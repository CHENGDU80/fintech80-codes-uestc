"Albemarle, Livent move lower as Piper Sandler cuts on lithium supply/demand woes","Albemarle   in Wednesday's trading as Piper Sandler downgraded the lithium producer to Neutral from Overweight with a  155 price target,  100 lower than its previous PT, citing challenges in electric vehicle manufacturing and demand that may  significantly degrade  lithium's supply andLivent   as Piper analyst Charles Neivert also lowered the stock to Neutral with a  19 PT, cut from  33, although Deutsche Bank separately upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, seeing an attractive entry point following a 30 -plus decline since early June.Neivert said widespread downstream issues for the lithium due to slowing EV demand growth driven by macroeconomic factors and product issues within the OEMs and a relatively faster rate of lithium supply growth  will take the lithium market to a balanced to long situation vs. estimates of a decidedly short situation as recently as six months ago,  thus  lithium prices may remain under pressure and earnings growth may suffer.The risk reward profile for the two lithium producers has  dramatically shifted downward as a combination of rapidly expanding new capacity collides with slowing demand growth of the EV sector,  Neivert wrote.ETF  ",10,2023-10-25T12:27:26.000-04:00
Vale: Buy On Higher For Longer Iron Ore Prices,"Vale  has been range bound for the better part of 3 years driven by investor skepticism surrounding the future of China steel demand and the residential construction crises despite consistently high IO  iron ore  prices. IVale is one of the largest seaborne IO miners with the bulk of sales going to China. As such the price setters are Chinese steel companies and their demand for IO has been thought to be greatly dependentThere are 4 reasons to forecast higher for longer IO pricesThis means that the seaborn IO miners have entered maturity with a few resounding caveats, there main client depends on them, there are scant substitutes for exported iron ore and the Chinese steel sector can take share from other steel makers via pricing. In essence the iron ore miners are in symbiotic existence with the Chinese steel sector.Thus, the key to Vale fundamentals is the health and peculiarity of the Chinese steel sector. As with the case for many Chinese companies, the creation of shareholder value may not be a priority. Employ and produce is more relevant. As long as the steel companies can run production at near breakeven  with plenty of govt subsidies  they will make steel products for China and export the rest. The exports prices can and have been highly competitive, perhaps predatory or dumping but that's the operating model.Vale and the Australian IO miners see peak China steel production in sight and should limit capacity expansion or perhaps begin to reduce. This is similar to what many oil companies are doing, rationalizing capex, attempting to balance supply with demand and maintaining reasonable prices that permit very healthy FCF and dividend payouts i.e. capital discipline.China is 50  of global steel capacity  1bn tons  and it consumes most of the seaborn IO, about 85 . Thus, as real estate construction demand fell and continues to decline  massive over building  China steel companies will export and displace share in any market without high import barriers.Below are my estimates of the seaborne IO balance between supply and demand. There are many drivers and moving parts. Fundamental to seaborne IO demand is that Chinese steel output remains near peak or near capacity while its primary suppliers do not add significant capacity. Note that I assume global steel demand grows at half a percent in 2024 and 1  in 2025, any move higher means greater IO imbalance.The Chinese Steel sector is large and divers, I found data and consensus estimates for 9 companies. One of the largest is Baoshan with 50m ton capacity  5  of total .Contrary to headlines, the sample group, seems to be weathering the real estate construction sector decline well. Revenue and EBITDA has fallen up to 1Q23 and now turned positive in 2Q23. Steel prices seem to have stabilized at above US 500mt with the ratio to iron ore prices at 5x  4x is thought to be healthy . Balance sheets seem to be in good shape with leverage under control.The market, as judged by consensus estimates, seems to have a favorable outlook for the sector with over 20  upside and a significant EBITDA rebound in YE24. The demand side dynamics for iron ore looks robust or at least better than in YE22 and YE23.Vale compares well on fundamentals vs. its peer group of IO miners such as BHP  and Rio Tinto . We see similar growth and margin profile but at a lower valuation due primarily to lower business risk on product diversification and country risk i.e. Australia vs Brazil.The stock is cheap vs peers and relative to FCF generation and dividend payout trading at 3.7x EV EBITDA and 6.2x PE on YE24 consensus estimates. The US 16.5 price target is based on a 4.2x EV EBITDA target multiple, below peers such as Rio Tinto and BHP, which have a slightly lower risk profile as Australian companies.Vale is a BUY on positive IO price dynamics supported by Chinese steel exports which drives significant free cash flow and dividends share buy backs. The stocks valuation is discounted vs peers which further supports a possible re-rate and 25  upside potential.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"PDI: Complete Devastation, Massive Income","  is a closed-end mutual fund, or CEF, that seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. The fund is actively managed by portfolio managers Joshua AndersonThe fund has some interesting holdings in its top 10, and that has led to some uncertainty, but after the most recent decline in shares down to  15.67, you can now buy and . Assuming the dividend is paidMake no mistake, income stocks have been crushed, but this is a name we were waiting for  16, and now we are below that level. For the long-term investor, now is the time to buy in our opinion.Let's be honest. That PDI chart is disgusting. If it was not for management and the shifting of holdings for income, we would likely be short  If this chart was one of a stock, we would be pretty bearish. However, the payout is simply so good, even if it were to be cut, PDI is just an income machine. While countless other investors have lost money on paper, we are picking up their slack.We now are wanting to come into the fund. Enough is enough here. While you can earn 5  in a bond or money market with no risk, but taking on some risk, you can collect over 3 times that with PDI. We like PDI as it invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities, including government and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and other debt instruments. The fund also has the flexibility to invest across various fixed income sectors, which allows the aforementioned fund managers to seek opportunities in different parts of the bond market.Now, the price of PDI has dropped in recent weeks with a surge in rates. To us, this is opportunity, despite expected short-term pressure. It is down due to fear over the leverage, as management uses leverage to enhance potential returns. This means that the fund borrows money to invest in additional securities, and the borrowing rates are only getting more expensive. The fear is further that it will hurt income. PDI is over 40  levered on its net asset value benchmarks, and is mostly doing so through reverse repos. That said, we like the port and the ability to shift it.As of the end of the last reporting period, PDI's portfolio was allocated to 70  U.S. investments, 5  in the UK, and the remaining in emerging markets, while 25  of the securities are invested in non-agency backed mortgages instruments. While the company does have nearly 1900 holdings, here is the look at the top 10 as of 2 week agoSo the holdings are many and diverse, but you get an idea of the major holdings above. Generally speaking, the company is invested in debt obligations and other income-producing securities. We did mention the mortgage-backed securities, but they also invest heavily in investment grade, and high-yield corporate dent, as well as in both developed and emerging markets' corporate and sovereign bonds. As of the end of the last reporting period the company had  4.7 billion in assets.So why is PDI fund getting crushed  It is all about the surge in rates, folks. You see, it is not just the so-called competition from bonds  savings accounts  money markets. There is certainly some fixed income competition happening, but the surge in rates has crushed a ton of income names. While some may have been telling you to buy for many months, we had been hesitant, saving you capital depreciation pain, even if it is on paper. Now we see the fund as a buy, as the income is just too good.But, the current economic environment is certainly a headwind for PDI's underlying assets. This is because PDI has an average portfolio maturity ranging from zero to eight years. With the rapid surge in rates  and, of course, the decline in the principal , the pressure is on the holdings, and as such, the value of the fund. At this point however we have very little concern over the bountiful payout. The investments made by the fund pay big time, which is why you get a bountiful monthly dividend and special dividends over time. Hold your nose and buy this for income.Why  Despite the carnage, PDI has a long history of providing its investors with very high level of income. Folks, this is not going to change, and with the sale happening, you need to take advantage. Scale into the fund in  0.50 increments from here. The investment will pay off. Readers, keep in mind that the fund has paid a monthly dividend for over 20 years now, and as we mentioned, it has also paid special dividends. The 16.4  payout is simply a very attractive yield, over 3 times that of most fixed income options. Of course, there is risk.But folks, do your due diligence. This is a quick pick for income, and one that we have looked at more in depth at our investing group, but the fact is that PDI is a very complex fund. It really is important to understand the risks involved before investing. First there is PDI's use of leverage, which can and does amplify gains, but can also magnify near-term losses. PDI is very sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions than a non-leveraged fund, and given the spike in rates, you have seen the value of the fund plummet to these buyable levels in the  15 range. Further this is a closed-end fund and, given the supply and demand for buying the shares, may trade at a premium or discount to the fund's net asset value. Right now, it is on sale. There is also credit risk because PDI invests in a variety of fixed income securities, including some that are issued by lower-credit quality borrowers, so there is risk of default.With that said, we think that PDI is a good option for further research and for investors who are looking for a high level of income. There is risk, and you have to be ok with the leverage, interest rate sensitivity, and credit risk, but the fund makes big money. You can see shares go to a penny in 6 years, but as long as the dividends keep getting paid  they should  you will make your entire investment back in dividends in just 6 years. Everything after that is simply gravy.So what do you think  Are you a reluctant shareholder  Have you been buying for months, or will this be your first purchase.

Tesla: My Long-Term Bull Thesis (Rating Upgrade),"A few days ago, I was in a discussion with a friend about his recent   stock acquisition and told him I thought he would likely be quite happy with his purchase a decadeAs much as I am quite bullish on their long-term prospects, when I wrote  on Tesla in April, I was hesitant to place a buy rating because of a combination of their margin contraction  and our . However, with the  providing significant , Tesla's shortTesla produces electric vehicles, solar panels and roof tiles, and battery storage systems. They are a leading developer of self-driving software, and have expanded into machine learning with the development of their own supercomputer . They maintain operations in the United States, China, and internationally. The company was founded in 2003 and and is currently headquartered in Austin, Texas.Tesla maintains an Automotive segment, and an Energy Generation and Storage segment. Their Automotive segment offers electric vehicles and ancillary products and services. This segment includes their network of Superchargers and service locations, in-app upgrades and mobile services, financing and leasing services, and warranties and extended service plans.Their Energy Generation and Storage segment provides photovoltaic generation, storage products, and related services. It maintains a website as well as stores and galleries, and also reaches customers through a network of channel partners. They offer various financing options to their solar customers.The global electric vehicle  EV  market is projected to have a  until 2030. The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to have a  through 2032. The global electric vehicle charging station market is projected to have a  until 2033. The energy storage market is projected to have a  through 2028. The global photovoltaic market is projected have a  during the forecast period.Tesla is in the process of improving its capabilities on multiple fronts. They have been working toward full self-driving  FSD  for many years. As part of this effort,  at their AI Day event on August 19, 2021.As progress continues on establishing superior reliability and safety capabilities, it will eventually become clear that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers. Once a certain statistical threshold has been met, insurance companies are going to be willing to offer lower rates to drivers who use proven autonomous driving software.What I believe frequently gets overlooked is the pressure this will place on entities who operate large fleets of vehicles. They will be financially incentivized to transition to autonomous capable vehicles. While most of the auto industry has been working toward  of autonomous driving, Tesla has a capability . If insurance companies are willing to offer users of Tesla's software better rates, this will incentivize Tesla's competition to manufacture vehicles which are capable of running a variety of software packages.Their Autopilot has access to more raw data than any of their competitors. This gives them a significant lead on reaching full capability more quickly than any other autonomous driving software provider.We could witness an era where it's common for people to buy a new Ford , General Motors , or Stellantis  vehicle equipped with Tesla's autonomous driving software. This may also produce an industry of third party entities which convert vehicles to be capable of using Tesla's software. Eventually, any capability gap should close for those of their competitors who continue developing their own software packages, so this period may only last a few years. However, the trend of vehicles being manufactured with multi-software capability may continue even after the gap closes. Being able to purchase a vehicle capable of using a variety of self-driving software packages may eventually become standard.While I am not clear as to when this threshold will be crossed. The idea that Tesla might find themselves with a much larger market for their software than their own vehicles is extremely appealing. The pressure would have to be significant for the other auto manufacturers to make the switch. If the discounts the insurance companies are handing out are not deep enough, we may not see an adoption or we may only experience a partial adoption.Tesla is well positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in our energy grid. The  is the most dominant factor at play when examining long-term energy infrastructure trends.When photovoltaics reached the status of  several years ago, additional renewable capacity seems inevitable. However, the adoption of intermittent sources warps the daily supply and demand curve for wholesale electricity. This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve. Excessive overproduction from solar will damage portions of the grid. This problem is severe enough that it is already common to disconnect portions of commercial scale capacity during the middle of the day. I went into further detail about how this is affecting long-term trends related to our grid in my recent .Tesla sits in a unique situation where they are involved in both grid scale storage as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In places where a portion of the grid is supplied by photovoltaics, storage providers are able to collect free or almost-free electricity in the middle of the day while the grid is overproducing. This electricity can later be sold back into the market in the evening when they are at their highest.With the electricity collected at no cost, or almost no cost, the margins for such an operation are a function of the sheer volume one can manage divided by the maintenance costs for the batteries. This means that storage providers are incentivized to gain access to as much overproduction as possible. Over the next several decades, I believe the electricity arbitrage industry has the potential to scale with the mass adoption of solar and will become incredibly lucrative. Although it's still far too early to tell how this situation will develop, Tesla is currently well positioned to become a major player in this emerging industry.Their Autobidder continues to find opportunities in Australia, Texas, California, and the UK. The company cites the clear advantages of growing their footprint, as each facility they build is expected to produce revenue for about 20 years.In 2022, their energy generation and storage segment , representing a 90  YoY increase to  1.310 billion, while the cost of revenues stands at  1.151 billion. This gives it a gross margin of 9.26 . According to a , Autobidder has made over  330 million in trading revenues since inception.Tesla's most recent earnings call spoke of several long-term projects they have in the works. They covered developments with the Cybertruck, which they plan to launch later this year, and also mentioned continued efforts toward developing a robotaxi. They are pleased about the adoption of the North American Charging Standard. Overall, things have been going well for them in recent months.Their forward looking statements indicate that they expect Q3 to have lower revenue due to scheduled upgrades causing down-time through the summer months.Tesla's  has been growing at an impressive rate. In 2013 they had an annual revenue of  2,013.5M. By 2022, that had grown to  81,462M. This represents a total increase of 3945.8  at an average annual rate of 438.4 .Their annual margins have been improving over the last several years. As of the most recent annual report, gross margins were 25.60 , EBITDA margins were 21.41 , operating margins were 16.81 , and net margins were 15.41 .Like many growing companies, Tesla has been diluting to help fund expansion. Total common shares outstanding was at 1,846.4M in 2013  by the end of 2022 that rose to 3,164M. This represents a 71.4  rise in share count, which comes out to an average annual rate of 7.93 . Over that same time period, operating income rose from - 61.3M to  13,692M. Because it has come with significant improvements to income, I view this dilution as accretive.Their debt situation has been improving over the last several years. As of the 2022 annual report, they had  106M in net interest expense, total debt was  5,748M, and long-term debt was  1,029M.As of this most recent annual report, cash and equivalents was  16,253M, operating income was  13,692M, EBITDA was  17,439M, net income was  12,556M, unlevered free cash flow was  4,327.5M, and levered free cash flow was  4,208.1M.Their total equity has been growing quite quickly.Annual returns have also been improving. As of the most recent annual report ROIC was 24.31 , ROCE was 17.64 , and ROE was at 27.36 .Their quarterly financials are showing significant revenue growth over the last two years. Eight quarters ago Tesla had a quarterly revenue of  11,958M. Four quarters ago that had grown to  16,934M. By this most recent quarter that had grown to  24,927M. This represents a total two-year rise of 108.4  at an average quarterly rate of 13.6 .Their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters. As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 18.19 , EBITDA margins were 14.25 , operating margins were 9.62 , and net margins were at 10.84 .Their dilution rate appears to have dropped in more recent quarters. The sum of their last eight quarters of dilution comes to 7.32  over the last four quarters this has dropped to 1.63 .Their debt situation is improving. This most recent quarter, Tesla had  210M in net interest expense, total debt was at  5811M, and long-term debt was at  504M.Their quarterly cash flow is inconsistent. As of the most recent earnings report, cash and equivalents were  15,296M, quarterly operating income was  2,399M, EBITDA was  3553M, net income was  2,703M, unlevered free cash flow was  894.4M, and levered free cash flow was  876.9M.When viewed on a quarterly basis, their total equity continues to rise.Their returns are trending in a similar pattern with their margins. As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 4.66 , ROCE was 2.81 , and ROE was 5.18 .As of October 11th, 2023, Tesla had a market capitalization of  836.73B and traded for  262.99 per share. They do not pay a dividend, so using their  of 91.03x, and their  of 19.72 , I calculated a PEGY of 4.616x and an Inverted PEGY of 0.2166x. As the PEGY value is well above 1, this implies the company is presently significantly overvalued.However, TSLA has a history of trading at elevated valuations. They are currently trading with an EV EBITDA of 48.73x. When viewing their EV EBITDA over the last 5 years, it's clear that its present valuation is historically not as overvalued as it has reached in the past.Tesla faces a large number of competitors. A majority of the already established auto manufacturers on the planet are developing or already producing their own EV's and alternative fuel vehicles. This developing industry has also attracted a significant number of speculative startups. Because of Tesla's first mover advantage, and the time it will take to develop a viable product from nothing, I expect that the effects of this increasing competitive pressure will come on gradually.Autonomous driving may take longer to reach full maturity than they expect. Progress is expected to continue on its logistic growth curve, with most of the easy breakthroughs having already been made. The company already has a viable product, but they need a huge amount of additional data and time to fine tune it and make further safety and reliability improvements. It will likely be difficult to tell when they have actually crossed above the threshold where their FSD software can be called  fully mature.As always with innovators, Tesla runs the risk of overspending to stay relevant. Developing their own hardware and software for machine learning may end up costing more than they expect, or not be as profitable as they project. The push to develop A.I. is spawning development across the industry, and Tesla is merely one of many companies working on their own projects. While I believe the decision to move into machine learning was good for the long-term health of the company, it's always possible the additional cost of joining the first movers will not be worth the benefits.Tesla faces several catalysts, most of which are not near term. Tesla has cut prices several times earlier this year. This should produce additional demand and help them capture market share. Tesla has been normalizing electric vehicle use  at some point we will cross the threshold where it's more normal culturally to drive an electric or alternative fuel vehicle than a gasoline or diesel.Tesla's overall engineering quality is extremely high. Tesla is several generations into EV development and their design philosophy has them continuously making performance improvements. For a specific example of what I am referencing, YouTube has videos of Sandy Munro comparing the thermal systems of the Mach-E and the Model Y. They are eye-opening.As stated above, I believe demand for their FSD software will increase once the insurance providers are willing to offer discounts. Organizations which maintain fleets of vehicles will have to justify not transitioning to the cheaper option. This is likely to affect everyone from car rental companies and taxi services, to government employees and utility vehicles. Demand for FSD may also spur their competition into producing vehicles which are capable of using Tesla's driverless software.Tesla is joining several others in the . These types of batteries are significantly cheaper than the Li-ion we are all accustomed to. Tesla already operates a grid scale energy . The dramatic cost savings of Iron-Air batteries makes them a disruptive technology. Our electric grid currently requires a significant contribution from base load providers. As we increase its storage capacity, I believe the bargaining power the base load providers currently have will diminish as most of the negotiating power will shift to the storage providers.Also, storage providers will experience sustained tailwinds from the continued adoption of solar as they profit from . Because of their dramatically lower cost of production, the adoption of iron-air batteries should both lower cost of expansion and improve margins for their energy storage division.Tesla achieves rather high margins for a manufacturer. As producers in other industries realize that the reason Tesla is achieving superior margins and return on capital is due to their preference for automated manufacturing, the demand for Tesla-style facilities should rise. The company could eventually open a subsidiary which establishes automated manufacturing facilities for other companies.Normally, I refuse to place buy ratings on any company this overvalued. However, I believe the current UAW strike will provide continued tailwinds for Tesla, Inc.'s share price as it continues. Add to this the fact that they have a history of achieving unreasonably high valuations and its present valuation becomes less of a concern. This is one of the few occasions where I am willing to hand out a buy rating on a ticker when I am unable to clearly see that it's trading below its intrinsic value. I believe Tesla has unrecognized long-term growth potential, so it potentially may have a hidden margin of safety.Overall, Tesla, Inc. appears to be an extremely attractive investment because of their culture of adaptation and innovation. While I cannot guarantee that their current endeavors will lead to future moats, they have already established themselves as a premier EV producer and have the potential to find themselves with multiple high margin revenue streams. Although their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters, they have proven they are capable of producing attractive returns.I believe Tesla stock is likely to become the long-term compounder that its present investors hope it will be. So even if buying at today's prices ends up being a lackluster entry in the short or medium term, long-term Tesla, Inc. shareholders are unlikely to be punished for it.

The Catalysts Are Building For Bitcoin,"In this article, I'm going to provide an update on the catalysts that are driving the tremendous upward momentum in the Bitcoin  price. However, each of these comes with risks that could cause Bitcoin price to reverseI believe that these catalysts have contributed to the increasing price of Bitcoin. Furthermore, since Bitcoin's price is dependent on supply and demand dynamics, it is possible to argue that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the upcoming Bitcoin supply, the spot ETFs and increased utility will increase the demand for Bitcoin, and hence the price of Bitcoin should go up.Bitcoin is up 13.5  since I recommendedUsing Bitcoin as a back-end mechanism will serve to increase the demand for Bitcoin. Given that more financial institutions use Bitcoin as a payment rail, then these institutions will need to buy Bitcoin in order to process transactions. Block Inc.'s Cash App has integrated the Bitcoin lightning network onto Cash App and given Dorsey's comments above, I believe there is a significant chance that the company is working on a Bitcoin remittance solution.Another use-case that is evolving for Bitcoin is a so-called  sats economy . The sats economy refers to using satoshis  the smallest denomination of bitcoin  to send small tips of appreciation to others on social media. Damus used this model after it launched earlier this year, however, Apple  has forced Damus to shut this feature down during the summer . The problem with this use case is that it bypasses Apple's rules for in-app payments. This reflects the strength of the Bitcoin lightning network, but also the complete pushback it has received.For these reasons, I believe this catalyst is the weakest but also the most overlooked. Although nothing very concrete has materialized yet within the utility use case, it is likely soon to come... and if it does the scale could be vast.The payments industry comprises many large and powerful players, including Mastercard , Visa , and PayPal . How will they look upon Bitcoin as a future payment rail  Will these companies adopt the technology or build their own offering to compete against it  PayPal, for example, has a stablecoin called PAYUSD that developers are able to build new payment layers on top of. This is very similar to the Bitcoin ecosystem and directly the opposite approach that Block Inc. has taken. Instead of building on and integrating the Bitcoin network into Venmo and PayPal, the company has created its own. Actions like this could undermine the eventual increase in demand for Bitcoin.If you didn't already know, Bitcoin is set to halve in April 2024. This implies that the reward for mining one Bitcoin will be cut in half in April, effectively lowering the rate at which future supply enters the market.Historically, Bitcoin halvings have led to price increases in Bitcoin both  the halving occurs. Notice this dynamic in the image belowEvery halving has been front-run by significant price increases. This is likely due to the supply and demand effect. As more people realize that the Bitcoin halving is coming the more Bitcoin is bought, which raises the price of the asset due to higher demand. After Bitcoin halvings have occurred, the price of the asset has gone up even more dramatically in general.We are currently about five months away from the beginning of April and we've seen a very significant price increase over the past few months. Since its January lows Bitcoin has doubled and since the end of September the Bitcoin price has increased by around 35  with steep increases in the past few days.Although Bitcoin halvings in the past have historically always correlated with increases in the Bitcoin price, there is no rule that this has to be the case. One risk with looking at the historical price action of Bitcoin is that the digital currency really doesn't have a long history. Since its inception, Bitcoin has only halved three times. Why will this time be the sameThere are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs pending application   The applications are from Grayscale, 21Shares   Ark, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree  WT , Invesco  IVZ , Galaxy, Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X, Hashdex and Franklin  . These spot ETFs generally imply that investors will be able to take part in Bitcoin's price development without buying Bitcoin directly. Hence, we can think of these brokerages investment firms as distribution channels for Bitcoin. The more distribution channels Bitcoin has, the more consumers will be able to gain easy access to the digital asset. This will clearly increase the demand for Bitcoin.In fact, Galaxy estimated in a research report that inflows into a Bitcoin  ETF  could amount to  14 billion in year one,  27 billion in year two, and  39 billion in year three. Given the huge asset management industry, it is likely that asset managers begin suggesting customers allocate a small portion of their wealth into this quickly growing  digital gold .If we build upon Galaxy's logic quickly  12 spot ETFs with  14 billion in inflows in year one would result in total inflows of  168 billion during the first year. Galaxy found that the amount of Bitcoin held under management on September 30th was  21.7 billion, or 4.3  of the current supply at the time. If Galaxy's calculations are correct, the ETF adoption would imply an almost 8x increase in the amount of Bitcoin held under management with regard to monetary value. Personally, I believe that this could be a little bit of a stretch target, which the research report also admits   if Bitcoin spot ETF approvals are delayed or denied, our analysis would be altered by timing and access restriction. Or if poor price performance, or any other factor, leads to lower-than-expected access or adoption to a bitcoin ETF, our estimates could prove too aggressive.Insofar, the SEC has not accepted any of the spot Bitcoin ETFs which means that much of the Bitcoin price increase could be built upon a false sense of hope. The SEC still hasn't approved anything  citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud  . On top of this, the greed index which was mentioned in a recent Seeking Alpha news article suggests that the greed of Bitcoin-buying has reached the highest point since November 2021 .Based on the discussion of each of the three catalysts above, we can presume that if all of the catalysts fall in place around the same time, Bitcoin prices will receive strong momentum. This will likely not be the case for the utility catalyst for Bitcoin since I believe this is a long-term development that we may see as Bitcoin becomes more  built into  offerings at existing companies. However, the Bitcoin halving is certain. This catalyst is likely the strongest since it has historically always meant that Bitcoin prices will rise. If the halving event is coupled with the regulatory acceptance of spot ETFs, demand would increase  potentially by a lot as claimed by Galaxy  and the rate of supply will contract causing the price to increase.In all, I remain just as bullish on Bitcoin as a long-term investment as I did during the summer when I published my first article on the digital asset. As opposed to then, halving is nearly in sight, and the general reception of potential spot Bitcoin ETFs has been really positive. To me, these are signals that indicate that Bitcoin can continue rising, but the uncertainty of whether spot ETFs are accepted or not makes this catalyst relatively weak on its own. My belief, however, is that asset management firms are doing everything they can to influence the acceptance of these ETFs as it would give the institutions more money and a potentially broader customer base. For these reasons I rate Bitcoin a buy as a long-term investment with both short and long term catalysts on the horizon.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,"First and foremost, the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination. This article is not about politics, and it will not focus on what's right or wrong. Instead, we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent, as of this writing, are up  3 , with WTI  trading above  85 and Brent above  87. Initially, at the close of Friday, WSJ published a report noting that the U.S. is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high. Soon after, Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. If you want to thoroughly review the events, Some of you may wonder, what does this have to do with oil  Historically speaking, geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions. In this case, Israel is not a major oil producer, so what's the catch  The catch, in our view, has to do with Iran's potential involvement in this whole ordeal. WSJ published a piece noting that Iran's senior officials helped plan this attack months ago.While the U.S. has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet, it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on Iran.For starters, we need context to what we are writing. In June,  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market. Since then, IEA has confirmed via its figures that Iran's oil production is close to  3.1 million b d. Our supply   demand model assumes  3.3 million b d, and official Iranian figures support that production is around  3.3 million b d.Putting all of this together, Iran is exporting close to  2 million b d. Visible tanker exports account for  1.5 to  1.6 million b d, while shadow exports account for  400k b d.Since H2 2022, the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports. As we wrote earlier in the year, this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storage.With floating storage gone and crude exports back to  2 million b d  500 to  800k b d below the previous peak , what's the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward  Perhaps the U.S. does nothing and leaves Iran as is, but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view, while the risk of a major loss is low, we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months. We think the average would fall from  2 million b d to  1.6 million b d. In terms of visible tankers, this means Iran's crude exports would drop closer to  1.2 million b d.While it won't be much of a decline, it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into year-end and possibly well into H1 2024.Looking at our latest supply   demand update, we made a few important assumption changesIn essence, global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by month-end. And if the U.S. starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports, then our balance could surprise to the upside. But with a deficit of  2.2 million b d, the lack of production decline from Iran won't make that much of a difference, either.On the other hand, with no mega deal on the horizon  between Israel and Saudi , the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases. Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis won't be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least  110 bbl. With Brent trading at  87, we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a reality.In conclusion, global oil inventories should accelerate downward. But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession. Fund flows will ebb and flow, so oil prices won't skyrocket anytime soon. Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception. Until then, we see prices grinding higher, with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levels.For readers looking to add energy stocks, Q4 will provide ample opportunities. We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil. Consolidation and M A are heating up, so you will see more and more mergers announced. But more importantly, always remember that with these oil prices, the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist. Please be patient, fundamentals are on your side.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, .  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks.

Sibanye Stillwater Hopes To Offer A Metal Mosaic,"Sibanye Stillwater  is a South African metals company with hopes of significant expansion in the next 5 years. Through investment in both recycling and production initiatives globally, SBSW hopes to become a linchpin in the global metals market.Given its rising demand, significant investments in battery metals, especially Lithium, are critical for future growth. While electric vehicles are gaining popularity, a mix, including hybrids, will dominate the next decade, still providing tailwinds to PGM recycling and PGM mining businesses. SBSW will spend an estimated  500 million in FY23 on these expansion initiatives.Despite the challenges faced by SBSW in the short term, the company shows promising potential for long-term growth.EFV  Estimated Fair Value    E24 EPS  Earnings Per Share  times PE  Price EPSEFV   E24 EPS X P E    1.0 X 9.7   9.70P 2E PGM, containing Pt  Platinum  and Pd  Palladium , 3PGM contains Pt  Platinum  Pd  Palladium  and Rhodium  Rd . 3E is 2E plus gold. 4E is 3PGM plus gold.PGMs are not rare-earth metals, but are critical in numerous industrial components, particularly in the hydrogen and emissions management space. While fully-electric battery EVs receive the most attention, a mix of EVs, including hybrids, are needed to fulfil demand within the next decade. Light vehicle production climbs to 82.5 million units per year in FY23. The PGM market is expected to see significant demand recovery linked with the Chinese auto sales rebound expected in FY23. still originate from Russia, and there is still some uncertainty about Russia's place in the global economy. While much of Russia's PGM capacity remains unsanctioned, that could change and further affect the supply and demand dynamics of the market.American PGM operations are still ramping up, with SBSW ramping production to 700koz of 2E PGM by 2027. Short-term sustaining costs have surged amid regional flooding and a shaft collapse which caused a work stoppage, which will resume in 2H23. SBSW states this is temporary and expects leveling off of AISC by FY26 of under  990 oz. SBSW expects the American PGM segment to return to full profitability in late FY23 or in FY24 when all in sustaining costs return to normalized levels.The South African PGM operation is the largest segment by revenue and is considered mature. Currently, the segment has 4 active mines and 3 exploration operations. Expansion in this segment includes the K4 expansion to Marikana, South Africa facility. This will add 50 years of output, at an estimated 250koz per year, once full capacity is reached in FY29.SBSW PGM cost relative to peers. SBSW is highlighted in Blue.Before the acquisition of Stillwater, Sibanye was an exclusive gold producer. SBSW still seeks to streamline its operations in this area, acquiring a controlling stake in DRDGOLD   a tailings management company. SBSW will close underperforming mines to reduce capital costs and make room for new greenfield expansion. After FY23, SBSW expects the capital requirements to significantly decrease for the Gold segment, amounting to  54.7 million annually in savings due to these streamlining actions.Gold production for FY23 is expected to produce 756-788koz at an all-in sustaining cost of  1826 oz. The average realized price for 2Q23 for gold was  1864 oz.Expansion in this area is the Burnstone project, believed to be able to output 141koz per year at full capacity in FY25. Existing local infrastructure significantly reduces startup costs, with the first production output expected in 2H23. DRDGOLD is a tailings management company recovering residue metals from waste from the mine. It has a far lower sustaining cost of  1,528 oz with an annual output of 179koz. This portfolio addition could increase cash flow by  55 million per year at full production capacity in FY25.The battery metals segment encompasses Nickel, Copper, and Lithium operations. SBSW seeks to create a raw materials presence closest to regional United States and Europe ecosystems.In Finland, a concentrated 7 mine facility has been approved for mining and broke ground in March of FY23. SBSW has a 79  controlling interest in the operation and hopes to achieve 15,000 metric tons annually in FY25. The facility is concentrated on a deposit of Lithium Hydroxide which demands a price premium compared to Lithium Carbonate. The reason is extracting and refining Lithium Hydroxide is much more expensive. The current price assumption for the 15-year life of the mine is  26,034 per metric ton, with an average operating cost of  7,423 per metric ton in all in sustaining costs. Total capital expenditure, less sustaining capital, is expected to be  650 million. This has the chance to be a highly profitable venture in a strategic area close to numerous battery factories in Europe.The Sandouville Nickel Refinery was acquired with 100  controlling interest in FY22. The facility is designed to refine 16,000 tons of nickel and 600 tons of Cobalt. This location is strategically close to a site set to be France's first gigafactory, built and operated by Verkor in a partnership with Renault. SBSW invested  27.5 million in the gigafactory as well.Rhyolite Ridge in the United States is a lithium-boron project in Nevada. The project has a nameplate capacity of 22,000 metric tons annually, assuming an average price of  13,000 per metric ton for Lithium and  710 per metric ton for Boron. SBSW has pledged to contribute funding in exchange for 50  interest conditional to permitting approval. The permitting environment for lithium exploration has become more favorable in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, with the Department of Energy offering a loan of  700 million. The project has attracted large names, including the Toyota and Panasonic JV, Ford, and South Korean battery maker Eco Pro. Ford has committed to take 35  of production from FY25-FY30.The top two risks facing SBSW in the short term are labor disputes and South African power infrastructure.Numerous disruptions in FY22 caused by South African workers protesting poor working conditions and low wages. While these have settled, SBSW could be at risk of disruption again once the contract is up for renegotiation in FY25.The South African power company ESKOM has been plagued with fuel supply problems, sabotage, and aging components. This has caused them to embark on a program of  load shedding,  turning off power after peak hours. Mining, smelting, and refining consume roughly 30  of ESKOM's net power output. Thus, ESKOM, on top of load shedding, has increased power prices by 20 . In the medium term, ESKOM will remain a primary power supplier to the SA Mining segments. ESKOM expects load shedding to ramp up through FY23, which could result in 15  production losses. At the end of FY24, SBSW expects enough private-sector electricity generation to eliminate load shedding for the mining industry. To this effect, SBSW has acquired the largest solar farm in South Africa, set to enter initial production in FY25 with 89MW in nameplate capacity.Underpinning these is ongoing political instability in South Africa. While SBSW is quickly diversifying out of South Africa, it is still a South African company. We will likely see some form of price action after the .Lithium demand will grow by . There will be a 55  gap between supply and demand for Lithium at the current global capacity. The story is similar but not as grim for nickel, with an 8  gap between supply and demand. This fact will put upward pressure on the prices of nickel and Lithium as the decade continues. Additionally, PGM metals in use with existing non-battery EVs and traditional ICE vehicles will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Even at an aggressive growth assumption, EVs of all types are not expected to pass 40  market share Despite lower-than-expected output in FY22 and 1H23, the foundations for significant long-term growth are in place. SBSW has a very strong balance sheet, with only a reported 0.14x debt to adjusted EBITDA and around  630 million in free cash flow. Additionally, it pays out a sector high 8.54  yield targeting 35  of earnings paid out to shareholders.SBSW is undergoing a transformative effort to broaden global holdings and cut stalling operations. For this reason, we think it is attractive at its current price for the dividend investors.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy The Big Dip In The Utility Sector With 9.8% Yield: UTF,"Have you ever heard the saying,  all theories are great... in theory  The truth is that most theories or ideas rarely play out as pre-planned or expected. The cold harshness of reality can wreak havocMovements in the stock market can be viewed as a series of competing theories or ideas that collide around companies or sectors. Some view bond alternatives as terrible investments when rates rise, while others view them as excellent companies now trading at more attractive prices - perspectives and theories crashing into each other.The reality is that an excellently run company can rapidly see its price decline due to no other fact than investors with a herd mentality following a popular theory or viewpoint.The utility sector has been hit hard recently, crashingWe've already seen several utility names adjust their growth outlooks due to higher costs of capital. Infrastructure is often expensive to build, and building new infrastructure is usually funded in large part by debt. Almost any infrastructure investment can be characterized as providing a large amount of upfront capital and then collecting a very long-term income stream. Higher interest rates make building new infrastructure less appealing, so less is built.Meanwhile, higher interest rates also impact the present value of existing income streams. Investing  100 million to receive  7 million year for decades sounded like a great deal just two years ago. Today, it isn't because interest rates are higher.So, I won't call the market crazy for selling utilities in the near term. Growth is going to be slower, and the cost of capital is making it difficult for utilities to grow while making the present value of future cash flows lower.I will say it is very short-sighted. There are two sides to every economic transaction - supply and demand. One party provides something, and another wants something. The price of the transaction is determined by the interaction between the two. What happens if utilities slow expansion  There is less electricity, and the supply is lower. Is demand going to decline as well  Not likely. Whether interest rates are 1 , 5 , 10 , or 30 , living without electricity is not a solution that many are likely to pursue. Economics 101  What happens when supply is low and demand is high  Prices go up. Rising prices are good for those who are on the supply side of the equation.We can already see this with oil companies. Oil prices are more reactive to supply changes, which is why oil companies are doing very well despite higher capital costs while other utilities have been struggling.The price of electricity is going up. And as the expansion of electric supply slows down, it is only going to go higher. When gas prices go up, you see it at the pump fairly quickly, and it is very common to see the price of gas at your favored station change daily. Electric companies generally are not allowed to increase prices month to month. Your bill will vary primarily based on how much electricity you consume monthly. In most jurisdictions, prices will be raised  or lowered  once a year with government approval. As with all bureaucratic processes, it takes time  the authorities will often push back against the raises requested, but eventually, nobody can fight the economic reality of supply and demand. Attempts to do so lead to unpleasant things like rolling brownouts.Infrastructure investments like electric companies have been dealing with pressures from higher rates and delays from benefiting from inflation, and the supply demand balance is looking very favorable for them. , yielding 10 , is one great option to invest in today.  holds a portfolio that is 33  electric, 11  midstream, along with a host of other infrastructure-style investments like toll roads, freight rails, gas distribution, cell towers, airports, etc. These are the things that we take for granted when living in first-world countries. They make our daily lives possible, and we sure would notice if they disappearedLike some other Cohen   Steers funds, UTF made the wise decision to implement interest rate swaps - fixing 85  of its leverage at an average rate of only 1.8 .Infrastructure investments are down, but they aren't out. They will continue to be great sources of cash flow and an essential part of our daily lives. UTF is well-positioned to ride out this turbulence while paying out a hefty dividend.Investors have many different avenues that they can use to benefit from utilities or infrastructure being sold off due to high interest rates. If you're an investor who does not want to have to play the game of figuring out which specific company to hold or which will be the best to see the strongest recovery, one fantastic option is UTF  Not only do you receive monthly dividends that give an annual yield of 9.8 , but you're also exposed to a number of companies that are heavily oversold, as well as gaining access to a fantastic management team that has a history of routinely raising the fund's dividends because they are out earning what they're paying. This is a definitive win-win for investors.When it comes to your retirement, there are not going to be many things in your life that are automatically paying you more each year. Many of your bills are going to expect you to pay them more every single year. Your Social Security will typically have an annual cost of living adjustment designed to only help you keep pace with inflation, but not to help you get ahead. Having a portfolio filled with income investments that are providing you with outstanding income and giving you the ability to reinvest some of that income back into your portfolio to see additional growth is going to be what allows you to continue to see wealth development even in your twilight years.Retirement isn't the sound of a funeral dirge. It should be a sound celebration  The sound of celebration is as unique as the situation. Whether it's spending extra time with loved ones, jumping in a truck hauling a 5th wheel trailer and being able to see all the beauty that the world has to offer, or simply staying at home with a crackling fireplace, enjoying a cup of tea and reminiscing with friends and family - whatever a beautiful and satisfying retirement looks like to you, it's possible if you have the financial security that's provided by owning dozens of different income-producing holdings.That's the beauty of my Income Method.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks  Archer-Daniels-Midland . The company, which just reported its quarterly numbers, is doing extremely well. It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds, including strong secular growth in biofuels.In thisSo, let's get to itRoughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I highlighted the company's massive footprint in the agriculture industry.Listed in 1924, the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42,000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations, allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview, the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery stores.This includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions, which account for the biggest part of the company's revenue.In the United States, Archer-Daniels-Midland is the third-largest producer of ethanol, according to .With this in mind, earlier this week, major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good position.The bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth, driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policies.As one can imagine, this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers, who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sector.As biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation, various biobased feedstocks, including agricultural crops and animal-derived products, are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and net-zero emissions by 2050.Like many people, I am not a fan of using  food  to produce fuel, but in light of global energy policies, my opinion doesn't matter.Furthermore, while corn-based ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  and Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS  in the mid-2000s, there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks, driven by the growth of renewable diesel production.Meanwhile, increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil, as well as soybean and canola oil, further used in renewable diesel.This shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023.Adding to that, the new Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  provides tax credits to the biofuels industry, extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuels.In this light, during last year's JP Morgan All-Stars Conference, the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels, with strong biodiesel margins, high demand for ethanol, and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants, which confirms the trends noticed by ING.The company also mentioned the start-up of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota, which will add 1.5 million tons of capacity, focusing on low-carbon intensity feedstocks.Furthermore, the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide low-carbon emissions power.In the third quarter, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of  1.63, accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of  1.5 billion.Notably, this quarter's results contributed to an outstanding year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of  5.62, making it the second-best EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally, ADM's trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 13.2 , which reflects the company's consistent strength in this environment.ADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market, where opportunities and challenges coexist, which makes it challenging for traders and investors.Consumer behavior trends vary across categories, impacting spending.Issues also include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and fluctuating commodity supply and demand.Despite these challenges, ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved year-to-date, with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total company.With that in mind, ADM's different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwinds.During its earnings call, the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork, which is something I already briefly mentioned.In 2023, ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network, partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable, sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo , Nestle, and Carlsberg.The company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025, equivalent to powering over 100,000 homes annually.ADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project, contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for  greener  fuels.The company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9x, which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their long-term strategic agenda and return capital to shareholders.It enjoys a credit rating of  A .ADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates full-year EPS in excess of  7 per share.Based on that context, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently pays a  0.45 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to  1.80 per year. It implies a 26  2023E earnings payout ratio, which is extremely healthy.The dividend yield is 2.5 .ADM is attractively valued. As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below, the normalized P E ratio is 14.6x, which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decades.Now, the company is trading at 9.5x earnings. That's the lowest valuation since the great financial crisis.Even if earnings moderate in the next few years  analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years , the stock is significantly undervalued.A return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18  annual returns through 2025.The current consensus price target is  97, which is 38  above the current price.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. I believe that ADM has a fair value between  100 and  110, which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four years.Archer-Daniels-Midland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector. The booming biofuel industry, supported by evolving government policies, presents a significant growth opportunity for ADM.Their diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sources.ADM's strong financial performance, improved earnings outlook, and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment. With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation, ADM could offer investors an 18  annual return through 2025.Hence, I maintain my belief in ADM's fair value between  100 and  110, which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four years.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

The Most Common Misconception About REIT Investing In This Environment,"As many of my readers have probably noticed, lately, I have paid a very close attention to the REIT balance sheets and debt financing structures.I think that restrictive interest rates for a long period of timeEveryone who has invested a bit of his or her time into exploring how equity REITs work, understands that the chances of finding the next Nvidia or Apple by picking any REIT out there are extremely slim.Instead, REIT-focused investors can play a more balanced and predictable game, which is underpinned by to a large extent a predictable business model and cash generation profile.REITs per definition  regulation  have to devise a  buy and hold  strategy, where a notable portion of the collected cash flows  rents or leases  have to be regularly distributed to the shareholders.The main ways how REITs can increase the cash flows are the followingBesides increasing the rents   leases organically or conducting non-core activities such as positive debt refinancing, the key essence of REIT business is to capture a positive spread between asset  or investment  IRR and the cost of capital.If the spread widens, REITs are deep in the money.If the spread remains stable, REITs deliver stable and positive results.If the spread decreases, REITs fall.Since the early 2022, the overall cost of financing has gradually increased, sending the broader REIT index in a negative return territory.One might argue that this decline is mostly explained by the struggling office sector and if the office segment was excluded, the remaining REIT space would be in a nice position relative to the early 2022.Well, not exactly right. In the chart above, we can see some of the most popular REITs operating outside of the realm of office segment, and that have still delivered returns, which are significantly below the S P 500.All in all, the key message here is that REITs are extremely sensitive to the changes in the interest rate levels, as any movement in the cost of capital makes a huge impact on the underlying cash generation profile.In most of my recent articles, I have incorporated a huge skew towards assessing the potential implications of higher cost of capital.Why  Because I think that the  higher for longer  scenario and higher interest rates in general embody a significant potential to destroy huge chunks of FFO for many REITs out there.The following are the main avenues through which this risk is most likely set to render a painful impactOtherwise, at this stage, REITs are protected from additional headwinds that are associated with higher cost of capital as the effects from unhedged floating debt instruments have already been reflected in the latest financials.In my view, refinancings at higher interest rates is the most critical issue.Let me depict the  via one very common REIT  Realty Income Corporation .Currently, O has around  6.5 billion of debt  excluding the floating portion and the assumption of organic dept repayment  that has to be refinanced by 2026.As of Q2, 2023, O had a weighted average cost of financing at 3.7 , which is considerably below the market level financing cost.Looking at the prevailing YTM of some of the O's outstanding bonds, we get an average cost of financing around 6.4   72  of an increase .If we assign the prevailing cost of financing level to the maturing debt proceeds until 2026  i.e., reprice according to the market level , O's FFO would decrease by    175 million or by 6  taking TTM FFO as a basis. This, in turn, would send the FFO payout ratio higher to 80  level.If we take a more extreme scenario and reprice all of the remaining  12 billion to the 6.4  interest rate level, the effects would be very severe, impairing O's long-term growth prospects. In other words, completely justifying the recent price decline.Remember that via this example we see the potential consequences for a REIT, which has an upper investment grade credit rating, relatively well-laddered debt maturity profile, and a significant scale, which introduces flexibility in the financing processes. For many REITs the debt situation looks much worse.Finally, we come to the point, where I want to emphasize a very popular misconception in the context of REITs and the potential consequences of higher interest rates.The challenge stems from the misunderstanding of the rate of change effects. More specifically, many REIT investors carry a concept that REITs are a natural hedge of the inflation due to the rents   leases that adjust to the inflation levels accordingly.This coupled with the generally correct fact that many REITs exhibit favourable supply and demand dynamics - especially now when building new supply has become very expensive - leads to an opinion that the growing interest costs will be easily offset by a synchronized movement in the top line.As a result, many REIT investors have become overly complacent and do not fully appreciate the potential consequences.Now, my argument is that while all this is correct, it does not really move the needle in the context of surging interest expenses.Since the early 2022, O has managed to deliver a superb growth in its top-line, registering a couple of very strong quarterly results. In total, from Q1, 2022 to Q2, 2023, O's operating income grew by  34 . And for all of the reasons many REIT investors mention - e.g., embedded rent escalators, which kick in nicely during inflationary period and favourable supply and demand dynamics.However, despite the solid growth numbers, the share of the interest expense component relative to the operating income has become larger. And now let me remind you that the current cost of debt sitting in O's books is still nowhere near the market level and that during most of these quarters the interest rates were actually much lower than we currently have given that the Fed was still in the aggressive hiking process.To contrast O, which is an A-rated REIT with a smaller REIT, which has not an IG balance sheet, I have taken the Global Medical REIT  as an example.As we can see, the higher interest costs have consumed a significant portion of GMRE's operating income, despite the fact that the Company has embedded rent escalators for almost all of its contracts. Moreover, GMRE operates on a net lease basis just as O, which protects the earnings from other inflationary costs.Both in O and GMRE's case, the occupancy levels have remained robust  at their peaks  and there have been successful increases in the top-line. Yet, both companies have still significantly lower cost of financing recorded at their books currently, and first notable maturities are slowly but surely approach their deadlines.I recommend REIT investors to revisit the theoretically correct yet practically insignificant thesis that rent   lease indexation to inflation or rent increases in general serve as meaningful mitigates to the  higher for longer  scenario for REITs. Mathematically and based on the actual results, organic growth in rents or leases is not sufficient to protect many REITs from a gradual convergence to higher cost of capital and the resulting consequences.

"Forget The Hype, W. P. Carey Is An Absolute Bargain","Rising interest rates are a phenomenon remembered by few market participants--the last time interest rates experienced sustained upward momentum was 40 years ago. The subsequent reduction of interest rates after the U.S. inflationary crisis of the 1970sREITs, along with other capital and debt-intensive industries, were primary beneficiaries of this long-term trend, and have thusly been slapped in the proverbial face as interest rates rise. The office sector has been doubly slapped by rising interest rates and the COVID pandemic, which ushered in remote and hybrid work en masse. The sector has yet to recover to even a fraction of its pre-pandemic highs, and is now faced with the daunting prospect ofUnderstanding the direness of the situation, management at W. P. Carey  announced in September 2023 that the company would .The method of the spinoff is the main contention here, as many  have . Essentially, W. P. Carey management did two thingsThe first point here seems to be the cardinal sin. As  in his recent article on W. P. CareyThis, we think, is true when placed in the proper context, which is the interest rate discussion we started this article with.Yes--dividend cutters did not prosper in a falling rate environment. That only makes sense, right  After all, if you're cutting your payout as your cost of capital is falling, then the overwhelming likelihood is that your business is suffering. Cutting payouts in a  interest rate environment is a very different animal and, we would contend, a sign of prudent management.Others have also pointed out what W. P. Carey did not slash its dividend in the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, a line of reasoning intended to invoke in the reader a thought of  wow, things must  be bad, then.  In our view, this thinking is flawed. The GFC, as painful as it was and despite what our collective memories may tell us, did not have the same devastating force as the Great Depression, and active government intervention shielded many industries and companies from massive amounts of pain. Additionally, the GFC did not affect all asset classes equally, and, lastly, rates fell overall during the GFC, enabling companies to roll debt at even cheaper prices.In response to a question about the dividend on  to address the office spinoff, CFO Toni Ann Sanzone had this to saySo, yes, while dividend cuts are generally bad news, we think the rationale from management makes sense, especially in the long run.The second issue--that the company's spin-off would be meant to simply sell its assets over time--seems to us to just be an admission of reality on the part of management. The market for office space is unlikely to return to equilibrium anytime soon due to a massive imbalance of supply and demand. What, we ask, would you rather have in this situation  A lame-duck child company that limps along, in constant need of attention and funding, or a company designed to sell the assets and close up shop once the maximum amount of capital has been collected for investorsWe think the latter is a far better option.Now, we don't think the analysis conducted on this site regarding W. P. Carey is , in the sense that long-term investors have every right to feel as jilted as they do. The stock has performed poorly, after all, and it is only natural that the office spinoff and dividend target reduction would feel like a rug-pull. Thus, today's levels for sure represent an inflection point for long-term holders of W. P. Carey.For new investors, however, we think the opportunity may be quite enticing.First, an historic discrepancy has emerged between the company's stock price and its forward EBITDA estimates. For most of the last 10 years  minus the start of the COVID pandemic , W. P. Carey's stock traded well above its forward EBITDA expectations. Since the start of 2023, the stock has endured a precipitous decline while forward EBITDA estimates have moderately .  The most recent drop in EBITDA estimates appears to reflect the spinoff.The popular narrative surrounding W. P. Carey--that the company is slow-to-no-growth and that the primary reason for wanting to own it is for its dividend--also doesn't appear to hold up particularly well.Over the last five years the company has generated a 14.3  CAGR on sales. While, yes, this number is below best-in-class Realty Income  and slightly worse than STAG Industrial , it is also not insignificant and has been on the upswing.Perhaps more importantly for those with a long term perspective, W. P. Carey has managed to produce a better return on capital for its shareholders, coming in at 3.2  for the latest quarter, a full 113 basis points above Realty Income's quarterly ROC.Lastly, , the stock is attractive on a forward P FFO and P AFFO basis. The stock currently trades hands at 9.79x P FFO and 10.22x P AFFO, which is 7  and 21  lower than the current sector median. This, we think, is a reflection of the negative sentiment swirling around the stock.Year to date, W. P. Carey has been a disappointment for shareholders, delivering a 27  negative total return. While we understand why long-term holders of the stock may no longer find the story appealing, we think that newcomers to the company are likely to find a lot to like in the current valuation and outlook for the company post-spinoff.

Vonovia Is Likely To Benefit From Undersupply In Germany,"Dear readers,  is one of my favorite stocks to write about and one that occupies the biggest position in my real estate   REIT portfolio. I've studied the stock quite extensively over the pastMost recently I shared an update following Vonovia's Q2 2023 earnings - , reiterating my BUY rating at EUR 22 per share for the native shares  ticker VNA .I'm now more than 20  in profit  excl. dividends  on my position with a break-even under EUR 18 per share with no intention to sell before my EUR 40 price target. That leaves 80  of upside to a price target, which really is quite conservative, making Vonovia a worthwhile investment even at today's prices.I think that the one thing that often keeps people from investing in Vonovia is lack of knowledge of the local German market. The focus here is on the supply and demand dynamics and especially on rent regulation, which I believe is a key piece of the puzzle here.Today I want to show you why I have  that Germany will experience substantial under-supply of housing over the next 5 years which will inevitably benefit Vonovia and other residential landlords.Just as any other market in the world, the German residential market is driven by supply and demand  with a sparkle of regulation  over the long term.Let's start with supply of new apartments. There's only one reason why developers build new housing - to make money. When input construction and energy costs increase, developers are faced with a choice. They can try to pass through these input cost increases onto the final customers by increasing the sale prices or they can halt their development plans.In tough economic conditions with high inflation and a weakening consumer, it's quite unlikely that new apartments would sell at higher prices. In fact, housing prices have already started coming down from their peak in early 2022.Faced with no other choice, this has led many developers to postpone their construction plans which has led to a significant drop in the number of issued building permits  one of the best proxies for future new supply .Note that the data below is monthly, so in normal years about 300,0000 units are permitted per year. This year that number is likely to be below 250,000 and unless the economy improves drastically, I expect no more than 200,000 permitted units in 2024.The result is that only about 250,000 new units are expected to be delivered to the market this year. In the following years, this number may fall somewhat lower before recovering closer to the 300,000 unit long-term average. But even 300,000 units per year isn't nearly enough to cover the demand which is expected at 500-700 thousand units per yearThat may seem like a high number so let's break it down.Demand for housing is first and foremost driven by population growth. The natural population in Germany has been declining for a long time, but immigration has been high and has resulted in a 0.4  annual population growth over the last 10 years. Recently, this growth has been accelerated by  the government passing immigration reform laws in an effort to increase immigration to fight labor shortages and especially by  the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has resulted in unprecedented 1.3  population growth in 2022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 0.5-0.6  per year.On top of population growth, there are two trends worth mentioning. Firstly, urbanization which isn't stopping any time soon and is likely to disproportionately benefit Vonovia whose portfolio is located primarily in places that are seeing population growth. Secondly, the downsizing of households. Back in 2011, there were on average 2 people in every household. That number has dropped to 1.94 today and is expected to decline further to 1.89 by 2035, adding additional 0.2  of demand per year.Between population growth and these trends, it is estimated that demand for housing will average 500-700 ths. units per year which is a far cry from what will be constructed. And because you cannot simply pull new apartments out of a hat,  for the foreseeable future and will only be magnified if the ruling party manages to pass  for more stringent rent regulation which would only discourage more developers.What does all this mean for VonoviaFirstly, as the housing shortage keeps prices high a large portion of the German population will rent out of necessity which is likely to result in ongoing near perfect occupancy of 98 . Secondly, with fewer apartments on the market, existing real estate will be more valuable leading to higher prices which should help get the stock closer to its NAV of EUR 40 .In the short-term the stock price will continue to be driven by interest rates expectations and sentiment. But over the long term the value of the company's assets acts as a very strong magnet and the valuation will eventually reflect this. Severe undersupply is one of the key reasons why I don't mind being overweight Vonovia at these depressed levels and reiterate my BUY rating for the stock.Stay tuned for an update of my cash flow model following Q3 earnings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Buy REITs Before Everyone Else Does,"A fundamental truism of investing in stocks is that capturing maximal gains from an investment requires buying it  the crowd does.Ideally, an investor would buy a full position in a stock when it's down, then other investors will gradually orThat sounds nice , but in reality, human psychology often gets in the way. We are tribal creatures, and going against the tribe in hopes that they will follow feels uncomfortable and unnatural. In most areas of life, it doesn't make sense to go against the crowd. That's why, for most of us, investing is a learned skill instead of an innate talent.I would argue that income-oriented investors and dividend growth investors have a rare opportunity right now to buy ahead of the crowd. That opportunity is in realThere has been a  35  drop in the REIT index, measured below by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF , since the beginning of 2022This selloff has been inversely correlated with the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield, which has soared over that time period.REITs are than just bond alternatives. Unlike bonds, REITs offer inflation protection from property value appreciation and rent growth, which generally flow into rising dividends. But, despite my  to the contrary, the market still treats them like bond proxies, as exemplified by the tight, inverse correlation between REIT stock prices and bond yields, as seen above.In what follows, I'm going to argue that interest rates have or are very close to peaking, that the Fed is done with the current hiking cycle, that interest rates are likely to come down in 2024, and that this will be the catalyst for REITs to shift from  to .There are multiple reasons why Treasury yields have surged so much, such as government deficit spending and fading demand from foreign buyers, but I would argue the primary catalyst for rising rates is the Federal Reserve.Since April 2022, the Fed has dumped over  1 trillion of debt securities, most of which were Treasuries, off its balance sheet. That has created artificially high supply of Treasuries as rates have risen, just as the Fed's asset buying program created artificial  for Treasuries when rates were low and or falling.Plus, demand for Treasuries is driven largely by what the Fed  doing and  of what the Fed is  with the Fed Funds Rate. The coordinated  higher for longer  narrative from Fed officials in recent months has done exactly what it was intended to do  cause long-term interest rates to rise.The Fed thinks this will help anchor inflation back at its 2  target rate. I think this move will end up doing more harm than good.The fact of the matter is that .The market briefly panicked over the  hotter than expected  inflation data in the September reading. But the 3.7  headline CPI rate is only that high because of the shelter component, which lags real-time changes in rents by about a year.Compare the YoY growth in US shelter CPI  gold line below  to the Zillow Rent Index  red lineIn September, shelter CPI still showed 7.1  YoY growth, but we know from Zillow that actual YoY rent growth was only 3.2 .Apartment List's latest  shows an even lower rent growth metric of -1.2  for SeptemberThe same story holds true for home prices. Using  most recent data from July 2023, median home listing prices  0.9 , while the S P Case-Shiller index showed a 1.0  YoY gain.However you measure real-time housing cost changes,  shelter inflation is far below the 7.1  YoY rate reported in the CPI.And the shelter component of headline CPI represents about 35  of the overall index. Thus, about 2.5 percentage points of the 3.7  CPI rate came from this inaccurate shelter input.What was the CPI rate in September if you exclude this lagging shelter component  Answer  1.99 .The biggest reason there has been a slight bounce in CPI ex shelter since June is the rebound in oil prices, but even this appears to be temporary. Recently, the International Energy Agency  that oil prices near  100 caused meaningful demand destruction, hence the stagnant price now in the  80s.If instead of the CPI's inaccurate 7.1  YoY growth in shelter costs you used Zillow's 3.2  YoY rent growth number, headline CPI would be 2.4 .If you used Apartment List's -1.2  number, you would get a headline CPI reading of 0.9  for September.Inflation has already been whipped. It's just a matter of time before it shows up in the official data and the Fed acknowledges it.Both the forward SOFR curve and the Fed's dot plot shows interest rates on the short end coming down slowly next year. I think the drop in interest rates will be much faster and sharper than the market seems to think, because I believe we will get a recession in the near future.Anytime in modern history that the Fed has hiked rates this fast, it has precipitated a recession. And during every recession in modern history, the Fed has pushed rates down quickly and significantly  by an average of about 500 basis points .Therefore, shouldn't the burden of proof be on those who claim  contrary to the historical record  that the Fed will be able to achieve a soft landing, avoid recession, and ease the Fed Funds Rate down slowly over the course of several yearsEven if I'm wrong and the Fed does ease the FFR down slowly over the course of a few years, I still think this will put downward pressure on Treasury yields across the curve as the lagged shelter inflation falls and allows CPI readings to come down further.Now, with all of the above said, recall my earlier point that the market treats REITs like bond proxies.If REITs fall because interest rates rise, then what should happen when interest rates begin declining  whether fast or slowOf course, some investors will object that a recession would be bad for REITs, causing an  selloff. This is pure conjecture, and not very well informed conjecture at that. This objection seems to imply that every recession will be just like the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, which was very damaging to real estate and REITs.But most economic forecasts today see a milder recession on the horizon, more akin to the short and shallow recession of 2001.How did REITs perform through that recession  Answer  swimmingly.The Fed quickly pushed down the FFR in response to economic weakness, which corresponded with a drop in long-term interest rates.From April 2000 through June 2022, the Vanguard Real Estate Index  gained 35   15.5  annualized , while real estate stalwarts like Realty Income , Alexandria Real Estate Equities , and W. P. Carey  gained even more.The line of thinking above isn't some sophistry I'm using to try to bail out my underwater REIT positions.  As if anything I write could move the markets anyway  This is my actual view. I truly think REITs, especially the higher quality names that typically trade at large valuation premiums, offer an incredible buying opportunity right now, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.Here are several of the blue-chip REITs I've been buying hand-over-fist lately.ADC owns single-tenant net lease properties leased to the nation's largest and strongest retailers. Its portfolio is highly defensive, recession-resistant, and resilient to competition from e-commerce.Moreover, ADC enjoys among the strongest and best-positioned balance sheets in all of REITdom, with very little debt maturing until 2028.CEO Joey Agree and his top management team are highly shareholder-aligned, illustrated recently by significant insider buying.For a deeper dive on , check out  Why Agree Realty Is My Largest Holding.ARE owns and develops a portfolio of state-of-the-art life science campuses located in the nation's most productive innovation clusters like Boston, Washington DC, and Raleigh Durham. These are generally triple-net leased properties occupied by the world's strongest biotech companies.ARE has suffered a pullback due to worries over cyclically slowing VC investment spending in the biotech space as well as a wave of life science supply coming to market. But ARE's quality of building design and location should act as a moat, blunting the impact of these temporary headwinds.Meanwhile, ARE's balance sheet is top notch, boasting a BBB  credit rating, over 13-year weighted average debt maturity, and no loans maturing until 2025.For more on ARE, see  written in 2019 explaining why I  to own it, even though I thought it was too expensive to buy at the time. It's definitely not too expensive anymore.CCI boasts perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure network in the United States, with all the benefits of scale that comes with it. This network includes over 40,000 cell towers,  85,000 miles of fiber, and  120,000 small cell nodes.In addition, CCI enjoys a strong balance sheet with a BBB  credit rating and a very manageable amount of debt maturing over the next few years.The few headwinds CCI currently faces, such as its 9  floating rate debt exposure and Sprint's lease cancellations as a result of its merger with T-Mobile , are expected to disappear by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, mobile data is projected to keep growing at a double-digit clip, necessitating further investments from carriers into infrastructure.For a deeper dive into , see  Crown Castle  Take Advantage of The Market's Short-Termism.Now that EXR has completed its acquisition of Life Storage  LSI , it has become the largest US-focused self-storage REIT. It enjoys massive benefits of scale as well as an efficient operating platform that, when rolled out for LSI's properties, should produce some nice synergies.In addition, it has a strong balance sheet with a credit rating of BBB  that should give it the ability to handle refinancing the relatively small amount of upcoming debt maturities.Right now, self-storage is suffering a hangover from the huge growth during the pandemic, and low home sales volume and job growth mean few people are moving. The standard catalysts for customers getting a storage unit are not heavily present right now, but that situation won't last forever.For more on , see  REIT Meltdown  3 Rarely Discounted Buying Opportunities.MAA owns and develops a diversified portfolio of apartment communities across the Sunbelt, from Las Vegas to Norfolk. This is a recession-resistant asset class, and MAA's portfolio is ideally suited to benefit from the long-term trend of above-average population and job growth in the Sunbelt.The balance sheet is likewise rock-solid, sporting an A- credit rating.There's a wave of new supply coming to many of MAA's markets, but I  in detail why the REIT won't be hurt nearly as bad as the market thinks in  Mid-America Apartment Communities  Advantages Being Ignored Amid Supply Glut.REXR owns infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained market of Southern California. These properties enjoy one of the biggest mismatches between supply and demand in the United States. New supply under development is only about 2-3  of the total supply, while demand is growing significantly faster than that.The result is double-digit rent growth as far as the eye can see.REXR also boasts an incredibly strong balance sheet, low debt, and a BBB  credit rating that greatly minimizes the negative impact of high interest rates.For more on , see  REIT Crash  The More They Drop, The More I Buy.I call VICI the  landlord of Las Vegas,  because it is the largest owner of casino-resort real estate on the famous Strip, including the iconic Caesar's Palace from which it derives its name.VICI's balance sheet is in good shape with  only  a BBB- credit rating, while its long-duration leases enjoy some inflation protection. Management has proven themselves disciplined about growth, acquiring only when it is accretive to the bottom line.For more on , see  If I Could Only Own 7 REITs, It Would Be These.WPC is a net lease REIT focused on single-tenant industrial and, to a lesser extent, retail and self-storage properties across the US and Western Europe.Lately, WPC has taken a beating over its decision to quickly exit its office segment and downsize its dividend by 10-15 . But I actually like this decision. Single-tenant net lease office has become an extraordinarily unattractive property type that will likely endure very poor returns going forward. I only wish management would have ripped this band-aid off sooner.Plus, selling its office properties now gives WPC the liquidity to manage its 2024 and 2025 debt maturities. Even though it has a BBB  credit rating, I like that management is  killing two birds with one stone  by eliminating the office exposure and prepaying maturing debt in one fell swoop.For more on , see  Despite Inflation Protection, WPC is Best Suited For Low Interest Rates.The primary reason why REITs have shed over 1 3rd of their value since their peak has been rising interest rates.Therefore, as interest rates peak and begin to steadily decline going forward, we should expect the REIT recovery to pick up steam.I of course cannot time the bottom and don't believe anyone can. But I believe the valuations offered right now by high-quality REITs like the 8 discussed above provide ample margin of safety as well as massive upside.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

Why U.S. Treasury Bond Yields Will Continue To Rise,"The year 2023 has been a tough one for bond investors.The Bloomberg Aggregate Index has posted a -1.43  return YTD through October 13th. Following losses of -1.54  in 2021 and -13.01  in 2022, the Aggregate Index is on track for its thirdMuch of the focus has been on the Fundamental economic factors that affect the bond market.Although the Fed s favorite inflation measure has declined from its peak of 5.6  in Feb 2022, the Core PCE came in at a still high 3.9 , last month. Core PCE has remained above the Fed s inflation target of 2.0  for 30 consecutive months.This has been the primary reason why the Fed has been so aggressive with tightening monetary policy. Between March 2022 and theThe possibility of another rate hike is still on the table for this year.The Fed is concerned with the stickiness of the inflation rate and the resiliency of the economy. Many have been predicting a recession due to the Fed s tightening, but the economy seems quite robust, as evidenced by the surprising surge in non-farm payrolls of 336,000, as released by the BLS on October 6. This was markedly stronger than the 267,000 average gain in new jobs over the prior 12 months and the forecasted level of 170,000.While many have been anticipating for more than a year a Fed pivot by cutting rates, with such a durable jobs market the Fed s fear is that such a move would stimulate the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing, autos and consumer borrowing, which would then reignite inflation.The Fed has been using the mantra of  higher for longer  with regards to their rate policy for quite some time, and only recently has it begun to sink in.When Fed Chairman Powell says the Fed will be data dependent at future FOMC meetings, he is referring to these Fundamental economic factors.There is another dimension, however, that is also impacting the bond market, and in my view, is the major reason why US Treasury bond yields will continue to rise, and these are the Technical factors that affect bond yields.One of the basic elements of economics is the Law of Supply and Demand, and with regard to US Treasury bonds, I will discuss how his Technical factor impacts yields.The largest owner of US Treasury bonds is the Federal Reserve. From 2008 through 2022, during the Fed s fourteen-year experiment with Quantitative Easing  QE,  the Fed had a voracious appetite for Treasury bonds. Their Treasury bond holdings surged from  481 billion in 2008 to  5.9 trillion in 2022.The Fed s share of US Treasury Bonds owned by the public jumped from 7.6  to 25.5 .During the pandemic, when QE was reinstituted to prevent the economy from collapsing as everything was shut down, the Fed was virtually the only buyer of government bonds. With the entire yield curve yielding less than 1  due to the Fed s aggressive easing, the Fed bought 53  of the net new government debt issued to stimulate the economy.But then inflation reared its ugly head, and the Fed began reversing course. In addition to raising the Fed Funds rate to 5.50 , the Fed began a policy normalization program, more commonly referred to as Quantitative Tightening  QT.  The goal of QT is to reduce the size of the Fed s balance sheet. This was to be accomplished through allowing their Treasury bonds to roll-off at a pace of  60 billion per month. QT was announced in March 2022, and since then the Fed s Treasury bond holdings have declined to just under  5.0 trillion, or 19.8  of publicly held Treasury debt.The Fed is committed to continuing QT for the foreseeable future.The next largest individual owners of Treasury bonds are Japan and China. At their peaks, both countries each owned well over  1 trillion Treasury bonds. China s ownership topped out at  1.2 trillion in 2013, but has been gradually reduced to only  822 billion. Japan s ownership reached  1.3 trillion at the end of 2021, but has since been reduced to  1.1 trillion. Their shares of ownership of Treasury bonds declined to 3.2  and 4.4 , respectively.There are more than 40 other foreign countries that own Treasury bonds, as well, and collectively their holdings have also declined recently. From a peak of owning 28.3  of US Treasury debt in 2014 the other foreign countries holdings declined to 22.4  in 2023.The final group of US Treasury bond holders are other US Financial Institutions. This category includes, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and hedge funds. As a whole, the Financial Institutions are more price sensitive than the Fed and the other foreign governments. As yields have risen, the Financial Institutions are the only ones who have increased their holdings. Their share of Treasury ownership rose from 32.8  in 2014 to 50.1  in 2023..Treasury debt is issued to help fund the US Government. The government runs a fiscal deficit each year and their expenditures, in excess of revenues, are financed by Treasury bonds. Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the government s deficits have been quite large and consequently the Treasury s requirement for debt issuance has been massive.For the Fiscal Year ending 9 30 23 the government recorded a deficit of - 1.7 trillion, a  300 billion increase from FYE 22 s deficit of - 1.4 trillion. This represents the fourth consecutive year of  trillion plus deficits. The projection for the current year is more of the same.Because of the Debt Ceiling crisis this past spring, the Treasury had to resort to extraordinary measures to prevent the government from defaulting on its obligations. The Treasury had reached its statutory debt limit of  31.4 trillion in January and could no longer issue new bonds. Treasury Secretary Yellen had to move money around and delay funding some retirement programs until Congress solved the problem in June by suspending the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025.Once Yellen received the authority to turn the debt spigots back on, the Treasury has been playing catch up with record new levels of debt. In only four months, the Treasury has issued  1.75 trillion in new bonds. This amount is larger than issuance in any full year, excluding the 2020 pandemic surge. Total government debt outstanding has grown to  33.2 trillion and counting.The basic economic law of Supply and Demand says that when supply increases and demand declines, prices must fall. In bond land, this means that interest rates must go up.This has been evident in looking at the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note. The Fed began paring back their purchases of Treasuries in December 2021 as they started moving away from QE. Then in early 2022 they began cutting their Treasury holdings as they implemented QT.When the Fed began tapering their QE purchases the 10-year Treasury note was yielding roughly 1.50 . As demand for Treasuries has declined and the supply of Treasuries has increased, the 10-year yield has climbed to 4.65 , the highest level in 16 years.Because their borrowing requirements are so immense, the Treasury has a sophisticated and robust system for fulfilling their needs under the Office of Debt Management.The strategy is to offer a variety of debt instruments through a regular and predictable issuance mechanism. This includes promoting a broad and diverse investor base and supporting market liquidity and efficient market functioning.To accomplish their goals, the Treasury works with a network of Primary Dealers to ensure that there will always be a market for their needs.Currently there are 25 Primary Dealers who are authorized by the Federal Reserve System to deal directly in government bonds. These are banks or broker-dealers who must meet rigid requirements to qualify.The first requirement is demonstrating sufficient capital. A broker dealer not affiliated with a bank must have capital exceeding  50 million. For a bank that wants to act as a Primary Dealer, they must have at least  1 billion in Tier 1 capital. They must also be registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The next requirement is that the Primary Dealer must demonstrate that they maintain at least a 0.25  market share in trading government bonds. This includes showing a substantial presence as a market maker that provides two-way liquidity in US government securities.Additionally, they must commit to bid on a consistent basis for their pro rata share at Treasury auctions. Their bids must be competitive with prevailing market levels.Finally, they must have the proper back-office support, with membership in US clearing organizations to efficiently process transactions.The Treasury offers several types of debt instruments. These include Treasury Bills  maturities under 1 year, , Treasury Notes  maturities 1-10 years,  Treasury Bonds  maturities greater than 10 years , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS  and Floating Rate Notes  FRN .There is a regular calendar, where Treasury Bills are auctioned weekly, and all of the other instruments are auctioned monthly.The mechanism for the auctions is that the Treasury posts a schedule of type of security, the size to be issued and the date it is to be auctioned.When an issue is announced, it then trades on a when-issued basis. When-issued trading allows market participants to buy and sell a particular security before it has been auctioned. This feature is important because it provides helpful information about the market interest in the upcoming security.On the day of the auction the Primary Dealers gauge the interest in the security with their customers. Customers can bid on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. A non-competitive bid is usually from small investors who say they want the security and will take it at the prevailing market price. Competitive bids are for customers who say they will buy the bonds at a specific level. They then wait for the auction results to see if they are able to acquire the security at their desired level.The Primary Dealers then convey the interest of their customers to the Treasury at the prescribed auction time.Once the auction closes the Treasury compiles all of the bids and accepts bids, starting at the lowest yield, until they have reached sufficient demand for the amount of security they are offering. The highest yielding bid that clears the auction causes the auction to end.The Treasury uses a single-price format, so all winners of the auction pay the same price, which is the highest yield accepted to clear the auction, even if their bid was at a lower yield.Once the auction is complete, the Treasury then reports the auction results.The official results contain a lot of tidbits of information that are helpful in measuring the success of the auction.The first significant piece of information is to compare the high yield to what the security was trading at on a when -issued basis immediately before the auction closed. If the high yield is below the when-issued price, this is viewed as a strong auction because it demonstrates investors were being aggressive in their bid to ensure that they will get the securities that they desire.If the high yield is above the when -issued price, this is called a  tail,  A tail is viewed as a weak auction, because investors were bidding at a higher yield than that prevailing at auction close, and thus are indicating less interest in the security. The larger the tail, the weaker the auction.The next piece of information to look at is the bid-to-cover ratio. This indicator measures how much demand there is for the security. The larger the bid-to-cover, the greater the interest there is in the security.The final measure to analyze is the percentage taken down by dealers. Primary Dealers are required to submit bids to each auction. They want to provide bids for their customers, whether on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. However, if they do not have customer interest, then they must submit bids for themselves, as market-makers. Again, this is part of their role as a Primary Dealer.However, they typically do not want to own the security themselves. A large percentage taken down by dealers usually means weak customer interest and is viewed as a bad signal, while low dealer ownership is viewed as a strong auction.Last week the Treasury issued 3-year Treasury Notes, 10-year Treasury Notes, and 30-Year Treasury Bonds, and the results were all viewed as sloppy.The Treasury started with auctioning  46 billion of 3-year notes. The high yield was 4.74 , up from 4.66  last month, and the highest level since February 2007.The high yield was above the 4.723  when-issued yield at auction, creating a 1.7 bp tail. This was the largest tail since February, and the third largest in the past ten years.The bid-to-cover was 2.562, down from last month s 2.75. It was the lowest cover since February, and below the six-month average of 2.792.Dealers were awarded 22.1  of the total, the highest level since October 2022.Next came the 10-year Treasury auction of  35 billion.The high yield was 4.61 , versus 4.289  at last month's auction. The 4.592 when-issued yield at auction created a 1.8 bp tail. This was the largest tail since the April auction, and the 8 consecutive auction with a tail.The bid-to-cover was 2.50, down from last month s 2.52. It was also the lowest bid-to-cover since June.Dealers took down 20.9  of the auction, the highest level since October 2022.The final auction of the week was the  20 billion of 30-year Treasury Bonds.The high yield was 4.837 , up from last month s 4.345 . This was the highest yield since August 2007.The 30 year when-issued yield was 4.80, meaning there was a 3.7bp tail. This was the 4 consecutive 30-year auction with a tail, and it was the largest tail since November 2021. Also, it was the 3 largest tail on record.The bid-to-cover was 2.349, the lowest since February. It also was below the 6-month average of 2.44Dealers took down 18.2  of the auction, which was the largest amount since December 2021. It also was above the 6-month average dealer takedown of 11 .Together, these auction results show the limited demand within the investor community and how the Primary Dealers were forced to own more of the auctions than they would like.All indicators point to higher yields ahead.The final Technical factor to analyze is liquidity.The Treasury market has always been the largest and most liquid segment of the bond market. Large quantities of securities are traded daily. Size trades typically have little impact on the bid ask spread. This is known as market depth.Recent activity, however, has shown a troubling weakness in market depth. As measured by the Bloomberg US Government Liquidity Index, seen below, liquidity is near its all-time worst level. This index measures, on average, how far yields are away from where fair value models suggest they should be. The index has deteriorated over the past year as Treasury yields have risen, and is near the all-time high level.The Fundamentals continue to show above target inflation, and the resiliency of the economy, as measured by employment, cause the Fed to emphasize their  higher for longer  mantra.The Technicals, as demonstrated by declining demand for Treasury debt in an environment of heavy supply due to rising budget deficits, suggest higher yields ahead.The metrics of recent Treasury auctions support the weakness in demand among investors, and the deterioration in liquidity as rates rise suggest there is more pain to be felt investing in bonds.For those who view the high current yields as an attractive buying opportunity, I offer the words of Rick Reider, CIO of Global Fixed Income at BlackRockBuy the dip doesn t work during QT   you just keep getting new dips.

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Cash Drain Could Become A Problem (Rating Downgrade),"The market has been kind to shipping company  this year as its stock price has plunged from a 52 week high of  29.38 all the way down to  9.17 as of yesterday's close.The shipping company lowered its expectations for 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, implying a steep decline in free cash flow as well. The market now models a long earnings contraction for the shipping company which means that the dividend might not return for years.Furthermore, growing container supply might result in a depression of freight rates for a longer period of time which in turn might lead to an ongoing re-rating of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' valuation multiple.I am now a lot more pessimistic as to how long the earnings contraction will last and take responsibility byI have been a big fan of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services when it made a strong value proposition to stockholders, in no small part because of the company's huge dividend pay-out.. Recently, however, net losses have forced the shipping company to not pay a dividend and with the market now expecting a long earnings contraction, investors will likely have to wait years until the dividend comes back.Furthermore, the company is burning through cash and might again have to lower its EBITDA guidance when it releases quarterly earnings for the last quarter.According to ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' dividend policy, the company distributes 30-50  of annual net income as a dividend to shareholders, but the recent accumulation of losses has resulted in non-payment of a dividend and it could take years until the dividend gets paid again.By now, the consensus pretty much is that investors will not get a dividend until the free cash flow and earnings situation at the shipping company improves drastically, something which might not happen for years.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services lost  213 million in the second quarter which brought total YTD losses to  271 million.I am starting now to be a bit more concerned about the company's cash levels which are rapidly depleting and which, in the past at least, have been cited, including by me, as a source of strength for the shipping company.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' reported a net debt position of  1.6 billion in the second quarter and a net leverage ratio of 0.5x. However, at the end of last year, the company had a  269 million net cash position  0.0x net leverage ratio . The problem with this change in debt is that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' free cash flow has fallen off the cliff.Positive free cash flow is naturally replenishing a company's bank accounts and with free cash flow declining a scary 80  YoY in 2Q-23, I think ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is at the brink of having potentially to drastically increase its debt.The absence of any real debt and strong free cash flow were good reasons to buy ZIM during the expansion, but the cash situation is unlikely to get better in the near term.The company had  3.3 billion in cash at the end of 2022 and, at the end of the second quarter, had  1.9 billion in cash, reflecting a decline of  1.4 billion.With the current rate of cash drain, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services might actually have to raise some money next year, or leverage up its balance sheet.Freight rates have come under considerable pressure in 2022 and 2023, primarily because of shrinking demand in the consumer sector. With consumer sentiment deteriorating and shipping volumes shrinking, the spot market has come under increasing pressure.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' average freight rate, for instance, plunged to just  1,193  TEU  in the second quarter, marking a sharp correction of 67  YoY.Unfortunately, I don't think the situation is getting much better and I was probably misguided in my earlier assessment that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services could see a short-lived recession and enjoy a quick rebound in freight rates.One aspect why I am less optimistic on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is that the market continues to expect a glut of new supply for container ships which, in my view, will continue to suppress average freight rates way into 2024.The following chart is reproduced from my last article, for convenience.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of  1.2 billion to  1.6 billion, down from a prior guidance of between  1.8 billion and  2.2 billion in Adjusted EBITDA. Given the poor state of the shipping industry, I would not be surprised to see yet another reduction in the profit outlook.The market now models a much deeper recession than it did in July which is when I presented my last outlook on the shipping company. The estimates also indicate that the recession will last longer and concerns over the general state of the economy should be taken seriously.Cyclically-vulnerable shipping companies are at risk of a major earnings contraction and the market now sees 2024 to lead to even higher losses than are expected for 2023, and the situation is not anticipated to get much better in 2025 either.Profit estimates are negative and an earnings multiple can't be applied. The valuation ultimately depends on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' outlook for 2023, its cash drain in the third quarter and the company's prospects for a free cash flow recovery.If the outlook gets slashed again when the company presents for 3Q-23, I would say the valuation of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is most likely headed for new lows. The most important metric to watch moving forward will be ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash balance.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services was a popular income stock in 2021 and 2022 which is when the shipping company returned a boatload of cash to shareholders.But two consecutive quarters of  growing  net losses have changed the picture quite a bit and the market now appears to model a steep recession that could last 1-3 years.I am now much more concerned about ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash drain as well as the length of the earnings contraction. As a consequence, investors must expect to see a much more leverage balance sheet moving forward. I am not willing to accept this risk and have sold out.

My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid, but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead. Currently with the funds rate at 5.5  and the core CPI at 4.1  the real funds rate is 1.4 . ThatThe Fed can resume its fine-tuning operation later if the need arises, but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go. I'll agree that the bulk of the Fed's work is done, BUT I don't believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a last-minute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown, the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded. The first-ever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mix-raising the odds of a government shutdown in mid-November. While this situation won't affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that will.The political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics, fiscal spending, and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors, rating agencies, and voters. Now to be fair, the government's deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yields-the market's way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order. And, the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the government's out-of-control spending, the worse the situation will get.In an era of low inflation and zero low interest rates, Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences. No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10-year Treasury yield now hovering around 4.9 . With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate, Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road. fiscal austerity would become a near-term headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates. However, that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2  target, so this growth inflation interest rate issue isn't going to be so easy to solve. However, as I will explain later, an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today. Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced before.The auto workers union is making  in my opinion  some outrageous demands. They are asking for a 40  increase in wages over 4 years, a 20  reduction in the workweek from 40.0 to 32.0 hours, and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of all-electric vehicles. The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands, poisoned any good-faith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainable.At the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rank-and-file union members. The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President. Against this background, it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly. As it progresses, the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip. The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparent.While investors seem to be pricing a  soft landing,  history is not on their side. The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history, and the market is still trying to absorb the impact. This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike, with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by near-term macro events. As rates have spiked, so too have long-term yields.Yield spreads also bear monitoring. The spread, or difference, between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, has been negative all year, i.e., an inverted yield curve, but has narrowed from a record -110 basis-point inversion in March to only 30 basis points today-not positive, but it's progress. Dating back to 1990, when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities. It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points, do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues. I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positive.The past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil. We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week, and as I'll speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations. The MACRO scene, however, has been impacted, especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their  911  event. Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spending debt debacle in our economy, the  rubber band  gets stretched once again. The U.S. has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will  get what they need  to defend themselves., but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation. These events along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII. In the meantime, taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding  spending , as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced . Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process. However, they are not.There is a contingent, in which Ms. Yellen is a firm supporter, that wishes to spend trillions on  climate issues  and an  energy transition . While the economy is doing well, welfare spending is near or at all-time highs. In fiscal year , the federal  spent  1.19 trillion on more than 80 different  programs. That represents almost 20  of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022. That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is  humming along  The pandemic is over but the country's food stamp program reached an all-time high in November 2022 and remains at that level.Then there are the 6-7 million immigrants that have arrived, and they also come with a huge cost to social services, welfare, etc. Finally, the cherry on top of this debt cake. The cost of  the  existing debt   not future debt  will be about the same as the existing Social Security program. In effect, we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programs.Therefore it is a HUGE  stretch  to assume the U.S. can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately needed.It doesn't take a Wharton School graduate to realize that  other  spending must be curtailed. I realize I keep repeating that, but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact. At some point, this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped. If it isn't then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye. Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL, some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE.  The climate ISN'T the biggest threat to our economy . The only question that remains is - is it already too lateBetween the  issues  at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad, the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades. For the U.S., the latter is a self-inflicted policy error that leaves the  That in turn will negatively impact the financial markets for what could turn out to be a period The 3Q23 earnings season ramped up this week with 11  of the S P 500 market cap reporting results, traders entered the scene with a wait-and-see approach.

Retail sales in August were inflated after gasoline prices spiked, however. That was not the case in September when gas prices began to ease.A closely watched category of retail sales that excludes auto dealers, gas stations, and building materials and feeds into the gross domestic product jumped 0.6  last month compared to the prior month.September's uptick in retail sales, the sixth consecutive monthly gain, reflects how the U.S. economy has remained resilient despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool spending and hiring.In the good news is bad news backdrop, this number was considered a negative as it potentially keeps the Fed engaged in the rising rate scene.The  to -9.0 in October from -13.5, versus a 16-month high of 12.0 in August which was the only positive reading over the last year.

The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longer-term interest rates that are doing some of the Fed's heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled, while Wall Street rallied.However, the markets shuddered at Powel's view that the economy's resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough, suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2 .That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3.--  - It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That is also frightening for equities.House Speaker Vote. It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan, leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry  R-NC . It's unclear if he can garner 217 votes either.The continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 11 17, and besides the geo-political turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed, the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker, the more likely it is that we reach that mid-November deadline without a budget agreement.Then there is the administration's emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel. With the slim Republican majority, they would need 98  of their contingent to back ONE candidate, and as we have seen that is an impossible task. An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal  handful  of Democrats to get behind a candidate  ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee  and remove this obstacle.As far as the shutdown, as stated in earlier updates, it's a non-event for the markets. If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending. With complete dysfunction in Washington, we're all suffering the consequences of politicians.After three years of overlapping crises, it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world. While these concerns are valid, I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Because of this, it is unlikely that the Israeli-Hamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the Russia-Ukraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years. A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the region.Fortunately, I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence. The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war. Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel. As the leadership in Tehran knows very well, Israel is a nuclear-armed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East. It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved. However, for a variety of other reasons, I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the  85- 90 barrel range. that are taking place in the Israeli conflict, but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth. First, from an economic perspective, Israel is a small country, with a GDP of  521 billion-making it the 29th largest country in the world, representing only 0.5  of world GDP. To put this into perspective, when measured by GDP, Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US  roughly the size of Virginia  and when compared to companies in the S P 500, Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company  Eli Lilly .Additionally, Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US, making up only 0.7  of both US imports and exports  the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively . And because of this, Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path. From an earnings perspective, given that I don't expect a significant economic impact from the war, combined with the fact that the S P 500 receives only 0.2  and 2.8  of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively, the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earnings.Finally, it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact. Unfortunately, conflict in this region is nothing new. Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts, the S P 500 was up  15  on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75  of the time.While this terrorist act may not change my economic views, it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the future.Iran did some saber-rattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any 'calls' in this war is preposterous. The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today. Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terror.If this terrorist attack isn't a wake-up call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future. The FACTS, not opinion, rhetoric, or  spin , but FACTS, tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced. Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2  years. Instead of crippling their economy, the country's coffers have been enriched in the last 2 years.If common sense doesn't prevail, this war is just the beginning of global turmoil. The U.S. received yet another reminder that 'policy' errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel. After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price, the U.S. finally decided to begin   Strategic Petroleum Reserve . Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels. Combine this with U.S. Domestic issues that I'll present next, and it's easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higher.There is  reason to abandon the energy trade.Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a  59.5 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and a side-step against the US anti-fossil fuels policies. The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resources.This deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill, and that should encourage more M  A activity.Being a low-cost producer with an enviable list of land assets, Pioneer Natural Resources is a  prize . Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits. That means the newly combined entity will drill longer, more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money. Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer  laterals  Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impact.A the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. In a stroke of genius, Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale, while defraying costs, and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels. In essence, this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.U.S. oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. However, that is about to end, as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian in the last 2 years. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition.The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029-the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades, and at some point, the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economy.Finally, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas. The U.S. energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that 'policies' have consequences.The indices are all at a point where they could still go either way. Given all of the  outside  influences, the best scenario might be more sideways action. Plenty of starts and stops, with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while. Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter. That tells me to stay diversified and look for  special situations .It's easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy. The S P 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away. The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the index.The ball is in the BULL's court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position. A 'break' of support opens up a completely different set of circumstances on the technical front.Once sentiment sours, NOTHING is going to change that downward price action.

SQM: The Future Of Lithium Amidst The Energy Transition,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  is priced at 5x this year's EPS. Anyone looking at this stock will immediately recognize that it's cheaply valued. So, this consideration is not the main factor that's weighing onThe problem with this stock is that there's so much uncertainty priced in. Undoubtedly, some aspects are worthy elements that  priced in.Demand for lithium is going to massively increase in the next few years. Accordingly, the long-term thesis is clearly intact. However, a combination of risk-off investor sentiment, together with a slowdown in the energy transition is overwhelmingly impacting the stock.Here I shine a light on why investors are eschewing this stock. Ultimately, even though there are some aspects that should be factored in, I believe that at 5x this year'sWhat's the energy transition  Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it was clear. Is the energy transition when we stopped using wood and dung and started to use coal as the primary energy source  Or is the energy transition when we started to use Diesel oil for mobility  Or perhaps, the energy transition was when we started to increase our usage of natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and cookingPerhaps, the energy transition is in the future, when we use a greater proportion of our primary energy supply from solar panels and wind turbines  Do you see the point I'm making here  That we are always transiting from one source of energy to another.Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it happens overnight. But the fact of the matter is that while we have energy transitions, they take time. And what do investors absolutely hate nearly as much as bad news  UncertaintyNot knowing how long we'll have to wait to get paid. And I get it. With the share price going up, nobody is going to bother with difficult questions.But when the share price starts to move south, everything that was an uncertainty before becomes bad news. Now.Investors' time horizons shorten, and unless something is expected to go up within the next 12 months with a high degree of certainty, investors lose patience.I'm not saying that SQM is unquestionably a good investment. I for one, invested with Albemarle   disclosure  I'm long ALB . Admittedly, both companies have been terrible performers in 2023.There's no clearer sign of investors' capitulation than the right side of the chart consistently moving down day after day, without respite.The top concern is the most obvious, and can even be discerned in the company's name. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile. When investors are risk-seeking, investing in Chile is a compelling opportunity. It's a fast-growing company, that's strategically located in Chile, which grants it access to abundant lithium resources and cost-effective mining operations.But when interest rates are high, plus investors' temperaments mercurial, all that investors can think about are the political and regulatory risks that arise due to the company's operations in Chile, not to mention the likely overreaching government policies that may capture some of the company's profits.80  of SQM's gross profits are tied to lithium's prospects. If lithium regains its footing, SQM will do well. And in time, lithium's prospects will improve.Lithium prices have fallen by around 70  in the past year. This has for the most part been brought about by the sustainable climb in prices in the previous 2 years.Again, the overall energy transition story is still very much intact. Demand for lithium is expected to increase in the future, primarily driven by the growing adoption of EVs and the expansion of renewable energy storage systems.As automakers worldwide increasingly shift towards EV production to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements, lithium-ion batteries, will play a pivotal role in powering these vehicles.Additionally, the renewable energy sector's need for energy storage solutions to stabilize  will further boost lithium demand, making it a crucial element in the energy transition.Moreover, lithium demand for energy storage solutions aimed at grid stabilization is on the rise as utilities and the grid seek reliable methods to store excess energy and balance supply and demand, especially given the increasing amount of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the grid.I contend that lithium batteries have gained prominence in this role due to their efficiency, rapid response times, and ability to store and discharge electricity when needed, contributing to grid stability.I have a cautiously optimistic outlook on SQM. While it's trading at an attractive 5 times this year's EPS, there are notable near-term uncertainties and doubts that need consideration.The demand for lithium, while poised for substantial growth in the long run due to the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, has faced recent setbacks, leading to a substantial drop in lithium prices and creating short-term volatility.Additionally, SQM's exposure to political and regulatory risks in Chile, coupled with market uncertainties, may dampen investor sentiment in the short term.However, the fundamental strength of SQM's lithium production and its strategic position in the industry suggest a potentially brighter future once these near-term challenges are navigated.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

The West Is Losing Control Over The Gold Price,"An important change has unfolded in the global gold market. The East has been driving up the gold price, predominantly in late 2022 and the first months of 2023, breaking the West s long-standing pricing power.Until recently, Western institutional money was driving the  in wholesale markets such as London, mainly based on real interest rates. Gold was bought when real rates fell and vice versa. However, from late 2022 until June 2023 gold was up 17  while real rates were more or less flat, and Western institutions were net . Most likely, Eastern central banks, and Turkish and Chinese private demand, lifted the price of gold.For about ninety years, up until 2022, there was a patternIf we zoom in on the period from 2006 through 2021 the main reason for Western institutions to buy or sell gold was the , which reflects the 10-year expected real interest rate  real rate,  in short  of US government bonds.The physical gold price was predominantly set in the London Bullion Market and to a lesser extent Switzerland. Gold trade in London can be divided in three categoriesAs we will see below, the TIPS rate, UK net gold import  positive or negative , Western ETF holdings, and the COMEX open interest were all correlated to the price of gold. Until the war in Ukraine broke out late February 2022, that is, and things started to change.Because customs data lags a few months, and the World Gold Council s supply and demand data is published quarterly, we will cover the global market until June 2023 in this article. We will examine how gold is becoming less sensitive to real rates, and how London is losing its gold pricing power.Let s start by  the correlation between real rates and gold. Note, the TIPS yield axes in the charts below are inverted because higher rates caused lower gold prices and vice versa.From March until September 2022 the TIPS yield rose dramatically  down in the chart , but the price of gold reacted less bearish than the  rates model  previously prescribed. As London was still a net exporter over this time horizon, I conclude the West was still in charge of the price. But then came the third quarter of 2022.From late October 2022 until June 2023 the TIPS rate was barely down while gold was up 17 . Remarkably, the West wasn t driving up the gold price, as demonstrated by UK net exports, declining Western ETF inventory, and falling COMEX open interest.First, the UK s monthly net flows. Obviously, the price wasn t set in London, as the UK was a net seller while the price was up. In Chart 1 and 4 you can see this is unprecedented.Also taking into account gold flows through Switzerland, the second-largest Western  and largest refining hub globally, shows a similar picture. For the first time since monthly data is available, the gold price has been rising over several months, while the UK and Switzerland combined are net exporters.Not surprisingly, Western ETF inventory, of which the majority is stored in London and Switzerland, has declined over the past three quarters.Western institutions that trade gold outright or use ETFs are dominant on the COMEX futures exchange as well. At the COMEX, we see the same development  gold s open interest has fallen over the period in question.If the UK and Switzerland were net exporters, who did they sell to  The UK mainly exported gold to Switzerland, so to answer this question all we have to do is find out which countries Switzerland exported to and check if these countries didn t sell the metal on.The Swiss customs department lets users track the flow of goods per continent. Apparently, Switzerland was a huge net exporter to Asia when the gold price went up.Let s see which of Switzerland s main buyers in Asia could have pushed up the gold price.It wasn t India, as the Indians, like most people in the East, are price sensitive. From October through June, India s net gold imports declined, with the exception of June when the price reverted.Possibly, Chinese private demand somewhat lifted the gold price. Although the Chinese are usually price sensitive, net imports into the mainland were surprisingly strong in November and December 2022, and in February and March 2023.Turkey s net import reached an all-time high in January 2023 when the Turkish lira continued to devalue and the Turks fled to real estate, durable goods and, needless to say, gold. After January, the Turkish central bank began blocking imports and sold 156 tonnes of its official gold reserves domestically to defend the lira. No doubt that Turkish private demand, mainly up until January, has had an impact on the gold price.A proper indicator of a trend reversal is the net flows to Eastern trading hub, Hong Kong. Normally, Hong Kong would be a net importer when the price declines  and vice versa . Recently, however, Hong Kong was a net importer while the price was up. Possibly, central banks are buying in Hong Kong, monetize the gold locally, and repatriate the metal outside the scope of public customs data. Gold owned by central banks  monetary gold  is exempt from being reported in customs data.The tonnages recently net imported by Hong Kong may not be very impressive, but they could be a sign of a larger development. If central banks are buying in Hong Kong, they can be buying anywhere.Major suspects are non-Western central banks secretly buying gold, as dollar assets have become riskier to hold since the US seized Russia s official dollar reserves in 2022. These central banks have an incentive not to make public rushing into gold or the price would spike excessively, giving them less bang for their buck.Every quarter the World Gold Council  WGC  publishes an estimate, based on field research by Metals Focus, that reflects how much they think central banks have bought. Since the Ukraine war, these quarterly estimates are much higher than what central banks in aggregate report to the IMF. Most likely covert central bank purchases have boosted the price.The most logical explanation for gold s recent behavior is a combination of surreptitious buying by central banks from emerging markets, and strong private demand in Turkey and China. It s possible the WGC s estimates of covert central bank buying are too low, given these estimates were falling during the price spike at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023.As some of you might have noticed, the US dollar gold price has been declining in the last months of the period of our investigation, and London was still a net exporter. Perhaps the West will regain control over the price again. I don t expect the gold price to fall to levels previously suggested by the rates model, though.Central bank buying is likely to stay strong.  We still believe that the official sector will remain a sizeable bullion buyer for the foreseeable future  , as factors that encouraged reserve managers to add gold reserves in recent years are expected to persist,   this August.We will have to wait and see if the East is able to further push up the price of gold and weaken the West s control over the price. If so, gold will become less of a dollar derivative, and take more center stage in the international monetary system.

Public Storage: A Simple Question Of Supply And Demand,"Over the long haul, it could be said that betting on the American self-storage space has really been a bet on the American consumer  as people buy more stuff to put in their homes, eventually they'll run out ofA primary beneficiary of this stunning growth is Public Storage , the largest self-storage player in the United States which, as of its , boasted 206 million net rentable square feet of storage space spread across 2,888 facilities, and whose common stock sports a 4.4  dividend yield  as of this writing .The large-scale trends across the country haveFor all of these bullish points, however, the market seems to believe that the outlook for Public Storage is not quite so rosy, as evidenced by the stock's 18.5  decline over the last 12 months.Over the last ten years, in fact, the stock has appreciated 77  versus the broader S P 500's  return of 171 . Reviewing the stock's performance on a total return basis for the same time frame also reveals underperformance for Public Storage with a 158  return against SPY's 225 .While it might be tempting to view the drop in Public Storage's price as a potential buying opportunity, we do not believe that the outlook for the company or the sector to be quite as strong as what the bulls contend. In fact, we think that a few key drivers will precipitate a continued slowdown in Public Storage's business and underperformance in its stock. The main points of our argument are thusLet's dive in.On the , Public Storage management highlighted move in volume, with CEO Joseph Russell noting that  we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14  in the second quarter.While growing volumes of move-ins might generate excitement on a conference call, analysts had questions about the company's move-outs as well. Let's take a dive into the same store net tenant addition metrics for Public Storage's latest quarter.Of Public Storage's 2,888 properties, 2,344  roughly 81  are considered same store, with the remainder in development or having been acquired less than one year ago. In our view, this reflects an aggressive growth strategy on behalf of the company  more on that later . Public Storage posted this chart in its latest quarterly filing, detailing same store data .Note that realized rent per occupied square foot grew overall by 8.3 , average occupancy across all markets declined overall by 2.1 . This indicates that the increase in revenue in the latest reporting period was driven--at least in the same store category--by price hikes to existing customers rather than an increase in new tenants.The picture doesn't get better when analyzing the tenants coming in to replace those that are leaving.As can be seen in the chart above  of the most recent 10Q , new tenants average annual contract rent per square foot decreased year over year by 14.4 , while promotional discounts to new tenants increased by 26.4 . Additionally, the net delta between new contract rents gained year over year versus contract rents lost from move-outs widened significantly, from negative  6 million in the quarter ending June 2022 to negative  29.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2023.In other words, it appears that Public Storage is having difficulty bringing in new tenants at full price, while it continues to raise rates for existing tenants and also experiencing a net decrease in overall tenants as expressed by average occupancy.It is perhaps not surprising that Public Storage is having difficulty with net tenant additions, given that the industry has been building new facilities at a feverish pace to meet demand over the last decade.In any industry, rapid build-outs of supply are driven by demand, but supply takes time to come online, and demand can wane during that time frame, causing supply to overshoot. To frame the situation for the self-storage industry, an estimated  of new storage facility space is expected to be completed in 2023 while the average storage unit price has dropped, according to SpareFoot.com, with the estimated cost to rent a storage unit in 2023 being  100 per month compared to .It's also a murky proposition to assume that Americans who are not yet utilizing storage spaces will suddenly jump on board and become new tenants. Consider our chart belowPictured above is a monthly snapshot of the Public Storage stock price and the Google trend search term 'Self-Storage Near Me' going back to September 2010. While not a perfect correlation, it can clearly be seen that the spike in searches for self-storage  we should note that Public Storage boasts that a large portion of its new move-ins come through its online funnel  in 2021 coincided with a rise in Public Storage's stock price. Searches for storage space has since moderated back towards 2019 levels, which, in our minds, is evidence that Americans are losing steam when it comes to renting new self-storage units.As an aside, we also believe that the stickiness of the self-storage consumer is also somewhat overstated in the bull case. While tenants who store motorhomes or other large items will likely remain for the long term, research from StorageCafe.com shows that most people using storage across the country are . Further, most contracts at self-storage properties are month-to-month with no penalty for cancelling  Public Storage's 10K notes on  that its lease policy is month-to-month .It isn't far fetched to think, then, that tenants could simply sell, discard, or move it back into their living space especially if they are looking to cut roughly  100 in expenses out of their monthly budget  and there is ample  to support the  that  seeking  monthly expenditures .Furthermore, the largest driver of new self-storage rentals comes from tenants moving to a .This, of course, was a boon for the self-storage industry as remote work became all the rage and high-earning white collar workers fled urban  to more rural settings. However, that trend appears to be , and there is plenty of research showing that Americans are moving .While we aren't of the belief that mass amounts of tenants will mount an exodus from self-storage nationwide, we believe that the majority of the facts do not stand in Public Storage's favor.Despite Public Storage's acquisitive nature  recall that roughly 20-25  of its properties are excluded from same store sales , analysts have largely factored out future FFO growth expectations from the stock.Against analyst estimates looking out in the second unreported year of  17.50 per share of FFO, Public Storage stock currently trades at roughly 15.6x FFO Share on a forward basis.Seeking Alpha's  paints a slightly worse picture, showing that the stock trades at 16x forward price to FFO, which is 30.9  above the sector mean.Should the company see its ability to hike prices on existing renters deteriorate, and if net move-ins continue to decline  as we think both will for the reasons outlined above , this will inevitably squeeze margins and Public Storage, which could result in further gloom from analysts in the future.For us, then, we target a 15-20  decline in forward price to FFO valuation as a good point to re-evaluate Public Storage's situation against the macroeconomic backdrop.It is difficult to grow a business with a relatively fixed cost structure while large amounts of new supply are set to come online amidst signs of waning demand.

Rising U.S. Treasury Yields Do Some Of The Fed's Heavy Lifting,"I love it when I can figure out a way to work more efficiently or, even better, get someone to do my work for me. The less I have to do, the better. I think the US Federal Reserve  Fed  agrees. After all, when it comes toWhen someone is happy to do your work for you, I think that s a good thing. I ve mentioned before how my oldest son used to prefer cleaning with his grandmother to playing with toys when he was a toddler. My husband was uncomfortable with this, but IIt seems the Fed has found a  helper  of sorts as well in the rising 10-year yield  and one that s a bit more effective than a three-year-old armed with Windex and paper towels . Different Fed members have said as much in recent days, and even Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening.There are a variety of reasons for this increase. The 10-year US Treasury yield is composed of two drivers  1  it s influenced by short-term rates  which is fairly straightforward  and 2  it factors in a  term premium  that investors demand for holding onto a bond for that long. That term premium reflects everything else that could occur over the life of the bond, including growth expectations and inflation expectations. Recently, inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, and so we need to look to other factors to explain the rise in long yieldsOf course, there is a countervailing force that can push down yields, and has done so on at least a few days since the conflict in the Middle East began  a preference for  safe haven  asset classes. There have been concerns that this crisis could be contagious and expand to involve other countries, which has fueled a move to Treasuries on several days since the conflict began. Although there has been far more of a preference for gold as a safe haven asset class, preferences can change - especially since the opportunity cost of owning gold is higher as yields rise.The rising 10-year yield is arguably a positive development in that it means the Fed doesn t have to hike rates anymore and therefore hastens the end of the tightening cycle, in my opinion. In other words, it s ripping the band-aid off. However, it s also exerting downward pressure on stocks. And when I talk to clients outside the US, they worry about the impact that higher mortgage rates, driven up by the 10-year US Treasury yield, will have on American consumers.But while the national average 30-year US fixed mortgage rate just hit 8 , a level that has not been seen in many years, I don t think it will have a very significant impact on US households. That s because more than 90  of existing mortgages in the US are long-term fixed-rate mortgages - with an average rate below 4  - so rising rates will not impact US households the way they have impacted households in other countries that do not have the exorbitant privilege of long-term fixed-rate mortgages. Or the way they impacted US households in advance of the Global Financial Crisis, when nearly 40  of existing mortgages were adjustable-rate. In fact, past due residential real estate loans have declined since mid-2020.The biggest result of high mortgage rates may be a low inventory of houses for sale, since many homeowners are unwilling to put their houses on the market with rates so high. The environment has created  golden handcuffs  for them.Policy uncertainty is likely to create an environment in which the 10-year yield will continue to move in a wide range in the near term. But I believe once we get clarity from the Fed that the rate hike cycle has ended, then I think we will see yields begin to ease.  In other words, I think sky-high long-term yields are likely to be very temporary.I think we are likely to get policy clarity in the next few months. After all, I thought it was meaningful that Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Wage growth is typically the stickiest part of inflation, so that suggests the Fed is content with progress made in the labor market - all the more reason they shouldn t need to hike rates again.And while the Fed may continue to talk tough in the short term  and we got a lot of tough talk in Powell s speech last week , I think it will be quick to recognize signs of the lagged effects of monetary policy on the economy, as I believe a very real slowdown  a bumpy landing  is coming. The very data-dependent Fed should soon realize there is no need for more rate hikes - and that there will likely be a need for at least one rate cut before the end of the first half of 2024. I believe higher oil prices will also weigh down on the US consumer and do some of the Fed s work for it.US stocks are likely to come under pressure in the near term as the 10-year yield remains high and perhaps moves slightly higher. Last week, the S P 500 Index fell more than 2 , down to 4,224 - which marks its lowest level since June 1. But I have to put this all in perspective  it is well below its peak of 4796 on January 3, 2022, but is well above its closing low of 3,577 on October 12, 2022. I think it is telling us that the recession that was priced in last year with an approximately 25  drop in the S P 500 is being replaced with a slowdown, being forecasted by a milder drop in the S P 500 this year.At the expense of sounding like a broken record, I see this as an environment that reminds us of the importance of broad diversification across and within not just equities and fixed income, but alternatives.After a flurry of data releases last week, I m primarily waiting to see what the Federal Open Market Committee decides to do in its meeting on Nov. 1.But there are some important data points and events between now and then Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Federal Reserve Board of Governors Summary of Economic Projections, Sept. 20, 2023, and Summary of Economic Projections, June 14, 2023 Sources  JP Morgan, Refinitiv Datastream, and Invesco Global Market Strategy Office, as of Oct. 20, 2023 Source  Bankrate, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Sources  Invesco, Macrobond, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  Freddie Mac , as of Sept. 31, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 20, 2023NA3186789Header image  archives   GettyPast performance is not a guarantee of future results.An investment cannot be made into an index.This does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor.

TORM: The Comeback Is Unfolding,"You are reading my 4th article on TORM plc  - one of the world's largest transporters of refined oil products, operating in various vessel segments from Medium Range to Long Range 2 tankers.I first wrote aboutToday, I'd like to update my coverage again as the tanker transportation market is changing quite dynamically and the, TORM reported its strongest performance ever, building on a strong 1st quarter. They achieved a TCE of  308 million, with an EBITDA result of  237 million  with a margin of 61.6  vs. 45.3  last year . After adjusting for unrealized gains, EBITDA increased by 23  to  199 million, and profit before tax increased by 72  to  184 million compared to Q2 FY2022As the management noted during , TORM's return on invested capital amounted to 33.9  in Q2  vs. 22.7  last year , and its balance sheet remained strong with a net LTV ratio of 29  and available liquidity of  497 million. The board of directors approved a dividend of  1.5 per share based on the second quarter results TORM has taken delivery of several vessels and entered into collaborations to enhance their fleet's performance. They mentioned .The executives emphasize the importance of the product tanker order book, which is currently at 10  of the fleet. It's spread across 3.5 years of deliveries, translating to a relatively low annualized growth rate  any new orders won't be delivered before 2026 . This implies that the market may not see significant new supply in the near term, supporting current rates.So the financial outlook for the remainder of FY2023 was  bullish,  so to speak, as TORM expects significant earnings day coverage at favorable rates. As of August 14, 2023, the company had already secured 72  of its full-year earning days and 74  of its Q3 earning days. While these rates provide a foundation, TORM acknowledges the potential for market rates to vary significantly, given the low visibility of unfixed TCE rates. Their outlook for FY2023 anticipates TCE in the range of  1,050-1,175 million and EBITDA ranging from  775-900 million. These projections reflect the current fleet size, considering vessel acquisitions and divestments.I like to check management's statements for realism by comparing their forecasts with third-party research, and if we're talking about shipping, BIMCO analysts, whose research is regularly publicly available, are one of the leading representatives of independent opinion  as far as I know . Analyst Niels Rasmussen updated , pointing to a serious imbalance of supply and demand in this market.While time charter rates are below their late 2022 peak, they are still well above 2022 levels, and used vessel prices have increased, underscoring the strength of the market and positive future expectations. Given the limited supply growth expected in 2024 and rising cargo volumes, BIMCO's outlook stayed optimistic. However, risks remain, with Chinese demand and economic indicators playing a key role in shaping future market conditions.The strength of the market can be seen in the latest data and in the behavior of fleet utilization  , MR utilization rates are currently at all-time highs  as of October 15From this, I conclude that TRMD's internal outlook is close to reality and that the company will indeed be able to achieve its projected EBITDA of  837.5 million for FY2023  the mid-range .Just like a few months ago, Seeking Alpha's Quant System, which  of picking promising stocks, gives TRMD stock an , which is absolutely solidAt the moment, TRMD is trading at about 4x of next year's EV EBITDA. Is that a lot or a little  In absolute terms, that looks cheap. But compared to the rest of the industry, it's slightly above averageIn terms of dividend yield, however, TRMD outperforms its peers, although its double-digit FCF yield is the smallest of allGiven its huge dividend yield, TRMD still appears to be a fairly cheap option among clean tankers, and as the positive trends in the industry continue, I expect that dividend yield to be quite well protected. This should ultimately attract more income-seeking investors and drive the share price higher - those who buy early will see a much higher total return, in my opinion.Of course, investing in TRMD stock carries several inherent risks that every investor should take into account. First off, the shipping industry's susceptibility to market volatility and cyclicality means that TORM's performance can be greatly influenced by fluctuations in freight rates, economic conditions, and oil prices. Regulatory and environmental compliance requirements may lead to increased operating costs, and TORM's substantial debt could pose financial risks, especially during extended periods of low rates. Intense competition, geopolitical instability, and the potential impacts of changing interest rates and exchange rates further underscore the risk profile of investing in TRMD stock. So prior to investing in TRMD or any stock, diligent research and consideration of one's risk tolerance are crucial.However, despite the associated risks, I remain confident that the stock rebound I anticipated for TRMD back in July is still in progress, and it is far too premature for it to halt. The current dividend yield is a result of market strength, but even if it falls to , it is still over 15  in FY2024, which is very, very generous at the company's current valuation of 4x EV EBITDA.Therefore, I reiterate my  Buy  rating and expect a double-digit total return from TRMD stock over the next 12 months.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Disney:Why You Should Buy And Hold Forever,"Although Fact Set breaks down the revenues into a few different subcategories, Disney generally classifies them as DMED for the media side and DPEP for the parks and hotel side. The DMED business represented about 35  of total operating income for FY22 and DPEP 65 . So in this case we have huge revenues with slim margins on the media business and lower revenues with higher margins on the parks entertainment and retail side.The equation here for a turnaround looks quite clear, enhance the parks business with greater CAPEX and cut the fat on the media side now that a customer base has been established. The linear media business also needs to be slowly merged into the  Web Based Data and Services  portion, or streaming. No small feat. However, Netflix has shown us that fairly high operating and profit margins can be achieved in direct-to-consumer streaming. Replicating it is the ultimate goal.Disney  was launched on November 12, 2019. This combined with park closures during Covid and the departure of Iger resulted in negative profit margins for a short stint. The recovery has been slow and not entirely pretty.Back to Netflix as a comp for what all streaming services aim to achieve. While Netflix has been around longer than 2009, streaming was introduced during this period. It took the good part of 7 years to achieve a steady upward trajectory for positive margin trends while the company also began to phase out the physical disk business. I wasn't even aware, but Netflix still mailed DVDs up to September of this year. Any dying business will have a long tail and take time to phase out.That being said, part of the difficult trek to profitability for Netflix had to do with the adoption of streaming. Luckily streaming has now become the norm, so Disney does not have to fight that battle. Streaming competition is also more fierce than ever, but Netflix has built a blueprint that should speed up the process to ascending margins in about half the time as it took Netflix. If it took Netflix 7 years, I'd like to think Disney could start that trajectory in 3.5-4 years. We should be near the sweet spot for margin improvement.In my previous article, I looked at Disney primarily on an asset basis. Since then, the price-to-book value has hit even further lows. Being that Disney is in a turnaround phase, with lots of write-offs and expenses, I used a modified Graham number using the book value and EBITDA per share as a proxy to income. Here is an update on that model for where we stand todayIn my bull case price model I will be making the following 2025 future assumptions using a Buffett Owner Earnings Model with TTM numbers bumped up by 10All numbers in millionsThis is not the first time I have written about Disney. I am very interested in keeping myself abreast of the company since it has become one of my larger holdings. Having traveled extensively, I would have to say that Disney has maintained its brand appeal internationally even though it has deteriorated domestically. It is still one of the first places on the list to visit should a foreign national set foot in one of the various locations that have a Disney Park.As someone who leans to the right side of the political spectrum, I also acknowledge what some of my readers have pointed out, some liberal, US-based issues have seeped into the Disney media content. This is not prescient throughout the rest of the world where Disney is known solely for its Parks, Hotels, and retail products.I have seen recent feature-length films put out by Disney, and while they were not all that impressive, none of them struck me as agenda-based either. I must also admit that I do not stream Disney  or subscribe to the linear segments, but supply and demand should eventually reconfigure the offerings to a nice happy middle. Simply put, we are all customers, and business survival will eventually come down to pleasing all of your customers. Our demand will eventually modify the supply. The beauty of a capitalist economy is that the customer eventually wins in the end. The only way we don't is if there is someone willing to subsidize an agenda.Commentary courtesy of The YOY reduction in subscribers has not gone over well as evidenced by Disney share price trends. However, Disney and other streaming services are going the route of higher monetization per user at this point versus service price cuts to attract a greater number of eyeballs. This is bound to happen as price increases take hold and ads are placed across all the platforms.Disney also has the advantage as evidenced by the Charter deal, to migrate their content to other streaming services outside of Disney  where companies like Netflix do not enjoy that advantage. While they may not increase their subscriber revenue through this, the ad revenue will still be theirs. Ads on streaming will be the new norm and the key to higher margins.Disney is looking to Double Down on the Long term debt has seen a decline from its peak at near  60 Billion, now down to  48 Billion. Current assets are solid at near  30 Billion. The EBIT net interest expense ratio is a healthy 5x. Not amazing, but ample coverage.

AMD's Consolidation Presents Strong Price Development (Technical Analysis),"  is scheduled to  for Q3 2023 post-market on October 31, 2023. While the company anticipates growth in both revenue and earnings due to robust product demand, there are heightened risks stemmingIn , AMD delivered commendable revenue figures, further cementing its pivotal position in the semiconductor sector. Even with an operating deficit, the company's financial results were noteworthy, particularly from a non-GAAP perspective. This piece picks up from my , offering an updated snapshot and highlighting potential investment avenues for long-term investors. Notably, the stock price has held its ground, and its consolidation at crucial thresholds suggests a bullish price development.In Q2 2023, AMD reported a  of  5.4 billion, marking a notable presence in the semiconductor industry. Their official releaseDr. Lisa Su, AMD's Chair and CEO, emphasized the significant ramping up of 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors. A massive increase was observed in AI engagements, with a seven-fold rise during this quarter alone. This was attributed to customers initiating or expanding their programs, primarily supporting the future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. The company is also gearing up for the launch and ramp-up of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Segment-wise, the Data Center segment revenue came in at  1.3 billion, a decline of 11  YoY, yet a sequential increase of 2 . Despite facing a drop of 54  YoY due to a weaker PC market and supply chain inventory corrections, the Client segment managed a sequential growth of 35 . Moreover, the Gaming segment faced a 4  YoY decline, with its revenue being  1.6 billion. In contrast, the Embedded segment saw an uplifting 16  YoY increase, totaling a revenue of  1.5 billion.Significant events and strategic movements also marked Q2 2023. At the Data Center and AI Technology Premier event, AMD unveiled two new 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors optimized for different workloads. Some of the event's other highlights were partnerships with industry leaders such as Hugging Face and PyTorch and robust networking portfolios. Cloud giants like AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft Azure, and OCI embraced 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors for new instances. Gaming and commercial PC users also have new products to look forward to, with the introduction of the Ryzen Z1 Series processors and the Radeon  RX 7600 graphics card.Strategically, AMD is set to invest  135 million to amplify its adaptive computing research in Ireland, targeting next-gen AI, data centers, and 6G communication infrastructure. Finally, the appointment of Phil Guido as the chief commercial officer, coming from a 30-year tenure at IBM, promises to bring in fresh strategic insights for AMD's global operations.AMD is scheduled to announce the Q3 2023 earnings on 31 October 2023. For Q3 2023, AMD expects growth in both revenue and earnings owing to solid demand for its products. The revenue is expected to hover around the  5.7 billion mark, with a potential variation of  300 million. Additionally, the company projects its non-GAAP gross margin to be close to 51 . Surpassing these expectations with positive results could significantly boost AMD's stock price.In the previous article, a deep dive was taken into the pronounced bullish trends observed in yearly and quarterly charts. The article emphasized how the notable downturn of 2022 was counteracted by strong bullish formations, suggesting a potential rise in momentum. This steep decline in 2022 can be traced back to the wick on 2021's yearly candle. Further insights from the quarterly charts revealed a pronounced breakout from the 38.2  Fibonacci retracement mark at  102.25. This threshold was pivotal for bullish momentum, and a second consecutive quarterly close above it only solidified this perspective.Additionally, the critical reversal candle touching a low of  54.57, backed by staunch support at the 61.8  Fibonacci retracement of  63.83, suggests that the bottom was hit, and an upward trajectory was expected. The weekly chart corroborated this bullish view, showcasing a completed inverted head and shoulders and a descending broadening wedge. It's also worth noting that any monthly close below  102.25 could hint at further declines. Yet, with September 2023 closing at  102.82, the market seems to maintain its bullish stance. To sum it up, the prior article posited that the price adjustment in AMD offers a prime buying opportunity for long-term investors.As previously discussed, AMD has held its pivotal levels and now exhibits a more bullish trajectory. The monthly chart below showcases the long-term foundational development from 2001 to 2019. This robust foundation was surpassed in 2019, marked by the red trendline, which served as the bullish base's neckline. Leading up to this breakthrough, the price had carved an ascending broadening wedge delineated by the blue trendlines. When these patterns were surmounted, the stock witnessed a significant upward movement.Several factors fueled this surge. At the forefront, AMD experienced a surge in demand for its Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, allowing it to snatch market shares from its rivals in desktop and data center domains. These products' standout performance and efficiency branded AMD as a potent contender against established market leaders. Furthermore, the global semiconductor landscape saw a general uptick, propelled by the digital revolution during COVID-19, growing cloud computing needs, and the increasing integration of electronics across industries. AMD's strategic alliances, relentless innovation, and successful roadmap implementation amplified investor trust, reflected in the stock's impressive performance during this period.Nevertheless, as highlighted in the previous discussion, the market's robust correction halted at  54.56. This bounce-back is a positive sign, hinting at a potential upward journey. Moreover, the RSI on the monthly chart is comfortably above 50.Conversely, the updated weekly chart highlights the stock's challenge in sustaining above the blue trendline. The pullback from the peak of  132.83 is attributed to fulfilling the descending broadening wedge pattern's target. Additionally, the RSI has edged above its midpoint, suggesting potential support at this crucial level.Moreover, the latest market pullback is better visualized on the subsequent weekly chart. It reveals a correction from  132.83 that has formed a bull flag pattern. A breach above  125 could potentially trigger a significant upward rally. The observation underlines the bullish stance for AMD, reinforced by a pronounced inverted head and shoulders pattern with the head at  54.57 and shoulders at  71.60 and  81.02, combined with the emerging bullish flag.Investors may consider increasing long positions at the present rates, given that the consolidation at critical levels, coupled with the appearance of a bull flag and inverted head and shoulders, signals an upward momentum.Various factors, including global supply chain dynamics and inventory adjustments, threaten AMD's performance and stability. The notable 54  YoY drop in the Client segment due to a struggling PC market and supply chain inventory changes underscores this vulnerability. While the company has shown the capability to manage certain industry pitfalls, continued disruptions or any imbalance between supply and demand can jeopardize its revenue, profit margins, and its place in the competitive landscape.External macroeconomic factors, such as potential economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, and unexpected global incidents, can further unsettle AMD's operations and stock value. The competitive landscape is also challenging, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Intel's earnings. Underperformance against these market expectations, especially in critical areas like data centers or client sales, can cause significant stock price fluctuations. Additionally, the possibility of competitors introducing groundbreaking technologies or aggressive pricing strategies remains a consistent threat to AMD's market dominance. On a technical note, if the stock closes below  102.25 in a month, it could drop to  63.82, but a monthly close beneath  63.83 would challenge the long-term optimistic forecast.AMD displayed a robust revenue performance in Q2 2023, asserting its prominence in the semiconductor sector. While the company faced particular challenges, such as an operating loss, its non-GAAP figures and continued growth under Dr. Lisa Su's leadership spotlight its potential and adaptability. The introduction of the latest EPYC and Ryzen processors, coupled with a significant rise in AI engagements, underscores AMD's forward momentum. Various segments within the company showed mixed results, with major product releases and strategic partnerships further enhancing the company's market position. AMD's upcoming investment in Ireland showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in adaptive computing. However, the future brings both optimistic projections and uncertainties due to broader economic influences.From a technical standpoint, AMD displays a robust bullish trend through pronounced price patterns. The appearance of the inverted head and shoulders combined with the bull flag formation bolsters the bullish argument presented in the previous article. As a result, investors might think about increasing long positions to capitalize on the potential upward surge. AMD is set to reveal its Q3 2023 earnings in a few days, which could catalyze AMD's next significant movement.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Sociedad Química Y Minera De Chile: Get Ready To Buy,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  shares have derated on falling LCE  Lithium Carbonate Equivalent  prices and concession renewal or nationalization risk. In addition I see potential for downgrades post 3Q23 results on high consensus estimates. However, the sharesEV auto sales and penetration are  than anticipated. Falling car prices, higher fuel costs, government rebates, and charging infrastructure expansion have combined toAfter skyrocketing to over US 80kg,  are back to a healthier US 20kg as supply and demand balanced. For SQM this is a sweet spot that allows for over 40  gross margins, free cash flow to continue to fund expansion, and keeps higher cost assets from entering the market at a reckless pace. at US 20kg makes many key   without subsidies  and with high environmental costs, according to recent data by  and . If spot prices continue to decline, new capacity may get stalled or need to look for long-term supply contracts to fund mines and chemical conversion.In addition, LCE is not yet a commodity like oil or copper, actual transactions and the ability to hedge, and buy forward contracts, are in diapers. The market is still largely based on bilateral negotiations between mining companies, chemical converters, battery makers, and automakers. Demand in China may have paused but in the USA and Europe, it's increasing. In my view, the China spot price is a guide but not likely what SQM or other non-China companies are realizing with customers.A process that promises to further enhance the cost competitiveness of brines vs rock or clay lithium fields. As illustrated in an  by Goldman Sachs , the Latin American brines could expand share via low-cost environmentally benign technology. DLE may reduce processing time and increase yields. Thus, if and when SQM can renew its concession that would very likely be accompanied by a DLE expansion project and enhance capacity and cost competitiveness.Post 2Q23 guidance I have adjusted volumes and now I assume a lower LCE price of US 20kg going forward  vs 30k in 2H23 . This may reduce gross margins from 50  to 40  as seen in the table below. Note that cash cost estimates decline in YE24 as new capacity comes online. SQM has been growing very rapidly adding costs faster than revenue that can't always be capexed.For the other segments of the company, I assume Iodine continues to see near US 70kg prices and over 60  margins. Specialty fertilizers and Potash improve on higher agricultural and natural gas prices while industrial chemicals are flat. I continue to value SQM at 10x EV EBITDA, this has been it's historic multiple and coincides with a DFC valuation and long term growth rates. However, the market has de rated SQM down to 5x and the consensus price target uses an implied 5.8x multiple. This de-rating is also evident in many peers such as Albemarle , Livent , Ganfeng  and Tianqi. Part of the rationale for this lower multiple is that LCE prices spiked and would fall, which they have. Yet the market continues to discount the sector due to price volatility, much as is seen in the oil and iron ore sector. However, I believe this sector should not be considered a pure commodity given that LCE, or Lithium Carbonate Equivalent as the name implies, is not pure lithium, this is a specialty chemical compound with varying formulations.The second reason for SQMs derating is due to recent political risk, the famous nationalization threat. This is very unlikely to come to fruition for many reasons, the primary one is that the current government has almost zero political power and no budget to acquire SQM's assets at a reasonable price. At present there is no bill in front of Congress to enact its  take over  proposal of lithium assets via joint ventures where the government controls the assets  51  but does not contribute capital. The only action reported by SQM and in the media is that Codelco  national copper mining company  has been tasked with negotiating the concession renewal  which expires in 2030 . In my view, Chile is not going to nationalize anything.When if the concession renewal is announced the valuation may jump several points, which would also be positive for ALB. There is considerable upside risk to SQM's valuation.My current estimates, that use LCE prices of US 20kg from 3Q23 forward, are at the low end of consensus. This is a problem, if SQM does realize LCE prices at this level, there could be a rash of downgrades that would not be positive for the shares. Thus, it may be worthwhile waiting for 3Q23 result before buying the stock.Buy SQM post 3Q23 results. Consensus may need to correct for lower LCE prices. However, at US 20kg for LCE prices going forward, SQMs valuation is cheap at 5x EV EBITDA, which has room to re-rate on less volatile LCE prices and more importantly, resolution of the concession renewal.

There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,"There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts  REITs  between  and .Second-quarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12-month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  to that of the S P 500  and Nasdaq 100-Index The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and long-lasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run. Therefore, many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for value.We think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLet's address all three points and finish by taking a look at five high-quality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performances.On the first point, if you watch financial media for any length of time, you'll inevitably hear commentators equating  commercial real estate  with office buildings, and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environment.Even industry insiders sometimes equate the two. See, for example, the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate RoundtableThe survey is about  CRE, but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CRE.What about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which they're located  Keep in mind that most non-office real estate properties, and most of the properties in REITs' portfolios, are located  of downtown areas.It isn't a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from  commercial real estate  to  REITs.  You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal office.While office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID-19, occupancy of apartments, retail, and industrial remains at or near their highs.The market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates, almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higher.But the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs. Most of them do a very good job at this.Hence we find that REITs' total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID-19Moreover, REITs' weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years, and  generally speaking  relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year. During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021, REITs very actively refinanced debt, pushing out maturity dates as far as they could. Many of them, like Alexandria Real Estate  and NNN REIT  refinanced expiring debt with 30-year bonds during that period.That is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs' debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surged.Of course, the longer interest rates remain elevated, the higher their weighted average interest rates will go. But while higher rates are a short-term headwind, they can be a long-term tailwind, because of the next point.In the long run, higher interest rates  combined with higher labor and construction costs  act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs, because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to market.As we all learned in Econ 101, the economy is basically operated on supply and demand. If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows, the price typically goes up. This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economy.When interest rates and input costs go up, development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt, which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the road.That's exactly what we've seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industry.Here's a chart showing sentiment among CRE developers related to their views of whether various components will be higher or lower in 12 months' time.As you can see, over the past year, they have mostly viewed occupancy and rents as headed higher while construction and labor costs have likewise headed higher. Only recently have developers started to see the light at the end of the tunnel for construction costs -- envisioning an end to materials cost increases.What does this do to development activity  It causes much less of it to be greenlit.Take a look at this chart of industrial  on the left  and multifamily  on the right  construction starts going back 10 yearsAlthough starts spiked in 2021 and early 2022, they have since  to very low levels as the costs of land, labor, materials, and capital have soared. The same thing is happening all across the CRE spectrum right now. Very few new projects are breaking ground for any type of real estate.What does this mean for REITs  It means that after the  manageable  wave of new supply of properties comes to market this year and next year, there will be a steep drop-off in 2025-2026 and potentially beyond that.Less supply combined with growing demand should result in rising rent rates.Let's briefly look at five REITs that we believe exhibit this huge mismatch between strong fundamental performance and weak investor sentiment. To illustrate, we'll just use one valuation metric  price to operating cash flow  or  CFO , because cash flow is one of real estate's primary channels of delivering returns.First off   , a triple-net lease REIT focused on investment grade, single-tenant retail properties leased to the nation's leading retailers like Walmart , T.J. Maxx , Tractor Supply Co. , and Home Depot .ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating, very little debt maturing before 2028, the highest quality tenant roster in the net lease REIT space, and a skilled management team. And yet, ADC is near its cheapest valuation of any time in the last five years.At a price of around  69, ADC trades at a price to AFFO of 17.5x, compared to its 5-year average of 19.6x.Next up, consider  , the only pure-play life science REIT that owns and develops state-of-the-art, Class A research   development properties in the nation's most innovative research clusters. The REIT just  an earnings beat on continued strong demand for its top-tier lab space, even if leasing and rent rate growth is normalizing from its elevated, COVID-era levels. ARE also enjoys a BBB  credit rating and no debt maturing before 2025.And yet, partially in response to activist REIT investor Jonathan Litt's short report, the REIT trades near its lowest valuation in 5 years.At a price of  127.50, ARE trades at a price to AFFO of 16.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 25.5x.Much the same could be said about US-based telecommunications REIT  , which owns a vast network of wireless towers, small cells, and fiber across the country. The market seems to be focused on the fact that management slightly trimmed AFFO per share guidance for 2023, lowering their growth estimate from 3  to 2 .Moreover, the market also seems pessimistic about management's repeated assertion that CCI will be able to return to growth after 2025, when the last of Sprint's lease cancellations take effect. Given the huge rise in mobile data usage and carriers' need to continue investing to facilitate that traffic, I believe management in their assertion that dividend growth will return to 7-8  annually in 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, CCI's BBB credit rating and modest debt maturities in 2023-2024 exude strength.And yet, CCI's valuation has gone off a cliffAt a price of  112.50, CCI trades at a price to AFFO of 14.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 23.0x.Turning to the self-storage space, we believe one of the strongest names in this area is  , which recently solidified its scale advantage by acquiring peer Life Storage. EXR now commands the  1 market share in U.S. self-storage at 13.2  of the market. Like ARE, EXR's ultra-strong pandemic-era performance is in the process of normalizing, especially as the housing market cools and fewer people are moving. EXR also enjoys a BBB credit rating and a manageable amount of debt maturing this year and next year.And yet, the market is valuing EXR  than it did prior to COVID-19.At a price of  144.50, EXR trades at a price to AFFO of 17.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 22.3x.Finally, in the industrial space, consider  , the premier owner of high-quality, infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained Southern California market. Management calls the industrial supply shortage in Southern California  virtually incurable,  and this shortage has spurred peer-leading rent and NOI growth. Over the last five years, REXR's NOI has grown at a CAGR of 39 , and after Q2 2023, in-place rents on its existing portfolio remained 50  below market, implying significant organic growth ahead.REXR is truly firing on all cylinders while also enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in REITdom with a BBB  credit rating, and yet the market is pricing it significantly  than it was before COVID-19.At a price of  56.75, REXR trades at a price to AFFO of 26.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 39.5x.REIT fundamentals across almost all sectors remain strong, and the decrease in development activity today implies that a favorable supply environment will be in effect in a few years' time. And yet, the market is pricing many top-tier REITs as if growth is coming to an end and temporarily elevated interest rates will permanently eat into REITs' profits.As for us at High Yield Landlord, we will follow the fundamentals, not investor sentiment.If you want full access to our Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us at High Yield Landlord for a We are the largest and best-rated real estate investor community on Seeking Alpha with 2,500  members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 500  reviewsYou won't be charged a penny during the free trial, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Jussi Askola is the President of Leonberg Capital, a value-oriented investment boutique that consults hedge funds, family offices, and private equity firms on REIT investing.

What I Wish I Knew Before Buying High Yield Stocks,"Thanks to the rapid rise of interest rates over the past year and a half, alongside geopolitical, inflationary, and other macroeconomic headwinds, high yield stocks have rarely been more attractively priced than they are today. Just take a look at what some ofClearly, there is an attractive combination of value and quality available in the high yield space. That said, the sector is far from a guaranteed ticket to financial independence and riches. For every high quality and sustainable high yield stock out there, there are many more that are ticking time bombs. As a result, while high yield investing can certainly be a very lucrative and rewarding approach to investing, it a requires knowledgeable, prudent approach to avoid suffering large long-term losses.Here are two lessons that I wish I had learned before investing in high yielding stocksMany times, management teams will make rosy projections about their company's ability to deliver strong long-term growth alongside paying out a very attractive dividend. While management does  hopefully  have the clearest view of the performance of and outlook for their business, they do not always share an honest assessment of the true state of their business. Sometimes, they may even be giving their best assessment, but they lack the foresight to properly understand the macroeconomic and or competitive threats coming their way.Two classic examples of this from my own experience were Algonquin Power   Utilities  and Lumen Technologies .AQN had a very impressive history of delivering a consistent  10  dividend per share CAGR over the course of about a decade. The company had a robust growth pipeline fueled by a powerful one-two punch of its renewables business segment and its regulated utilities business segment. Moreover, it had an investment grade balance sheet and the dividend yield looked quite attractive at over 5  following a pullback in the stock price. With management continuing to guide for robust dividend growth in the years to come, I bought shares, taking management at its word.However, if I had taken more care to look under the hood, I would have seen that they actually had considerable exposure to floating interest rates and were taking on a lot of leverage to finance their aggressive growth pipeline. With interest rates soaring in 2022, AQN got caught swimming naked when the tide went out  to borrow from a . As a result, it was forced to slash its dividend and the stock price plunged, burning me and many other gullible investors who had trusted management's guidance.Fortunately, in the case of LUMN, I sold before the massive dividend cut, but this was another case of a company that continued to speak glowingly of its strong growth potential that would be fueled by the  4th Industrial Revolution  all while also pitching its  1 per share dividend as a top capital allocation priority that would be sustained through the pivot to growth.Once management quietly removed this priority from its slide show, I asked the company point blank about it, and they tried to talk around it. Thankfully, I sensed something was going on and sold my shares, and sure enough, shortly thereafter, management not only cut the dividend, but actually totally eliminated it. Since then, the stock has completely cratered as it has failed miserably in its efforts to pivot to growth. Sadly, investors who failed to jump ship have been burned badly as over the past year LUMN stock has lost over 84  of its value.While management guidance and commentary can be very useful, never ever take it as gospel truth. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions when you get a chance to speak to a company. Oftentimes, how they answer questions on earnings calls and when you speak with them says as much, if not more, than what they actually say.Another lesson I wish that I had learned before investing in high yield stocks is that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors. Yes, I am a bottom-up investor who focuses on company-level fundamentals and valuations when making investment decisions and I generally do not make macroeconomic forecasts and therefore do not make my investment decisions based on where I think the economy is headed. However, that does not mean that I should be totally blind to what is happening in the broader economy when allocating capital.What I mean by this is that sometimes it is clear what is going on in the broader economy and what the ramifications will be for a stock in my portfolio. Even if the stock looks deeply undervalued and likely to deliver attractive returns over the course of a full economic cycle, it may be apparent that the current economic situation will cause excessive distress for the business. As a result, market sentiment may be highly likely to remain negative on the stock for the foreseeable future and in some cases, a dividend cut may be highly likely as well, further exacerbating market sentiment.A classic example of this was recently seen in the apparel sector. A stock that I owned was Hanesbrands . It had recently brought on an impressive new CEO who was previously a senior executive at Walmart  and was implementing an impressive plan to improve the company's brands, supply chain, and operating efficiencies. However, it quickly became apparent that a perfect storm of macro events was transpiring that were leading to an unmistakable solution. Inflation was soaring, interest rates were spiking, a prolonged imbalance in supply and demand, and an out of the blue cyber-attack on the company exacerbated its fairly heavily leveraged balance sheet and left management with little choice but to eliminate the dividend. Throughout this entire process the stock price continued to plummet, yet, given my focus on the long-term disconnect between supply and demand and principled agnostic approach to macro factors, I held the whole way down through the dividend cut. Given that I am an income investor, I ended up selling the stock after the dividend was eliminated.In hindsight, I should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier in the process and sold the stock at a much smaller loss than I ended up doing after the dividend was eliminated. Granted, I got lucky and was able to recycle the capital into New York Community Bancorp  right near its bottom during the March crash in the banking sector, leading to me gaining back much of my losses on HBI in short order. However, my handling of the HBI investment was still a clear mistake. Was my initial investment a mistake in the sense that my reasoning was wrong  I don't believe so. The fundamentals and valuation seemed to clearly indicate that HBI was undervalued, but the macroeconomic and black swan factors - which are highly unpredictable - conspired against it and sent the stock tumbling. This is just part of investing and is why I diversify my portfolio. However, my mistake was holding HBI for as long as I did despite the clear headwinds facing the stock. I should have just eaten my losses and moved on at a much earlier stage in the process.Now is clearly an exceptional time to invest in high yield stocks given where valuations sit. However, investors should not jump in head first into the sector recklessly. Many high yield stocks are high yield for a reason.While I certainly value management's opinion and listen closely to the earnings calls, investor presentations, and the answers they give in my interviews with them, I have learned the hard way that just because a management team says that its high yield is  safe  does not mean that it really is.Moreover, while I am a big believer in taking a bottom-up approach to investing and not making investment decisions based on macroeconomic forecasts, I also believe that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors once it becomes obvious that they are going to force one of your holdings to slash its dividend and potentially even face financial distress.By taking these lessons along with many others into account when investing in high yield stocks, investors can avoid painful dividend cuts and the steep principal losses that almost always accompany them.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Tesla: Onward And Upward,"During 3Q23,   produced 430,488 vehicles and delivered 435,059. Last quarter, the company produced and delivered 479,700 and 466,140 automobiles. The sequential decline was anticipated, as TSLA had announced downtime at its production facilities for upgrades duringTSLA is  Q3 2023 financial results on or about October 19. For the period, analysts anticipate  24.7 billion in revenues and  0.65 in GAAP earnings per share. Based on the number of Teslas delivered during the quarter, we expect actual results to come in below consensus estimates, on the top line and bottom line. However, although we anticipate a decline in revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to the shortfall in the sequentialWith respect to margins, despite the softer revenues, we expect higher gross margins on a sequential basis, driven by the increase in Model Y MSRP, decrease in commodity prices, labor efficiencies due to greater automation, and depreciation. However, profit margins are likely to come in lighter on a quarter-over-quarter basis, based on expenses related to the ramp in production associated with the Cybertruck and the Megapack, as well as additional spending on artificial intelligence. Consequently, earnings per share are likely to decline compared to the previous quarter, while coming in higher than a year ago.Considering that the TSLA story has not radically shifted during the third quarter, we reiterate our  492 share Price Target derived utilizing a 10-year Discounted Cash Flow model, that incorporates a 10-year normalized revenue growth rate of 50 , a profit margin of 10 , operating cash flow margin of 18 , yearly capital expenditures of 2 , average cost of capital of 7 , and a perpetual growth rate of 3 . Reiterate Buy Rating. With whispers that Cybertruck launch paraphernalia is being sent out, it appears that the vehicle's debut event is drawing close. Given that pick-up truck sales account for 20  of the U.S. automobile market, the lack of a pick-up truck among TSLA's models was a glaring gap, that was necessary to plug. Therefore, we are excited about the Cybertruck eventually becoming a reality.In regard to the competition, Ford Motor Company's  F-Series vehicles are the best-selling pick-up trucks in America, followed by General Motors'  Chevrolet Silverado models. F's F-150 Lightning is an EV pick-up truck with a range of 320 miles, towing facility of 7,700 lbs, and MSRP of  50,000 on the base model. Chevrolet Silverado EV version has a range of 400 miles, towing capacity of 10,000 lbs, and a price tag of  52,000 on the base model. Relatively, the Cybertruck has a range of up to 500 miles and towing facility of 14,000 lbs. Nevertheless, we view the entire line-up of Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado models, including the internal combustible engine  ICE  pick-up trucks as potential competition for the Cybertruck.Although, based on the Cybertruck's novel features and specifications, we expect strong demand out-of-the-gate, deliveries are likely to initially lag demand, due to the manufacturing complexity associated with the vehicle. However, as demand continues to ratchet, the gap between supply and demand is likely to narrow, as TSLA allocates additional resources to benefit from the popularity of the Cybertruck. In our opinion, sales of the Cybertruck, which, given the vehicle's niche appearance is considered to lack mass appeal, will surprise significantly on the upside.In addition, although, our argument might appear cliched, similar to the iPhone, the Cybertruck represents a paradigm shift within its industry. The iPhone captured customer attention because of the additional value it provided relative to other smartphones. We believe the incremental value the Cybertruck provides over the typical pick-up truck will reflect in a surge in vehicle sales, over time. In our opinion, the UAW strike afflicting F, GM, and Stellantis  is unlikely to benefit TSLA. Although we believe that the shutdown at the factories of the impacted firms is likely to be successful, the companies will absorb the increase in labor costs rather than risk raising product prices and turning uncompetitive. The automobile industry is highly profitable in absolute dollar terms, with F and GM guiding to 2023 net income of between  10 billion to  12 billion and  9.3 billion to 10.7 billion, respectively. Considering that labor costs account for 4  to 5  of the average cost of producing a vehicle, the impact of higher employee wages and benefits on the bottom line is unlikely to be crippling.Moreover, it is hardly a zero-sum game. Up until the UAW demanded a resurrection of the living wage raises, defined pension plans, and removal of wage tiers, the requests appear reasonable. However, when it comes to wrangling a 40  pay raise for workers, the UAW terms appear onerous, and will only escalate the trend towards automation of core production functions at automobile companies, in our judgment.Net-net, a potential success of the UAW strike will likely decrease profit margins at F, GM, and STLA, over the short term. Longer term, the impasse represents a margin expansion opportunity as hiring is replaced by automation, bolstering our argument that F's, GM's and STLA's loss is not TSLA's gain. The Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  mandate  including  400 billion in funding  to encourage the purchase of green energy technologies matches up nicely with TSLA's mission to design, manufacture, and market products that accelerate the earth's transformation to renewable energy. Consequently, along with customer subsidies on the MSRP of a majority of TSLA's EV models, the company's energy storage solutions are similarly advantaged with retail and corporate purchases of the firm's battery storage systems  Powerwall and Megapack  eligible for up to  30  in tax credits on the cost of the products.In addition, the IRA has earmarked  12 billion in entitlements to escalate the development and deployment of clean energy systems in rural communities across America, which will necessitate the utilization of battery storage technologies. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  USDA  entrusted with managing the venture, has received funding requests for up to 2x the 9.7 billion overlay allocated by Federal authorities. In addition, given our opinion that the nation is highly likely to achieve the target of 60  solar wind generated power by 2030 compared to the current 13 , large utility companies are likely to turn to TSLA for their battery storage requirements as they shift the electricity grid towards dependence on renewable energy sources.Further, it is notable that TSLA's energy storage business is global with mega-scale projects that depend on the firm's Megapacks, active in Europe and Australia, with additional projects under development in the geographies. Moreover, TSLA recently tabled a proposal with the Indian government to produce and market the Powerwall in the country. Although Indian officials balked at providing the firm with incentives for manufacturing, it appears that subsidizing customer purchases of the Powerwall is under discussion.With the Megapack backordered until Q3 2024 and favorable market conditions, TSLA appears to be increasing focus on its energy storage business. In that regard, it launched a Megafactory in China, over the summer, and has stated that its objective is to add several facilities over the short term.Overall, with what appears to be another strong quarter behind it, TSLA is well-positioned to charge ahead. Onward and upward.Considering the highly volatile nature of TSLA shares, they undoubtedly offer an opportunity to generate returns through day trading and other short holding period arrangements. However, TSLA is an investment story, not a trading story. Folks that Buy and Hold TSLA stock for longer time horizons are like to secure greater gains on investment with virtually zero risk relative to traders timing the market in the company's shares.Tesla, Inc. is a prudently managed firm with products that are key participants in growing markets with fragmented competition. We believe TSLA has high growth in revenues and earnings locked in for at least the next ten years. Buy, Buy, Buy  on pullbacks .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Adyen Simplified,"I recently produced an in-depth review of Adyen's   H1 2023 report as well asWhile I feel I was as comprehensive as possible in my review, I recently came across market share data that has been in my mind over the years for Adyen, but which I've been unable to locate. As I mentioned in the introductory bullet points, this data is, in some sense, the entire thesis.Specifically, this data illustrates a few key aspects of the Adyen investment thesisWith these ideas as our platform, let's begin this abridged version of my Adyen thesis.As I've shared in the past, Adyen could likely be considered to be the best FinTech on earth presently. Perhaps, it could be argued that Stripe  holds this crown, but, as the data in the concluding thoughts of this note will reveal, Adyen is a vastly more capital-efficient business relative to Stripe, while growing at essentially parity and while having fielded a platform at essentially product and feature parity.Additionally, as the TAM data that I will share with you in a moment demonstrates, Adyen has a very long runway for growth.So we have a fantastic combination of quality and capital efficiency, alongside elevated growth prospects.With these ideas in mind, let's turn to a review of Adyen's valuation.For a company that could grow sales, and, by extension, free cash flow per share, at 20   which would be below management's guidance  annualized for the next 10 years, a 3.4  free cash flow yield is quite fantastic.And this does not include future share repurchase programs, which its legacy peers, such as Fiserv , have executed with brilliant success.To add just a bit of extra information here by which you may become a more educated investor, Adyen's 3.4  yield is quite attractive in light of its growth prospects and in light of the reality that it is likely the best FinTech on earth. This yield is vastly, vastly more attractive than the sub 2  yield investors were offered historically.Additionally, the rise of Adyen's yield is not mysterious.On the heels of the fastest interest rate hiking cycle in American history, the 10 year treasury yield, against which Adyen's yield principally competes for investor capital  the result of which influences supply and demand for Adyen's security  therefore, share price , now finds itself at about 4.6 .Academic finance suggests that Adyen should trade such that we get the risk free rate   risk premium, which would suggest that Ayden should trade with a free cash flow yield of 5 .For current owners, this likely sounds like a scary prospect, but for prospective owners, such a valuation would likely yield 25 , or quite likely more, annualized returns in the decades ahead, as the company grows at 20  and begins repurchasing shares.All of this being said, Adyen does not offer a risk premium, nor does its yield trade at parity with the 10 year treasury yield, and I believe this makes sense  While investors in the 10 year will only receive 4.9  per annum, granted they hold to maturity, investors in Adyen will witness the free cash flow yield  note not actual yield  on their investment grow very materially in the decade ahead, especially if Adyen begins repurchasing shares with its excess free cash flow, which it likely will at some point in the decade ahead.The principal impetus behind crafting this abridged version of the Adyen thesis was my recent receipt of the TAM data that has eluded me for the last couple of years or so.Adyen, like essentially all of our businesses, has grown within a giant TAM populated by legacy incumbents and a diverse set of point solutions.Adyen has vertically integrated the aforementioned point solutions into one acquiring platform tech stack, and it has done so on a single source of code. This has resulted in a more feature-rich, cost-effective, and versatile platform  especially for global, multi-national enterprises , which has afforded Adyen the market share capture we can see in the chart below.Additionally, we can see the highly fragmented nature of this industry, within which Adyen continues to grow due to the nature of its platform. That is, its growth within this fragmented TAM has been a byproduct of the nature and configuration of its platform, which you may review belowAdyen is a quintessential example of a business that fits within my Inverse Bubble Framework  a term I coined , as well as our first and third foundational investment frameworks.  As I mentioned towards the introduction of this note, Adyen is arguably the best FinTech on earth at present, and the financial data below confirms this reality in my mindAs we can see, Adyen's leadership has demonstrated a  aptitude for capital allocation relative to the leadership of Stripe.Adyen has grown faster with vastly less required capital, and Adyen and Stripe are effectively at product parity today.To close, some have told me they do not like FinTech  to which I would respond,  Fair, but have you seen the returns of legacy FinTechs from whom Adyen or Marqeta continue to capture market shareBelow, we can see the returns of Fiserv and Global Payments over the last 40 and 20 years respectively.Today, we have the opportunity to buy the very, very best FinTechs on earth at value  to deep value .Both of these businesses have truly giant cash hoards and no debt, as well as very profitable unit economics and long runways for growth.Thank you for reading, and have a great day.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,"The notion that history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically, stocks and treasury yields  interest rates  are inversely proportional. As risk-free interest rates rise, equitiesHowever, as soon as long-duration  10-year  treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at  4.25 , the S P-500 formed a local top in mid-July and has since declined by nearly 8   with 10-year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5.001  last week .Now, the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by  extremely poor  breadth, with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few mega-cap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indices.Interestingly, the rally in big tech has been driven by significant P E multiple expansion  and not fundamental earnings growth . Given the steep rise in long-duration treasury yields, such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic. The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their  safe-haven  status  massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets  as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy. In one of my recent notes, I shared my views on the significant concentration into big-cap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq-100  Now, from a historical standpoint, I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987 - the year of the  Black Monday  crash. In a similar vein to 2023, we can observe a sharp rise in equities and long-duration treasury yields through the summer of 1987  an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship . And as you can see on the chart below, the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on  Black Monday   19th October 1987 , with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a  flight to safety  trade  causing a sharp decline in treasury yields .In today's note, we will try to find an answer to this question, but before we do that, let's understand the drivers of this ongoing wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields.On the back of a 40-year bull run in the bond market  1982-2022 , treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemic-induced inflation, ending the era of free money.During this tightening cycle, the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 5.5  and reduced its balance sheet assets by  1T through run-off of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of  95B per month.While inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022, it is still running well above the  target of 2   September CPI  3.7  y y . With persistent labor market tightness  unemployment rate  3.8  and strong economic data, central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation, and rightly so given past inflationary episodes.For several months, the Fed has insisted that a  higher rates for longer  policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle. And, in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes  despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow, as we know, the  monetary tightening actions and  higher interest rates for longer  stance explain the move higher in short-duration treasury yields. However, long-duration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening  long-term interest rates outpacing short-term interest rates , the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly. And, as of writing, the spread between 10-year and 2-year treasury yields has narrowed down to just -16 bps  from more than -100bps just a few weeks ago .Historically, yield curve uninversions have occurred right before the start of economic recessions, and while stock market investors are big on the idea of a soft landing  with S P-500 trading at  19x P E , leading economic indicators continue to point towards an imminent slowdownNow, higher long-duration bond yields mean tighter financial conditions and slower economic activity. While the bond market is doing some much-needed work on behalf of the Fed in the fight against inflation, the velocity of this move up in long-duration yields is quite incredible, and the longer this goes on, the greater the chance of something breaking in the financial system that eventually leads to a hard landing  recession  in the economyDuring the Q A session of his appearance at the New York Economic Club last week, Powell  on being queried about his understanding of the run-up in the long end of the treasury yield curve  listed out multiple theories that could explain the surge higher in long-duration treasury yields- Given the continued strength in the economy  tight labor market and strong GDP growth , higher interest rates are becoming an ineffective tool for slowing down economic activity or that rates just haven't been higher for longer-  US government debt   33.6T, current fiscal deficit   1.7T, massive treasury issuance from the government, Powell said - we are on an  unsustainable  path fiscally-   reduction of Fed's balance sheet assets, Fed moving from buyer to seller- investors are demanding a higher term premium due to growing expectations that the world is moving into an environment of more supply shocks than demand shocksAnd followed that up with the following commentsBy pointing toward supply-demand dynamics, my opinion is that Powell essentially admitted that the Fed has lost control of the long end of the yield curve. While the Fed's rate hiking campaign is likely on pause for now, the door has been left open for future rate hikes. More importantly, with inflation still running well above its target rate of 2  and Q3 US GDP growth projected to come in at 4 , the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy  switch back to QE  quantitative easing  in the foreseeable future. And without the Fed buying up government treasuries, the wild run-up in long-duration yields may continue for a while, pressurizing valuations of risk assets.Since treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the US government, their yields are considered the risk-free rate in the investing world. In a normalized environment, risk assets like equities tend to offer a premium of 2-3  on top of this risk-free rate. Hence, at this time, the S P-500 should ideally command an earnings yield of 7-8   risk-free rate  10-year treasury yield  of 5    equity risk premium of 2-3 .By inverting this 7-8  earnings yield, we get to a Price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5-14.28x for the S P-500. Considering forward 2024 earnings estimates of  245 for the S P-500, the market is currently trading at a forward P E of 19x. According to the yield math shared above, S P-500 should be trading 25-35  lower than current levels, i.e., in the 2,800 to 3,200 range.In addition to this yield-based repricing, I see additional risk for the S P-500 since consensus analyst estimates are looking for 12  y y earnings growth in 2024 heading into a potential recession. If we do end up getting a garden variety recession, S P-500 earnings could drop by 15-20  next year. And in that bearish scenario, the S P-500 could drop down as low as 2,200 to 2,640  2024 S P-500 earnings   176-185, P E multiple  12.5-14.28x .From a valuation standpoint, there's ample room for a significant de-rating in the S P-500, with its Shiller PE ratio  28.87x  sitting at extremely elevated levels as you can see on the chart belowYes, the yield math could change quickly if long-duration treasury yields moved back down to 2020-21 lows  however, current economic conditions are unsupportive of such a low-interest rate environment. A Fed pivot and re-introduction of QE-infinitum is probably the only thing that can push rates down to such depths, and while I do expect the Fed to revert back to QE at some point in the future  I believe the Fed Put is currently inactive  due to strong economy and high inflation . This reality doesn't change until and unless something breaks in the financial markets or the economy. And honestly, if something does break, we could see a  crash in the financial markets before the Fed pivots back to quantitative easing.On the back of a sizeable pullback since mid-July, the S P-500 is currently testing the support trendline from the COVID-19  March 2020  and the October 2022 lows. With weekly RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, a massive technical breakdown here is very much on the table.If long-duration treasury yields hold up at elevated levels or continue to climb higher over the coming sessions, equity market selling could pick up here accompanied by a potential spike in VIX  CBOE Volatility Index , which rallied past the 20 level last week.The S P-500  SPY  has support in the 410 to 420 range  however, if we break those levels, then all bets are off, and yes, we could even see the S P-500 experiencing a crash similar to 1987.That said, so far in 2023, SPY has followed seasonality patterns quite well, and numerous analysts have cited strong past performance trends in the November-December period while predicting a year-end rally for stocks  Recent economic data has remained resilient, and Q3 earnings are unlikely to rock the boat. With the Fed virtually on pause now, equity markets can embark on a run higher to close out 2023.Last Friday, SPY closed right under its 200-DMA support level and the trendline of support from October 2022 lows. However, we could be forming a bear trap here, with RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart showing signs of positive divergence.From a sentiment perspective, investors appear to be fearful at this moment in time as indicated by CNN's Fear   Greed Index  currently in  Fear  territoryAhead of a seasonally strong period in a pre-election year, investor sentiment is bearish  fearful  whilst SPY is nearly oversold and trading within a critical support zone. From an ultra near-term perspective, SPY can forge some sort of a bounce here as long as we hold the 410 to 420 support zone  and then resume the downtrend in H1 2024.The immutable laws of money dictate that risk assets such as equities offer a positive risk premium relative to the risk-free rate in the market. With the long end of the treasury yield curve having moved up to  5  in recent weeks, the S P-500 trading at a 4  earnings yield is simply unsustainable, and a de-rating to 7-8  earnings yields would be justified.Given the current state of the economy and Fed chair Powell's recent talk, long-duration treasury yields are likely to move higher from here, not lower. From a valuation and technical perspective, the S P-500 can drop by 25-50  from current levels.As we noted in this article, there are uncanny similarities between 1987 and 2023 up to this point of the year. Will we see a 1987-esque crash  Frankly, I don't know, but under the given set of economic and financial conditions, I simply cannot rule out a stock market crash.Winston Churchill once said -Heading into a potential recession, the equity market  S P-500  valuation reflects a high degree of investor complacency. A 1987-esque may or may not materialize  however, prudent investors must prepare themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes  tail events  in this uncertain environment. Considering the simple yield math behind stock valuations, the S P-500 is ripe for a significant correction. A technical bounce here may delay the inevitable move lower  however, looking at medium-term  1-3 years  risk reward, I rate SPY a  Sell  at current levels.The era of free money is over, and we are now operating in a normalized interest rate environment. With major US equity indices yet to price in the new financial realities, the risk of significant correction or crash remains elevated.In order to navigate this tricky uncertain environment, we are pursuing  Bold, Active Investing with Proactive Risk Management  at our investing group - . Join our community today and take control of your financial future.Ahan Vashi has 10  years of investing experience with a professional background in equity research, private equity, and software engineering.

BP: Significantly Undervalued At Current Oil Prices,"BP  is a well-known major oil player from the UK which has faced challenging conditions in a difficult oil market for the last three years. Despite drastic events  Deepwater Horizon, shale oil expansion, COVID, Rosneft write-off , the company remained aAt the end of the second quarter 2023, BP had 17.38 bn shares outstanding and a total market cap of  112.8 bn as of 09 30 23  share price of  6.49 .The fundamental ratios can be found in the table below, with a peer comparisonsales, EBITDA, earnings, equity and dividend numbers for 2023 in relation to the share prices as of 09 30 23.BP claims the top spot in two fundamental categories  P S and P EBITDA , has the second-highest dividend yield and ranks second and third in the other two categories  P B and P E . If we compare the 5 oil majors by implementing a score system  1. 4, 2. 3, 3. 2, 4. 1, 5. 0 , BP will take the lead.BP has introduced a dividend policy which regularly increases the annual distribution by 4  at  60 per barrel Brent oil after cutting the payout in half in the second quarter of 2020  from 10.5 cents quarter to 5.25 cents quarter  when the pandemic hit the economy. Since then BP has raised the quarterly dividend to 7.27 cents  38.5  or 11.5  p.a.  which exceeds the policy increase of 4 . At current oil prices above  80 per barrel, it is very likely that BP can increase the payout by 10  annually at least.Furthermore, BP is strongly committed to share buybacks of at least . In 2023 BP allocates 60  of surplus cashflow due to high oil prices. Since the end of 2019, BP has already reduced share count by 14.1   from 20.241 bn to 17.379 bn shares . In the second quarter of 2023 BP bought back 323 million shares for around  2 bn. At  60 per barrel BP aims to buy shares for  4 bn but due to a good environment for oil companies, BP has At a current share price of  6,45 and if oil prices remain above  80, BP will buy back nearly 1 billion shares each year which represents a buyback yield of more than 5 . Hence, the dividend and buyback yield combined is close to 10 .BP's earnings have been volatile for years because of major shocks which have been mentioned before  COVID, Rosneft . However, earnings have always recovered strongly when the environment for oil prices were beneficial. What is the current outlook for oil prices and the most likely scenarioThe most important influences on oil prices are supply and demand  1 , economic growth  2  and OPEC policy  3 .Oil prices have recently risen to  91  WTI  and  95  Brent  per barrel, an increase of 33  since June. Global oil demand is expected to rise to while supply plunged to 100.9 mb d in July. In July and August oil demand hit a record of 103 mb d widening the supply gap. Although the supply situation will improve to 101.5 mb d by an increased non-OPEC  oil production, oil demand will exceed oil supply for the next months which will support current oil price levels.The global economic output will . Growth is driven by India, China and other emerging markets while Europe's economy will be outpaced. Economic growth will stabilize oil prices as well as global air traffic which . The global demand for travel is continuously high and consequently, it is likely that global air traffic will surpass pre-pandemic levels which will also boost global oil demand.OPEC  supply fell to 50.2 mb d in July because of a reduced production of Saudi Arabia. The OPEC  countries are interested in a tight market and won't add a significant amount of supply to the global oil production. The group announced a total of 3.7 mb d output cut in April and a revision of this decision is unlikely. OPEC  produces nearly 50  and OPEC 33  of global oil supply. The output cut will limit a production expansion and oil supply won't keep up with economic growth and demand. Hence, the OPEC policy supports high oil prices in the near future.All in all, a scenario with high oil prices above  80 is very likely  60  and has consequences for BP's valuation.The first scenario with the highest probability shows a significant undervaluation of BP. Even if we reduce the buyback amount of  6 bn by  700-800 million share based compensation, the buyback yield in combination with future dividend increases support an upside potential of more than 50 . Furthermore, the downside risks are limited as the worst scenario for oil majors still signals an undervaluation for BP. The higher oil prices climb, the more likely and faster BP can surpass pre-pandemic dividend levels.BP is not only undervalued compared to its peers, the company's shares still would have upside potential if oil prices fell which is not very likely near-term. A combination of economic growth, limited oil supply growth and an increasing demand for air travel are excellent conditions for BP shareholders. In the scenario of high oil prices above  80 per barrel, they can expect increasing dividends and a buyback yield of at least 5 . Finally, the shares have a significant upside potential of 55 .Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

A Rising Interest Rate Freight Train Is Coming For The Economy,"The quiet murmur of rising interest rates has now grown to the roar of an approaching freight train. The 10-year yield continues to rise, hitting a fresh 52-week high this week over 4.3 . The  this week and is now threatening to rise above 8 . After over a decade of zero-interest rate central bank policies  a.k.a. , surging inflation sparked an economic avalanche that threatens to turn the economy and markets as we know it upside down. With massive government deficits, analysts can't seem to raise their targetsSo why are interest rates rising so much  And what does it mean for the economy and financial markets  Let's dig in.The 2010s were a unique time in economic history. Due to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis, global central banks kept interest rates at zero  or less  for roughly 14 years. The US raised interest rates for a couple of years from 2017 to 2019 but ended up cutting them right back to zero due to COVID. In addition, central banks pursued  to push down interest rates on mortgages to below the free market rate. This had even more effect on the economy.Holding interest rates at or near zero had subtle but profound effects on the economy in the 2010s.ZIRP also made certain business models unusually profitable. Friends of mine got rich by doing not much more than borrowing money cheaply and buying real estate. Decent execution of off-the-shelf business models like  or Airbnb hosting made making money a cakewalk. Even simply buying a property for a 3.5  fixed mortgage in the 2010s and putting paint, carpet, and a tenant in it was good enough. During this time, vacant houses in California made about as much money from price appreciation  just by existing  as a typical household living there did by working.Crypto is another business model that took off because of ZIRP. With the economic inputs of interest rates at zero, inflation at 2-3 , and government borrowing a bit unsustainable, putting some of your money in another currency like Bitcoin  actually makes a ton of sense.Of course, the mainstream economic theory here is that by fixing prices for loans at an unnaturally low level, the Fed was going to create shortages. For example, QE created an artificial housing shortage, despite there being a  in the US than there was before the 2008 crash. Still, consumer price inflation was low and everything was fine, at least until around 2019. And low rates were popular with the upper middle class, who saw their home equity increase and their 401ks rise. But, like America's obsession with off-label Ozempic, it was too good to be true.The chaos of the pandemic brought these policies to a rapid end. Inflation surging from 2  to nearly 10  annually shattered the public's trust in price stability. The public started panic buying goods, there were shortages of all kinds of necessary goods and services in the economy, and alternatives to the US dollar became cocktail party conversation. This more or less forced the Fed to act by raising interest rates and reversing its QE policies. Had they not done anything, inflation likely would have continued to rise, as it did in the 1970s.Today, inflation is still significantly above target, and public trust in the currency is still not fully restored. The US government is running , and fewer and fewer investors are willing to buy government debt. Fitch recently downgraded the US's credit rating due to an  and a lack of will to raise taxes. After getting burned by inflation, the market is hitting back.To this point, the market has severely punished the prices of previously issued long-term bonds with low coupon rates. Long-term Treasuries  have fallen off of a cliff.This is simple supply and demand. The Treasury needs to sell trillions of dollars in bonds to cover its budget deficits, and the market has not been keenly interested in buying them. As long as government deficits go unchecked, interest rates will continue to rise. The so-called  from Beijing to Riyadh to New York are threatening to humble the US Treasury, voting with their keyboards to stop financing unsustainable levels of spending. Unless the Treasury either raises taxes or sharply cuts spending, the freight train will not be stopped. While it's theoretically possible that the White House could force the Fed to print money to buy the US debt, this would send an unmistakable message to our foreign creditors that it's time to turn off the spigot. Long-term bonds actually aren't a terrible value here if you trust the government's ability to raise taxes and maintain 2  inflation, but that would require some sort of signal that they're going to take deficits seriously first.Essentially, credit is getting more expensive and harder to get. Since household savings rates are near record lows, that's a big problem for borrowers. By industryAt a , a homebuyer with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home worth  721,000. At 4 , it's  649,000. At 5 , it's  587,000. At 6 , it's  533,000. At 7 , it's  486,000. At 8 , it's  445,000. Finally, at 9  mortgage rates a household with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home that costs  410,000, which is 43  less than they could at the 3  interest rate. This is purely mechanical from the change in financing costs, not due to opinion or sentiment. To maintain equilibrium at 9  mortgage rates, home prices would need to fall 43 .This isn't just theoretical. Mortgage rates have already soared from 3  to 7.5 , so 9  isn't even that crazy given where we already are. This interest sits on top of large home price increases during the pandemic. The typical household looking to buy a house now with a mortgage is making an almost existential choice by signing up to pay bubble prices at 7-8  interest. It's not going to end well, and DTI ratios are at or above their previous peaks in 2006-2007. If you're in the top 1  of income earners then do whatever you want, but if you're looking to buy a house and start a family you're making a much bigger gamble than you might think.It's going to be hard for interest rates to go down with the deficits the government is running, so the most likely outcome here is some sort of housing crisis sooner rather than later. It's not really a question of if, it's rather a question of when. Consumers are not displaying enough elasticity to interest rates due to their bias against renting, and it's going to cost them. Just because you should call an all-in bet for  20 does not mean you should call it for  2,000. It's the same with mortgages- housing was a great investment at 2016 prices and 2016 interest rates but a terrible one at today's rates and prices.The story isn't too different for automakers. Because the vast majority of buyers need to finance their cars, sharply rising interest rates are bad news for automakers. While manufacturers are free to offer discounted financing, it cuts into their margins. Far fewer people can pay  90,000 for a truck at 6  or 7  for a 5-year loan than could at 2  or 3 .March's bank crisis was sparked by regional banks taking too much interest rate risk, and then rising rates burned them. Now, rates are back at fresh 52-week highs. Where are all of these banks now, and how much in losses have they sustained  The crisis caused rates to fall, allowing smart banks to get out from upside-down bets. For every bank that took decisive action to reduce interest rate exposure this spring, there are likely several that put their heads in the sand. While big banks are fine, I expect dozens more of these smaller banks to end up being taken over cheaply by competitors or closed by the FDIC over the next 12-18 months. Bad bets on commercial real estate and long-duration assets virtually guarantee this. This will not be the last you hear about regional banksThis said, attrition in the banking industry could be an opportunity for well-run banks like JPMorgan .The days of losing billions to grab market share are effectively over now that capital has a price. While the 2010s brought gains in innovation, they also brought hundreds of VC-backed companies with flimsy business models. Expect many of these companies to go out of business over the next 12-18 months. This is just common sense.Large-cap valuations are near-bubble highs despite bond yields rapidly rising. With the economy being  revolutionized  by skyrocketing interest rates, it's worth considering whether you can meet your financial goals by taking less risk in bonds and cash. For every cloud, there is a silver lining and bad news for borrowers is good news for lenders.Also, it's not widely known but interest rates are priced into futures and options, which means that calls and long futures get more expensive, while puts and short futures get cheaper. Higher interest rates also accrue to short sellers who short stock, enforcing some discipline on the market by channeling capital away from junk companies to higher-quality, profitable companies.Current valuations for large stocks are suspect. The S P 500  currently sits at  in terms of its earnings. Stocks like Apple  and Microsoft  are trading for 30x earnings or more, while stocks like Tesla , Amazon , and Nvidia  are trading for 50-100x. Historically these kinds of valuations don't work out. On the other hand, you can get roughly 5.5  in money market funds , 5.5  in short-term bonds , and 4.4  tax-free in municipal bonds . Will stocks ever get cheaper than they are now  Since stocks have almost never been more expensive than they are now from a valuation perspective, it seems likely that they'll revert to the mean with bonds and cash offering better and better returns. Again, I think this happens sooner rather than later. in various countries tells us that higher rates and inflation will likely remain for 5-10 years. While a severe recession could bring balance back to the economy, this is hard to exploit because the assets that would benefit from lower rates  stocks, real estate  would likely have to get completely crushed first to set the conditions for another bull market from the bottom.While realtors are shouting from the rooftops to get buyers to  date the rate and marry the house,  overpaying for assets with teaser rates and betting that interest rates will go down and make the deal pencil is something that has burned millions of people in the past. This time is likely no different. History also shows that  tend to go up in times of economic stress.This also goes for the popular assertion that the economy will never slow down because unemployment is currently low. Consumption of food, services, and soft goods won't crash per se due to higher interest rates, but the borrowing to buy stuff will crash. Housing and autos  for consumers, and changes in these are how every business cycle starts and ends. Workers in these industries are the original source of unemployment shocks, and business investment operates on a similar cycle. This eventually trickles down to consumption, but it's a slow process. Student loans kicking back in on October 1st , as student loan debt service is about 1  of the US national after-tax income.You should care about rising interest rates because it greatly affects the fair value of assets. If you understand how interest rates affect asset pricing, you can be more  elastic  to changes in interest rates and use this to make money for yourself and reduce your risk. If you're overly emotional or dogmatic, you're more likely to end up paying the wrong prices for the wrong assets. To this point, rising rates are both a huge opportunity and a huge threat to investors. In a less dysfunctional world, interest rates should not have risen this much, and government budget deficits wouldn't be as atrocious. But we have to make do with the world we have, so this is how I view things as likely to play out going forward.Will interest rates continue to rise  If so, what will the effects be on the economy  Share your thoughts in the comments below   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Is There Still A Bull Case For Bonds?,"For those who have been bullish bonds and calling for a rally throughout 2023, it has been on the back of falling growth and waning inflation such thesisIt seems the traditional relationship between yields and the business cycle has broken down, at least for now.Indeed, while my own fixed income asset allocation quadrant has been suggesting an overweight position in duration is appropriate for this stage of the business cycle, this cycle has thus far indeedBut, to be fair, market internals have also been disconfirming the recent highs in yields, as indicators by the likes of the copper to gold ratio and the relative performance of cyclical stocks vs defensive stocks  which are both contributors to this model  have been making lower highs and lower lows while yields do the opposite. Historically, market internals have provided a fairly reliable gauge of where yields should be from a growth and inflation perspective.However, while growth has been slowing on the whole, the US economy remains robust and resilient, meaning the business cycle overall hasn t actually been an all-out tailwind for bonds just yet.Despite the plethora of unfavourable leading indicators of economic growth, the US economy continues to hold steady. Much of this resilience can be attributed to a combination of the followingAnd although we have clearly seen a slowdown  and probably recession  in the cyclical manufacturing side of the economy, the services sector is humming along nicely. We can observe this below by examining the recent momentum in a number of key economic data points. Outside of industrial production, growth in consumption, income and employment all remain in expansionary territory.While the trend in growth is by and large to the downside, the economy overall has been running pretty hot, and the expectation we are heading into recession  which is driving many fund managers to allocate to duration  has simply not yet played out.But I say that to say this. A recession may well be on the cards yet. As I detailed in my recent , the evidence continues to point to a slowdown in growth over the coming quarters, which should translate into hard data deterioration at some point in late 2023 or early 2024. This is an outcome that should favour duration at some point in this cycle, but we are not there yet.Of course, from a fundamental perspective for bonds, growth is only half the story. Inflation and inflation expectations also play a major role in determining the price of interest. Unlike the growth story, the deceleration in inflation has been much more clear cut. Headline CPI has moved sharply lower this year. The latest three-month annualised reading came in at 1.9 , just shy of the Fed s 2  target.Of course, core CPI has been far stickier as a result of persistent wage growth, but, the outlook for owners  equivalent rent  the largest component of both headline and core CPI  suggests the overall trend in core CPI is likely to be to the downside over the next 12 months.However, I would argue the downtrend in headline inflation looks to be running out of steam. Indeed, as I detailed , we could well be nearing a point in which many of the cyclical drivers of headline CPI - energy, food and commodities overall - are shifting from inflation headwinds to tailwinds once again. This is certainly a message being corroborated by my composite inflation leading indicator, whose downside momentum clearly looks to be waning and is not suggesting headline CPI reaches the Fed s 2  year-over-year growth target anytime soon.Of course, whether we do see renewed inflationary pressures show up in headline CPI as 2023 progresses depends much on how far energy prices can rally in the coming months. While I do not think we will see triple-digit oil prices this year, the fundamentals within the oil market continue to lead toward the bullish side of the spectrum  as I detailed .I would not at all be surprised to see  90- 100 oil in the coming months, an outcome which would once again put increased upside pressure on inflation breakevens  which themselves are highly correlated to the oil price, as we can see below , and thus put upside pressure on interest rates overall.The positioning dynamics of the bond market have become rather tricky to decipher in recent times. Bond bulls have been quick to highlight how bearish speculative positioning is towards the bond market, which is currently nearing multi-decade lows.While speculative positioning is indeed at its most bearish levels in decades  a signal which I would generally lend a great deal of credence , in this case it would be remiss of me if I were not to point out the large potential fault in the signaling power of this data point.This relates to the , a popular trading strategy deployed by relative value hedge funds. Such a strategy attempts to profit from dislocations between the pricing of cash Treasuries and that of Treasury futures. During periods when there is demand for Treasury futures from institutional asset managers such as pension funds  which seems to be the case at present, as I shall detail below , then this increased demand can create a dislocation between the price of the underlying itself and that of Treasury futures. This creates an opportunity for hedge funds to lever up in the repo market and buy the underlying while at the same time shorting the futures, attempting to capture the spread. This was a popular investment strategy prior to COVID-19, and we can see these strategies are seemingly once again being deployed by hedge funds by looking at measure such as hedge funds futures positioning  which is heavily short, as we can see above , Treasury repo volumes  which have soared to multi-year highs , as well as asset manager positioning in the futures market  which is heavily long . The Fed itself also recently  how such strategies are seemingly being utilised by hedge funds once again.Not only does this dynamic suggest institutional capital in the form of pension funds and the like are long bonds, but it also seems to suggest the heavily short speculative positioning in the futures market illustrated above may be somewhat misleading and not actually providing a reliable contrarian buy signal after all.If we assess discretionary positioning toward bonds through the lens of Bank of America s Global Fund Manager Survey, we can see that not only are asset managers heavily overweight bonds, but there is also a consensus among them that yields are going to fall from here. Previous instances where discretionary managers were as certain yields were going to fall marked major tops in bonds, not bottoms.Also confirming this level of bullish sentiment toward long duration is J.P. Morgan s client survey index.Unlike what speculative positioning in the futures market is indicating, it appears asset allocations and money managers are actually bullish bonds.Other measures of positioning are also sending similar messages. The put call ratio for the 10-year Treasury bond for example remains floored and is not signalling the kind of panic put buying indicative of market bottoms.In fact, as we can see below, just the opposite has occurred. Call buying on the TLT ETF has skyrocketed in recent months.Meanwhile, TLT fund flows have been positive for much of 2022 and 2023 as investors pile into the traditional recession trade, while the ETF's short interest is effectively non-existent relative to historical levels.Again, this is the kind of speculative behaviour generally seen at market tops, not bottoms. Undoubtedly, it appears everyone one is playing the deflationary cyclical game of the last 30 years without understanding the changing structural dynamics surrounding inflation and demand and supply - nowhere is this more evident that in the bond market term premium  more on this later .Alas, one group of traders we can be sure are actually short bonds and are providing some kind of reliable contrarian buy signal are CTAs, which are effectively systematic trend-following strategies. While not as short bonds as they have been, CTAs are indeed actually short the market, and, as we can see below courtesy of Goldman Sachs, there is plenty of juice CTAs can provide bonds should a short squeeze develop at some stage.It is also worth noting too how pessimistic the media has become toward bonds. While discretionary positioning does not yet reflect this narrative, this level of bearish sentiment in mainstream media is often noteworthy.So, if inflation has been falling and fund managers buying bonds, why do yields continue to go up  Simply put, this is a supply and demand story.Indeed, I have highlighted in previous articles on the bond market how unfavourable the supply and demand dynamics could be for yields, but, I must admit this bearish force has been far greater than I had anticipated. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change anytime soon.Though most will be aware of the fiscal situation the United States currently finds itself in from a Treasury issuance perspective, it is worth repeating. Since running down the Treasury General Account earlier this year, the US Treasury has been issuing new debt en masse, with around  1 trillion of Treasuries forecast to be issued in Q3 and Q4 of this year alone. That s a lot of supply.Of course, this is happening at a time when Federal tax receipts are falling and interest expenses rising, two trends which will only exacerbate this dynamic and worsen the fiscal situation.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continues to undertake QT and dump additional supply on the market, while foreign investors are themselves also no longer funding US deficits on net  and haven t been for some years now . As such, it is falling to the private sector to buy these bonds.And, while the private sector has been happy to comply thus far given the attractiveness of US government debt, it is true that when neither the Fed nor foreign investors are willing to provide the required level of demand,  in the absence of demand, supply sets the price.  Per the work of Totem Macro below, what this means is historically, excess supply has had a far more meaningful impact on pressuring yields higher than would be the case when the Fed was willing to support the market via QE and foreign investors were willing to finance US deficits.These excess supply dynamics remain a continued threat to the bond market. But it unfortunately doesn t end there.Japanese investors are the largest foreign owners of US Treasury securities. Japanese insurance companies and pension funds represent some of the largest pools of capital in the world, and US bonds are one of their primary holdings. So, when the Bank of Japan makes alterations to its yield curve control policy, this can have big implications for Japanese capital flows.Indeed, they have recently done just that, widening the 10-year JGB trading band from 50 bps to 100 bps. And, as noted recently by the , with ' yields going up in Japan, the risk is that Japanese investors will now begin to sell US fixed income and start buying higher-yielding Japanese fixed income. This is a big deal for global fixed income markets because Japanese investors are the biggest foreign holders of US Treasuries, and they also own significant amounts of US credit.We can see this dynamic in play by looking at the correlation of 10-year US Treasury yields and 10-year Japanese government bond yields. As JBG yields rise, Japanese capital allocators are incentivised to sell foreign USTs and buy domestic bonds.The depreciation of the yen relative to the USD also exacerbates this dynamic, as many Japanese investors hedge their FX exposure when investing in foreign debt assets. So, when the dollar yen FX rate rises  USD appreciates relative to the yen , hedging costs increase and domestic yields can become more attractive even if the yields are lower than UST yields. This dynamic helps to explain why the USD JPY FX rate  black line below  is so closely correlated to US yields  blue line below .This dynamic is perhaps better illustrated by comparing JGB yields relative to FX-hedged UST yields, as we can see below. The additional yield pick-up for Japanese investors when investing in USTs is much lower than the JGB yield when accounting for the hedging costs associated with foreign investment.This is the threat of the great repatriation of foreign capital. All else equal, rising JGB yields and a strong dollar incentivises Japanese investors to repatriate capital to finance Japanese deficits instead of US deficits, a dynamic which will only serve to further reduce demand for US government debt securities  at least at current rates .But once again, the story doesn t end there. Another spike in oil and energy costs could again result in capital flows from energy importers out of USTs and into domestic assets in order to defend their currencies - as rising energy costs lowers current account balances thus depreciating the currency - another risk to duration should energy costs  i.e. oil  start to rise again. Such flows are effectively equal to additional QT.Should the USD strengthen, this also gives reason for foreigners to continue to sell USTs to strengthen their own currencies  as the dollar trends to go up when Fed is conducting QT and the private sector must adsorb the debt while the foreign sector is selling . The recent devaluation of the Chinese yuan speaks to this risk, with  recently reporting that Chinese banks are trying to defend the CNY by selling USDs USTs.As we can see, the supply and demand imbalance clearly indicates their remains upside risk for yields and downside risk for bonds, regardless of the macro fundamentals for duration. These are very important factors at play that have not been anywhere near as prominent in recent times where the fundamentals favoured duration.From a technical perspective, the 10-year yield is at an interest juncture. After butting heads with recent resistance just shy of 4.4  and completing a daily 9-13-9 DeMark sell signal, this recent move higher in yields clearly looks to be running out of steam. Given the level of bearish media sentiment toward bonds at present, I suspect we will see this correction continue to play out over the next month or two, though I would be surprised if yields were to retrace all the way down to their major support level around 3.4  anytime in the near future. Indeed, barring any imminent crash in equities, recession or market event that sees the return of QE, it is hard to argue against this being a chart that looks like it wants to go higher overall.While what I have discussed thus far has primarily focused on the cyclical outlook for bonds, it is worth highlighting some of the secular risks for the bond market that could see yields move much higher over the medium to long term.This dynamic is most aptly examined through the lens of the term premium, which represents the additional compensation investors receive for holding a longer dated bond  i.e. 10-year Treasury  until maturity as opposed to continually investing in one year Treasuries and reinvesting the proceeds each year upon maturity. In theory, the term premium should account for the additional duration and inflation risks associated with locking up capital for a long period of time.As it stands, it appears the term premium for 10-year Treasuries is not at all reflecting any kind of structural risks facing markets.  of the term premium suggest it is still negative as investors are yet to demand any kind of meaningful compensation for actually bearing the additional risks for being long duration in a world of .We can see this below by comparing the term premium to various forms of long-term inflation expectations.The same can be said of inflation uncertainty, which has clearly yet to be accounted for by fixed income traders.Even the outlook for debt issuance by the US Treasury and the excess supply this is set to bring to the market are yet to be fully accounted for in the term premium.On a structural level, it seems clear there are a number of reasons why yields could go higher from here, or at least average a higher level that what we have seen during recent decades. These are dynamics all bond bulls should keep in mind.Summing it all up, there are clearly a very large number of factors at play here that are contributing, or attempting to contribute, to the movement in bond prices and yields. The economic resilience thus far has resulted in any kind of material growth slowdown or recession being pushed back, meaning the macro conditions are yet to turn truly favourable for bonds. Likewise, while the cyclical inflation trend has been to the downside for most of the past 12 months, there are signs suggesting inflationary pressures could again re-emerge as we close out 2023.Meanwhile, the supply and demand story for bonds remains as bearish as ever, with excess issuance by the US Treasury and the potential for the repatriation of foreign capital both serious risks that could lead to higher yields.Will we get a cyclical bond rally at some stage  Most probably, but the timing here is very difficult given the bearish factors in play. A significant rally in bonds will probably require a material stock market crash, recession, or the resumption of QE. This is particularly true given how discretionary positioning toward the asset class seems on the bullish side. For now, being long duration at present is not the right risk reward trade investors should be looking for, particularly given the attractive yields on offer from the short end of the curve. After all, we now live in a world where you can be paid to wait. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",39,2023-09-01T21:52:00.000-04:00
TLT: Bullish Ahead Of September Payrolls And The CPI Update,"Rising bond yields have taken the market by storm with the 10-year and 30-year Treasury rate at the highest levels since 2007, approaching nearly 5 . The setup has been a disaster for the bond market, including the iShares 20  Year Treasury BondThe fund technically tracks a basket of Treasury bonds with maturities greater than  and represents a good bond benchmark as one of the most widely traded exchange-traded funds in the market. While the trading action has been poor, we see room to take the other side ahead of a rebound.The potential for favorable indicators, between the September CPI as well as the payrolls report suggesting confidence that inflation will continue to trend lower could help build a consensus that the Fed is done withThe Fed's rate hiking policy in place since early last year, taking the Fed Funds rate from effectively zero to 5.5  at the short end of the curve explains much of the dynamic in rising yields at the long end of the curve.Still, what we're seeing now has evolved into more of a momentum-based selloff. Data shows that bond futures market positioning is at a, implying a bet on even higher yields going forward.As it relates to the macro backdrop, the interpretation is a view by some that  inflation remains a problem  and the Fed will need to keep hiking to bring the CPI down to the 2  target level.This line of thinking received some fodder at the September Fed meeting with comments by Chairman Powell leaving the door open for another rate hike this year, noting the group remains data-dependent.The  higher for longer  mantra was strengthened by the fabled dot plot forecast by Fed members for the Fed Funds rates in 2024 to 5.1  compared to 4.6  from the June update.All in all, it is fair to say bonds deserve to be higher compared to levels last year although we will argue that the move has been overextended.The key point here is that there is some uncertainty regarding the actual direction of Fed policy even over the next few months. The difference between a continued  pause  or a rate hike over the next Fed meetings has significant implications for the broader bond market.Importantly, that extra rate hike taking the Fed Fund Rates to 5.75  is far from certain with a case to be made that it won't happen. There is a deep divide in the market right now regarding where the Fed Funds rate will end this year.According to the, which extrapolates the probability for the Fed Funds rate move at each FOMC, there is currently a 52.2  chance the Fed ends the year at the December meeting with no change to the current 5.5  level, compared to a 47.8  odds for a hike.The point here is to recognize that the interest rate expectations and the corresponding market probabilities are dynamic. Several factors can work to shift those probabilities.A  good  or favorable data point suggesting lower-than-expected inflationary pressures between now and the next Fed meeting could be enough to keep the group on hold. If it becomes clear further rate hikes are unnecessary for the CPI to trend lower, this scenario would be particularly bullish for bonds and TLT with room for yields to correct lower.This would be reflected in the December rate hike odds repricing lower and potentially even pulling forward the room for a rate cut earlier in 2024. This would also be a positive for stocks, although we'll leave that to a separate discussion.On the other hand, bond bears are sort of hoping inflation surprises much higher with other macro data coming in exceptionally strong, forcing the Fed to turn even more hawkish. Here is the market-implied probability that a rate hike in December would become the consensus, as a further tailwind for bond yields to climb higher, and more downside in bond prices including the TLT ETF.Two major indicators are coming out over the next few weeks that can help set the record straight. First up is the September non-farm payrolls report due out on Friday, October 6th. The current consensus is for 170k jobs added, representing a slight slowdown from 187k in August.Our thinking here is that this otherwise  soft  figure confirms a gradual deceleration in the labor market as evidence monetary policy is working to cool demand-side consumer pricing pressures. For context, the average number of jobs added over the past year has been around 260k added per month meaning it's clear that the pace has slowed.What might even be more encouraging is room for the unemployment rate to climb above 4 , based on a growing participation rate that was the theme in August.This headline number returned to the highest level since 2021 indicating that the transmission of monetary policy to restrict economic activity within the credit cycle is working. We also expect wage growth to be subdued.In our view, it would take a  blowout  print higher implying the economy is exceptionally strong to raise an eyebrow at the Fed that the labor market trends are inflationary.A miss to the downside on Friday with the payroll number a bit weaker than expected would be a very bullish backdrop for bonds because it pushes back on the need for the Fed to keep hiking and brushes aside concerns that inflation is accelerating.If anything, bonds could react in a sort of  buy the news  dynamic, where any print is met with some market-wide short covering considering the recent weakness. We expect to see a rally in TLT here as part of a  short squeeze dynamic  against the excessive net short interest in the bond market.TLT bulls can also look forward to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12th. A lot of attention has been placed on the recent spike in oil prices, although the key here will be core trends. The September inflation update showed that the core CPI dropped to 4.3 , the lowest level in more than two years.This is a very favorable development we expect to continue over the next few months because this side of the consumer price basket covers categories like housing, automobiles, and services that are more directly impacted by higher interest rates compared to energy prices.All indications are that core CPI which had been stubbornly elevated for much of the past year is finally turning. The Fed looks at three and six-month annualized levels which are well on their way to being at the target range. Again, the data has said they are data-dependent, and the cooling CPI is as important as it gets to confirm the trend is on track.In terms of the headline rate, our call is that core can drag the broader index lower through 2024. Even as oil prices have climbed, we believe it would take oil significantly higher for it to begin driving a cost-pull inflationary wave. We can point to retail gasoline which remains as a national average as highlighted by the otherwise muted impact on the consumer price basket.Putting it all together, we see good value in bonds at the current level with room for TLT to rebound higher as interest rates stabilize and ultimately pull back.Investors can pick up TLT with a compelling  4  dividend yield on a forward basis, with a good chance the fund will deliver a positive total return over the next year in our opinion. A scenario where the 30-year Treasury rate corrects to  4.25  by year-end, implies TLT can reclaim the  100 as our initial target.Into 2024, the possibility that the inflation converges toward the 2  target more quickly than currently expected, would provide the flexibility for the Fed to consider rate cuts based on anchored expectations. This could evolve irrespective of economic conditions within the soft landing scenario where the economy averts a recession.A soft September payroll report and cool CPI can go a long way to reset the trajectory of Fed policy. TLT and bond market shorts covering within a broader repricing would kickstart a momentum trade to the upside.In terms of risks, it would be more a concerning spike or re-accelerating of inflationary pressures that would be necessary to sustain a selloff in bonds. Factors such as the national debt, with supply and demand dynamics of Treasury bond issuances, also play a role in this market, but to a lesser extent.The setup here is that bonds are oversold and the next move in prices is higher in our opinion. More aggressive traders can also consider the ProShares Ultra 20  Year Treasury ETF  which is essentially a 2x leveraged version of TLT meaning double the risk as well as potentially double the upside return in percentage terms.

Canadian Solar: EPS Outlook Plummeting On Solar Glut And China Risks,"2023 has been a particularly challenging year for the solar industry. The solar ETF  has lost 40  of its value this year, with virtually all those losses occurring over the past three months. One notable exampleOver the past month alone, CSIQ has plummeted by 20  due to a poor sales outlook and earnings report from its larger competitor SolarEdge . Further, although solar stocks have lostCanadian Solar has been a publicly traded company since 2007. Since then, it has gone through four  boom and bust  cycles where it doubled  or more  in value and erased all those gains. The same pattern is mirrored in most other solar stocks. In general, the boom and bust cycle is correlated to changes in CSIQ's EPS  however, there is a tremendous amount of speculative influence, considering there is often some overreaction in the stock price in either direction. See belowOne key issue with solar companies is that the industry is not as firmly rooted as others in the energy space. These companies are very capital-intensive, with Canadian Solar spending over  630B in CapEx last year, or nearly half of its current market capitalization. Accordingly, they operate with a fair degree of competition and are highly exposed to broader manufacturing trends.Many investors are attracted to solar companies because they see the long-term growth potential of the solar market. However, the greatest benefactors of that may not be the solar panel factories because they're exposed to the same competitive, interest rate, and inflation risks as all other industrial manufacturers. A slight decline in demand combined with a continued increase in global solar panel production can quickly push the market into a glut, erasing the relatively thin profit margins found by factories. Additionally, these companies do not naturally grow organically as many others but require significant capital infusions to expand. Thus, substantial sales growth will almost always require considerable equity dilution or debt financing.The operating margin and sales growth trends of Canadian Solar and its peer, Solar Edge, are very similar because they compete in the same market. See belowThe operating margins of these firms dipped dramatically from 2020-2022, mainly due to supply-chain challenges that increased production costs while  to slow. Today, are up dramatically as these companies adjust for rising costs, although they're still lower than many years ago. That said, the price hike is likely sufficient to lower demand, particularly considering that electricity price growth has stagnated after two strong years. Thus, the sales outlooks for these firms are now deteriorating more quickly.Canadian Solar is still expected to expand its revenue over the coming years. However, over the past year, there has been a significant decline in its immediate and longer-term revenue estimates, highlighting some potential for stagnation. See belowSignificantly, Canadian Solar relies on debt financing to grow its revenue, which comes at the cost of its equity stability. It has also diluted its equity to a small extent over recent years, though the pace has quickened. Further, we can expect that production costs, such as power, labor, and input materials, will continue to increase at or above inflation as in recent years. As a result, its  to stagnate through at least 2025, but no significant declines are anticipated, with annualized EPS running around  5 and potentially rising after 2025.The solar sector's largest issues are interest rates and inflation. Combined, these factors dramatically increase solar installation costs and lower most solar systems' ROI. Solar panel loans now carry  APRs, erasing most of the gains received by adopting the panels. Problematically, the solar market has not been tested by such high interest rates ever before, increasing the probability of overestimation, as recently seen in guidance cut.At the same time, the production of solar panels, particularly from China, is rising very quickly today. In light of waning demand, this situation has already created a glut of solar modules in many markets, with that  as long as US and EU interest rates constrain residential demand  and corporate . Combined with increasing weakness in , credit ratings, and rising solar panel production costs, I believe it may take longer than 2025 before we see a rebound in solar demand.  very cheap today, likely reversing some of the electricity price growth since 2020.Most of the company's manufacturing is in China, often viewed as a Chinese headquartered in Canada. At the end of 2022, 72  of its long-lived assets  1.67B in total  were situated in China  an additional 12  were in Thailand, but less than 1  were in Canada  see . Its annual report has 315 mentions of  China  and 365 of  PRC,  with immense details regarding associated risks relating to trade, ownership issues, geopolitical risks, taxation, and other factors. Additionally, 95 is in Asia, while just 3  is in Canada.Canadian Solar markets itself as a Canadian firm, which is technically accurate, but its core operations are mainly Chinese. China is essentially the only place in the world where solar panels can be manufactured cost-effectively due to other countries' environmental and labor cost restrictions. Controversially, Canadian Solar has  of using Uyghurs in China. Unfortunately, The same is true for many Chinese-made items  however, unlike , Canadian Solar cannot hide behind the issue through externally contracted factories since they indirectly own projects in Xinjiang. Although the company has since investigated the issue and , third-party that is not entirely accurate.Humanitarian issues aside, this controversy is a significant problem for CSIQ. For one, investors must realize that it is effectively a Chinese company that actively seeks to appear more Canadian than it truly is. That is not to say that it is dishonest, since its annual reports are clear on that fact, but it is true in investor marketing since very few other analysts have realized this fact. Of course, the US and other countries recently against solar panel imports made by China's forced labor factories. Aside from the slave labor issue, it is a problem that most of CSIQ's assets are tied up in China because US investors do not necessarily own those assets, instead being indirectly that generally do not protect foreign investors.In my view, in light of Solar Edge's substantial guidance cut, the latest income and sales estimates for Canadian Solar are likely overestimated. Interest rates are now around 5  from today through 30-year Treasury bonds, so there is no reason to expect any reductions in short-term borrowing costs anytime soon. Considering we see the yield curve steepen without rate cuts, it is possible that the Federal Reserve may hike rates again next year. Inflation has slowed, but it can rebound as it had numerous  which faced similar supply-side inflationary trends relating to geopolitics in the Middle East.That risk factor compounds Canadian Solar's woes because its COGS should now rise faster than its sales consistently as long as interest rates and inflation remain an issue. In my view, we may likely see the company's operating margins slip back toward zero as they had been years ago. Higher interest rates also push the company's borrowing costs up, just as its debt grows as it seeks to expand its operations. The company's financial debt-to-EBITDA is relatively high at 6X, particularly considering I expect its EBITDA to crash due to the sales and profit margin reversal. Indeed, considering its thin margins and high capital overhead, I believe there is reasonable potential that CSIQ's EPS will be back around zero by the end of 2024, far below current estimates.Short interest on CSIQ is high at 9.6 , meaning many investors are betting against the stock. Most analysts love the company and believe it is undervalued today, but may be dramatically underappreciating its China-related risk factors and broader glut risks facing the solar sector. As solar loan costs soar and solar panel production costs rise with global labor and commodities, I firmly believe Canadian Solar and most of its peers will soon see enough price competition that their meager operating margins will be wiped out again. We've seen this pattern many times throughout the company's history, so I do not see any strong reason to suspect it should not continue.The fact is that Canadian Solar is not a green energy growth company but a relatively old-school manufacturing firm with tremendous cyclical risks and capital needs. Further, it faces high exposure to geopolitical trade issues between the West and China and associated labor issue allegations. This is not to say that I do not believe Solar itself will grow, just that Canadian Solar, as a stock, has minimal upside potential related to the long-term expansion of the solar industry. So long as supply and demand rise together, a factory will not generally expand its income without raising external capital. Thus, CSIQ's sustained EPS upside, even with a great demand outlook for Solar, is minimal to me, while its downside risk associated with a glut is considerable.Overall, I am slightly bearish on CSIQ today and believe it will continue to lose value over the coming months as its 2024-2025 EPS expectations decline due to the glut issue. If the allegations of labor issues in China result in actions from Western governments, then CSIQ's downside would be even more significant. That said, the same can be said for most solar companies, given that essentially all solar panels are produced in Asia, . Personally, while the US has made laws to stop the labor issue, enforcement is , potentially because green necessarily afford higher prices.At this point, it is difficult to say where exactly CSIQ may land once its bearish trend ends. It is just now reaching back into its pre-COVID price range, mirroring expectations of EPS deterioration. To me, given a near-or-below zero operating margin outlook, high leverage, and China-headquartered assets, I would not personally buy CSIQ at any price, given there is too much room for black-swan risk factors and financial deterioration. However, I would be surprised to see CSIQ cross below  10- 15 per share anytime soon, given it did earn substantial profits over the past year. Even if its prospects are in sharp reversal, it is unclear if this issue will last until 2024-2025 or longer. Thus, while I am bearish, I would not short CSIQ today because it has already lost so much value, and we will likely not know clearly how its financial position will be impacted by the macroeconomic shift until early 2024.

"Nvidia Was Up 235% In 2023, Don't Expect It To Continue (Rating Downgrade)","It is our stance that the stock market is not logical, rather it's sentimental. There is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100   - only to fall 40   in aThis roller coaster ride is most evident in tech stocks, which happens to be our specialty. Therefore, we openly and frequently discuss with our free newsletter readers the importance of layering into a leading position, setting up buy plans ahead of time, and also the importance of taking gains once the technicalWe've had unwavering conviction in Nvidia's AI story . In fact, it was our leading position going into 2023 and  exceeded Stanley Druckenmiller at 29 , meanwhile, Druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading AI portfolio. The Street is also  for being early to  , which was a latecomer recommendation in March 2023. Ark Invest often discusses AI as a leading trend, yet almost  entirely. We point this out because we provided Nvidia as a stock tip for free, repeatedly, with top-tier analysis delivered on Seeking Alpha and through , with our own capital backing the research.We are a strong proponent of offering quality information at the free level. We offer top-tier analysis every single week in our free newsletter,   Unfortunately, free information tends to come from those who are unproven and may not be very good investors at all, while those with a proven track record keep trades close to their chest.Not only do we actively manage every position we own and send real-time trade alerts, but we discuss openly and frequently our thoughts along the way. Our track record on Nvidia over the past 1-2 years looks like thisThe single biggest issue individual investors face is a lack of quality information that is , , and comes with  around position sizing, portfolio performance, and how to handle sell-offs.It is this last point that we'd like to discuss with you today,  how to handle selloffs.  We were considered crazy for buying Nvidia in 2022 and we are considered crazy for trimming in 2023. Yet, in what is rare transparency for the financial world, we are sharing with you our plans with this leading portfolio position.On August 28th, we put out our price analysis on NVDA. We offered two general scenarios that we see playing out, which are still very much in play today. Here is what we said back thenAlso, in the last report, we were looking for a breakout above  480 to signal that a low was in, and we were heading toward our first overhead target around of  545. We did see a breakout, but it failed to hold, which was a warning of more volatility to come. This, coupled with some heavy distribution volume above the  440 price level, had us decide to take more gains in Nvidia. However, we do not believe current prices are ideal for a long-term, buy and hold mindset. Patience will likely pay off in the long run. So, it will be up to each investor to decide if they want to take on the risk of potentially getting one more high.For us, the reward is not worth the risk, which is why we have decided to trim. Our last buy at  410 in July is our last buy, and we do not have any more buys planned until we see a resolution. There are two other AI-related stocks that we like better in the near term, and when we enter these, we will notify our premium members with real-time trade alerts.This remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the  340 support. Below there, and the top is likely in.Nvidia is a core holding of ours, so we will likely never close the position, as long as the story and tech trend remain intact. However, we do strongly believe in taking gains, reducing risk, and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis. That being said, we believe we are approaching one of these moments. Even though we broke a key trendline today, we expect a bounce to occur soon. If this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels, we will trim our position even more.There has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO, Jensen Huang. So far, he has sold over  110,000,000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks. Regarding insider activity, there are many reasons insiders sell, which may have nothing to do with the business. However, when you see the executives within a company, like the CEO, it's worth paying attention to. Since June, we've seen about  175,000,000 worth of NVDA sold.In conclusion, our broad market work suggests that a complex topping process is forming. Many sectors and stocks have likely topped, while some big tech names look like they have the potential for one more high into the end of the year.Insider activity and institutional selling point toward another high being less likely. If we do get that second high, our plan is to trim more. Until the  340 support breaks, NVDA still has the potential for that last swing higher. Regardless, we believe being patient will pay off for those looking to buy a great company at a great a price. We are also being patient for when we add back to our position and feel it's better to be defensive at the moment.If you own Nvidia stock, or are looking to own NVDA, we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars, held every Thursday at 4 30 pm EST.

Surge Battery Metals Is The Lithium Giant In Nevada That You Haven't Heard Of Yet,"My email box and phone blew up last week with friends and family forwarding the big news of Lithium Americas   huge caldera-hosted lithium mine in northern Nevada. 'HaveHowever, as boring as I've been blathering on about lithium mining stocks, I couldn't be satisfied with being ahead of the curve on lithium in general. After all, lithium prices have declined precipitously from record highs, so it has been a stock-pickers market for lithium mining stocks.Back to Lithium Americas. 'Yes, and yes,' I said, but then I added a big new reveal  There's an early-stage lithium company, Surge Battery Metals  , that looks to be sitting on a lithium deposit that checks all the boxes that Thacker Pass does and is arguably better, but it is trading at 1 10th the value or less. This company's property is also in Nevada, ranked the number one mining-friendly region in the world by the . They've drilled some remarkable holes judging by lithium content, strike length and initial geology and metallurgy. So remarkable that  the Chairman of the company  a respected figure in the world of lithium, mining, and finance  a Director  former Rio Tinto executive and geologist  and the Chairman of another public lithium mining company that became a strategic investor  American Lithium   all had a similar initial response  Surprise, intrigue and sometimes head-shaking disbelief., Chairman of   his company's approximate 10  stake in Surge Battery Metals  beginning at 11 34 - Director, .  Source   - Chairman,   Source  I'm going to assume that readers are familiar with the lithium space. I'm not going to discuss the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries, and I'll expend little to no ink on the differences between the three general types of lithium mining, hard-rock, brine, and sediment clay. The reason I'm going to skip all that for now is I want to get this article out rapidly because I think after last week's big pullback after a breakneck run, that Surge Battery Metals warrants a strong buy recommendation. I am convinced of this opinion based on the current supply and demand picture, my experience investing in lithium stocks and investing in general. I think that Surge Battery Metals will be acquired for at least five times the current market capitalization in relatively short order. I want this article to serve as a stake in the ground at this point in time so I get the intangible  credit  for having informed a wider audience about Surge Battery Metals, hopefully to our mutual success.Of course, hope is not a reliable investing strategy. In my long investing experience though, simple comparative economics is quite reliable. That is just taking one product, company, or resource project, and measuring it against another more established and higher valued one, and determining whether the former is undervalued based on the qualities of each project and the market capitalization of the companies being compared. I'll do that with Surge Battery Metals' Nevada North Lithium Project.The Nevada North Lithium Project  NNLP  is in Northeast Nevada in Elko County. It now encompasses 725 mineral claims, a total area of 22.45 square miles, and is open in multiple directions. The expanded size model is over 8.5 times larger than just this past February 2023 based on the latest results of the drilling campaign, soil samples, and geophysics.What first caught my attention about Surge's NNLP last November 2022 was the below map, showing geologist Alan Morris' area-wide soil sample results across the original footprint of the project. Stunningly, the pink purple regions reflect lithium values  from 500 to 5,120 parts per million  ppm .Not only are lithium readings at the surface like this extremely rare, the whole economics of a project can get a huge boost if the surface readings are confirmed to run deep. And they do, as confirmed by a 2022 drilling campaign that posted the results belowAs you can see, these results are extraordinary in terms of grade and strike length, and rival the best results of clay sediment hosted lithium anywhere in North America. Some highlights are the over  in hole 5 beginning right at the surface, and hole 7 which boasts So far during the current drilling campaign, two holes assays have come back from the third-party lab and have produced the following resultsHere in NN23-01 we have about   to Surge Battery Metals, the shallow zone includes lithium content , which is apparently the highest ppm in Nevada ever confirmed by a lab.NN23-02 continued to expand the size of the project to the northwest, as an , and contained one layer of core length of .About eight more holes have been drilled, including the deepening of a few previously drilled holes upon further indications of additional highly prospective zones of lithium at lower levels.If the Nevada North Lithium Project appears to be as significant in size, grade, ease of lithium extraction, and level of impurities as Thacker Pass, the NNLP should be valued the same as Thacker Pass. If the NNLP proves to be of greater significance in the majority of these factors, it should be valued higher than Thacker Pass. This is the basic thesis.However, we certainly need to add a lot of points to Thacker Pass for its stage of operations including finalized permitting and approval, finalized mining flow sheet and plan of operations, defined metallurgy, and financing. Lithium Americas has been at this a long time and is clearing ground and commencing operations. They are much farther along, and there is a significant value attributed to project stage by the Market.Once Lithium Americas finalizes its split into two entities, one which holds the South American assets and the other which holds the North American assets, we will know how the Market values Thacker Pass. Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Jaberwock Research wrote a  with a valuation estimate on the separated entities. They ascribe a value to Thacker Pass of  4.009 Billion, discounted by .7, excluding a 636 Million investment from GM, of which half has been injected so far. They give a value to the South American assets of  2.354 Billion post cash of  167 Million and debt of  279 Million. Because the Market is currently valuing the combined company at  2.72 Billion in Market Cap, which is less than half of Jaberwock's discounted all-in current value, I'll use their ratio of 70 30  in favor of Lithium Americas' North American assets. This comes to about  1.9 Billion for Thacker Pass in terms of current Market Cap.On to the comparison. Here is a table of the most important clay sediment hosted lithium deposits in North AmericaFrom the table above, we can see that Surge's NNLP has higher average grades than even stellar Thacker Pass, averaging 3,437 from its drilling campaign thus far.In its initiation of coverage, the analysts at SCP Resource Finance  previously known as Sprott Capital Partners  estimates, based on last year's drilling alone, a resource of 2.5-3Mt LCE   . They believe that this season's just completed drilling could lift the resource towards . SCP further sees blue sky potential of the NNLP at .Upcoming holes are being drilled deeper, to up to 1000 feet, and previously drilled holes are being deepened after indications of deeper targets. 15Mt LCE could even be conservative in my opinion, and we'll find out soon from the assays of these deeper targets.'How can one make an estimate like this with only the assays from 10 holes ' some will protest. Fortunately, the nature of clay-hosted lithium deposits gives geologists confidence, as clay-hosted deposits often show remarkable consistency and continuity across a wide area.Thacker Pass sits in the McDermitt Caldera, an ancient lake inside that formed inside a collapsed volcano which collected-lithium enriched sediments from various geologic occurrences over millions of years - including of course the volcano's initial eruption - constrained by the volcano's edges. Over time these sediments became further enriched with lithium as detailed in one of the papers principally authored by Lithium Americas' Thomas Benson, , that garnered a lot of well-deserved attention in the press recently.The high grades of Li-bearing clay being found at the NNLP are similar if not higher than the grades found at Thacker Pass, and the regional rocks have been described as of  to the McDermitt Tuff soils that host lithium at Thacker Pass. The NNLP sits in the site of the Jarbridge Caldera, and it appears from the location and geology that the same factors that enriched the lithium-bearing clays at Thacker Pass could also be responsible for the NNLP's  of lithium ppms.Further, in the recent  with Surge director Iain Scarr, he mentions that there is more Hectorite present in the soils of Thacker Pass than present at the NNLP, hence extracting the lithium from NNLP should be less complicated and less costly.Speaking about soils, the SCP analyst points to a beneficially low magnesium content  2-4  and the presence of coarse calcite crystals which aid in extraction purification efficiency.Another key factor in mining is 'overburden', which is simply how much relatively worthless rock and dirt sit above the valuable resource that must be removed to get to the good stuff. As mentioned above, . Compare this to Thacker Pass, which finds itself in the opposite position. At Thacker Pass, the best grades are generally  and the lesser grades are at the surface. Overburden equals additional cost. Surge's project is blessed with high grade at the surface in the resource area drilled so far.To sum up the comparison, Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine is being valued in the Market right now at  1.9 Billion before the second  300 Million  cash infusion from GM, assuming the value of the entire company pre-split is 70  in favor of Thacker Pass. We will find out this week, perhaps before this article comes out. Regardless, some Seeking Alpha contributors see a value of Thacker Pass of up to about  5.7 Billion  excluding the  636 Million from GM .Let's be a bit conservative and give Thacker Pass a current value of  1.5 Billion. Surge Battery Metals has a current market cap of about  109 Million U.S. dollars and a fully diluted market cap of about  140 Million U.S. dollars.That is a  In doing this comparison, I asked myself what the likelihood is that the NNLP becomes a mine. Considering all of the positives and the comparison that at the very least gives the NNLP an equal value if it becomes a mine after it is proved out by the requisite amount of drilling, I have no doubt that it does become a mine. It will probably not be owned by the same corporation at that point, as I can see Surge Battery Metals being acquired for a substantial premium in relatively short order.After all, Lithium Americas reportedly had numerous competitors vying to take the stake that GM ended up winning. The U.S. Administration has recognized the urgency of a domestic supply of lithium and other critical energy metals, and plenty of companies are finding out the hard way that some nations are looking to nationalize or further control lithium projects. Case in point  the Sonora Lithium project in Mexico. The government of Mexico just  a number of concessions from Chinese giant , in a move that could delay another large source of lithium to a world that is estimated to be going into deficit for years.When investing in the mining sector, it's often wise to bet on the repeat performers. Their contacts, geological experience, and instincts come in especially handy in the relatively small community of lithium experts. It's a small community because for a very long time, lithium wasn't worth a whole lot. How times have changed.The  of Surge Battery Metals is , an experienced executive and financier who sold his last company, Millennial Lithium, to none other than Lithium Americas for  490 Million U.S.The  of Surge is , who before Surge was EVP of Transmission and Distribution at British Columbia's electric utility BC Hydro, serving 4 Million customers. He previously served as Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and Chair of the BC Oil and Gas Commission. is a geologist with more than 30 years at Rio Tinto, including serving as Commercial Director and VP of Exploration. holds a BSc in chemistry and a PhD in flotation technology. A holder of numerous patents involving lithium processing and extraction, Dr. Mehta is a world-renowned expert in lithium mining, extraction, and processing. is EVP at American Lithium Corp. and the board representative for American Lithium's investment in Surge Battery Metals. He is a professional geoscientist and brings more than 30 years of experience in the exploration industry to the Company, including working directly on American Lithium's TLC Claystone Project in Nevada.Here is a rundown of Surge's share structure from their most recent corporate deckThe Company raised about  7 Million dollars in June 2023, mostly from American Lithium, which has funded their recent drilling and exploration campaign. They reported about  9.6 Million on the  at the end of June. Warrants attached to that financing should bring in some more money to the company if American Lithium chooses to increase its stake in Surge, which I expect them to do. Other financing will of course be necessary in the future for Surge to keep up the pace of drilling. Considering Surge's prospects and the attention coming to lithium in Nevada, I think financing will not be a problem and could come from many sources, including another strategic investor.As detailed previously, Surge just concluded its second drilling campaign and has released results on two of them. There are about eight yet to be released after they are analyzed at the lab, including some that have been re-entered with a rig that can handle greater depths.Other news could relate to additional land acquisitions, additional strategic investors, and perhaps additional site visits another global automaker, which the CEO described after the initial drilling results were released.Then, the Maiden Resource Estimate  MRE  will be released, estimated by the company variously to be arriving as early as November 2023 but at the latest Q1 2024. More recently, company representatives have said that Q1 is more likely, to allow the incorporation of the results of the whole second drilling campaign.Below is my own standard list of the main risks I consider specifically when considering an investment in junior mining stocks, beyond the general risks inherent in any public company investmentWhat balances some of these standard risks in Surge's case is Lithium Americas' hard-fought but trailblazing success. They had rough patches along the way, had court fights and doubters of the technology behind lithium extraction from clay sediment, but emerged successful and are rumored to be close to a  from the U.S. government to fund mine construction.Surge is the beneficiary of the  Second Mover Advantage . By following Lithium Americas' playbook where it was successful and avoiding the minefields where it had difficulties, Surge could really expedite the timeline to a producing mine, or a buyout. Who better to guide the team than Chairman Graham Harris who led his company's buyout by Lithium Americas, and CEO Greg Reimer  who rapidly focused Surge on the NNLP and started to assemble a crack team when he saw what they had in the ground  Chairman Harris has done this before, and I was a beneficiary since I owned stock in Millennial Lithium.One final point concerns the price of battery-grade lithium. Spot prices are volatile, and reflect short-term supply and demand considerations, but most lithium is purchased on long-term contracts. Some might think that currently depressed prices in the spot market are a sign of a surplus of lithium. Maybe if viewed week-to-week, but the long-term demand picture is extremely bullish, and might even get desperate as countries increasingly look to protect their own national lithium interests, cancel concessions, and various mines get delayed or cancelled such as  in Serbia and Sonora in Mexico.Analysts at Macquarie have  that lithium supplies have been depleted now to the level where prices began to soar the last time.Sometime in the near future, but within a year, I expect Surge Battery Metals to be acquired by one of the big names in lithium such as Rio Tinto, Albermarle, BHP, Lithium Americas, or even a specialty chemical conglomerate, auto manufacturer or oil major. There are a lot of contenders out there, and if  I think the operative word is  Surge's official MRE confirms the highest-grade clay-hosted resource in North America, which has minimal overburden and favorable extraction parameters, I predict Surge's share price will ramp up further to reflect greater awareness of this remarkable project.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Scorpio Tankers Q2: A New Fleet, A Strong Strategy, A Promising Future"," , a leading provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the challenging market conditions, the company has demonstrated resilience and strategic financial management, which are key indicators of its potentialThe oil shipping market is influenced by a myriad of factors. These include global oil supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and broader economic conditions. Each of these elements plays a significant role in shaping the industry's landscape and, more specifically, the spot rates for oil tankers.Global oil supply is one of the key drivers of spot rates in the oil shipping market. Spot rates, the price for immediate charter of aCurrently, we are witnessing a period of relatively low oil inventories, which is contributing to an upward trend in spot rates. This situation is beneficial for oil tanker companies like Scorpio Tankers, as higher spot rates are leading to increased revenues and profitability.Another critical factor influencing the oil shipping market is the rate of fleet growth. The number of new ships being built and added to the global fleet can significantly impact the supply-demand dynamics in the industry. Currently, the industry is experiencing lower fleet growth levels relative to historical averages. This trend is primarily driven by high interest rates, which make the financing of new ship construction more expensive, and the fact that many shipyards are currently occupied with building other types of ships.This lack of new ship construction is leading to a tightening of supply in the oil shipping market. With fewer new ships entering the market, the existing fleet is in higher demand, which can further drive up spot rates. For well-leveraged oil tanker businesses like STNG, this situation presents an opportunity. With a modern and efficient fleet, they are well-positioned to capitalize on these market dynamics.STNG's financial results for  showed a net income of  132.4 million and an adjusted net income of  133.3 million. While these figures represent a decrease from Q2 2022, it's important to consider them in the broader context of the company's performance and the market conditions.The global oil shipping market is known for its volatility, with rates and revenues often fluctuating in response to changes in oil supply and demand, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. Despite these challenges, STNG has demonstrated a strong ability to navigate this complex landscape and generate increasing profits.Looking at the company's performance for the first half of 2023  H1 2023 , STNG reported a net income of  325.6 million and an adjusted net income of  328.9 million. These figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022, indicating a strong upward trend in the company's profitability.Furthermore, STNG's ability to maintain profitability despite the decrease in net income in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022 demonstrates the company's resilience in the face of market volatility. It suggests that STNG has effective strategies in place to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities, positioning it well for future growth.Management has been actively managing its debt through a combination of lease repayments, debt reductions, and new financing agreements.In , STNG exercised purchase options on several vessels that were previously financed under various lease agreements. This resulted in a significant aggregate debt reduction of  300.2 million. In July 2023, the company continued this strategy by exercising purchase options on six more vessels, leading to an additional debt reduction of  143.6 million. STNG also gave notice to exercise purchase options on two more vessels, which is expected to result in a further debt reduction of  36.5 million by the end of Q3 2023. This shows a strategy of wanting to deleverage, especially away from more expensive lease agreements.In addition to these debt reduction strategies, STNG has also secured new financing agreements. The company executed or received commitments for three separate credit facilities totaling up to  1.2 billion. The first credit facility, executed in May 2023, was a  117.4 million facility from a European financial institution. The second, executed in July 2023, was a term loan and revolving credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to  1.0 billion. Upon execution,  440.6 million was drawn from this facility to finance 21 of the company s unencumbered vessels. The remaining availability of this facility is expected to be drawn between Q3 2023 and the end of Q1 2024, primarily to repay and refinance more expensive lease financing. The third credit facility commitment, expected to close within Q3 2023, is a  94 million facility from DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, which will be used to finance four vessels.These strategies reflect STNG's proactive approach to managing its debt. By reducing its existing debt through the exercise of purchase options on leased vessels and securing new, lower-cost financing, STNG is effectively lowering its interest expenses and improving its financial position. This approach not only reduces the company's financial risk but also frees up resources that can be used to invest in its operations and growth initiatives.Scorpio's active share repurchase program is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. Share repurchase programs are often implemented when a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment. In their  Scorpios management outlined their thoughts on this explicitly stating  Share repurchases preferred over dividends when trading a significant discount to NAV.  During the most recent quarter, STNG purchased  283 million worth of shares at an average price of  48 per share. This move reduced the company's basic shares outstanding to 53 million from 56.8 million. Since the start of 2023, STNG has repurchased a substantial 8.6 million shares for a total of  421.1 million. This aggressive repurchase strategy underscores the company's belief in its intrinsic value and its commitment to capitalizing on what it perceives to be a market undervaluation of its shares. Over the past few months, STNG has been buying shares at prices ranging from  43 to  49 per share, demonstrating its commitment to this strategy and providing an idea of what they see is trading below NAV.Moreover, STNG still has  213 million remaining under its 2023 securities repurchase program. At current prices around  50 per share, this could potentially lead to the repurchase of an additional 4.26 million shares, or roughly 7.5  of the current shares outstanding. This further reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to an increase in earnings per share  EPS , all else being equal, and continue to boost the share price.It's also worth noting that STNG has preferred share repurchases over dividends when its shares are trading at a significant discount to Net Asset Value  NAV . This strategy suggests that the company is focused on long-term value creation rather than short-term yield.The age of a company's fleet is a significant factor in the maritime shipping industry, particularly for oil tankers. The typical useful lifetime of an oil tanker is between 20 to 30 years. After this period, the cost of maintaining and operating the vessel often outweighs the benefits, leading companies to retire and replace these older vessels.The global fleet's average age currently stands at 11.7 years. This figure is a crucial benchmark as it provides context for comparing individual companies' fleet ages. A fleet age significantly below this average suggests a company is operating with newer vessels, which often translates into operational and financial advantages.Scorpio Tankers Inc. stands out in this regard, boasting a modern fleet with a Deadweight Tonnage weighted average-year built of 2015. This figure is considerably newer than the global average and also surpasses some of Scorpio's direct competitors. For instance, International Seaways  and Nordic American Tankers  both have fleet average build years of 2011.Moreover, some of these competitors' fleets include ships that are reaching or have already reached their retirement age. This situation could lead to substantial capital expenditures in the near future as these companies may need to invest in new vessels to maintain their operational capacity.In contrast, Scorpio's oldest ship was built in 2012, meaning none of its vessels are approaching retirement age and many are debt-free and still have dozens of years of operation. This situation provides Scorpio with a significant advantage, as it can avoid the substantial costs associated with replacing older vessels for the foreseeable future.The benefits of a younger fleet extends beyond avoiding the costs of replacing older vessels. Younger fleets often have lower maintenance costs as newer vessels are less likely to require significant repairs. They also tend to be more fuel-efficient and are more likely to meet the latest safety and environmental regulations, which can lead to cost savings, operational efficiencies and help reduce political risk associated with older vessels. Scorpio Tankers' conservative dividend payout ratio of 10.42  demonstrates the company's strategic approach towards its long-term financial health. By retaining a significant percentage of its earnings, the company has more capital available for reinvestment into its operations and growth initiatives, and for reducing its debt load.A focus on debt reduction is particularly advantageous in the current economic climate, where rising interest rates are a concern for many businesses. By reducing its net debt, which has fallen from - 2,934 million in Q4 2021 to - 1,523 million currently, Scorpio Tankers is effectively lowering its future interest payments. This is significant because a substantial proportion of the company's debts are in the form of floating rate notes, the interest rates of which increase in tandem with market rates. A lower debt burden could even potentially lead to improved credit ratings and better loan terms in the future.Despite the expected drop in the Fleet TCE rate to  26,210 from  32,154 in Q2, the company's strategic financial management and modern fleet position it well to navigate these challenges. The company's focus on debt reduction and share buybacks over dividends suggests a long-term growth strategy that could yield significant returns for investors.The company's revenue is heavily tied to the global oil industry, and fluctuations in oil supply and demand can directly impact its profitability. This commodity price risk means that a drop in oil prices could reduce the demand for oil transportation, leading to lower revenues for Scorpio Tankers which is predicted by Scorpio in their latest earnings.Furthermore, the company's significant debt load, a portion of which is subject to floating interest rates, exposes it to interest rate risk. Should interest rates rise, Scorpio Tankers could see its interest expenses increase substantially, affecting its profitability and ability to service its debt. The company also faces regulatory risk as the shipping industry is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. Changes in these regulations could necessitate major capital expenditures, potentially impacting Scorpio Tankers' financial performance. Operational risks, inherent to the shipping industry, include potential accidents, piracy, and environmental disasters, which could lead to significant costs, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liabilities. Finally, the cyclical nature of the shipping industry and its susceptibility to global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in seaborne trade patterns create market risk for Scorpio Tankers. Downturns in the shipping cycle could decrease demand for the company's services and put downward pressure on shipping rates, which could potentially impact revenues.With all of this information on dividends, , stock buy backs and overall strong market tail winds. How do we value STNG not only against the overall market but also against some of it's peers  From a dividend perspective, STNG is trading slightly higher than their 4Y average of 1.97  at an estimated FWD rate of 2.11 . It is the lowest among its peers, especially when you add in INSW's special dividends that don't show up in their yield in the TTM or Fwd. But they also have a low payout ratio, so as they finish up deleveraging, and as their stock rises to a point they feel matches their NAV they will likely begin to focus more on dividends and less on stock buybacks. I imagine that target NAV valuation is around the  52- 55 mark, and I expect them to continue to have large stock buybacks below that price. Delving into the Price to Earnings ratio, Scorpio Tankers stands out with a trailing twelve months  P E ratio of 3.27, the lowest among its peers. This can be attributed to its relatively high debt load, as evidenced by its EV Market Cap ratios. This ratio provides a snapshot of a company's financial situation, encompassing debt, cash, and market value. STNG's position towards the higher end of this industry ratio suggests its financial strength may be less robust compared to competitors like INSW and DHT.However, the future looks promising for STNG. I anticipate that as the company manages its debt more effectively and harnesses the industry-wide earnings momentum to boost its cash reserves, it will be better capitalized. This improved financial health should enable the company to provide increased returns to its investors and drive a non-linear return, especially if Spot Charter Rates stay elevated. In my view, Scorpio Tankers Inc. represents an attractive investment opportunity, especially in terms of its Net Asset Value. Given the high valuations of ships and STNG's relatively new fleet, I believe purchasing its shares at any price below  57 represents good value. If the price drops below  40, it would be a highly attractive investment.It's important to remember, though, that the market is cyclical and can be significantly influenced by geopolitical events, which can quickly shift price targets. While this price target isn't high relative to the current prices levels. I like to set low Price Targets that I believe afford optimum risk reward ratios rather than pie in the sky valuations that companies will struggle to grow in to. Scorpio Tankers Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, strategic debt management, active share repurchase program, modern fleet, and low fleet to EV valuation.

"Albemarle, Livent move lower as Piper Sandler cuts on lithium supply/demand woes","Albemarle   in Wednesday's trading as Piper Sandler downgraded the lithium producer to Neutral from Overweight with a  155 price target,  100 lower than its previous PT, citing challenges in electric vehicle manufacturing and demand that may  significantly degrade  lithium's supply andLivent   as Piper analyst Charles Neivert also lowered the stock to Neutral with a  19 PT, cut from  33, although Deutsche Bank separately upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, seeing an attractive entry point following a 30 -plus decline since early June.Neivert said widespread downstream issues for the lithium due to slowing EV demand growth driven by macroeconomic factors and product issues within the OEMs and a relatively faster rate of lithium supply growth  will take the lithium market to a balanced to long situation vs. estimates of a decidedly short situation as recently as six months ago,  thus  lithium prices may remain under pressure and earnings growth may suffer.The risk reward profile for the two lithium producers has  dramatically shifted downward as a combination of rapidly expanding new capacity collides with slowing demand growth of the EV sector,  Neivert wrote.ETF  ",10,2023-10-25T12:27:26.000-04:00
Vale: Buy On Higher For Longer Iron Ore Prices,"Vale  has been range bound for the better part of 3 years driven by investor skepticism surrounding the future of China steel demand and the residential construction crises despite consistently high IO  iron ore  prices. IVale is one of the largest seaborne IO miners with the bulk of sales going to China. As such the price setters are Chinese steel companies and their demand for IO has been thought to be greatly dependentThere are 4 reasons to forecast higher for longer IO pricesThis means that the seaborn IO miners have entered maturity with a few resounding caveats, there main client depends on them, there are scant substitutes for exported iron ore and the Chinese steel sector can take share from other steel makers via pricing. In essence the iron ore miners are in symbiotic existence with the Chinese steel sector.Thus, the key to Vale fundamentals is the health and peculiarity of the Chinese steel sector. As with the case for many Chinese companies, the creation of shareholder value may not be a priority. Employ and produce is more relevant. As long as the steel companies can run production at near breakeven  with plenty of govt subsidies  they will make steel products for China and export the rest. The exports prices can and have been highly competitive, perhaps predatory or dumping but that's the operating model.Vale and the Australian IO miners see peak China steel production in sight and should limit capacity expansion or perhaps begin to reduce. This is similar to what many oil companies are doing, rationalizing capex, attempting to balance supply with demand and maintaining reasonable prices that permit very healthy FCF and dividend payouts i.e. capital discipline.China is 50  of global steel capacity  1bn tons  and it consumes most of the seaborn IO, about 85 . Thus, as real estate construction demand fell and continues to decline  massive over building  China steel companies will export and displace share in any market without high import barriers.Below are my estimates of the seaborne IO balance between supply and demand. There are many drivers and moving parts. Fundamental to seaborne IO demand is that Chinese steel output remains near peak or near capacity while its primary suppliers do not add significant capacity. Note that I assume global steel demand grows at half a percent in 2024 and 1  in 2025, any move higher means greater IO imbalance.The Chinese Steel sector is large and divers, I found data and consensus estimates for 9 companies. One of the largest is Baoshan with 50m ton capacity  5  of total .Contrary to headlines, the sample group, seems to be weathering the real estate construction sector decline well. Revenue and EBITDA has fallen up to 1Q23 and now turned positive in 2Q23. Steel prices seem to have stabilized at above US 500mt with the ratio to iron ore prices at 5x  4x is thought to be healthy . Balance sheets seem to be in good shape with leverage under control.The market, as judged by consensus estimates, seems to have a favorable outlook for the sector with over 20  upside and a significant EBITDA rebound in YE24. The demand side dynamics for iron ore looks robust or at least better than in YE22 and YE23.Vale compares well on fundamentals vs. its peer group of IO miners such as BHP  and Rio Tinto . We see similar growth and margin profile but at a lower valuation due primarily to lower business risk on product diversification and country risk i.e. Australia vs Brazil.The stock is cheap vs peers and relative to FCF generation and dividend payout trading at 3.7x EV EBITDA and 6.2x PE on YE24 consensus estimates. The US 16.5 price target is based on a 4.2x EV EBITDA target multiple, below peers such as Rio Tinto and BHP, which have a slightly lower risk profile as Australian companies.Vale is a BUY on positive IO price dynamics supported by Chinese steel exports which drives significant free cash flow and dividends share buy backs. The stocks valuation is discounted vs peers which further supports a possible re-rate and 25  upside potential.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"PDI: Complete Devastation, Massive Income","  is a closed-end mutual fund, or CEF, that seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. The fund is actively managed by portfolio managers Joshua AndersonThe fund has some interesting holdings in its top 10, and that has led to some uncertainty, but after the most recent decline in shares down to  15.67, you can now buy and . Assuming the dividend is paidMake no mistake, income stocks have been crushed, but this is a name we were waiting for  16, and now we are below that level. For the long-term investor, now is the time to buy in our opinion.Let's be honest. That PDI chart is disgusting. If it was not for management and the shifting of holdings for income, we would likely be short  If this chart was one of a stock, we would be pretty bearish. However, the payout is simply so good, even if it were to be cut, PDI is just an income machine. While countless other investors have lost money on paper, we are picking up their slack.We now are wanting to come into the fund. Enough is enough here. While you can earn 5  in a bond or money market with no risk, but taking on some risk, you can collect over 3 times that with PDI. We like PDI as it invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities, including government and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and other debt instruments. The fund also has the flexibility to invest across various fixed income sectors, which allows the aforementioned fund managers to seek opportunities in different parts of the bond market.Now, the price of PDI has dropped in recent weeks with a surge in rates. To us, this is opportunity, despite expected short-term pressure. It is down due to fear over the leverage, as management uses leverage to enhance potential returns. This means that the fund borrows money to invest in additional securities, and the borrowing rates are only getting more expensive. The fear is further that it will hurt income. PDI is over 40  levered on its net asset value benchmarks, and is mostly doing so through reverse repos. That said, we like the port and the ability to shift it.As of the end of the last reporting period, PDI's portfolio was allocated to 70  U.S. investments, 5  in the UK, and the remaining in emerging markets, while 25  of the securities are invested in non-agency backed mortgages instruments. While the company does have nearly 1900 holdings, here is the look at the top 10 as of 2 week agoSo the holdings are many and diverse, but you get an idea of the major holdings above. Generally speaking, the company is invested in debt obligations and other income-producing securities. We did mention the mortgage-backed securities, but they also invest heavily in investment grade, and high-yield corporate dent, as well as in both developed and emerging markets' corporate and sovereign bonds. As of the end of the last reporting period the company had  4.7 billion in assets.So why is PDI fund getting crushed  It is all about the surge in rates, folks. You see, it is not just the so-called competition from bonds  savings accounts  money markets. There is certainly some fixed income competition happening, but the surge in rates has crushed a ton of income names. While some may have been telling you to buy for many months, we had been hesitant, saving you capital depreciation pain, even if it is on paper. Now we see the fund as a buy, as the income is just too good.But, the current economic environment is certainly a headwind for PDI's underlying assets. This is because PDI has an average portfolio maturity ranging from zero to eight years. With the rapid surge in rates  and, of course, the decline in the principal , the pressure is on the holdings, and as such, the value of the fund. At this point however we have very little concern over the bountiful payout. The investments made by the fund pay big time, which is why you get a bountiful monthly dividend and special dividends over time. Hold your nose and buy this for income.Why  Despite the carnage, PDI has a long history of providing its investors with very high level of income. Folks, this is not going to change, and with the sale happening, you need to take advantage. Scale into the fund in  0.50 increments from here. The investment will pay off. Readers, keep in mind that the fund has paid a monthly dividend for over 20 years now, and as we mentioned, it has also paid special dividends. The 16.4  payout is simply a very attractive yield, over 3 times that of most fixed income options. Of course, there is risk.But folks, do your due diligence. This is a quick pick for income, and one that we have looked at more in depth at our investing group, but the fact is that PDI is a very complex fund. It really is important to understand the risks involved before investing. First there is PDI's use of leverage, which can and does amplify gains, but can also magnify near-term losses. PDI is very sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions than a non-leveraged fund, and given the spike in rates, you have seen the value of the fund plummet to these buyable levels in the  15 range. Further this is a closed-end fund and, given the supply and demand for buying the shares, may trade at a premium or discount to the fund's net asset value. Right now, it is on sale. There is also credit risk because PDI invests in a variety of fixed income securities, including some that are issued by lower-credit quality borrowers, so there is risk of default.With that said, we think that PDI is a good option for further research and for investors who are looking for a high level of income. There is risk, and you have to be ok with the leverage, interest rate sensitivity, and credit risk, but the fund makes big money. You can see shares go to a penny in 6 years, but as long as the dividends keep getting paid  they should  you will make your entire investment back in dividends in just 6 years. Everything after that is simply gravy.So what do you think  Are you a reluctant shareholder  Have you been buying for months, or will this be your first purchase.

Tesla: My Long-Term Bull Thesis (Rating Upgrade),"A few days ago, I was in a discussion with a friend about his recent   stock acquisition and told him I thought he would likely be quite happy with his purchase a decadeAs much as I am quite bullish on their long-term prospects, when I wrote  on Tesla in April, I was hesitant to place a buy rating because of a combination of their margin contraction  and our . However, with the  providing significant , Tesla's shortTesla produces electric vehicles, solar panels and roof tiles, and battery storage systems. They are a leading developer of self-driving software, and have expanded into machine learning with the development of their own supercomputer . They maintain operations in the United States, China, and internationally. The company was founded in 2003 and and is currently headquartered in Austin, Texas.Tesla maintains an Automotive segment, and an Energy Generation and Storage segment. Their Automotive segment offers electric vehicles and ancillary products and services. This segment includes their network of Superchargers and service locations, in-app upgrades and mobile services, financing and leasing services, and warranties and extended service plans.Their Energy Generation and Storage segment provides photovoltaic generation, storage products, and related services. It maintains a website as well as stores and galleries, and also reaches customers through a network of channel partners. They offer various financing options to their solar customers.The global electric vehicle  EV  market is projected to have a  until 2030. The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to have a  through 2032. The global electric vehicle charging station market is projected to have a  until 2033. The energy storage market is projected to have a  through 2028. The global photovoltaic market is projected have a  during the forecast period.Tesla is in the process of improving its capabilities on multiple fronts. They have been working toward full self-driving  FSD  for many years. As part of this effort,  at their AI Day event on August 19, 2021.As progress continues on establishing superior reliability and safety capabilities, it will eventually become clear that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers. Once a certain statistical threshold has been met, insurance companies are going to be willing to offer lower rates to drivers who use proven autonomous driving software.What I believe frequently gets overlooked is the pressure this will place on entities who operate large fleets of vehicles. They will be financially incentivized to transition to autonomous capable vehicles. While most of the auto industry has been working toward  of autonomous driving, Tesla has a capability . If insurance companies are willing to offer users of Tesla's software better rates, this will incentivize Tesla's competition to manufacture vehicles which are capable of running a variety of software packages.Their Autopilot has access to more raw data than any of their competitors. This gives them a significant lead on reaching full capability more quickly than any other autonomous driving software provider.We could witness an era where it's common for people to buy a new Ford , General Motors , or Stellantis  vehicle equipped with Tesla's autonomous driving software. This may also produce an industry of third party entities which convert vehicles to be capable of using Tesla's software. Eventually, any capability gap should close for those of their competitors who continue developing their own software packages, so this period may only last a few years. However, the trend of vehicles being manufactured with multi-software capability may continue even after the gap closes. Being able to purchase a vehicle capable of using a variety of self-driving software packages may eventually become standard.While I am not clear as to when this threshold will be crossed. The idea that Tesla might find themselves with a much larger market for their software than their own vehicles is extremely appealing. The pressure would have to be significant for the other auto manufacturers to make the switch. If the discounts the insurance companies are handing out are not deep enough, we may not see an adoption or we may only experience a partial adoption.Tesla is well positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in our energy grid. The  is the most dominant factor at play when examining long-term energy infrastructure trends.When photovoltaics reached the status of  several years ago, additional renewable capacity seems inevitable. However, the adoption of intermittent sources warps the daily supply and demand curve for wholesale electricity. This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve. Excessive overproduction from solar will damage portions of the grid. This problem is severe enough that it is already common to disconnect portions of commercial scale capacity during the middle of the day. I went into further detail about how this is affecting long-term trends related to our grid in my recent .Tesla sits in a unique situation where they are involved in both grid scale storage as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In places where a portion of the grid is supplied by photovoltaics, storage providers are able to collect free or almost-free electricity in the middle of the day while the grid is overproducing. This electricity can later be sold back into the market in the evening when they are at their highest.With the electricity collected at no cost, or almost no cost, the margins for such an operation are a function of the sheer volume one can manage divided by the maintenance costs for the batteries. This means that storage providers are incentivized to gain access to as much overproduction as possible. Over the next several decades, I believe the electricity arbitrage industry has the potential to scale with the mass adoption of solar and will become incredibly lucrative. Although it's still far too early to tell how this situation will develop, Tesla is currently well positioned to become a major player in this emerging industry.Their Autobidder continues to find opportunities in Australia, Texas, California, and the UK. The company cites the clear advantages of growing their footprint, as each facility they build is expected to produce revenue for about 20 years.In 2022, their energy generation and storage segment , representing a 90  YoY increase to  1.310 billion, while the cost of revenues stands at  1.151 billion. This gives it a gross margin of 9.26 . According to a , Autobidder has made over  330 million in trading revenues since inception.Tesla's most recent earnings call spoke of several long-term projects they have in the works. They covered developments with the Cybertruck, which they plan to launch later this year, and also mentioned continued efforts toward developing a robotaxi. They are pleased about the adoption of the North American Charging Standard. Overall, things have been going well for them in recent months.Their forward looking statements indicate that they expect Q3 to have lower revenue due to scheduled upgrades causing down-time through the summer months.Tesla's  has been growing at an impressive rate. In 2013 they had an annual revenue of  2,013.5M. By 2022, that had grown to  81,462M. This represents a total increase of 3945.8  at an average annual rate of 438.4 .Their annual margins have been improving over the last several years. As of the most recent annual report, gross margins were 25.60 , EBITDA margins were 21.41 , operating margins were 16.81 , and net margins were 15.41 .Like many growing companies, Tesla has been diluting to help fund expansion. Total common shares outstanding was at 1,846.4M in 2013  by the end of 2022 that rose to 3,164M. This represents a 71.4  rise in share count, which comes out to an average annual rate of 7.93 . Over that same time period, operating income rose from - 61.3M to  13,692M. Because it has come with significant improvements to income, I view this dilution as accretive.Their debt situation has been improving over the last several years. As of the 2022 annual report, they had  106M in net interest expense, total debt was  5,748M, and long-term debt was  1,029M.As of this most recent annual report, cash and equivalents was  16,253M, operating income was  13,692M, EBITDA was  17,439M, net income was  12,556M, unlevered free cash flow was  4,327.5M, and levered free cash flow was  4,208.1M.Their total equity has been growing quite quickly.Annual returns have also been improving. As of the most recent annual report ROIC was 24.31 , ROCE was 17.64 , and ROE was at 27.36 .Their quarterly financials are showing significant revenue growth over the last two years. Eight quarters ago Tesla had a quarterly revenue of  11,958M. Four quarters ago that had grown to  16,934M. By this most recent quarter that had grown to  24,927M. This represents a total two-year rise of 108.4  at an average quarterly rate of 13.6 .Their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters. As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 18.19 , EBITDA margins were 14.25 , operating margins were 9.62 , and net margins were at 10.84 .Their dilution rate appears to have dropped in more recent quarters. The sum of their last eight quarters of dilution comes to 7.32  over the last four quarters this has dropped to 1.63 .Their debt situation is improving. This most recent quarter, Tesla had  210M in net interest expense, total debt was at  5811M, and long-term debt was at  504M.Their quarterly cash flow is inconsistent. As of the most recent earnings report, cash and equivalents were  15,296M, quarterly operating income was  2,399M, EBITDA was  3553M, net income was  2,703M, unlevered free cash flow was  894.4M, and levered free cash flow was  876.9M.When viewed on a quarterly basis, their total equity continues to rise.Their returns are trending in a similar pattern with their margins. As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 4.66 , ROCE was 2.81 , and ROE was 5.18 .As of October 11th, 2023, Tesla had a market capitalization of  836.73B and traded for  262.99 per share. They do not pay a dividend, so using their  of 91.03x, and their  of 19.72 , I calculated a PEGY of 4.616x and an Inverted PEGY of 0.2166x. As the PEGY value is well above 1, this implies the company is presently significantly overvalued.However, TSLA has a history of trading at elevated valuations. They are currently trading with an EV EBITDA of 48.73x. When viewing their EV EBITDA over the last 5 years, it's clear that its present valuation is historically not as overvalued as it has reached in the past.Tesla faces a large number of competitors. A majority of the already established auto manufacturers on the planet are developing or already producing their own EV's and alternative fuel vehicles. This developing industry has also attracted a significant number of speculative startups. Because of Tesla's first mover advantage, and the time it will take to develop a viable product from nothing, I expect that the effects of this increasing competitive pressure will come on gradually.Autonomous driving may take longer to reach full maturity than they expect. Progress is expected to continue on its logistic growth curve, with most of the easy breakthroughs having already been made. The company already has a viable product, but they need a huge amount of additional data and time to fine tune it and make further safety and reliability improvements. It will likely be difficult to tell when they have actually crossed above the threshold where their FSD software can be called  fully mature.As always with innovators, Tesla runs the risk of overspending to stay relevant. Developing their own hardware and software for machine learning may end up costing more than they expect, or not be as profitable as they project. The push to develop A.I. is spawning development across the industry, and Tesla is merely one of many companies working on their own projects. While I believe the decision to move into machine learning was good for the long-term health of the company, it's always possible the additional cost of joining the first movers will not be worth the benefits.Tesla faces several catalysts, most of which are not near term. Tesla has cut prices several times earlier this year. This should produce additional demand and help them capture market share. Tesla has been normalizing electric vehicle use  at some point we will cross the threshold where it's more normal culturally to drive an electric or alternative fuel vehicle than a gasoline or diesel.Tesla's overall engineering quality is extremely high. Tesla is several generations into EV development and their design philosophy has them continuously making performance improvements. For a specific example of what I am referencing, YouTube has videos of Sandy Munro comparing the thermal systems of the Mach-E and the Model Y. They are eye-opening.As stated above, I believe demand for their FSD software will increase once the insurance providers are willing to offer discounts. Organizations which maintain fleets of vehicles will have to justify not transitioning to the cheaper option. This is likely to affect everyone from car rental companies and taxi services, to government employees and utility vehicles. Demand for FSD may also spur their competition into producing vehicles which are capable of using Tesla's driverless software.Tesla is joining several others in the . These types of batteries are significantly cheaper than the Li-ion we are all accustomed to. Tesla already operates a grid scale energy . The dramatic cost savings of Iron-Air batteries makes them a disruptive technology. Our electric grid currently requires a significant contribution from base load providers. As we increase its storage capacity, I believe the bargaining power the base load providers currently have will diminish as most of the negotiating power will shift to the storage providers.Also, storage providers will experience sustained tailwinds from the continued adoption of solar as they profit from . Because of their dramatically lower cost of production, the adoption of iron-air batteries should both lower cost of expansion and improve margins for their energy storage division.Tesla achieves rather high margins for a manufacturer. As producers in other industries realize that the reason Tesla is achieving superior margins and return on capital is due to their preference for automated manufacturing, the demand for Tesla-style facilities should rise. The company could eventually open a subsidiary which establishes automated manufacturing facilities for other companies.Normally, I refuse to place buy ratings on any company this overvalued. However, I believe the current UAW strike will provide continued tailwinds for Tesla, Inc.'s share price as it continues. Add to this the fact that they have a history of achieving unreasonably high valuations and its present valuation becomes less of a concern. This is one of the few occasions where I am willing to hand out a buy rating on a ticker when I am unable to clearly see that it's trading below its intrinsic value. I believe Tesla has unrecognized long-term growth potential, so it potentially may have a hidden margin of safety.Overall, Tesla, Inc. appears to be an extremely attractive investment because of their culture of adaptation and innovation. While I cannot guarantee that their current endeavors will lead to future moats, they have already established themselves as a premier EV producer and have the potential to find themselves with multiple high margin revenue streams. Although their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters, they have proven they are capable of producing attractive returns.I believe Tesla stock is likely to become the long-term compounder that its present investors hope it will be. So even if buying at today's prices ends up being a lackluster entry in the short or medium term, long-term Tesla, Inc. shareholders are unlikely to be punished for it.

The Catalysts Are Building For Bitcoin,"In this article, I'm going to provide an update on the catalysts that are driving the tremendous upward momentum in the Bitcoin  price. However, each of these comes with risks that could cause Bitcoin price to reverseI believe that these catalysts have contributed to the increasing price of Bitcoin. Furthermore, since Bitcoin's price is dependent on supply and demand dynamics, it is possible to argue that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the upcoming Bitcoin supply, the spot ETFs and increased utility will increase the demand for Bitcoin, and hence the price of Bitcoin should go up.Bitcoin is up 13.5  since I recommendedUsing Bitcoin as a back-end mechanism will serve to increase the demand for Bitcoin. Given that more financial institutions use Bitcoin as a payment rail, then these institutions will need to buy Bitcoin in order to process transactions. Block Inc.'s Cash App has integrated the Bitcoin lightning network onto Cash App and given Dorsey's comments above, I believe there is a significant chance that the company is working on a Bitcoin remittance solution.Another use-case that is evolving for Bitcoin is a so-called  sats economy . The sats economy refers to using satoshis  the smallest denomination of bitcoin  to send small tips of appreciation to others on social media. Damus used this model after it launched earlier this year, however, Apple  has forced Damus to shut this feature down during the summer . The problem with this use case is that it bypasses Apple's rules for in-app payments. This reflects the strength of the Bitcoin lightning network, but also the complete pushback it has received.For these reasons, I believe this catalyst is the weakest but also the most overlooked. Although nothing very concrete has materialized yet within the utility use case, it is likely soon to come... and if it does the scale could be vast.The payments industry comprises many large and powerful players, including Mastercard , Visa , and PayPal . How will they look upon Bitcoin as a future payment rail  Will these companies adopt the technology or build their own offering to compete against it  PayPal, for example, has a stablecoin called PAYUSD that developers are able to build new payment layers on top of. This is very similar to the Bitcoin ecosystem and directly the opposite approach that Block Inc. has taken. Instead of building on and integrating the Bitcoin network into Venmo and PayPal, the company has created its own. Actions like this could undermine the eventual increase in demand for Bitcoin.If you didn't already know, Bitcoin is set to halve in April 2024. This implies that the reward for mining one Bitcoin will be cut in half in April, effectively lowering the rate at which future supply enters the market.Historically, Bitcoin halvings have led to price increases in Bitcoin both  the halving occurs. Notice this dynamic in the image belowEvery halving has been front-run by significant price increases. This is likely due to the supply and demand effect. As more people realize that the Bitcoin halving is coming the more Bitcoin is bought, which raises the price of the asset due to higher demand. After Bitcoin halvings have occurred, the price of the asset has gone up even more dramatically in general.We are currently about five months away from the beginning of April and we've seen a very significant price increase over the past few months. Since its January lows Bitcoin has doubled and since the end of September the Bitcoin price has increased by around 35  with steep increases in the past few days.Although Bitcoin halvings in the past have historically always correlated with increases in the Bitcoin price, there is no rule that this has to be the case. One risk with looking at the historical price action of Bitcoin is that the digital currency really doesn't have a long history. Since its inception, Bitcoin has only halved three times. Why will this time be the sameThere are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs pending application   The applications are from Grayscale, 21Shares   Ark, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree  WT , Invesco  IVZ , Galaxy, Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X, Hashdex and Franklin  . These spot ETFs generally imply that investors will be able to take part in Bitcoin's price development without buying Bitcoin directly. Hence, we can think of these brokerages investment firms as distribution channels for Bitcoin. The more distribution channels Bitcoin has, the more consumers will be able to gain easy access to the digital asset. This will clearly increase the demand for Bitcoin.In fact, Galaxy estimated in a research report that inflows into a Bitcoin  ETF  could amount to  14 billion in year one,  27 billion in year two, and  39 billion in year three. Given the huge asset management industry, it is likely that asset managers begin suggesting customers allocate a small portion of their wealth into this quickly growing  digital gold .If we build upon Galaxy's logic quickly  12 spot ETFs with  14 billion in inflows in year one would result in total inflows of  168 billion during the first year. Galaxy found that the amount of Bitcoin held under management on September 30th was  21.7 billion, or 4.3  of the current supply at the time. If Galaxy's calculations are correct, the ETF adoption would imply an almost 8x increase in the amount of Bitcoin held under management with regard to monetary value. Personally, I believe that this could be a little bit of a stretch target, which the research report also admits   if Bitcoin spot ETF approvals are delayed or denied, our analysis would be altered by timing and access restriction. Or if poor price performance, or any other factor, leads to lower-than-expected access or adoption to a bitcoin ETF, our estimates could prove too aggressive.Insofar, the SEC has not accepted any of the spot Bitcoin ETFs which means that much of the Bitcoin price increase could be built upon a false sense of hope. The SEC still hasn't approved anything  citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud  . On top of this, the greed index which was mentioned in a recent Seeking Alpha news article suggests that the greed of Bitcoin-buying has reached the highest point since November 2021 .Based on the discussion of each of the three catalysts above, we can presume that if all of the catalysts fall in place around the same time, Bitcoin prices will receive strong momentum. This will likely not be the case for the utility catalyst for Bitcoin since I believe this is a long-term development that we may see as Bitcoin becomes more  built into  offerings at existing companies. However, the Bitcoin halving is certain. This catalyst is likely the strongest since it has historically always meant that Bitcoin prices will rise. If the halving event is coupled with the regulatory acceptance of spot ETFs, demand would increase  potentially by a lot as claimed by Galaxy  and the rate of supply will contract causing the price to increase.In all, I remain just as bullish on Bitcoin as a long-term investment as I did during the summer when I published my first article on the digital asset. As opposed to then, halving is nearly in sight, and the general reception of potential spot Bitcoin ETFs has been really positive. To me, these are signals that indicate that Bitcoin can continue rising, but the uncertainty of whether spot ETFs are accepted or not makes this catalyst relatively weak on its own. My belief, however, is that asset management firms are doing everything they can to influence the acceptance of these ETFs as it would give the institutions more money and a potentially broader customer base. For these reasons I rate Bitcoin a buy as a long-term investment with both short and long term catalysts on the horizon.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,"First and foremost, the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination. This article is not about politics, and it will not focus on what's right or wrong. Instead, we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent, as of this writing, are up  3 , with WTI  trading above  85 and Brent above  87. Initially, at the close of Friday, WSJ published a report noting that the U.S. is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high. Soon after, Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. If you want to thoroughly review the events, Some of you may wonder, what does this have to do with oil  Historically speaking, geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions. In this case, Israel is not a major oil producer, so what's the catch  The catch, in our view, has to do with Iran's potential involvement in this whole ordeal. WSJ published a piece noting that Iran's senior officials helped plan this attack months ago.While the U.S. has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet, it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on Iran.For starters, we need context to what we are writing. In June,  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market. Since then, IEA has confirmed via its figures that Iran's oil production is close to  3.1 million b d. Our supply   demand model assumes  3.3 million b d, and official Iranian figures support that production is around  3.3 million b d.Putting all of this together, Iran is exporting close to  2 million b d. Visible tanker exports account for  1.5 to  1.6 million b d, while shadow exports account for  400k b d.Since H2 2022, the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports. As we wrote earlier in the year, this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storage.With floating storage gone and crude exports back to  2 million b d  500 to  800k b d below the previous peak , what's the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward  Perhaps the U.S. does nothing and leaves Iran as is, but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view, while the risk of a major loss is low, we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months. We think the average would fall from  2 million b d to  1.6 million b d. In terms of visible tankers, this means Iran's crude exports would drop closer to  1.2 million b d.While it won't be much of a decline, it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into year-end and possibly well into H1 2024.Looking at our latest supply   demand update, we made a few important assumption changesIn essence, global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by month-end. And if the U.S. starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports, then our balance could surprise to the upside. But with a deficit of  2.2 million b d, the lack of production decline from Iran won't make that much of a difference, either.On the other hand, with no mega deal on the horizon  between Israel and Saudi , the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases. Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis won't be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least  110 bbl. With Brent trading at  87, we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a reality.In conclusion, global oil inventories should accelerate downward. But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession. Fund flows will ebb and flow, so oil prices won't skyrocket anytime soon. Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception. Until then, we see prices grinding higher, with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levels.For readers looking to add energy stocks, Q4 will provide ample opportunities. We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil. Consolidation and M A are heating up, so you will see more and more mergers announced. But more importantly, always remember that with these oil prices, the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist. Please be patient, fundamentals are on your side.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, .  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks.

Sibanye Stillwater Hopes To Offer A Metal Mosaic,"Sibanye Stillwater  is a South African metals company with hopes of significant expansion in the next 5 years. Through investment in both recycling and production initiatives globally, SBSW hopes to become a linchpin in the global metals market.Given its rising demand, significant investments in battery metals, especially Lithium, are critical for future growth. While electric vehicles are gaining popularity, a mix, including hybrids, will dominate the next decade, still providing tailwinds to PGM recycling and PGM mining businesses. SBSW will spend an estimated  500 million in FY23 on these expansion initiatives.Despite the challenges faced by SBSW in the short term, the company shows promising potential for long-term growth.EFV  Estimated Fair Value    E24 EPS  Earnings Per Share  times PE  Price EPSEFV   E24 EPS X P E    1.0 X 9.7   9.70P 2E PGM, containing Pt  Platinum  and Pd  Palladium , 3PGM contains Pt  Platinum  Pd  Palladium  and Rhodium  Rd . 3E is 2E plus gold. 4E is 3PGM plus gold.PGMs are not rare-earth metals, but are critical in numerous industrial components, particularly in the hydrogen and emissions management space. While fully-electric battery EVs receive the most attention, a mix of EVs, including hybrids, are needed to fulfil demand within the next decade. Light vehicle production climbs to 82.5 million units per year in FY23. The PGM market is expected to see significant demand recovery linked with the Chinese auto sales rebound expected in FY23. still originate from Russia, and there is still some uncertainty about Russia's place in the global economy. While much of Russia's PGM capacity remains unsanctioned, that could change and further affect the supply and demand dynamics of the market.American PGM operations are still ramping up, with SBSW ramping production to 700koz of 2E PGM by 2027. Short-term sustaining costs have surged amid regional flooding and a shaft collapse which caused a work stoppage, which will resume in 2H23. SBSW states this is temporary and expects leveling off of AISC by FY26 of under  990 oz. SBSW expects the American PGM segment to return to full profitability in late FY23 or in FY24 when all in sustaining costs return to normalized levels.The South African PGM operation is the largest segment by revenue and is considered mature. Currently, the segment has 4 active mines and 3 exploration operations. Expansion in this segment includes the K4 expansion to Marikana, South Africa facility. This will add 50 years of output, at an estimated 250koz per year, once full capacity is reached in FY29.SBSW PGM cost relative to peers. SBSW is highlighted in Blue.Before the acquisition of Stillwater, Sibanye was an exclusive gold producer. SBSW still seeks to streamline its operations in this area, acquiring a controlling stake in DRDGOLD   a tailings management company. SBSW will close underperforming mines to reduce capital costs and make room for new greenfield expansion. After FY23, SBSW expects the capital requirements to significantly decrease for the Gold segment, amounting to  54.7 million annually in savings due to these streamlining actions.Gold production for FY23 is expected to produce 756-788koz at an all-in sustaining cost of  1826 oz. The average realized price for 2Q23 for gold was  1864 oz.Expansion in this area is the Burnstone project, believed to be able to output 141koz per year at full capacity in FY25. Existing local infrastructure significantly reduces startup costs, with the first production output expected in 2H23. DRDGOLD is a tailings management company recovering residue metals from waste from the mine. It has a far lower sustaining cost of  1,528 oz with an annual output of 179koz. This portfolio addition could increase cash flow by  55 million per year at full production capacity in FY25.The battery metals segment encompasses Nickel, Copper, and Lithium operations. SBSW seeks to create a raw materials presence closest to regional United States and Europe ecosystems.In Finland, a concentrated 7 mine facility has been approved for mining and broke ground in March of FY23. SBSW has a 79  controlling interest in the operation and hopes to achieve 15,000 metric tons annually in FY25. The facility is concentrated on a deposit of Lithium Hydroxide which demands a price premium compared to Lithium Carbonate. The reason is extracting and refining Lithium Hydroxide is much more expensive. The current price assumption for the 15-year life of the mine is  26,034 per metric ton, with an average operating cost of  7,423 per metric ton in all in sustaining costs. Total capital expenditure, less sustaining capital, is expected to be  650 million. This has the chance to be a highly profitable venture in a strategic area close to numerous battery factories in Europe.The Sandouville Nickel Refinery was acquired with 100  controlling interest in FY22. The facility is designed to refine 16,000 tons of nickel and 600 tons of Cobalt. This location is strategically close to a site set to be France's first gigafactory, built and operated by Verkor in a partnership with Renault. SBSW invested  27.5 million in the gigafactory as well.Rhyolite Ridge in the United States is a lithium-boron project in Nevada. The project has a nameplate capacity of 22,000 metric tons annually, assuming an average price of  13,000 per metric ton for Lithium and  710 per metric ton for Boron. SBSW has pledged to contribute funding in exchange for 50  interest conditional to permitting approval. The permitting environment for lithium exploration has become more favorable in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, with the Department of Energy offering a loan of  700 million. The project has attracted large names, including the Toyota and Panasonic JV, Ford, and South Korean battery maker Eco Pro. Ford has committed to take 35  of production from FY25-FY30.The top two risks facing SBSW in the short term are labor disputes and South African power infrastructure.Numerous disruptions in FY22 caused by South African workers protesting poor working conditions and low wages. While these have settled, SBSW could be at risk of disruption again once the contract is up for renegotiation in FY25.The South African power company ESKOM has been plagued with fuel supply problems, sabotage, and aging components. This has caused them to embark on a program of  load shedding,  turning off power after peak hours. Mining, smelting, and refining consume roughly 30  of ESKOM's net power output. Thus, ESKOM, on top of load shedding, has increased power prices by 20 . In the medium term, ESKOM will remain a primary power supplier to the SA Mining segments. ESKOM expects load shedding to ramp up through FY23, which could result in 15  production losses. At the end of FY24, SBSW expects enough private-sector electricity generation to eliminate load shedding for the mining industry. To this effect, SBSW has acquired the largest solar farm in South Africa, set to enter initial production in FY25 with 89MW in nameplate capacity.Underpinning these is ongoing political instability in South Africa. While SBSW is quickly diversifying out of South Africa, it is still a South African company. We will likely see some form of price action after the .Lithium demand will grow by . There will be a 55  gap between supply and demand for Lithium at the current global capacity. The story is similar but not as grim for nickel, with an 8  gap between supply and demand. This fact will put upward pressure on the prices of nickel and Lithium as the decade continues. Additionally, PGM metals in use with existing non-battery EVs and traditional ICE vehicles will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Even at an aggressive growth assumption, EVs of all types are not expected to pass 40  market share Despite lower-than-expected output in FY22 and 1H23, the foundations for significant long-term growth are in place. SBSW has a very strong balance sheet, with only a reported 0.14x debt to adjusted EBITDA and around  630 million in free cash flow. Additionally, it pays out a sector high 8.54  yield targeting 35  of earnings paid out to shareholders.SBSW is undergoing a transformative effort to broaden global holdings and cut stalling operations. For this reason, we think it is attractive at its current price for the dividend investors.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy The Big Dip In The Utility Sector With 9.8% Yield: UTF,"Have you ever heard the saying,  all theories are great... in theory  The truth is that most theories or ideas rarely play out as pre-planned or expected. The cold harshness of reality can wreak havocMovements in the stock market can be viewed as a series of competing theories or ideas that collide around companies or sectors. Some view bond alternatives as terrible investments when rates rise, while others view them as excellent companies now trading at more attractive prices - perspectives and theories crashing into each other.The reality is that an excellently run company can rapidly see its price decline due to no other fact than investors with a herd mentality following a popular theory or viewpoint.The utility sector has been hit hard recently, crashingWe've already seen several utility names adjust their growth outlooks due to higher costs of capital. Infrastructure is often expensive to build, and building new infrastructure is usually funded in large part by debt. Almost any infrastructure investment can be characterized as providing a large amount of upfront capital and then collecting a very long-term income stream. Higher interest rates make building new infrastructure less appealing, so less is built.Meanwhile, higher interest rates also impact the present value of existing income streams. Investing  100 million to receive  7 million year for decades sounded like a great deal just two years ago. Today, it isn't because interest rates are higher.So, I won't call the market crazy for selling utilities in the near term. Growth is going to be slower, and the cost of capital is making it difficult for utilities to grow while making the present value of future cash flows lower.I will say it is very short-sighted. There are two sides to every economic transaction - supply and demand. One party provides something, and another wants something. The price of the transaction is determined by the interaction between the two. What happens if utilities slow expansion  There is less electricity, and the supply is lower. Is demand going to decline as well  Not likely. Whether interest rates are 1 , 5 , 10 , or 30 , living without electricity is not a solution that many are likely to pursue. Economics 101  What happens when supply is low and demand is high  Prices go up. Rising prices are good for those who are on the supply side of the equation.We can already see this with oil companies. Oil prices are more reactive to supply changes, which is why oil companies are doing very well despite higher capital costs while other utilities have been struggling.The price of electricity is going up. And as the expansion of electric supply slows down, it is only going to go higher. When gas prices go up, you see it at the pump fairly quickly, and it is very common to see the price of gas at your favored station change daily. Electric companies generally are not allowed to increase prices month to month. Your bill will vary primarily based on how much electricity you consume monthly. In most jurisdictions, prices will be raised  or lowered  once a year with government approval. As with all bureaucratic processes, it takes time  the authorities will often push back against the raises requested, but eventually, nobody can fight the economic reality of supply and demand. Attempts to do so lead to unpleasant things like rolling brownouts.Infrastructure investments like electric companies have been dealing with pressures from higher rates and delays from benefiting from inflation, and the supply demand balance is looking very favorable for them. , yielding 10 , is one great option to invest in today.  holds a portfolio that is 33  electric, 11  midstream, along with a host of other infrastructure-style investments like toll roads, freight rails, gas distribution, cell towers, airports, etc. These are the things that we take for granted when living in first-world countries. They make our daily lives possible, and we sure would notice if they disappearedLike some other Cohen   Steers funds, UTF made the wise decision to implement interest rate swaps - fixing 85  of its leverage at an average rate of only 1.8 .Infrastructure investments are down, but they aren't out. They will continue to be great sources of cash flow and an essential part of our daily lives. UTF is well-positioned to ride out this turbulence while paying out a hefty dividend.Investors have many different avenues that they can use to benefit from utilities or infrastructure being sold off due to high interest rates. If you're an investor who does not want to have to play the game of figuring out which specific company to hold or which will be the best to see the strongest recovery, one fantastic option is UTF  Not only do you receive monthly dividends that give an annual yield of 9.8 , but you're also exposed to a number of companies that are heavily oversold, as well as gaining access to a fantastic management team that has a history of routinely raising the fund's dividends because they are out earning what they're paying. This is a definitive win-win for investors.When it comes to your retirement, there are not going to be many things in your life that are automatically paying you more each year. Many of your bills are going to expect you to pay them more every single year. Your Social Security will typically have an annual cost of living adjustment designed to only help you keep pace with inflation, but not to help you get ahead. Having a portfolio filled with income investments that are providing you with outstanding income and giving you the ability to reinvest some of that income back into your portfolio to see additional growth is going to be what allows you to continue to see wealth development even in your twilight years.Retirement isn't the sound of a funeral dirge. It should be a sound celebration  The sound of celebration is as unique as the situation. Whether it's spending extra time with loved ones, jumping in a truck hauling a 5th wheel trailer and being able to see all the beauty that the world has to offer, or simply staying at home with a crackling fireplace, enjoying a cup of tea and reminiscing with friends and family - whatever a beautiful and satisfying retirement looks like to you, it's possible if you have the financial security that's provided by owning dozens of different income-producing holdings.That's the beauty of my Income Method.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks  Archer-Daniels-Midland . The company, which just reported its quarterly numbers, is doing extremely well. It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds, including strong secular growth in biofuels.In thisSo, let's get to itRoughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I highlighted the company's massive footprint in the agriculture industry.Listed in 1924, the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42,000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations, allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview, the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery stores.This includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions, which account for the biggest part of the company's revenue.In the United States, Archer-Daniels-Midland is the third-largest producer of ethanol, according to .With this in mind, earlier this week, major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good position.The bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth, driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policies.As one can imagine, this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers, who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sector.As biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation, various biobased feedstocks, including agricultural crops and animal-derived products, are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and net-zero emissions by 2050.Like many people, I am not a fan of using  food  to produce fuel, but in light of global energy policies, my opinion doesn't matter.Furthermore, while corn-based ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  and Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS  in the mid-2000s, there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks, driven by the growth of renewable diesel production.Meanwhile, increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil, as well as soybean and canola oil, further used in renewable diesel.This shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023.Adding to that, the new Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  provides tax credits to the biofuels industry, extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuels.In this light, during last year's JP Morgan All-Stars Conference, the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels, with strong biodiesel margins, high demand for ethanol, and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants, which confirms the trends noticed by ING.The company also mentioned the start-up of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota, which will add 1.5 million tons of capacity, focusing on low-carbon intensity feedstocks.Furthermore, the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide low-carbon emissions power.In the third quarter, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of  1.63, accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of  1.5 billion.Notably, this quarter's results contributed to an outstanding year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of  5.62, making it the second-best EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally, ADM's trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 13.2 , which reflects the company's consistent strength in this environment.ADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market, where opportunities and challenges coexist, which makes it challenging for traders and investors.Consumer behavior trends vary across categories, impacting spending.Issues also include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and fluctuating commodity supply and demand.Despite these challenges, ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved year-to-date, with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total company.With that in mind, ADM's different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwinds.During its earnings call, the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork, which is something I already briefly mentioned.In 2023, ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network, partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable, sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo , Nestle, and Carlsberg.The company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025, equivalent to powering over 100,000 homes annually.ADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project, contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for  greener  fuels.The company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9x, which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their long-term strategic agenda and return capital to shareholders.It enjoys a credit rating of  A .ADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates full-year EPS in excess of  7 per share.Based on that context, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently pays a  0.45 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to  1.80 per year. It implies a 26  2023E earnings payout ratio, which is extremely healthy.The dividend yield is 2.5 .ADM is attractively valued. As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below, the normalized P E ratio is 14.6x, which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decades.Now, the company is trading at 9.5x earnings. That's the lowest valuation since the great financial crisis.Even if earnings moderate in the next few years  analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years , the stock is significantly undervalued.A return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18  annual returns through 2025.The current consensus price target is  97, which is 38  above the current price.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. I believe that ADM has a fair value between  100 and  110, which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four years.Archer-Daniels-Midland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector. The booming biofuel industry, supported by evolving government policies, presents a significant growth opportunity for ADM.Their diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sources.ADM's strong financial performance, improved earnings outlook, and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment. With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation, ADM could offer investors an 18  annual return through 2025.Hence, I maintain my belief in ADM's fair value between  100 and  110, which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four years.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

The Most Common Misconception About REIT Investing In This Environment,"As many of my readers have probably noticed, lately, I have paid a very close attention to the REIT balance sheets and debt financing structures.I think that restrictive interest rates for a long period of timeEveryone who has invested a bit of his or her time into exploring how equity REITs work, understands that the chances of finding the next Nvidia or Apple by picking any REIT out there are extremely slim.Instead, REIT-focused investors can play a more balanced and predictable game, which is underpinned by to a large extent a predictable business model and cash generation profile.REITs per definition  regulation  have to devise a  buy and hold  strategy, where a notable portion of the collected cash flows  rents or leases  have to be regularly distributed to the shareholders.The main ways how REITs can increase the cash flows are the followingBesides increasing the rents   leases organically or conducting non-core activities such as positive debt refinancing, the key essence of REIT business is to capture a positive spread between asset  or investment  IRR and the cost of capital.If the spread widens, REITs are deep in the money.If the spread remains stable, REITs deliver stable and positive results.If the spread decreases, REITs fall.Since the early 2022, the overall cost of financing has gradually increased, sending the broader REIT index in a negative return territory.One might argue that this decline is mostly explained by the struggling office sector and if the office segment was excluded, the remaining REIT space would be in a nice position relative to the early 2022.Well, not exactly right. In the chart above, we can see some of the most popular REITs operating outside of the realm of office segment, and that have still delivered returns, which are significantly below the S P 500.All in all, the key message here is that REITs are extremely sensitive to the changes in the interest rate levels, as any movement in the cost of capital makes a huge impact on the underlying cash generation profile.In most of my recent articles, I have incorporated a huge skew towards assessing the potential implications of higher cost of capital.Why  Because I think that the  higher for longer  scenario and higher interest rates in general embody a significant potential to destroy huge chunks of FFO for many REITs out there.The following are the main avenues through which this risk is most likely set to render a painful impactOtherwise, at this stage, REITs are protected from additional headwinds that are associated with higher cost of capital as the effects from unhedged floating debt instruments have already been reflected in the latest financials.In my view, refinancings at higher interest rates is the most critical issue.Let me depict the  via one very common REIT  Realty Income Corporation .Currently, O has around  6.5 billion of debt  excluding the floating portion and the assumption of organic dept repayment  that has to be refinanced by 2026.As of Q2, 2023, O had a weighted average cost of financing at 3.7 , which is considerably below the market level financing cost.Looking at the prevailing YTM of some of the O's outstanding bonds, we get an average cost of financing around 6.4   72  of an increase .If we assign the prevailing cost of financing level to the maturing debt proceeds until 2026  i.e., reprice according to the market level , O's FFO would decrease by    175 million or by 6  taking TTM FFO as a basis. This, in turn, would send the FFO payout ratio higher to 80  level.If we take a more extreme scenario and reprice all of the remaining  12 billion to the 6.4  interest rate level, the effects would be very severe, impairing O's long-term growth prospects. In other words, completely justifying the recent price decline.Remember that via this example we see the potential consequences for a REIT, which has an upper investment grade credit rating, relatively well-laddered debt maturity profile, and a significant scale, which introduces flexibility in the financing processes. For many REITs the debt situation looks much worse.Finally, we come to the point, where I want to emphasize a very popular misconception in the context of REITs and the potential consequences of higher interest rates.The challenge stems from the misunderstanding of the rate of change effects. More specifically, many REIT investors carry a concept that REITs are a natural hedge of the inflation due to the rents   leases that adjust to the inflation levels accordingly.This coupled with the generally correct fact that many REITs exhibit favourable supply and demand dynamics - especially now when building new supply has become very expensive - leads to an opinion that the growing interest costs will be easily offset by a synchronized movement in the top line.As a result, many REIT investors have become overly complacent and do not fully appreciate the potential consequences.Now, my argument is that while all this is correct, it does not really move the needle in the context of surging interest expenses.Since the early 2022, O has managed to deliver a superb growth in its top-line, registering a couple of very strong quarterly results. In total, from Q1, 2022 to Q2, 2023, O's operating income grew by  34 . And for all of the reasons many REIT investors mention - e.g., embedded rent escalators, which kick in nicely during inflationary period and favourable supply and demand dynamics.However, despite the solid growth numbers, the share of the interest expense component relative to the operating income has become larger. And now let me remind you that the current cost of debt sitting in O's books is still nowhere near the market level and that during most of these quarters the interest rates were actually much lower than we currently have given that the Fed was still in the aggressive hiking process.To contrast O, which is an A-rated REIT with a smaller REIT, which has not an IG balance sheet, I have taken the Global Medical REIT  as an example.As we can see, the higher interest costs have consumed a significant portion of GMRE's operating income, despite the fact that the Company has embedded rent escalators for almost all of its contracts. Moreover, GMRE operates on a net lease basis just as O, which protects the earnings from other inflationary costs.Both in O and GMRE's case, the occupancy levels have remained robust  at their peaks  and there have been successful increases in the top-line. Yet, both companies have still significantly lower cost of financing recorded at their books currently, and first notable maturities are slowly but surely approach their deadlines.I recommend REIT investors to revisit the theoretically correct yet practically insignificant thesis that rent   lease indexation to inflation or rent increases in general serve as meaningful mitigates to the  higher for longer  scenario for REITs. Mathematically and based on the actual results, organic growth in rents or leases is not sufficient to protect many REITs from a gradual convergence to higher cost of capital and the resulting consequences.

"Forget The Hype, W. P. Carey Is An Absolute Bargain","Rising interest rates are a phenomenon remembered by few market participants--the last time interest rates experienced sustained upward momentum was 40 years ago. The subsequent reduction of interest rates after the U.S. inflationary crisis of the 1970sREITs, along with other capital and debt-intensive industries, were primary beneficiaries of this long-term trend, and have thusly been slapped in the proverbial face as interest rates rise. The office sector has been doubly slapped by rising interest rates and the COVID pandemic, which ushered in remote and hybrid work en masse. The sector has yet to recover to even a fraction of its pre-pandemic highs, and is now faced with the daunting prospect ofUnderstanding the direness of the situation, management at W. P. Carey  announced in September 2023 that the company would .The method of the spinoff is the main contention here, as many  have . Essentially, W. P. Carey management did two thingsThe first point here seems to be the cardinal sin. As  in his recent article on W. P. CareyThis, we think, is true when placed in the proper context, which is the interest rate discussion we started this article with.Yes--dividend cutters did not prosper in a falling rate environment. That only makes sense, right  After all, if you're cutting your payout as your cost of capital is falling, then the overwhelming likelihood is that your business is suffering. Cutting payouts in a  interest rate environment is a very different animal and, we would contend, a sign of prudent management.Others have also pointed out what W. P. Carey did not slash its dividend in the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, a line of reasoning intended to invoke in the reader a thought of  wow, things must  be bad, then.  In our view, this thinking is flawed. The GFC, as painful as it was and despite what our collective memories may tell us, did not have the same devastating force as the Great Depression, and active government intervention shielded many industries and companies from massive amounts of pain. Additionally, the GFC did not affect all asset classes equally, and, lastly, rates fell overall during the GFC, enabling companies to roll debt at even cheaper prices.In response to a question about the dividend on  to address the office spinoff, CFO Toni Ann Sanzone had this to saySo, yes, while dividend cuts are generally bad news, we think the rationale from management makes sense, especially in the long run.The second issue--that the company's spin-off would be meant to simply sell its assets over time--seems to us to just be an admission of reality on the part of management. The market for office space is unlikely to return to equilibrium anytime soon due to a massive imbalance of supply and demand. What, we ask, would you rather have in this situation  A lame-duck child company that limps along, in constant need of attention and funding, or a company designed to sell the assets and close up shop once the maximum amount of capital has been collected for investorsWe think the latter is a far better option.Now, we don't think the analysis conducted on this site regarding W. P. Carey is , in the sense that long-term investors have every right to feel as jilted as they do. The stock has performed poorly, after all, and it is only natural that the office spinoff and dividend target reduction would feel like a rug-pull. Thus, today's levels for sure represent an inflection point for long-term holders of W. P. Carey.For new investors, however, we think the opportunity may be quite enticing.First, an historic discrepancy has emerged between the company's stock price and its forward EBITDA estimates. For most of the last 10 years  minus the start of the COVID pandemic , W. P. Carey's stock traded well above its forward EBITDA expectations. Since the start of 2023, the stock has endured a precipitous decline while forward EBITDA estimates have moderately .  The most recent drop in EBITDA estimates appears to reflect the spinoff.The popular narrative surrounding W. P. Carey--that the company is slow-to-no-growth and that the primary reason for wanting to own it is for its dividend--also doesn't appear to hold up particularly well.Over the last five years the company has generated a 14.3  CAGR on sales. While, yes, this number is below best-in-class Realty Income  and slightly worse than STAG Industrial , it is also not insignificant and has been on the upswing.Perhaps more importantly for those with a long term perspective, W. P. Carey has managed to produce a better return on capital for its shareholders, coming in at 3.2  for the latest quarter, a full 113 basis points above Realty Income's quarterly ROC.Lastly, , the stock is attractive on a forward P FFO and P AFFO basis. The stock currently trades hands at 9.79x P FFO and 10.22x P AFFO, which is 7  and 21  lower than the current sector median. This, we think, is a reflection of the negative sentiment swirling around the stock.Year to date, W. P. Carey has been a disappointment for shareholders, delivering a 27  negative total return. While we understand why long-term holders of the stock may no longer find the story appealing, we think that newcomers to the company are likely to find a lot to like in the current valuation and outlook for the company post-spinoff.

Vonovia Is Likely To Benefit From Undersupply In Germany,"Dear readers,  is one of my favorite stocks to write about and one that occupies the biggest position in my real estate   REIT portfolio. I've studied the stock quite extensively over the pastMost recently I shared an update following Vonovia's Q2 2023 earnings - , reiterating my BUY rating at EUR 22 per share for the native shares  ticker VNA .I'm now more than 20  in profit  excl. dividends  on my position with a break-even under EUR 18 per share with no intention to sell before my EUR 40 price target. That leaves 80  of upside to a price target, which really is quite conservative, making Vonovia a worthwhile investment even at today's prices.I think that the one thing that often keeps people from investing in Vonovia is lack of knowledge of the local German market. The focus here is on the supply and demand dynamics and especially on rent regulation, which I believe is a key piece of the puzzle here.Today I want to show you why I have  that Germany will experience substantial under-supply of housing over the next 5 years which will inevitably benefit Vonovia and other residential landlords.Just as any other market in the world, the German residential market is driven by supply and demand  with a sparkle of regulation  over the long term.Let's start with supply of new apartments. There's only one reason why developers build new housing - to make money. When input construction and energy costs increase, developers are faced with a choice. They can try to pass through these input cost increases onto the final customers by increasing the sale prices or they can halt their development plans.In tough economic conditions with high inflation and a weakening consumer, it's quite unlikely that new apartments would sell at higher prices. In fact, housing prices have already started coming down from their peak in early 2022.Faced with no other choice, this has led many developers to postpone their construction plans which has led to a significant drop in the number of issued building permits  one of the best proxies for future new supply .Note that the data below is monthly, so in normal years about 300,0000 units are permitted per year. This year that number is likely to be below 250,000 and unless the economy improves drastically, I expect no more than 200,000 permitted units in 2024.The result is that only about 250,000 new units are expected to be delivered to the market this year. In the following years, this number may fall somewhat lower before recovering closer to the 300,000 unit long-term average. But even 300,000 units per year isn't nearly enough to cover the demand which is expected at 500-700 thousand units per yearThat may seem like a high number so let's break it down.Demand for housing is first and foremost driven by population growth. The natural population in Germany has been declining for a long time, but immigration has been high and has resulted in a 0.4  annual population growth over the last 10 years. Recently, this growth has been accelerated by  the government passing immigration reform laws in an effort to increase immigration to fight labor shortages and especially by  the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has resulted in unprecedented 1.3  population growth in 2022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 0.5-0.6  per year.On top of population growth, there are two trends worth mentioning. Firstly, urbanization which isn't stopping any time soon and is likely to disproportionately benefit Vonovia whose portfolio is located primarily in places that are seeing population growth. Secondly, the downsizing of households. Back in 2011, there were on average 2 people in every household. That number has dropped to 1.94 today and is expected to decline further to 1.89 by 2035, adding additional 0.2  of demand per year.Between population growth and these trends, it is estimated that demand for housing will average 500-700 ths. units per year which is a far cry from what will be constructed. And because you cannot simply pull new apartments out of a hat,  for the foreseeable future and will only be magnified if the ruling party manages to pass  for more stringent rent regulation which would only discourage more developers.What does all this mean for VonoviaFirstly, as the housing shortage keeps prices high a large portion of the German population will rent out of necessity which is likely to result in ongoing near perfect occupancy of 98 . Secondly, with fewer apartments on the market, existing real estate will be more valuable leading to higher prices which should help get the stock closer to its NAV of EUR 40 .In the short-term the stock price will continue to be driven by interest rates expectations and sentiment. But over the long term the value of the company's assets acts as a very strong magnet and the valuation will eventually reflect this. Severe undersupply is one of the key reasons why I don't mind being overweight Vonovia at these depressed levels and reiterate my BUY rating for the stock.Stay tuned for an update of my cash flow model following Q3 earnings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Buy REITs Before Everyone Else Does,"A fundamental truism of investing in stocks is that capturing maximal gains from an investment requires buying it  the crowd does.Ideally, an investor would buy a full position in a stock when it's down, then other investors will gradually orThat sounds nice , but in reality, human psychology often gets in the way. We are tribal creatures, and going against the tribe in hopes that they will follow feels uncomfortable and unnatural. In most areas of life, it doesn't make sense to go against the crowd. That's why, for most of us, investing is a learned skill instead of an innate talent.I would argue that income-oriented investors and dividend growth investors have a rare opportunity right now to buy ahead of the crowd. That opportunity is in realThere has been a  35  drop in the REIT index, measured below by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF , since the beginning of 2022This selloff has been inversely correlated with the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield, which has soared over that time period.REITs are than just bond alternatives. Unlike bonds, REITs offer inflation protection from property value appreciation and rent growth, which generally flow into rising dividends. But, despite my  to the contrary, the market still treats them like bond proxies, as exemplified by the tight, inverse correlation between REIT stock prices and bond yields, as seen above.In what follows, I'm going to argue that interest rates have or are very close to peaking, that the Fed is done with the current hiking cycle, that interest rates are likely to come down in 2024, and that this will be the catalyst for REITs to shift from  to .There are multiple reasons why Treasury yields have surged so much, such as government deficit spending and fading demand from foreign buyers, but I would argue the primary catalyst for rising rates is the Federal Reserve.Since April 2022, the Fed has dumped over  1 trillion of debt securities, most of which were Treasuries, off its balance sheet. That has created artificially high supply of Treasuries as rates have risen, just as the Fed's asset buying program created artificial  for Treasuries when rates were low and or falling.Plus, demand for Treasuries is driven largely by what the Fed  doing and  of what the Fed is  with the Fed Funds Rate. The coordinated  higher for longer  narrative from Fed officials in recent months has done exactly what it was intended to do  cause long-term interest rates to rise.The Fed thinks this will help anchor inflation back at its 2  target rate. I think this move will end up doing more harm than good.The fact of the matter is that .The market briefly panicked over the  hotter than expected  inflation data in the September reading. But the 3.7  headline CPI rate is only that high because of the shelter component, which lags real-time changes in rents by about a year.Compare the YoY growth in US shelter CPI  gold line below  to the Zillow Rent Index  red lineIn September, shelter CPI still showed 7.1  YoY growth, but we know from Zillow that actual YoY rent growth was only 3.2 .Apartment List's latest  shows an even lower rent growth metric of -1.2  for SeptemberThe same story holds true for home prices. Using  most recent data from July 2023, median home listing prices  0.9 , while the S P Case-Shiller index showed a 1.0  YoY gain.However you measure real-time housing cost changes,  shelter inflation is far below the 7.1  YoY rate reported in the CPI.And the shelter component of headline CPI represents about 35  of the overall index. Thus, about 2.5 percentage points of the 3.7  CPI rate came from this inaccurate shelter input.What was the CPI rate in September if you exclude this lagging shelter component  Answer  1.99 .The biggest reason there has been a slight bounce in CPI ex shelter since June is the rebound in oil prices, but even this appears to be temporary. Recently, the International Energy Agency  that oil prices near  100 caused meaningful demand destruction, hence the stagnant price now in the  80s.If instead of the CPI's inaccurate 7.1  YoY growth in shelter costs you used Zillow's 3.2  YoY rent growth number, headline CPI would be 2.4 .If you used Apartment List's -1.2  number, you would get a headline CPI reading of 0.9  for September.Inflation has already been whipped. It's just a matter of time before it shows up in the official data and the Fed acknowledges it.Both the forward SOFR curve and the Fed's dot plot shows interest rates on the short end coming down slowly next year. I think the drop in interest rates will be much faster and sharper than the market seems to think, because I believe we will get a recession in the near future.Anytime in modern history that the Fed has hiked rates this fast, it has precipitated a recession. And during every recession in modern history, the Fed has pushed rates down quickly and significantly  by an average of about 500 basis points .Therefore, shouldn't the burden of proof be on those who claim  contrary to the historical record  that the Fed will be able to achieve a soft landing, avoid recession, and ease the Fed Funds Rate down slowly over the course of several yearsEven if I'm wrong and the Fed does ease the FFR down slowly over the course of a few years, I still think this will put downward pressure on Treasury yields across the curve as the lagged shelter inflation falls and allows CPI readings to come down further.Now, with all of the above said, recall my earlier point that the market treats REITs like bond proxies.If REITs fall because interest rates rise, then what should happen when interest rates begin declining  whether fast or slowOf course, some investors will object that a recession would be bad for REITs, causing an  selloff. This is pure conjecture, and not very well informed conjecture at that. This objection seems to imply that every recession will be just like the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, which was very damaging to real estate and REITs.But most economic forecasts today see a milder recession on the horizon, more akin to the short and shallow recession of 2001.How did REITs perform through that recession  Answer  swimmingly.The Fed quickly pushed down the FFR in response to economic weakness, which corresponded with a drop in long-term interest rates.From April 2000 through June 2022, the Vanguard Real Estate Index  gained 35   15.5  annualized , while real estate stalwarts like Realty Income , Alexandria Real Estate Equities , and W. P. Carey  gained even more.The line of thinking above isn't some sophistry I'm using to try to bail out my underwater REIT positions.  As if anything I write could move the markets anyway  This is my actual view. I truly think REITs, especially the higher quality names that typically trade at large valuation premiums, offer an incredible buying opportunity right now, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.Here are several of the blue-chip REITs I've been buying hand-over-fist lately.ADC owns single-tenant net lease properties leased to the nation's largest and strongest retailers. Its portfolio is highly defensive, recession-resistant, and resilient to competition from e-commerce.Moreover, ADC enjoys among the strongest and best-positioned balance sheets in all of REITdom, with very little debt maturing until 2028.CEO Joey Agree and his top management team are highly shareholder-aligned, illustrated recently by significant insider buying.For a deeper dive on , check out  Why Agree Realty Is My Largest Holding.ARE owns and develops a portfolio of state-of-the-art life science campuses located in the nation's most productive innovation clusters like Boston, Washington DC, and Raleigh Durham. These are generally triple-net leased properties occupied by the world's strongest biotech companies.ARE has suffered a pullback due to worries over cyclically slowing VC investment spending in the biotech space as well as a wave of life science supply coming to market. But ARE's quality of building design and location should act as a moat, blunting the impact of these temporary headwinds.Meanwhile, ARE's balance sheet is top notch, boasting a BBB  credit rating, over 13-year weighted average debt maturity, and no loans maturing until 2025.For more on ARE, see  written in 2019 explaining why I  to own it, even though I thought it was too expensive to buy at the time. It's definitely not too expensive anymore.CCI boasts perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure network in the United States, with all the benefits of scale that comes with it.

But I actually like this decision. Single-tenant net lease office has become an extraordinarily unattractive property type that will likely endure very poor returns going forward. I only wish management would have ripped this band-aid off sooner.Plus, selling its office properties now gives WPC the liquidity to manage its 2024 and 2025 debt maturities. Even though it has a BBB  credit rating, I like that management is  killing two birds with one stone  by eliminating the office exposure and prepaying maturing debt in one fell swoop.For more on , see  Despite Inflation Protection, WPC is Best Suited For Low Interest Rates.The primary reason why REITs have shed over 1 3rd of their value since their peak has been rising interest rates.Therefore, as interest rates peak and begin to steadily decline going forward, we should expect the REIT recovery to pick up steam.I of course cannot time the bottom and don't believe anyone can.

Why U.S. Treasury Bond Yields Will Continue To Rise,"The year 2023 has been a tough one for bond investors.The Bloomberg Aggregate Index has posted a -1.43  return YTD through October 13th. Following losses of -1.54  in 2021 and -13.01  in 2022, the Aggregate Index is on track for its thirdMuch of the focus has been on the Fundamental economic factors that affect the bond market.Although the Fed s favorite inflation measure has declined from its peak of 5.6  in Feb 2022, the Core PCE came in at a still high 3.9 , last month. Core PCE has remained above the Fed s inflation target of 2.0  for 30 consecutive months.This has been the primary reason why the Fed has been so aggressive with tightening monetary policy. Between March 2022 and theThe possibility of another rate hike is still on the table for this year.The Fed is concerned with the stickiness of the inflation rate and the resiliency of the economy. Many have been predicting a recession due to the Fed s tightening, but the economy seems quite robust, as evidenced by the surprising surge in non-farm payrolls of 336,000, as released by the BLS on October 6. This was markedly stronger than the 267,000 average gain in new jobs over the prior 12 months and the forecasted level of 170,000.While many have been anticipating for more than a year a Fed pivot by cutting rates, with such a durable jobs market the Fed s fear is that such a move would stimulate the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing, autos and consumer borrowing, which would then reignite inflation.The Fed has been using the mantra of  higher for longer  with regards to their rate policy for quite some time, and only recently has it begun to sink in.When Fed Chairman Powell says the Fed will be data dependent at future FOMC meetings, he is referring to these Fundamental economic factors.There is another dimension, however, that is also impacting the bond market, and in my view, is the major reason why US Treasury bond yields will continue to rise, and these are the Technical factors that affect bond yields.One of the basic elements of economics is the Law of Supply and Demand, and with regard to US Treasury bonds, I will discuss how his Technical factor impacts yields.The largest owner of US Treasury bonds is the Federal Reserve. From 2008 through 2022, during the Fed s fourteen-year experiment with Quantitative Easing  QE,  the Fed had a voracious appetite for Treasury bonds. Their Treasury bond holdings surged from  481 billion in 2008 to  5.9 trillion in 2022.The Fed s share of US Treasury Bonds owned by the public jumped from 7.6  to 25.5 .During the pandemic, when QE was reinstituted to prevent the economy from collapsing as everything was shut down, the Fed was virtually the only buyer of government bonds. With the entire yield curve yielding less than 1  due to the Fed s aggressive easing, the Fed bought 53  of the net new government debt issued to stimulate the economy.But then inflation reared its ugly head, and the Fed began reversing course. In addition to raising the Fed Funds rate to 5.50 , the Fed began a policy normalization program, more commonly referred to as Quantitative Tightening  QT.  The goal of QT is to reduce the size of the Fed s balance sheet. This was to be accomplished through allowing their Treasury bonds to roll-off at a pace of  60 billion per month. QT was announced in March 2022, and since then the Fed s Treasury bond holdings have declined to just under  5.0 trillion, or 19.8  of publicly held Treasury debt.The Fed is committed to continuing QT for the foreseeable future.The next largest individual owners of Treasury bonds are Japan and China. At their peaks, both countries each owned well over  1 trillion Treasury bonds. China s ownership topped out at  1.2 trillion in 2013, but has been gradually reduced to only  822 billion. Japan s ownership reached  1.3 trillion at the end of 2021, but has since been reduced to  1.1 trillion. Their shares of ownership of Treasury bonds declined to 3.2  and 4.4 , respectively.There are more than 40 other foreign countries that own Treasury bonds, as well, and collectively their holdings have also declined recently. From a peak of owning 28.3  of US Treasury debt in 2014 the other foreign countries holdings declined to 22.4  in 2023.The final group of US Treasury bond holders are other US Financial Institutions. This category includes, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and hedge funds. As a whole, the Financial Institutions are more price sensitive than the Fed and the other foreign governments. As yields have risen, the Financial Institutions are the only ones who have increased their holdings. Their share of Treasury ownership rose from 32.8  in 2014 to 50.1  in 2023..Treasury debt is issued to help fund the US Government. The government runs a fiscal deficit each year and their expenditures, in excess of revenues, are financed by Treasury bonds. Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the government s deficits have been quite large and consequently the Treasury s requirement for debt issuance has been massive.For the Fiscal Year ending 9 30 23 the government recorded a deficit of - 1.7 trillion, a  300 billion increase from FYE 22 s deficit of - 1.4 trillion. This represents the fourth consecutive year of  trillion plus deficits. The projection for the current year is more of the same.Because of the Debt Ceiling crisis this past spring, the Treasury had to resort to extraordinary measures to prevent the government from defaulting on its obligations. The Treasury had reached its statutory debt limit of  31.4 trillion in January and could no longer issue new bonds. Treasury Secretary Yellen had to move money around and delay funding some retirement programs until Congress solved the problem in June by suspending the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025.Once Yellen received the authority to turn the debt spigots back on, the Treasury has been playing catch up with record new levels of debt. In only four months, the Treasury has issued  1.75 trillion in new bonds. This amount is larger than issuance in any full year, excluding the 2020 pandemic surge. Total government debt outstanding has grown to  33.2 trillion and counting.The basic economic law of Supply and Demand says that when supply increases and demand declines, prices must fall. In bond land, this means that interest rates must go up.This has been evident in looking at the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note. The Fed began paring back their purchases of Treasuries in December 2021 as they started moving away from QE. Then in early 2022 they began cutting their Treasury holdings as they implemented QT.When the Fed began tapering their QE purchases the 10-year Treasury note was yielding roughly 1.50 . As demand for Treasuries has declined and the supply of Treasuries has increased, the 10-year yield has climbed to 4.65 , the highest level in 16 years.Because their borrowing requirements are so immense, the Treasury has a sophisticated and robust system for fulfilling their needs under the Office of Debt Management.The strategy is to offer a variety of debt instruments through a regular and predictable issuance mechanism. This includes promoting a broad and diverse investor base and supporting market liquidity and efficient market functioning.To accomplish their goals, the Treasury works with a network of Primary Dealers to ensure that there will always be a market for their needs.Currently there are 25 Primary Dealers who are authorized by the Federal Reserve System to deal directly in government bonds. These are banks or broker-dealers who must meet rigid requirements to qualify.The first requirement is demonstrating sufficient capital. A broker dealer not affiliated with a bank must have capital exceeding  50 million. For a bank that wants to act as a Primary Dealer, they must have at least  1 billion in Tier 1 capital. They must also be registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The next requirement is that the Primary Dealer must demonstrate that they maintain at least a 0.25  market share in trading government bonds. This includes showing a substantial presence as a market maker that provides two-way liquidity in US government securities.Additionally, they must commit to bid on a consistent basis for their pro rata share at Treasury auctions. Their bids must be competitive with prevailing market levels.Finally, they must have the proper back-office support, with membership in US clearing organizations to efficiently process transactions.The Treasury offers several types of debt instruments. These include Treasury Bills  maturities under 1 year, , Treasury Notes  maturities 1-10 years,  Treasury Bonds  maturities greater than 10 years , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS  and Floating Rate Notes  FRN .There is a regular calendar, where Treasury Bills are auctioned weekly, and all of the other instruments are auctioned monthly.The mechanism for the auctions is that the Treasury posts a schedule of type of security, the size to be issued and the date it is to be auctioned.When an issue is announced, it then trades on a when-issued basis. When-issued trading allows market participants to buy and sell a particular security before it has been auctioned. This feature is important because it provides helpful information about the market interest in the upcoming security.On the day of the auction the Primary Dealers gauge the interest in the security with their customers. Customers can bid on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. A non-competitive bid is usually from small investors who say they want the security and will take it at the prevailing market price. Competitive bids are for customers who say they will buy the bonds at a specific level. They then wait for the auction results to see if they are able to acquire the security at their desired level.The Primary Dealers then convey the interest of their customers to the Treasury at the prescribed auction time.Once the auction closes the Treasury compiles all of the bids and accepts bids, starting at the lowest yield, until they have reached sufficient demand for the amount of security they are offering. The highest yielding bid that clears the auction causes the auction to end.The Treasury uses a single-price format, so all winners of the auction pay the same price, which is the highest yield accepted to clear the auction, even if their bid was at a lower yield.Once the auction is complete, the Treasury then reports the auction results.The official results contain a lot of tidbits of information that are helpful in measuring the success of the auction.The first significant piece of information is to compare the high yield to what the security was trading at on a when -issued basis immediately before the auction closed. If the high yield is below the when-issued price, this is viewed as a strong auction because it demonstrates investors were being aggressive in their bid to ensure that they will get the securities that they desire.If the high yield is above the when -issued price, this is called a  tail,  A tail is viewed as a weak auction, because investors were bidding at a higher yield than that prevailing at auction close, and thus are indicating less interest in the security. The larger the tail, the weaker the auction.The next piece of information to look at is the bid-to-cover ratio. This indicator measures how much demand there is for the security. The larger the bid-to-cover, the greater the interest there is in the security.The final measure to analyze is the percentage taken down by dealers. Primary Dealers are required to submit bids to each auction. They want to provide bids for their customers, whether on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. However, if they do not have customer interest, then they must submit bids for themselves, as market-makers. Again, this is part of their role as a Primary Dealer.However, they typically do not want to own the security themselves. A large percentage taken down by dealers usually means weak customer interest and is viewed as a bad signal, while low dealer ownership is viewed as a strong auction.Last week the Treasury issued 3-year Treasury Notes, 10-year Treasury Notes, and 30-Year Treasury Bonds, and the results were all viewed as sloppy.The Treasury started with auctioning  46 billion of 3-year notes. The high yield was 4.74 , up from 4.66  last month, and the highest level since February 2007.The high yield was above the 4.723  when-issued yield at auction, creating a 1.7 bp tail. This was the largest tail since February, and the third largest in the past ten years.The bid-to-cover was 2.562, down from last month s 2.75. It was the lowest cover since February, and below the six-month average of 2.792.Dealers were awarded 22.1  of the total, the highest level since October 2022.Next came the 10-year Treasury auction of  35 billion.The high yield was 4.61 , versus 4.289  at last month's auction. The 4.592 when-issued yield at auction created a 1.8 bp tail. This was the largest tail since the April auction, and the 8 consecutive auction with a tail.The bid-to-cover was 2.50, down from last month s 2.52. It was also the lowest bid-to-cover since June.Dealers took down 20.9  of the auction, the highest level since October 2022.The final auction of the week was the  20 billion of 30-year Treasury Bonds.The high yield was 4.837 , up from last month s 4.345 . This was the highest yield since August 2007.The 30 year when-issued yield was 4.80, meaning there was a 3.7bp tail. This was the 4 consecutive 30-year auction with a tail, and it was the largest tail since November 2021. Also, it was the 3 largest tail on record.The bid-to-cover was 2.349, the lowest since February. It also was below the 6-month average of 2.44Dealers took down 18.2  of the auction, which was the largest amount since December 2021. It also was above the 6-month average dealer takedown of 11 .Together, these auction results show the limited demand within the investor community and how the Primary Dealers were forced to own more of the auctions than they would like.All indicators point to higher yields ahead.The final Technical factor to analyze is liquidity.The Treasury market has always been the largest and most liquid segment of the bond market. Large quantities of securities are traded daily. Size trades typically have little impact on the bid ask spread. This is known as market depth.Recent activity, however, has shown a troubling weakness in market depth. As measured by the Bloomberg US Government Liquidity Index, seen below, liquidity is near its all-time worst level. This index measures, on average, how far yields are away from where fair value models suggest they should be. The index has deteriorated over the past year as Treasury yields have risen, and is near the all-time high level.The Fundamentals continue to show above target inflation, and the resiliency of the economy, as measured by employment, cause the Fed to emphasize their  higher for longer  mantra.The Technicals, as demonstrated by declining demand for Treasury debt in an environment of heavy supply due to rising budget deficits, suggest higher yields ahead.The metrics of recent Treasury auctions support the weakness in demand among investors, and the deterioration in liquidity as rates rise suggest there is more pain to be felt investing in bonds.For those who view the high current yields as an attractive buying opportunity, I offer the words of Rick Reider, CIO of Global Fixed Income at BlackRockBuy the dip doesn t work during QT   you just keep getting new dips.

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Cash Drain Could Become A Problem (Rating Downgrade),"The market has been kind to shipping company  this year as its stock price has plunged from a 52 week high of  29.38 all the way down to  9.17 as of yesterday's close.The shipping company lowered its expectations for 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, implying a steep decline in free cash flow as well. The market now models a long earnings contraction for the shipping company which means that the dividend might not return for years.Furthermore, growing container supply might result in a depression of freight rates for a longer period of time which in turn might lead to an ongoing re-rating of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' valuation multiple.I am now a lot more pessimistic as to how long the earnings contraction will last and take responsibility byI have been a big fan of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services when it made a strong value proposition to stockholders, in no small part because of the company's huge dividend pay-out.. Recently, however, net losses have forced the shipping company to not pay a dividend and with the market now expecting a long earnings contraction, investors will likely have to wait years until the dividend comes back.Furthermore, the company is burning through cash and might again have to lower its EBITDA guidance when it releases quarterly earnings for the last quarter.According to ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' dividend policy, the company distributes 30-50  of annual net income as a dividend to shareholders, but the recent accumulation of losses has resulted in non-payment of a dividend and it could take years until the dividend gets paid again.By now, the consensus pretty much is that investors will not get a dividend until the free cash flow and earnings situation at the shipping company improves drastically, something which might not happen for years.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services lost  213 million in the second quarter which brought total YTD losses to  271 million.I am starting now to be a bit more concerned about the company's cash levels which are rapidly depleting and which, in the past at least, have been cited, including by me, as a source of strength for the shipping company.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' reported a net debt position of  1.6 billion in the second quarter and a net leverage ratio of 0.5x. However, at the end of last year, the company had a  269 million net cash position  0.0x net leverage ratio . The problem with this change in debt is that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' free cash flow has fallen off the cliff.Positive free cash flow is naturally replenishing a company's bank accounts and with free cash flow declining a scary 80  YoY in 2Q-23, I think ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is at the brink of having potentially to drastically increase its debt.The absence of any real debt and strong free cash flow were good reasons to buy ZIM during the expansion, but the cash situation is unlikely to get better in the near term.The company had  3.3 billion in cash at the end of 2022 and, at the end of the second quarter, had  1.9 billion in cash, reflecting a decline of  1.4 billion.With the current rate of cash drain, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services might actually have to raise some money next year, or leverage up its balance sheet.Freight rates have come under considerable pressure in 2022 and 2023, primarily because of shrinking demand in the consumer sector. With consumer sentiment deteriorating and shipping volumes shrinking, the spot market has come under increasing pressure.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' average freight rate, for instance, plunged to just  1,193  TEU  in the second quarter, marking a sharp correction of 67  YoY.Unfortunately, I don't think the situation is getting much better and I was probably misguided in my earlier assessment that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services could see a short-lived recession and enjoy a quick rebound in freight rates.One aspect why I am less optimistic on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is that the market continues to expect a glut of new supply for container ships which, in my view, will continue to suppress average freight rates way into 2024.The following chart is reproduced from my last article, for convenience.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of  1.2 billion to  1.6 billion, down from a prior guidance of between  1.8 billion and  2.2 billion in Adjusted EBITDA. Given the poor state of the shipping industry, I would not be surprised to see yet another reduction in the profit outlook.The market now models a much deeper recession than it did in July which is when I presented my last outlook on the shipping company. The estimates also indicate that the recession will last longer and concerns over the general state of the economy should be taken seriously.Cyclically-vulnerable shipping companies are at risk of a major earnings contraction and the market now sees 2024 to lead to even higher losses than are expected for 2023, and the situation is not anticipated to get much better in 2025 either.Profit estimates are negative and an earnings multiple can't be applied. The valuation ultimately depends on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' outlook for 2023, its cash drain in the third quarter and the company's prospects for a free cash flow recovery.If the outlook gets slashed again when the company presents for 3Q-23, I would say the valuation of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is most likely headed for new lows. The most important metric to watch moving forward will be ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash balance.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services was a popular income stock in 2021 and 2022 which is when the shipping company returned a boatload of cash to shareholders.But two consecutive quarters of  growing  net losses have changed the picture quite a bit and the market now appears to model a steep recession that could last 1-3 years.I am now much more concerned about ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash drain as well as the length of the earnings contraction. As a consequence, investors must expect to see a much more leverage balance sheet moving forward. I am not willing to accept this risk and have sold out.

My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid, but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead. Currently with the funds rate at 5.5  and the core CPI at 4.1  the real funds rate is 1.4 . ThatThe Fed can resume its fine-tuning operation later if the need arises, but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go. I'll agree that the bulk of the Fed's work is done, BUT I don't believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a last-minute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown, the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded. The first-ever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mix-raising the odds of a government shutdown in mid-November. While this situation won't affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that will.The political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics, fiscal spending, and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors, rating agencies, and voters. Now to be fair, the government's deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yields-the market's way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order. And, the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the government's out-of-control spending, the worse the situation will get.In an era of low inflation and zero low interest rates, Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences. No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10-year Treasury yield now hovering around 4.9 . With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate, Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road. fiscal austerity would become a near-term headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates. However, that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2  target, so this growth inflation interest rate issue isn't going to be so easy to solve. However, as I will explain later, an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today. Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced before.The auto workers union is making  in my opinion  some outrageous demands. They are asking for a 40  increase in wages over 4 years, a 20  reduction in the workweek from 40.0 to 32.0 hours, and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of all-electric vehicles. The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands, poisoned any good-faith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainable.At the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rank-and-file union members. The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President. Against this background, it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly. As it progresses, the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip. The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparent.While investors seem to be pricing a  soft landing,  history is not on their side. The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history, and the market is still trying to absorb the impact. This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike, with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by near-term macro events. As rates have spiked, so too have long-term yields.Yield spreads also bear monitoring. The spread, or difference, between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, has been negative all year, i.e., an inverted yield curve, but has narrowed from a record -110 basis-point inversion in March to only 30 basis points today-not positive, but it's progress. Dating back to 1990, when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities. It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points, do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues. I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positive.The past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil. We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week, and as I'll speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations. The MACRO scene, however, has been impacted, especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their  911  event. Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spending debt debacle in our economy, the  rubber band  gets stretched once again. The U.S. has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will  get what they need  to defend themselves., but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation. These events along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII. In the meantime, taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding  spending , as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced . Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process. However, they are not.There is a contingent, in which Ms. Yellen is a firm supporter, that wishes to spend trillions on  climate issues  and an  energy transition . While the economy is doing well, welfare spending is near or at all-time highs. In fiscal year , the federal  spent  1.19 trillion on more than 80 different  programs. That represents almost 20  of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022. That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is  humming along  The pandemic is over but the country's food stamp program reached an all-time high in November 2022 and remains at that level.Then there are the 6-7 million immigrants that have arrived, and they also come with a huge cost to social services, welfare, etc. Finally, the cherry on top of this debt cake. The cost of  the  existing debt   not future debt  will be about the same as the existing Social Security program. In effect, we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programs.Therefore it is a HUGE  stretch  to assume the U.S. can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately needed.It doesn't take a Wharton School graduate to realize that  other  spending must be curtailed. I realize I keep repeating that, but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact. At some point, this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped. If it isn't then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye. Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL, some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE.  The climate ISN'T the biggest threat to our economy . The only question that remains is - is it already too lateBetween the  issues  at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad, the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades.

The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longer-term interest rates that are doing some of the Fed's heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled, while Wall Street rallied.However, the markets shuddered at Powel's view that the economy's resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough, suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2 .That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3.--  - It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That is also frightening for equities.House Speaker Vote. It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan, leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry  R-NC . It's unclear if he can garner 217 votes either.The continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 11 17, and besides the geo-political turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed, the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker, the more likely it is that we reach that mid-November deadline without a budget agreement.Then there is the administration's emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel. With the slim Republican majority, they would need 98  of their contingent to back ONE candidate, and as we have seen that is an impossible task. An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal  handful  of Democrats to get behind a candidate  ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee  and remove this obstacle.As far as the shutdown, as stated in earlier updates, it's a non-event for the markets. If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending. With complete dysfunction in Washington, we're all suffering the consequences of politicians.After three years of overlapping crises, it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world. While these concerns are valid, I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Because of this, it is unlikely that the Israeli-Hamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the Russia-Ukraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years. A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the region.Fortunately, I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence. The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war. Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel. As the leadership in Tehran knows very well, Israel is a nuclear-armed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East. It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved. However, for a variety of other reasons, I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the  85- 90 barrel range. that are taking place in the Israeli conflict, but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth. First, from an economic perspective, Israel is a small country, with a GDP of  521 billion-making it the 29th largest country in the world, representing only 0.5  of world GDP. To put this into perspective, when measured by GDP, Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US  roughly the size of Virginia  and when compared to companies in the S P 500, Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company  Eli Lilly .Additionally, Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US, making up only 0.7  of both US imports and exports  the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively . And because of this, Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path. From an earnings perspective, given that I don't expect a significant economic impact from the war, combined with the fact that the S P 500 receives only 0.2  and 2.8  of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively, the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earnings.Finally, it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact. Unfortunately, conflict in this region is nothing new. Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts, the S P 500 was up  15  on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75  of the time.While this terrorist act may not change my economic views, it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the future.Iran did some saber-rattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any 'calls' in this war is preposterous. The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today. Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terror.If this terrorist attack isn't a wake-up call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future. The FACTS, not opinion, rhetoric, or  spin , but FACTS, tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced. Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2  years. Instead of crippling their economy, the country's coffers have been enriched in the last 2 years.If common sense doesn't prevail, this war is just the beginning of global turmoil. The U.S. received yet another reminder that 'policy' errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel. After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price, the U.S. finally decided to begin   Strategic Petroleum Reserve . Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels. Combine this with U.S. Domestic issues that I'll present next, and it's easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higher.There is  reason to abandon the energy trade.Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a  59.5 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and a side-step against the US anti-fossil fuels policies. The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resources.This deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill, and that should encourage more M  A activity.Being a low-cost producer with an enviable list of land assets, Pioneer Natural Resources is a  prize . Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits. That means the newly combined entity will drill longer, more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money. Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer  laterals  Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impact.A the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. In a stroke of genius, Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale, while defraying costs, and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels. In essence, this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.U.S. oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. However, that is about to end, as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian in the last 2 years. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition.The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029-the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades, and at some point, the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economy.Finally, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas. The U.S. energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that 'policies' have consequences.The indices are all at a point where they could still go either way. Given all of the  outside  influences, the best scenario might be more sideways action. Plenty of starts and stops, with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while. Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter. That tells me to stay diversified and look for  special situations .It's easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy. The S P 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away. The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the index.The ball is in the BULL's court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position.

SQM: The Future Of Lithium Amidst The Energy Transition,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  is priced at 5x this year's EPS. Anyone looking at this stock will immediately recognize that it's cheaply valued. So, this consideration is not the main factor that's weighing onThe problem with this stock is that there's so much uncertainty priced in. Undoubtedly, some aspects are worthy elements that  priced in.Demand for lithium is going to massively increase in the next few years. Accordingly, the long-term thesis is clearly intact. However, a combination of risk-off investor sentiment, together with a slowdown in the energy transition is overwhelmingly impacting the stock.Here I shine a light on why investors are eschewing this stock. Ultimately, even though there are some aspects that should be factored in, I believe that at 5x this year'sWhat's the energy transition  Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it was clear. Is the energy transition when we stopped using wood and dung and started to use coal as the primary energy source  Or is the energy transition when we started to use Diesel oil for mobility  Or perhaps, the energy transition was when we started to increase our usage of natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and cookingPerhaps, the energy transition is in the future, when we use a greater proportion of our primary energy supply from solar panels and wind turbines  Do you see the point I'm making here  That we are always transiting from one source of energy to another.Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it happens overnight. But the fact of the matter is that while we have energy transitions, they take time. And what do investors absolutely hate nearly as much as bad news  UncertaintyNot knowing how long we'll have to wait to get paid. And I get it. With the share price going up, nobody is going to bother with difficult questions.But when the share price starts to move south, everything that was an uncertainty before becomes bad news. Now.Investors' time horizons shorten, and unless something is expected to go up within the next 12 months with a high degree of certainty, investors lose patience.I'm not saying that SQM is unquestionably a good investment. I for one, invested with Albemarle   disclosure  I'm long ALB . Admittedly, both companies have been terrible performers in 2023.There's no clearer sign of investors' capitulation than the right side of the chart consistently moving down day after day, without respite.The top concern is the most obvious, and can even be discerned in the company's name. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile. When investors are risk-seeking, investing in Chile is a compelling opportunity. It's a fast-growing company, that's strategically located in Chile, which grants it access to abundant lithium resources and cost-effective mining operations.But when interest rates are high, plus investors' temperaments mercurial, all that investors can think about are the political and regulatory risks that arise due to the company's operations in Chile, not to mention the likely overreaching government policies that may capture some of the company's profits.80  of SQM's gross profits are tied to lithium's prospects. If lithium regains its footing, SQM will do well. And in time, lithium's prospects will improve.Lithium prices have fallen by around 70  in the past year. This has for the most part been brought about by the sustainable climb in prices in the previous 2 years.Again, the overall energy transition story is still very much intact. Demand for lithium is expected to increase in the future, primarily driven by the growing adoption of EVs and the expansion of renewable energy storage systems.As automakers worldwide increasingly shift towards EV production to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements, lithium-ion batteries, will play a pivotal role in powering these vehicles.Additionally, the renewable energy sector's need for energy storage solutions to stabilize  will further boost lithium demand, making it a crucial element in the energy transition.Moreover, lithium demand for energy storage solutions aimed at grid stabilization is on the rise as utilities and the grid seek reliable methods to store excess energy and balance supply and demand, especially given the increasing amount of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the grid.I contend that lithium batteries have gained prominence in this role due to their efficiency, rapid response times, and ability to store and discharge electricity when needed, contributing to grid stability.I have a cautiously optimistic outlook on SQM. While it's trading at an attractive 5 times this year's EPS, there are notable near-term uncertainties and doubts that need consideration.The demand for lithium, while poised for substantial growth in the long run due to the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, has faced recent setbacks, leading to a substantial drop in lithium prices and creating short-term volatility.Additionally, SQM's exposure to political and regulatory risks in Chile, coupled with market uncertainties, may dampen investor sentiment in the short term.However, the fundamental strength of SQM's lithium production and its strategic position in the industry suggest a potentially brighter future once these near-term challenges are navigated.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

The West Is Losing Control Over The Gold Price,"An important change has unfolded in the global gold market. The East has been driving up the gold price, predominantly in late 2022 and the first months of 2023, breaking the West s long-standing pricing power.Until recently, Western institutional money was driving the  in wholesale markets such as London, mainly based on real interest rates. Gold was bought when real rates fell and vice versa. However, from late 2022 until June 2023 gold was up 17  while real rates were more or less flat, and Western institutions were net . Most likely, Eastern central banks, and Turkish and Chinese private demand, lifted the price of gold.For about ninety years, up until 2022, there was a patternIf we zoom in on the period from 2006 through 2021 the main reason for Western institutions to buy or sell gold was the , which reflects the 10-year expected real interest rate  real rate,  in short  of US government bonds.The physical gold price was predominantly set in the London Bullion Market and to a lesser extent Switzerland. Gold trade in London can be divided in three categoriesAs we will see below, the TIPS rate, UK net gold import  positive or negative , Western ETF holdings, and the COMEX open interest were all correlated to the price of gold. Until the war in Ukraine broke out late February 2022, that is, and things started to change.Because customs data lags a few months, and the World Gold Council s supply and demand data is published quarterly, we will cover the global market until June 2023 in this article. We will examine how gold is becoming less sensitive to real rates, and how London is losing its gold pricing power.Let s start by  the correlation between real rates and gold. Note, the TIPS yield axes in the charts below are inverted because higher rates caused lower gold prices and vice versa.From March until September 2022 the TIPS yield rose dramatically  down in the chart , but the price of gold reacted less bearish than the  rates model  previously prescribed. As London was still a net exporter over this time horizon, I conclude the West was still in charge of the price. But then came the third quarter of 2022.From late October 2022 until June 2023 the TIPS rate was barely down while gold was up 17 . Remarkably, the West wasn t driving up the gold price, as demonstrated by UK net exports, declining Western ETF inventory, and falling COMEX open interest.First, the UK s monthly net flows. Obviously, the price wasn t set in London, as the UK was a net seller while the price was up. In Chart 1 and 4 you can see this is unprecedented.Also taking into account gold flows through Switzerland, the second-largest Western  and largest refining hub globally, shows a similar picture. For the first time since monthly data is available, the gold price has been rising over several months, while the UK and Switzerland combined are net exporters.Not surprisingly, Western ETF inventory, of which the majority is stored in London and Switzerland, has declined over the past three quarters.Western institutions that trade gold outright or use ETFs are dominant on the COMEX futures exchange as well. At the COMEX, we see the same development  gold s open interest has fallen over the period in question.If the UK and Switzerland were net exporters, who did they sell to  The UK mainly exported gold to Switzerland, so to answer this question all we have to do is find out which countries Switzerland exported to and check if these countries didn t sell the metal on.The Swiss customs department lets users track the flow of goods per continent. Apparently, Switzerland was a huge net exporter to Asia when the gold price went up.Let s see which of Switzerland s main buyers in Asia could have pushed up the gold price.It wasn t India, as the Indians, like most people in the East, are price sensitive. From October through June, India s net gold imports declined, with the exception of June when the price reverted.Possibly, Chinese private demand somewhat lifted the gold price. Although the Chinese are usually price sensitive, net imports into the mainland were surprisingly strong in November and December 2022, and in February and March 2023.Turkey s net import reached an all-time high in January 2023 when the Turkish lira continued to devalue and the Turks fled to real estate, durable goods and, needless to say, gold. After January, the Turkish central bank began blocking imports and sold 156 tonnes of its official gold reserves domestically to defend the lira. No doubt that Turkish private demand, mainly up until January, has had an impact on the gold price.A proper indicator of a trend reversal is the net flows to Eastern trading hub, Hong Kong. Normally, Hong Kong would be a net importer when the price declines  and vice versa . Recently, however, Hong Kong was a net importer while the price was up. Possibly, central banks are buying in Hong Kong, monetize the gold locally, and repatriate the metal outside the scope of public customs data. Gold owned by central banks  monetary gold  is exempt from being reported in customs data.The tonnages recently net imported by Hong Kong may not be very impressive, but they could be a sign of a larger development. If central banks are buying in Hong Kong, they can be buying anywhere.Major suspects are non-Western central banks secretly buying gold, as dollar assets have become riskier to hold since the US seized Russia s official dollar reserves in 2022. These central banks have an incentive not to make public rushing into gold or the price would spike excessively, giving them less bang for their buck.Every quarter the World Gold Council  WGC  publishes an estimate, based on field research by Metals Focus, that reflects how much they think central banks have bought. Since the Ukraine war, these quarterly estimates are much higher than what central banks in aggregate report to the IMF. Most likely covert central bank purchases have boosted the price.The most logical explanation for gold s recent behavior is a combination of surreptitious buying by central banks from emerging markets, and strong private demand in Turkey and China. It s possible the WGC s estimates of covert central bank buying are too low, given these estimates were falling during the price spike at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023.As some of you might have noticed, the US dollar gold price has been declining in the last months of the period of our investigation, and London was still a net exporter. Perhaps the West will regain control over the price again. I don t expect the gold price to fall to levels previously suggested by the rates model, though.Central bank buying is likely to stay strong.  We still believe that the official sector will remain a sizeable bullion buyer for the foreseeable future  , as factors that encouraged reserve managers to add gold reserves in recent years are expected to persist,   this August.We will have to wait and see if the East is able to further push up the price of gold and weaken the West s control over the price. If so, gold will become less of a dollar derivative, and take more center stage in the international monetary system.

Public Storage: A Simple Question Of Supply And Demand,"Over the long haul, it could be said that betting on the American self-storage space has really been a bet on the American consumer  as people buy more stuff to put in their homes, eventually they'll run out ofA primary beneficiary of this stunning growth is Public Storage , the largest self-storage player in the United States which, as of its , boasted 206 million net rentable square feet of storage space spread across 2,888 facilities, and whose common stock sports a 4.4  dividend yield  as of this writing .The large-scale trends across the country haveFor all of these bullish points, however, the market seems to believe that the outlook for Public Storage is not quite so rosy, as evidenced by the stock's 18.5  decline over the last 12 months.Over the last ten years, in fact, the stock has appreciated 77  versus the broader S P 500's  return of 171 . Reviewing the stock's performance on a total return basis for the same time frame also reveals underperformance for Public Storage with a 158  return against SPY's 225 .While it might be tempting to view the drop in Public Storage's price as a potential buying opportunity, we do not believe that the outlook for the company or the sector to be quite as strong as what the bulls contend. In fact, we think that a few key drivers will precipitate a continued slowdown in Public Storage's business and underperformance in its stock. The main points of our argument are thusLet's dive in.On the , Public Storage management highlighted move in volume, with CEO Joseph Russell noting that  we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14  in the second quarter.While growing volumes of move-ins might generate excitement on a conference call, analysts had questions about the company's move-outs as well. Let's take a dive into the same store net tenant addition metrics for Public Storage's latest quarter.Of Public Storage's 2,888 properties, 2,344  roughly 81  are considered same store, with the remainder in development or having been acquired less than one year ago. In our view, this reflects an aggressive growth strategy on behalf of the company  more on that later . Public Storage posted this chart in its latest quarterly filing, detailing same store data .Note that realized rent per occupied square foot grew overall by 8.3 , average occupancy across all markets declined overall by 2.1 . This indicates that the increase in revenue in the latest reporting period was driven--at least in the same store category--by price hikes to existing customers rather than an increase in new tenants.The picture doesn't get better when analyzing the tenants coming in to replace those that are leaving.As can be seen in the chart above  of the most recent 10Q , new tenants average annual contract rent per square foot decreased year over year by 14.4 , while promotional discounts to new tenants increased by 26.4 . Additionally, the net delta between new contract rents gained year over year versus contract rents lost from move-outs widened significantly, from negative  6 million in the quarter ending June 2022 to negative  29.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2023.In other words, it appears that Public Storage is having difficulty bringing in new tenants at full price, while it continues to raise rates for existing tenants and also experiencing a net decrease in overall tenants as expressed by average occupancy.It is perhaps not surprising that Public Storage is having difficulty with net tenant additions, given that the industry has been building new facilities at a feverish pace to meet demand over the last decade.In any industry, rapid build-outs of supply are driven by demand, but supply takes time to come online, and demand can wane during that time frame, causing supply to overshoot. To frame the situation for the self-storage industry, an estimated  of new storage facility space is expected to be completed in 2023 while the average storage unit price has dropped, according to SpareFoot.com, with the estimated cost to rent a storage unit in 2023 being  100 per month compared to .It's also a murky proposition to assume that Americans who are not yet utilizing storage spaces will suddenly jump on board and become new tenants. Consider our chart belowPictured above is a monthly snapshot of the Public Storage stock price and the Google trend search term 'Self-Storage Near Me' going back to September 2010. While not a perfect correlation, it can clearly be seen that the spike in searches for self-storage  we should note that Public Storage boasts that a large portion of its new move-ins come through its online funnel  in 2021 coincided with a rise in Public Storage's stock price. Searches for storage space has since moderated back towards 2019 levels, which, in our minds, is evidence that Americans are losing steam when it comes to renting new self-storage units.As an aside, we also believe that the stickiness of the self-storage consumer is also somewhat overstated in the bull case. While tenants who store motorhomes or other large items will likely remain for the long term, research from StorageCafe.com shows that most people using storage across the country are . Further, most contracts at self-storage properties are month-to-month with no penalty for cancelling  Public Storage's 10K notes on  that its lease policy is month-to-month .It isn't far fetched to think, then, that tenants could simply sell, discard, or move it back into their living space especially if they are looking to cut roughly  100 in expenses out of their monthly budget  and there is ample  to support the  that  seeking  monthly expenditures .Furthermore, the largest driver of new self-storage rentals comes from tenants moving to a .This, of course, was a boon for the self-storage industry as remote work became all the rage and high-earning white collar workers fled urban  to more rural settings. However, that trend appears to be , and there is plenty of research showing that Americans are moving .While we aren't of the belief that mass amounts of tenants will mount an exodus from self-storage nationwide, we believe that the majority of the facts do not stand in Public Storage's favor.Despite Public Storage's acquisitive nature  recall that roughly 20-25  of its properties are excluded from same store sales , analysts have largely factored out future FFO growth expectations from the stock.Against analyst estimates looking out in the second unreported year of  17.50 per share of FFO, Public Storage stock currently trades at roughly 15.6x FFO Share on a forward basis.Seeking Alpha's  paints a slightly worse picture, showing that the stock trades at 16x forward price to FFO, which is 30.9  above the sector mean.Should the company see its ability to hike prices on existing renters deteriorate, and if net move-ins continue to decline  as we think both will for the reasons outlined above , this will inevitably squeeze margins and Public Storage, which could result in further gloom from analysts in the future.For us, then, we target a 15-20  decline in forward price to FFO valuation as a good point to re-evaluate Public Storage's situation against the macroeconomic backdrop.It is difficult to grow a business with a relatively fixed cost structure while large amounts of new supply are set to come online amidst signs of waning demand. This is the situation that we believe Public Storage finds itself in today. For the reasons outlined in this article, we remain negative on the stock.

Rising U.S. Treasury Yields Do Some Of The Fed's Heavy Lifting,"I love it when I can figure out a way to work more efficiently or, even better, get someone to do my work for me. The less I have to do, the better. I think the US Federal Reserve  Fed  agrees. After all, when it comes toWhen someone is happy to do your work for you, I think that s a good thing. I ve mentioned before how my oldest son used to prefer cleaning with his grandmother to playing with toys when he was a toddler. My husband was uncomfortable with this, but IIt seems the Fed has found a  helper  of sorts as well in the rising 10-year yield  and one that s a bit more effective than a three-year-old armed with Windex and paper towels . Different Fed members have said as much in recent days, and even Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening.There are a variety of reasons for this increase. The 10-year US Treasury yield is composed of two drivers  1  it s influenced by short-term rates  which is fairly straightforward  and 2  it factors in a  term premium  that investors demand for holding onto a bond for that long. That term premium reflects everything else that could occur over the life of the bond, including growth expectations and inflation expectations. Recently, inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, and so we need to look to other factors to explain the rise in long yieldsOf course, there is a countervailing force that can push down yields, and has done so on at least a few days since the conflict in the Middle East began  a preference for  safe haven  asset classes. There have been concerns that this crisis could be contagious and expand to involve other countries, which has fueled a move to Treasuries on several days since the conflict began. Although there has been far more of a preference for gold as a safe haven asset class, preferences can change - especially since the opportunity cost of owning gold is higher as yields rise.The rising 10-year yield is arguably a positive development in that it means the Fed doesn t have to hike rates anymore and therefore hastens the end of the tightening cycle, in my opinion. In other words, it s ripping the band-aid off. However, it s also exerting downward pressure on stocks. And when I talk to clients outside the US, they worry about the impact that higher mortgage rates, driven up by the 10-year US Treasury yield, will have on American consumers.But while the national average 30-year US fixed mortgage rate just hit 8 , a level that has not been seen in many years, I don t think it will have a very significant impact on US households. That s because more than 90  of existing mortgages in the US are long-term fixed-rate mortgages - with an average rate below 4  - so rising rates will not impact US households the way they have impacted households in other countries that do not have the exorbitant privilege of long-term fixed-rate mortgages. Or the way they impacted US households in advance of the Global Financial Crisis, when nearly 40  of existing mortgages were adjustable-rate. In fact, past due residential real estate loans have declined since mid-2020.The biggest result of high mortgage rates may be a low inventory of houses for sale, since many homeowners are unwilling to put their houses on the market with rates so high. The environment has created  golden handcuffs  for them.Policy uncertainty is likely to create an environment in which the 10-year yield will continue to move in a wide range in the near term. But I believe once we get clarity from the Fed that the rate hike cycle has ended, then I think we will see yields begin to ease.  In other words, I think sky-high long-term yields are likely to be very temporary.I think we are likely to get policy clarity in the next few months. After all, I thought it was meaningful that Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Wage growth is typically the stickiest part of inflation, so that suggests the Fed is content with progress made in the labor market - all the more reason they shouldn t need to hike rates again.And while the Fed may continue to talk tough in the short term  and we got a lot of tough talk in Powell s speech last week , I think it will be quick to recognize signs of the lagged effects of monetary policy on the economy, as I believe a very real slowdown  a bumpy landing  is coming. The very data-dependent Fed should soon realize there is no need for more rate hikes - and that there will likely be a need for at least one rate cut before the end of the first half of 2024. I believe higher oil prices will also weigh down on the US consumer and do some of the Fed s work for it.US stocks are likely to come under pressure in the near term as the 10-year yield remains high and perhaps moves slightly higher. Last week, the S P 500 Index fell more than 2 , down to 4,224 - which marks its lowest level since June 1. But I have to put this all in perspective  it is well below its peak of 4796 on January 3, 2022, but is well above its closing low of 3,577 on October 12, 2022. I think it is telling us that the recession that was priced in last year with an approximately 25  drop in the S P 500 is being replaced with a slowdown, being forecasted by a milder drop in the S P 500 this year.At the expense of sounding like a broken record, I see this as an environment that reminds us of the importance of broad diversification across and within not just equities and fixed income, but alternatives.After a flurry of data releases last week, I m primarily waiting to see what the Federal Open Market Committee decides to do in its meeting on Nov. 1.But there are some important data points and events between now and then Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Federal Reserve Board of Governors Summary of Economic Projections, Sept. 20, 2023, and Summary of Economic Projections, June 14, 2023 Sources  JP Morgan, Refinitiv Datastream, and Invesco Global Market Strategy Office, as of Oct. 20, 2023 Source  Bankrate, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Sources  Invesco, Macrobond, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  Freddie Mac , as of Sept. 31, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 20, 2023NA3186789Header image  archives   GettyPast performance is not a guarantee of future results.An investment cannot be made into an index.This does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor.

TORM: The Comeback Is Unfolding,"You are reading my 4th article on TORM plc  - one of the world's largest transporters of refined oil products, operating in various vessel segments from Medium Range to Long Range 2 tankers.I first wrote aboutToday, I'd like to update my coverage again as the tanker transportation market is changing quite dynamically and the, TORM reported its strongest performance ever, building on a strong 1st quarter. They achieved a TCE of  308 million, with an EBITDA result of  237 million  with a margin of 61.6  vs. 45.3  last year . After adjusting for unrealized gains, EBITDA increased by 23  to  199 million, and profit before tax increased by 72  to  184 million compared to Q2 FY2022As the management noted during , TORM's return on invested capital amounted to 33.9  in Q2  vs. 22.7  last year , and its balance sheet remained strong with a net LTV ratio of 29  and available liquidity of  497 million. The board of directors approved a dividend of  1.5 per share based on the second quarter results TORM has taken delivery of several vessels and entered into collaborations to enhance their fleet's performance. They mentioned .The executives emphasize the importance of the product tanker order book, which is currently at 10  of the fleet. It's spread across 3.5 years of deliveries, translating to a relatively low annualized growth rate  any new orders won't be delivered before 2026 . This implies that the market may not see significant new supply in the near term, supporting current rates.So the financial outlook for the remainder of FY2023 was  bullish,  so to speak, as TORM expects significant earnings day coverage at favorable rates. As of August 14, 2023, the company had already secured 72  of its full-year earning days and 74  of its Q3 earning days. While these rates provide a foundation, TORM acknowledges the potential for market rates to vary significantly, given the low visibility of unfixed TCE rates. Their outlook for FY2023 anticipates TCE in the range of  1,050-1,175 million and EBITDA ranging from  775-900 million. These projections reflect the current fleet size, considering vessel acquisitions and divestments.I like to check management's statements for realism by comparing their forecasts with third-party research, and if we're talking about shipping, BIMCO analysts, whose research is regularly publicly available, are one of the leading representatives of independent opinion  as far as I know . Analyst Niels Rasmussen updated , pointing to a serious imbalance of supply and demand in this market.While time charter rates are below their late 2022 peak, they are still well above 2022 levels, and used vessel prices have increased, underscoring the strength of the market and positive future expectations. Given the limited supply growth expected in 2024 and rising cargo volumes, BIMCO's outlook stayed optimistic. However, risks remain, with Chinese demand and economic indicators playing a key role in shaping future market conditions.The strength of the market can be seen in the latest data and in the behavior of fleet utilization  , MR utilization rates are currently at all-time highs  as of October 15From this, I conclude that TRMD's internal outlook is close to reality and that the company will indeed be able to achieve its projected EBITDA of  837.5 million for FY2023  the mid-range .Just like a few months ago, Seeking Alpha's Quant System, which  of picking promising stocks, gives TRMD stock an , which is absolutely solidAt the moment, TRMD is trading at about 4x of next year's EV EBITDA. Is that a lot or a little  In absolute terms, that looks cheap. But compared to the rest of the industry, it's slightly above averageIn terms of dividend yield, however, TRMD outperforms its peers, although its double-digit FCF yield is the smallest of allGiven its huge dividend yield, TRMD still appears to be a fairly cheap option among clean tankers, and as the positive trends in the industry continue, I expect that dividend yield to be quite well protected. This should ultimately attract more income-seeking investors and drive the share price higher - those who buy early will see a much higher total return, in my opinion.Of course, investing in TRMD stock carries several inherent risks that every investor should take into account. First off, the shipping industry's susceptibility to market volatility and cyclicality means that TORM's performance can be greatly influenced by fluctuations in freight rates, economic conditions, and oil prices. Regulatory and environmental compliance requirements may lead to increased operating costs, and TORM's substantial debt could pose financial risks, especially during extended periods of low rates. Intense competition, geopolitical instability, and the potential impacts of changing interest rates and exchange rates further underscore the risk profile of investing in TRMD stock. So prior to investing in TRMD or any stock, diligent research and consideration of one's risk tolerance are crucial.However, despite the associated risks, I remain confident that the stock rebound I anticipated for TRMD back in July is still in progress, and it is far too premature for it to halt. The current dividend yield is a result of market strength, but even if it falls to , it is still over 15  in FY2024, which is very, very generous at the company's current valuation of 4x EV EBITDA.Therefore, I reiterate my  Buy  rating and expect a double-digit total return from TRMD stock over the next 12 months.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Disney:Why You Should Buy And Hold Forever,"Although Fact Set breaks down the revenues into a few different subcategories, Disney generally classifies them as DMED for the media side and DPEP for the parks and hotel side. The DMED business represented about 35  of total operating income for FY22 and DPEP 65 . So in this case we have huge revenues with slim margins on the media business and lower revenues with higher margins on the parks entertainment and retail side.The equation here for a turnaround looks quite clear, enhance the parks business with greater CAPEX and cut the fat on the media side now that a customer base has been established. The linear media business also needs to be slowly merged into the  Web Based Data and Services  portion, or streaming. No small feat. However, Netflix has shown us that fairly high operating and profit margins can be achieved in direct-to-consumer streaming. Replicating it is the ultimate goal.Disney  was launched on November 12, 2019. This combined with park closures during Covid and the departure of Iger resulted in negative profit margins for a short stint. The recovery has been slow and not entirely pretty.Back to Netflix as a comp for what all streaming services aim to achieve. While Netflix has been around longer than 2009, streaming was introduced during this period. It took the good part of 7 years to achieve a steady upward trajectory for positive margin trends while the company also began to phase out the physical disk business. I wasn't even aware, but Netflix still mailed DVDs up to September of this year. Any dying business will have a long tail and take time to phase out.That being said, part of the difficult trek to profitability for Netflix had to do with the adoption of streaming. Luckily streaming has now become the norm, so Disney does not have to fight that battle. Streaming competition is also more fierce than ever, but Netflix has built a blueprint that should speed up the process to ascending margins in about half the time as it took Netflix. If it took Netflix 7 years, I'd like to think Disney could start that trajectory in 3.5-4 years. We should be near the sweet spot for margin improvement.In my previous article, I looked at Disney primarily on an asset basis. Since then, the price-to-book value has hit even further lows. Being that Disney is in a turnaround phase, with lots of write-offs and expenses, I used a modified Graham number using the book value and EBITDA per share as a proxy to income. Here is an update on that model for where we stand todayIn my bull case price model I will be making the following 2025 future assumptions using a Buffett Owner Earnings Model with TTM numbers bumped up by 10All numbers in millionsThis is not the first time I have written about Disney. I am very interested in keeping myself abreast of the company since it has become one of my larger holdings. Having traveled extensively, I would have to say that Disney has maintained its brand appeal internationally even though it has deteriorated domestically. It is still one of the first places on the list to visit should a foreign national set foot in one of the various locations that have a Disney Park.As someone who leans to the right side of the political spectrum, I also acknowledge what some of my readers have pointed out, some liberal, US-based issues have seeped into the Disney media content. This is not prescient throughout the rest of the world where Disney is known solely for its Parks, Hotels, and retail products.I have seen recent feature-length films put out by Disney, and while they were not all that impressive, none of them struck me as agenda-based either. I must also admit that I do not stream Disney  or subscribe to the linear segments, but supply and demand should eventually reconfigure the offerings to a nice happy middle. Simply put, we are all customers, and business survival will eventually come down to pleasing all of your customers. Our demand will eventually modify the supply. The beauty of a capitalist economy is that the customer eventually wins in the end. The only way we don't is if there is someone willing to subsidize an agenda.Commentary courtesy of The YOY reduction in subscribers has not gone over well as evidenced by Disney share price trends. However, Disney and other streaming services are going the route of higher monetization per user at this point versus service price cuts to attract a greater number of eyeballs. This is bound to happen as price increases take hold and ads are placed across all the platforms.Disney also has the advantage as evidenced by the Charter deal, to migrate their content to other streaming services outside of Disney  where companies like Netflix do not enjoy that advantage. While they may not increase their subscriber revenue through this, the ad revenue will still be theirs. Ads on streaming will be the new norm and the key to higher margins.Disney is looking to Double Down on the Long term debt has seen a decline from its peak at near  60 Billion, now down to  48 Billion. Current assets are solid at near  30 Billion. The EBIT net interest expense ratio is a healthy 5x. Not amazing, but ample coverage.

AMD's Consolidation Presents Strong Price Development (Technical Analysis),"  is scheduled to  for Q3 2023 post-market on October 31, 2023. While the company anticipates growth in both revenue and earnings due to robust product demand, there are heightened risks stemmingIn , AMD delivered commendable revenue figures, further cementing its pivotal position in the semiconductor sector. Even with an operating deficit, the company's financial results were noteworthy, particularly from a non-GAAP perspective. This piece picks up from my , offering an updated snapshot and highlighting potential investment avenues for long-term investors. Notably, the stock price has held its ground, and its consolidation at crucial thresholds suggests a bullish price development.In Q2 2023, AMD reported a  of  5.4 billion, marking a notable presence in the semiconductor industry. Their official releaseDr. Lisa Su, AMD's Chair and CEO, emphasized the significant ramping up of 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors. A massive increase was observed in AI engagements, with a seven-fold rise during this quarter alone. This was attributed to customers initiating or expanding their programs, primarily supporting the future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. The company is also gearing up for the launch and ramp-up of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Segment-wise, the Data Center segment revenue came in at  1.3 billion, a decline of 11  YoY, yet a sequential increase of 2 . Despite facing a drop of 54  YoY due to a weaker PC market and supply chain inventory corrections, the Client segment managed a sequential growth of 35 . Moreover, the Gaming segment faced a 4  YoY decline, with its revenue being  1.6 billion. In contrast, the Embedded segment saw an uplifting 16  YoY increase, totaling a revenue of  1.5 billion.Significant events and strategic movements also marked Q2 2023. At the Data Center and AI Technology Premier event, AMD unveiled two new 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors optimized for different workloads. Some of the event's other highlights were partnerships with industry leaders such as Hugging Face and PyTorch and robust networking portfolios. Cloud giants like AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft Azure, and OCI embraced 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors for new instances. Gaming and commercial PC users also have new products to look forward to, with the introduction of the Ryzen Z1 Series processors and the Radeon  RX 7600 graphics card.Strategically, AMD is set to invest  135 million to amplify its adaptive computing research in Ireland, targeting next-gen AI, data centers, and 6G communication infrastructure. Finally, the appointment of Phil Guido as the chief commercial officer, coming from a 30-year tenure at IBM, promises to bring in fresh strategic insights for AMD's global operations.AMD is scheduled to announce the Q3 2023 earnings on 31 October 2023. For Q3 2023, AMD expects growth in both revenue and earnings owing to solid demand for its products. The revenue is expected to hover around the  5.7 billion mark, with a potential variation of  300 million. Additionally, the company projects its non-GAAP gross margin to be close to 51 . Surpassing these expectations with positive results could significantly boost AMD's stock price.In the previous article, a deep dive was taken into the pronounced bullish trends observed in yearly and quarterly charts. The article emphasized how the notable downturn of 2022 was counteracted by strong bullish formations, suggesting a potential rise in momentum. This steep decline in 2022 can be traced back to the wick on 2021's yearly candle. Further insights from the quarterly charts revealed a pronounced breakout from the 38.2  Fibonacci retracement mark at  102.25. This threshold was pivotal for bullish momentum, and a second consecutive quarterly close above it only solidified this perspective.Additionally, the critical reversal candle touching a low of  54.57, backed by staunch support at the 61.8  Fibonacci retracement of  63.83, suggests that the bottom was hit, and an upward trajectory was expected. The weekly chart corroborated this bullish view, showcasing a completed inverted head and shoulders and a descending broadening wedge. It's also worth noting that any monthly close below  102.25 could hint at further declines. Yet, with September 2023 closing at  102.82, the market seems to maintain its bullish stance. To sum it up, the prior article posited that the price adjustment in AMD offers a prime buying opportunity for long-term investors.As previously discussed, AMD has held its pivotal levels and now exhibits a more bullish trajectory. The monthly chart below showcases the long-term foundational development from 2001 to 2019. This robust foundation was surpassed in 2019, marked by the red trendline, which served as the bullish base's neckline. Leading up to this breakthrough, the price had carved an ascending broadening wedge delineated by the blue trendlines. When these patterns were surmounted, the stock witnessed a significant upward movement.Several factors fueled this surge. At the forefront, AMD experienced a surge in demand for its Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, allowing it to snatch market shares from its rivals in desktop and data center domains. These products' standout performance and efficiency branded AMD as a potent contender against established market leaders. Furthermore, the global semiconductor landscape saw a general uptick, propelled by the digital revolution during COVID-19, growing cloud computing needs, and the increasing integration of electronics across industries. AMD's strategic alliances, relentless innovation, and successful roadmap implementation amplified investor trust, reflected in the stock's impressive performance during this period.Nevertheless, as highlighted in the previous discussion, the market's robust correction halted at  54.56. This bounce-back is a positive sign, hinting at a potential upward journey. Moreover, the RSI on the monthly chart is comfortably above 50.Conversely, the updated weekly chart highlights the stock's challenge in sustaining above the blue trendline. The pullback from the peak of  132.83 is attributed to fulfilling the descending broadening wedge pattern's target. Additionally, the RSI has edged above its midpoint, suggesting potential support at this crucial level.Moreover, the latest market pullback is better visualized on the subsequent weekly chart. It reveals a correction from  132.83 that has formed a bull flag pattern. A breach above  125 could potentially trigger a significant upward rally. The observation underlines the bullish stance for AMD, reinforced by a pronounced inverted head and shoulders pattern with the head at  54.57 and shoulders at  71.60 and  81.02, combined with the emerging bullish flag.Investors may consider increasing long positions at the present rates, given that the consolidation at critical levels, coupled with the appearance of a bull flag and inverted head and shoulders, signals an upward momentum.Various factors, including global supply chain dynamics and inventory adjustments, threaten AMD's performance and stability. The notable 54  YoY drop in the Client segment due to a struggling PC market and supply chain inventory changes underscores this vulnerability. While the company has shown the capability to manage certain industry pitfalls, continued disruptions or any imbalance between supply and demand can jeopardize its revenue, profit margins, and its place in the competitive landscape.External macroeconomic factors, such as potential economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, and unexpected global incidents, can further unsettle AMD's operations and stock value. The competitive landscape is also challenging, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Intel's earnings. Underperformance against these market expectations, especially in critical areas like data centers or client sales, can cause significant stock price fluctuations. Additionally, the possibility of competitors introducing groundbreaking technologies or aggressive pricing strategies remains a consistent threat to AMD's market dominance. On a technical note, if the stock closes below  102.25 in a month, it could drop to  63.82, but a monthly close beneath  63.83 would challenge the long-term optimistic forecast.AMD displayed a robust revenue performance in Q2 2023, asserting its prominence in the semiconductor sector. While the company faced particular challenges, such as an operating loss, its non-GAAP figures and continued growth under Dr. Lisa Su's leadership spotlight its potential and adaptability. The introduction of the latest EPYC and Ryzen processors, coupled with a significant rise in AI engagements, underscores AMD's forward momentum. Various segments within the company showed mixed results, with major product releases and strategic partnerships further enhancing the company's market position. AMD's upcoming investment in Ireland showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in adaptive computing. However, the future brings both optimistic projections and uncertainties due to broader economic influences.From a technical standpoint, AMD displays a robust bullish trend through pronounced price patterns. The appearance of the inverted head and shoulders combined with the bull flag formation bolsters the bullish argument presented in the previous article. As a result, investors might think about increasing long positions to capitalize on the potential upward surge. AMD is set to reveal its Q3 2023 earnings in a few days, which could catalyze AMD's next significant movement.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Sociedad Química Y Minera De Chile: Get Ready To Buy,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  shares have derated on falling LCE  Lithium Carbonate Equivalent  prices and concession renewal or nationalization risk. In addition I see potential for downgrades post 3Q23 results on high consensus estimates. However, the sharesEV auto sales and penetration are  than anticipated. Falling car prices, higher fuel costs, government rebates, and charging infrastructure expansion have combined toAfter skyrocketing to over US 80kg,  are back to a healthier US 20kg as supply and demand balanced. For SQM this is a sweet spot that allows for over 40  gross margins, free cash flow to continue to fund expansion, and keeps higher cost assets from entering the market at a reckless pace. at US 20kg makes many key   without subsidies  and with high environmental costs, according to recent data by  and . If spot prices continue to decline, new capacity may get stalled or need to look for long-term supply contracts to fund mines and chemical conversion.In addition, LCE is not yet a commodity like oil or copper, actual transactions and the ability to hedge, and buy forward contracts, are in diapers. The market is still largely based on bilateral negotiations between mining companies, chemical converters, battery makers, and automakers. Demand in China may have paused but in the USA and Europe, it's increasing. In my view, the China spot price is a guide but not likely what SQM or other non-China companies are realizing with customers.A process that promises to further enhance the cost competitiveness of brines vs rock or clay lithium fields. As illustrated in an  by Goldman Sachs , the Latin American brines could expand share via low-cost environmentally benign technology. DLE may reduce processing time and increase yields. Thus, if and when SQM can renew its concession that would very likely be accompanied by a DLE expansion project and enhance capacity and cost competitiveness.Post 2Q23 guidance I have adjusted volumes and now I assume a lower LCE price of US 20kg going forward  vs 30k in 2H23 . This may reduce gross margins from 50  to 40  as seen in the table below. Note that cash cost estimates decline in YE24 as new capacity comes online. SQM has been growing very rapidly adding costs faster than revenue that can't always be capexed.For the other segments of the company, I assume Iodine continues to see near US 70kg prices and over 60  margins. Specialty fertilizers and Potash improve on higher agricultural and natural gas prices while industrial chemicals are flat. I continue to value SQM at 10x EV EBITDA, this has been it's historic multiple and coincides with a DFC valuation and long term growth rates. However, the market has de rated SQM down to 5x and the consensus price target uses an implied 5.8x multiple. This de-rating is also evident in many peers such as Albemarle , Livent , Ganfeng  and Tianqi. Part of the rationale for this lower multiple is that LCE prices spiked and would fall, which they have. Yet the market continues to discount the sector due to price volatility, much as is seen in the oil and iron ore sector. However, I believe this sector should not be considered a pure commodity given that LCE, or Lithium Carbonate Equivalent as the name implies, is not pure lithium, this is a specialty chemical compound with varying formulations.The second reason for SQMs derating is due to recent political risk, the famous nationalization threat. This is very unlikely to come to fruition for many reasons, the primary one is that the current government has almost zero political power and no budget to acquire SQM's assets at a reasonable price. At present there is no bill in front of Congress to enact its  take over  proposal of lithium assets via joint ventures where the government controls the assets  51  but does not contribute capital. The only action reported by SQM and in the media is that Codelco  national copper mining company  has been tasked with negotiating the concession renewal  which expires in 2030 . In my view, Chile is not going to nationalize anything.When if the concession renewal is announced the valuation may jump several points, which would also be positive for ALB. There is considerable upside risk to SQM's valuation.My current estimates, that use LCE prices of US 20kg from 3Q23 forward, are at the low end of consensus. This is a problem, if SQM does realize LCE prices at this level, there could be a rash of downgrades that would not be positive for the shares. Thus, it may be worthwhile waiting for 3Q23 result before buying the stock.Buy SQM post 3Q23 results. Consensus may need to correct for lower LCE prices. However, at US 20kg for LCE prices going forward, SQMs valuation is cheap at 5x EV EBITDA, which has room to re-rate on less volatile LCE prices and more importantly, resolution of the concession renewal.

There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,"There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts  REITs  between  and .Second-quarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12-month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  to that of the S P 500  and Nasdaq 100-Index The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and long-lasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run. Therefore, many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for value.We think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLet's address all three points and finish by taking a look at five high-quality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performances.On the first point, if you watch financial media for any length of time, you'll inevitably hear commentators equating  commercial real estate  with office buildings, and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environment.Even industry insiders sometimes equate the two. See, for example, the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate RoundtableThe survey is about  CRE, but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CRE.What about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which they're located  Keep in mind that most non-office real estate properties, and most of the properties in REITs' portfolios, are located  of downtown areas.It isn't a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from  commercial real estate  to  REITs.  You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal office.While office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID-19, occupancy of apartments, retail, and industrial remains at or near their highs.The market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates, almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higher.But the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs. Most of them do a very good job at this.Hence we find that REITs' total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID-19Moreover, REITs' weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years, and  generally speaking  relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year. During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021, REITs very actively refinanced debt, pushing out maturity dates as far as they could. Many of them, like Alexandria Real Estate  and NNN REIT  refinanced expiring debt with 30-year bonds during that period.That is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs' debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surged.Of course, the longer interest rates remain elevated, the higher their weighted average interest rates will go. But while higher rates are a short-term headwind, they can be a long-term tailwind, because of the next point.In the long run, higher interest rates  combined with higher labor and construction costs  act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs, because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to market.As we all learned in Econ 101, the economy is basically operated on supply and demand. If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows, the price typically goes up. This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economy.When interest rates and input costs go up, development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt, which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the road.That's exactly what we've seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industry.Here's a chart showing sentiment among CRE developers related to their views of whether various components will be higher or lower in 12 months' time.As you can see, over the past year, they have mostly viewed occupancy and rents as headed higher while construction and labor costs have likewise headed higher. Only recently have developers started to see the light at the end of the tunnel for construction costs -- envisioning an end to materials cost increases.What does this do to development activity  It causes much less of it to be greenlit.Take a look at this chart of industrial  on the left  and multifamily  on the right  construction starts going back 10 yearsAlthough starts spiked in 2021 and early 2022, they have since  to very low levels as the costs of land, labor, materials, and capital have soared. The same thing is happening all across the CRE spectrum right now. Very few new projects are breaking ground for any type of real estate.What does this mean for REITs  It means that after the  manageable  wave of new supply of properties comes to market this year and next year, there will be a steep drop-off in 2025-2026 and potentially beyond that.Less supply combined with growing demand should result in rising rent rates.Let's briefly look at five REITs that we believe exhibit this huge mismatch between strong fundamental performance and weak investor sentiment. To illustrate, we'll just use one valuation metric  price to operating cash flow  or  CFO , because cash flow is one of real estate's primary channels of delivering returns.First off   , a triple-net lease REIT focused on investment grade, single-tenant retail properties leased to the nation's leading retailers like Walmart , T.J. Maxx , Tractor Supply Co. , and Home Depot .ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating, very little debt maturing before 2028, the highest quality tenant roster in the net lease REIT space, and a skilled management team. And yet, ADC is near its cheapest valuation of any time in the last five years.At a price of around  69, ADC trades at a price to AFFO of 17.5x, compared to its 5-year average of 19.6x.Next up, consider  , the only pure-play life science REIT that owns and develops state-of-the-art, Class A research   development properties in the nation's most innovative research clusters. The REIT just  an earnings beat on continued strong demand for its top-tier lab space, even if leasing and rent rate growth is normalizing from its elevated, COVID-era levels. ARE also enjoys a BBB  credit rating and no debt maturing before 2025.And yet, partially in response to activist REIT investor Jonathan Litt's short report, the REIT trades near its lowest valuation in 5 years.At a price of  127.50, ARE trades at a price to AFFO of 16.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 25.5x.Much the same could be said about US-based telecommunications REIT  , which owns a vast network of wireless towers, small cells, and fiber across the country. The market seems to be focused on the fact that management slightly trimmed AFFO per share guidance for 2023, lowering their growth estimate from 3  to 2 .Moreover, the market also seems pessimistic about management's repeated assertion that CCI will be able to return to growth after 2025, when the last of Sprint's lease cancellations take effect. Given the huge rise in mobile data usage and carriers' need to continue investing to facilitate that traffic, I believe management in their assertion that dividend growth will return to 7-8  annually in 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, CCI's BBB credit rating and modest debt maturities in 2023-2024 exude strength.And yet, CCI's valuation has gone off a cliffAt a price of  112.50, CCI trades at a price to AFFO of 14.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 23.0x.Turning to the self-storage space, we believe one of the strongest names in this area is  , which recently solidified its scale advantage by acquiring peer Life Storage. EXR now commands the  1 market share in U.S. self-storage at 13.2  of the market. Like ARE, EXR's ultra-strong pandemic-era performance is in the process of normalizing, especially as the housing market cools and fewer people are moving. EXR also enjoys a BBB credit rating and a manageable amount of debt maturing this year and next year.And yet, the market is valuing EXR  than it did prior to COVID-19.At a price of  144.50, EXR trades at a price to AFFO of 17.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 22.3x.Finally, in the industrial space, consider  , the premier owner of high-quality, infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained Southern California market. Management calls the industrial supply shortage in Southern California  virtually incurable,  and this shortage has spurred peer-leading rent and NOI growth. Over the last five years, REXR's NOI has grown at a CAGR of 39 , and after Q2 2023, in-place rents on its existing portfolio remained 50  below market, implying significant organic growth ahead.REXR is truly firing on all cylinders while also enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in REITdom with a BBB  credit rating, and yet the market is pricing it significantly  than it was before COVID-19.At a price of  56.75, REXR trades at a price to AFFO of 26.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 39.5x.REIT fundamentals across almost all sectors remain strong, and the decrease in development activity today implies that a favorable supply environment will be in effect in a few years' time. And yet, the market is pricing many top-tier REITs as if growth is coming to an end and temporarily elevated interest rates will permanently eat into REITs' profits.As for us at High Yield Landlord, we will follow the fundamentals, not investor sentiment.If you want full access to our Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us at High Yield Landlord for a We are the largest and best-rated real estate investor community on Seeking Alpha with 2,500  members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 500  reviewsYou won't be charged a penny during the free trial, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Jussi Askola is the President of Leonberg Capital, a value-oriented investment boutique that consults hedge funds, family offices, and private equity firms on REIT investing.

What I Wish I Knew Before Buying High Yield Stocks,"Thanks to the rapid rise of interest rates over the past year and a half, alongside geopolitical, inflationary, and other macroeconomic headwinds, high yield stocks have rarely been more attractively priced than they are today. Just take a look at what some ofClearly, there is an attractive combination of value and quality available in the high yield space. That said, the sector is far from a guaranteed ticket to financial independence and riches. For every high quality and sustainable high yield stock out there, there are many more that are ticking time bombs. As a result, while high yield investing can certainly be a very lucrative and rewarding approach to investing, it a requires knowledgeable, prudent approach to avoid suffering large long-term losses.Here are two lessons that I wish I had learned before investing in high yielding stocksMany times, management teams will make rosy projections about their company's ability to deliver strong long-term growth alongside paying out a very attractive dividend. While management does  hopefully  have the clearest view of the performance of and outlook for their business, they do not always share an honest assessment of the true state of their business. Sometimes, they may even be giving their best assessment, but they lack the foresight to properly understand the macroeconomic and or competitive threats coming their way.Two classic examples of this from my own experience were Algonquin Power   Utilities  and Lumen Technologies .AQN had a very impressive history of delivering a consistent  10  dividend per share CAGR over the course of about a decade. The company had a robust growth pipeline fueled by a powerful one-two punch of its renewables business segment and its regulated utilities business segment. Moreover, it had an investment grade balance sheet and the dividend yield looked quite attractive at over 5  following a pullback in the stock price. With management continuing to guide for robust dividend growth in the years to come, I bought shares, taking management at its word.However, if I had taken more care to look under the hood, I would have seen that they actually had considerable exposure to floating interest rates and were taking on a lot of leverage to finance their aggressive growth pipeline. With interest rates soaring in 2022, AQN got caught swimming naked when the tide went out  to borrow from a . As a result, it was forced to slash its dividend and the stock price plunged, burning me and many other gullible investors who had trusted management's guidance.Fortunately, in the case of LUMN, I sold before the massive dividend cut, but this was another case of a company that continued to speak glowingly of its strong growth potential that would be fueled by the  4th Industrial Revolution  all while also pitching its  1 per share dividend as a top capital allocation priority that would be sustained through the pivot to growth.Once management quietly removed this priority from its slide show, I asked the company point blank about it, and they tried to talk around it. Thankfully, I sensed something was going on and sold my shares, and sure enough, shortly thereafter, management not only cut the dividend, but actually totally eliminated it. Since then, the stock has completely cratered as it has failed miserably in its efforts to pivot to growth. Sadly, investors who failed to jump ship have been burned badly as over the past year LUMN stock has lost over 84  of its value.While management guidance and commentary can be very useful, never ever take it as gospel truth. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions when you get a chance to speak to a company. Oftentimes, how they answer questions on earnings calls and when you speak with them says as much, if not more, than what they actually say.Another lesson I wish that I had learned before investing in high yield stocks is that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors. Yes, I am a bottom-up investor who focuses on company-level fundamentals and valuations when making investment decisions and I generally do not make macroeconomic forecasts and therefore do not make my investment decisions based on where I think the economy is headed. However, that does not mean that I should be totally blind to what is happening in the broader economy when allocating capital.What I mean by this is that sometimes it is clear what is going on in the broader economy and what the ramifications will be for a stock in my portfolio. Even if the stock looks deeply undervalued and likely to deliver attractive returns over the course of a full economic cycle, it may be apparent that the current economic situation will cause excessive distress for the business. As a result, market sentiment may be highly likely to remain negative on the stock for the foreseeable future and in some cases, a dividend cut may be highly likely as well, further exacerbating market sentiment.A classic example of this was recently seen in the apparel sector. A stock that I owned was Hanesbrands . It had recently brought on an impressive new CEO who was previously a senior executive at Walmart  and was implementing an impressive plan to improve the company's brands, supply chain, and operating efficiencies. However, it quickly became apparent that a perfect storm of macro events was transpiring that were leading to an unmistakable solution. Inflation was soaring, interest rates were spiking, a prolonged imbalance in supply and demand, and an out of the blue cyber-attack on the company exacerbated its fairly heavily leveraged balance sheet and left management with little choice but to eliminate the dividend. Throughout this entire process the stock price continued to plummet, yet, given my focus on the long-term disconnect between supply and demand and principled agnostic approach to macro factors, I held the whole way down through the dividend cut. Given that I am an income investor, I ended up selling the stock after the dividend was eliminated.In hindsight, I should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier in the process and sold the stock at a much smaller loss than I ended up doing after the dividend was eliminated. Granted, I got lucky and was able to recycle the capital into New York Community Bancorp  right near its bottom during the March crash in the banking sector, leading to me gaining back much of my losses on HBI in short order. However, my handling of the HBI investment was still a clear mistake. Was my initial investment a mistake in the sense that my reasoning was wrong  I don't believe so. The fundamentals and valuation seemed to clearly indicate that HBI was undervalued, but the macroeconomic and black swan factors - which are highly unpredictable - conspired against it and sent the stock tumbling. This is just part of investing and is why I diversify my portfolio. However, my mistake was holding HBI for as long as I did despite the clear headwinds facing the stock. I should have just eaten my losses and moved on at a much earlier stage in the process.Now is clearly an exceptional time to invest in high yield stocks given where valuations sit. However, investors should not jump in head first into the sector recklessly. Many high yield stocks are high yield for a reason.While I certainly value management's opinion and listen closely to the earnings calls, investor presentations, and the answers they give in my interviews with them, I have learned the hard way that just because a management team says that its high yield is  safe  does not mean that it really is.Moreover, while I am a big believer in taking a bottom-up approach to investing and not making investment decisions based on macroeconomic forecasts, I also believe that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors once it becomes obvious that they are going to force one of your holdings to slash its dividend and potentially even face financial distress.By taking these lessons along with many others into account when investing in high yield stocks, investors can avoid painful dividend cuts and the steep principal losses that almost always accompany them.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Tesla: Onward And Upward,"During 3Q23,   produced 430,488 vehicles and delivered 435,059. Last quarter, the company produced and delivered 479,700 and 466,140 automobiles. The sequential decline was anticipated, as TSLA had announced downtime at its production facilities for upgrades duringTSLA is  Q3 2023 financial results on or about October 19. For the period, analysts anticipate  24.7 billion in revenues and  0.65 in GAAP earnings per share. Based on the number of Teslas delivered during the quarter, we expect actual results to come in below consensus estimates, on the top line and bottom line. However, although we anticipate a decline in revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to the shortfall in the sequentialWith respect to margins, despite the softer revenues, we expect higher gross margins on a sequential basis, driven by the increase in Model Y MSRP, decrease in commodity prices, labor efficiencies due to greater automation, and depreciation. However, profit margins are likely to come in lighter on a quarter-over-quarter basis, based on expenses related to the ramp in production associated with the Cybertruck and the Megapack, as well as additional spending on artificial intelligence. Consequently, earnings per share are likely to decline compared to the previous quarter, while coming in higher than a year ago.Considering that the TSLA story has not radically shifted during the third quarter, we reiterate our  492 share Price Target derived utilizing a 10-year Discounted Cash Flow model, that incorporates a 10-year normalized revenue growth rate of 50 , a profit margin of 10 , operating cash flow margin of 18 , yearly capital expenditures of 2 , average cost of capital of 7 , and a perpetual growth rate of 3 . Reiterate Buy Rating. With whispers that Cybertruck launch paraphernalia is being sent out, it appears that the vehicle's debut event is drawing close. Given that pick-up truck sales account for 20  of the U.S. automobile market, the lack of a pick-up truck among TSLA's models was a glaring gap, that was necessary to plug. Therefore, we are excited about the Cybertruck eventually becoming a reality.In regard to the competition, Ford Motor Company's  F-Series vehicles are the best-selling pick-up trucks in America, followed by General Motors'  Chevrolet Silverado models. F's F-150 Lightning is an EV pick-up truck with a range of 320 miles, towing facility of 7,700 lbs, and MSRP of  50,000 on the base model. Chevrolet Silverado EV version has a range of 400 miles, towing capacity of 10,000 lbs, and a price tag of  52,000 on the base model. Relatively, the Cybertruck has a range of up to 500 miles and towing facility of 14,000 lbs. Nevertheless, we view the entire line-up of Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado models, including the internal combustible engine  ICE  pick-up trucks as potential competition for the Cybertruck.Although, based on the Cybertruck's novel features and specifications, we expect strong demand out-of-the-gate, deliveries are likely to initially lag demand, due to the manufacturing complexity associated with the vehicle. However, as demand continues to ratchet, the gap between supply and demand is likely to narrow, as TSLA allocates additional resources to benefit from the popularity of the Cybertruck. In our opinion, sales of the Cybertruck, which, given the vehicle's niche appearance is considered to lack mass appeal, will surprise significantly on the upside.In addition, although, our argument might appear cliched, similar to the iPhone, the Cybertruck represents a paradigm shift within its industry. The iPhone captured customer attention because of the additional value it provided relative to other smartphones. We believe the incremental value the Cybertruck provides over the typical pick-up truck will reflect in a surge in vehicle sales, over time. In our opinion, the UAW strike afflicting F, GM, and Stellantis  is unlikely to benefit TSLA. Although we believe that the shutdown at the factories of the impacted firms is likely to be successful, the companies will absorb the increase in labor costs rather than risk raising product prices and turning uncompetitive. The automobile industry is highly profitable in absolute dollar terms, with F and GM guiding to 2023 net income of between  10 billion to  12 billion and  9.3 billion to 10.7 billion, respectively. Considering that labor costs account for 4  to 5  of the average cost of producing a vehicle, the impact of higher employee wages and benefits on the bottom line is unlikely to be crippling.Moreover, it is hardly a zero-sum game. Up until the UAW demanded a resurrection of the living wage raises, defined pension plans, and removal of wage tiers, the requests appear reasonable. However, when it comes to wrangling a 40  pay raise for workers, the UAW terms appear onerous, and will only escalate the trend towards automation of core production functions at automobile companies, in our judgment.Net-net, a potential success of the UAW strike will likely decrease profit margins at F, GM, and STLA, over the short term. Longer term, the impasse represents a margin expansion opportunity as hiring is replaced by automation, bolstering our argument that F's, GM's and STLA's loss is not TSLA's gain. The Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  mandate  including  400 billion in funding  to encourage the purchase of green energy technologies matches up nicely with TSLA's mission to design, manufacture, and market products that accelerate the earth's transformation to renewable energy. Consequently, along with customer subsidies on the MSRP of a majority of TSLA's EV models, the company's energy storage solutions are similarly advantaged with retail and corporate purchases of the firm's battery storage systems  Powerwall and Megapack  eligible for up to  30  in tax credits on the cost of the products.In addition, the IRA has earmarked  12 billion in entitlements to escalate the development and deployment of clean energy systems in rural communities across America, which will necessitate the utilization of battery storage technologies. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  USDA  entrusted with managing the venture, has received funding requests for up to 2x the 9.7 billion overlay allocated by Federal authorities. In addition, given our opinion that the nation is highly likely to achieve the target of 60  solar wind generated power by 2030 compared to the current 13 , large utility companies are likely to turn to TSLA for their battery storage requirements as they shift the electricity grid towards dependence on renewable energy sources.Further, it is notable that TSLA's energy storage business is global with mega-scale projects that depend on the firm's Megapacks, active in Europe and Australia, with additional projects under development in the geographies. Moreover, TSLA recently tabled a proposal with the Indian government to produce and market the Powerwall in the country. Although Indian officials balked at providing the firm with incentives for manufacturing, it appears that subsidizing customer purchases of the Powerwall is under discussion.With the Megapack backordered until Q3 2024 and favorable market conditions, TSLA appears to be increasing focus on its energy storage business. In that regard, it launched a Megafactory in China, over the summer, and has stated that its objective is to add several facilities over the short term.Overall, with what appears to be another strong quarter behind it, TSLA is well-positioned to charge ahead. Onward and upward.Considering the highly volatile nature of TSLA shares, they undoubtedly offer an opportunity to generate returns through day trading and other short holding period arrangements. However, TSLA is an investment story, not a trading story. Folks that Buy and Hold TSLA stock for longer time horizons are like to secure greater gains on investment with virtually zero risk relative to traders timing the market in the company's shares.Tesla, Inc. is a prudently managed firm with products that are key participants in growing markets with fragmented competition. We believe TSLA has high growth in revenues and earnings locked in for at least the next ten years. Buy, Buy, Buy  on pullbacks .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Adyen Simplified,"I recently produced an in-depth review of Adyen's   H1 2023 report as well asWhile I feel I was as comprehensive as possible in my review, I recently came across market share data that has been in my mind over the years for Adyen, but which I've been unable to locate. As I mentioned in the introductory bullet points, this data is, in some sense, the entire thesis.Specifically, this data illustrates a few key aspects of the Adyen investment thesisWith these ideas as our platform, let's begin this abridged version of my Adyen thesis.As I've shared in the past, Adyen could likely be considered to be the best FinTech on earth presently. Perhaps, it could be argued that Stripe  holds this crown, but, as the data in the concluding thoughts of this note will reveal, Adyen is a vastly more capital-efficient business relative to Stripe, while growing at essentially parity and while having fielded a platform at essentially product and feature parity.Additionally, as the TAM data that I will share with you in a moment demonstrates, Adyen has a very long runway for growth.So we have a fantastic combination of quality and capital efficiency, alongside elevated growth prospects.With these ideas in mind, let's turn to a review of Adyen's valuation.For a company that could grow sales, and, by extension, free cash flow per share, at 20   which would be below management's guidance  annualized for the next 10 years, a 3.4  free cash flow yield is quite fantastic.And this does not include future share repurchase programs, which its legacy peers, such as Fiserv , have executed with brilliant success.To add just a bit of extra information here by which you may become a more educated investor, Adyen's 3.4  yield is quite attractive in light of its growth prospects and in light of the reality that it is likely the best FinTech on earth. This yield is vastly, vastly more attractive than the sub 2  yield investors were offered historically.Additionally, the rise of Adyen's yield is not mysterious.On the heels of the fastest interest rate hiking cycle in American history, the 10 year treasury yield, against which Adyen's yield principally competes for investor capital  the result of which influences supply and demand for Adyen's security  therefore, share price , now finds itself at about 4.6 .Academic finance suggests that Adyen should trade such that we get the risk free rate   risk premium, which would suggest that Ayden should trade with a free cash flow yield of 5 .For current owners, this likely sounds like a scary prospect, but for prospective owners, such a valuation would likely yield 25 , or quite likely more, annualized returns in the decades ahead, as the company grows at 20  and begins repurchasing shares.All of this being said, Adyen does not offer a risk premium, nor does its yield trade at parity with the 10 year treasury yield, and I believe this makes sense  While investors in the 10 year will only receive 4.9  per annum, granted they hold to maturity, investors in Adyen will witness the free cash flow yield  note not actual yield  on their investment grow very materially in the decade ahead, especially if Adyen begins repurchasing shares with its excess free cash flow, which it likely will at some point in the decade ahead.The principal impetus behind crafting this abridged version of the Adyen thesis was my recent receipt of the TAM data that has eluded me for the last couple of years or so.Adyen, like essentially all of our businesses, has grown within a giant TAM populated by legacy incumbents and a diverse set of point solutions.Adyen has vertically integrated the aforementioned point solutions into one acquiring platform tech stack, and it has done so on a single source of code. This has resulted in a more feature-rich, cost-effective, and versatile platform  especially for global, multi-national enterprises , which has afforded Adyen the market share capture we can see in the chart below.Additionally, we can see the highly fragmented nature of this industry, within which Adyen continues to grow due to the nature of its platform. That is, its growth within this fragmented TAM has been a byproduct of the nature and configuration of its platform, which you may review belowAdyen is a quintessential example of a business that fits within my Inverse Bubble Framework  a term I coined , as well as our first and third foundational investment frameworks.  As I mentioned towards the introduction of this note, Adyen is arguably the best FinTech on earth at present, and the financial data below confirms this reality in my mindAs we can see, Adyen's leadership has demonstrated a  aptitude for capital allocation relative to the leadership of Stripe.Adyen has grown faster with vastly less required capital, and Adyen and Stripe are effectively at product parity today.To close, some have told me they do not like FinTech  to which I would respond,  Fair, but have you seen the returns of legacy FinTechs from whom Adyen or Marqeta continue to capture market shareBelow, we can see the returns of Fiserv and Global Payments over the last 40 and 20 years respectively.Today, we have the opportunity to buy the very, very best FinTechs on earth at value  to deep value .Both of these businesses have truly giant cash hoards and no debt, as well as very profitable unit economics and long runways for growth.Thank you for reading, and have a great day.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,"The notion that history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically, stocks and treasury yields  interest rates  are inversely proportional. As risk-free interest rates rise, equitiesHowever, as soon as long-duration  10-year  treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at  4.25 , the S P-500 formed a local top in mid-July and has since declined by nearly 8   with 10-year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5.001  last week .Now, the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by  extremely poor  breadth, with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few mega-cap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indices.Interestingly, the rally in big tech has been driven by significant P E multiple expansion  and not fundamental earnings growth . Given the steep rise in long-duration treasury yields, such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic. The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their  safe-haven  status  massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets  as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy. In one of my recent notes, I shared my views on the significant concentration into big-cap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq-100  Now, from a historical standpoint, I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987 - the year of the  Black Monday  crash. In a similar vein to 2023, we can observe a sharp rise in equities and long-duration treasury yields through the summer of 1987  an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship . And as you can see on the chart below, the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on  Black Monday   19th October 1987 , with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a  flight to safety  trade  causing a sharp decline in treasury yields .In today's note, we will try to find an answer to this question, but before we do that, let's understand the drivers of this ongoing wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields.On the back of a 40-year bull run in the bond market  1982-2022 , treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemic-induced inflation, ending the era of free money.During this tightening cycle, the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 5.5  and reduced its balance sheet assets by  1T through run-off of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of  95B per month.While inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022, it is still running well above the  target of 2   September CPI  3.7  y y . With persistent labor market tightness  unemployment rate  3.8  and strong economic data, central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation, and rightly so given past inflationary episodes.For several months, the Fed has insisted that a  higher rates for longer  policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle. And, in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes  despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow, as we know, the  monetary tightening actions and  higher interest rates for longer  stance explain the move higher in short-duration treasury yields. However, long-duration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening  long-term interest rates outpacing short-term interest rates , the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly. And, as of writing, the spread between 10-year and 2-year treasury yields has narrowed down to just -16 bps  from more than -100bps just a few weeks ago .Historically, yield curve uninversions have occurred right before the start of economic recessions, and while stock market investors are big on the idea of a soft landing  with S P-500 trading at  19x P E , leading economic indicators continue to point towards an imminent slowdownNow, higher long-duration bond yields mean tighter financial conditions and slower economic activity. While the bond market is doing some much-needed work on behalf of the Fed in the fight against inflation, the velocity of this move up in long-duration yields is quite incredible, and the longer this goes on, the greater the chance of something breaking in the financial system that eventually leads to a hard landing  recession  in the economyDuring the Q A session of his appearance at the New York Economic Club last week, Powell  on being queried about his understanding of the run-up in the long end of the treasury yield curve  listed out multiple theories that could explain the surge higher in long-duration treasury yields- Given the continued strength in the economy  tight labor market and strong GDP growth , higher interest rates are becoming an ineffective tool for slowing down economic activity or that rates just haven't been higher for longer-  US government debt   33.6T, current fiscal deficit   1.7T, massive treasury issuance from the government, Powell said - we are on an  unsustainable  path fiscally-   reduction of Fed's balance sheet assets, Fed moving from buyer to seller- investors are demanding a higher term premium due to growing expectations that the world is moving into an environment of more supply shocks than demand shocksAnd followed that up with the following commentsBy pointing toward supply-demand dynamics, my opinion is that Powell essentially admitted that the Fed has lost control of the long end of the yield curve. While the Fed's rate hiking campaign is likely on pause for now, the door has been left open for future rate hikes. More importantly, with inflation still running well above its target rate of 2  and Q3 US GDP growth projected to come in at 4 , the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy  switch back to QE  quantitative easing  in the foreseeable future. And without the Fed buying up government treasuries, the wild run-up in long-duration yields may continue for a while, pressurizing valuations of risk assets.Since treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the US government, their yields are considered the risk-free rate in the investing world. In a normalized environment, risk assets like equities tend to offer a premium of 2-3  on top of this risk-free rate. Hence, at this time, the S P-500 should ideally command an earnings yield of 7-8   risk-free rate  10-year treasury yield  of 5    equity risk premium of 2-3 .By inverting this 7-8  earnings yield, we get to a Price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5-14.28x for the S P-500. Considering forward 2024 earnings estimates of  245 for the S P-500, the market is currently trading at a forward P E of 19x. According to the yield math shared above, S P-500 should be trading 25-35  lower than current levels, i.e., in the 2,800 to 3,200 range.In addition to this yield-based repricing, I see additional risk for the S P-500 since consensus analyst estimates are looking for 12  y y earnings growth in 2024 heading into a potential recession. If we do end up getting a garden variety recession, S P-500 earnings could drop by 15-20  next year. And in that bearish scenario, the S P-500 could drop down as low as 2,200 to 2,640  2024 S P-500 earnings   176-185, P E multiple  12.5-14.28x .From a valuation standpoint, there's ample room for a significant de-rating in the S P-500, with its Shiller PE ratio  28.87x  sitting at extremely elevated levels as you can see on the chart belowYes, the yield math could change quickly if long-duration treasury yields moved back down to 2020-21 lows  however, current economic conditions are unsupportive of such a low-interest rate environment. A Fed pivot and re-introduction of QE-infinitum is probably the only thing that can push rates down to such depths, and while I do expect the Fed to revert back to QE at some point in the future  I believe the Fed Put is currently inactive  due to strong economy and high inflation . This reality doesn't change until and unless something breaks in the financial markets or the economy. And honestly, if something does break, we could see a  crash in the financial markets before the Fed pivots back to quantitative easing.On the back of a sizeable pullback since mid-July, the S P-500 is currently testing the support trendline from the COVID-19  March 2020  and the October 2022 lows. With weekly RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, a massive technical breakdown here is very much on the table.If long-duration treasury yields hold up at elevated levels or continue to climb higher over the coming sessions, equity market selling could pick up here accompanied by a potential spike in VIX  CBOE Volatility Index , which rallied past the 20 level last week.The S P-500  SPY  has support in the 410 to 420 range  however, if we break those levels, then all bets are off, and yes, we could even see the S P-500 experiencing a crash similar to 1987.That said, so far in 2023, SPY has followed seasonality patterns quite well, and numerous analysts have cited strong past performance trends in the November-December period while predicting a year-end rally for stocks  Recent economic data has remained resilient, and Q3 earnings are unlikely to rock the boat. With the Fed virtually on pause now, equity markets can embark on a run higher to close out 2023.Last Friday, SPY closed right under its 200-DMA support level and the trendline of support from October 2022 lows. However, we could be forming a bear trap here, with RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart showing signs of positive divergence.From a sentiment perspective, investors appear to be fearful at this moment in time as indicated by CNN's Fear   Greed Index  currently in  Fear  territoryAhead of a seasonally strong period in a pre-election year, investor sentiment is bearish  fearful  whilst SPY is nearly oversold and trading within a critical support zone. From an ultra near-term perspective, SPY can forge some sort of a bounce here as long as we hold the 410 to 420 support zone  and then resume the downtrend in H1 2024.The immutable laws of money dictate that risk assets such as equities offer a positive risk premium relative to the risk-free rate in the market. With the long end of the treasury yield curve having moved up to  5  in recent weeks, the S P-500 trading at a 4  earnings yield is simply unsustainable, and a de-rating to 7-8  earnings yields would be justified.Given the current state of the economy and Fed chair Powell's recent talk, long-duration treasury yields are likely to move higher from here, not lower. From a valuation and technical perspective, the S P-500 can drop by 25-50  from current levels.As we noted in this article, there are uncanny similarities between 1987 and 2023 up to this point of the year. Will we see a 1987-esque crash  Frankly, I don't know, but under the given set of economic and financial conditions, I simply cannot rule out a stock market crash.Winston Churchill once said -Heading into a potential recession, the equity market  S P-500  valuation reflects a high degree of investor complacency. A 1987-esque may or may not materialize  however, prudent investors must prepare themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes  tail events  in this uncertain environment. Considering the simple yield math behind stock valuations, the S P-500 is ripe for a significant correction. A technical bounce here may delay the inevitable move lower  however, looking at medium-term  1-3 years  risk reward, I rate SPY a  Sell  at current levels.The era of free money is over, and we are now operating in a normalized interest rate environment. With major US equity indices yet to price in the new financial realities, the risk of significant correction or crash remains elevated.In order to navigate this tricky uncertain environment, we are pursuing  Bold, Active Investing with Proactive Risk Management  at our investing group - . Join our community today and take control of your financial future.Ahan Vashi has 10  years of investing experience with a professional background in equity research, private equity, and software engineering.

BP: Significantly Undervalued At Current Oil Prices,"BP  is a well-known major oil player from the UK which has faced challenging conditions in a difficult oil market for the last three years. Despite drastic events  Deepwater Horizon, shale oil expansion, COVID, Rosneft write-off , the company remained aAt the end of the second quarter 2023, BP had 17.38 bn shares outstanding and a total market cap of  112.8 bn as of 09 30 23  share price of  6.49 .The fundamental ratios can be found in the table below, with a peer comparisonsales, EBITDA, earnings, equity and dividend numbers for 2023 in relation to the share prices as of 09 30 23.BP claims the top spot in two fundamental categories  P S and P EBITDA , has the second-highest dividend yield and ranks second and third in the other two categories  P B and P E . If we compare the 5 oil majors by implementing a score system  1. 4, 2. 3, 3. 2, 4. 1, 5. 0 , BP will take the lead.BP has introduced a dividend policy which regularly increases the annual distribution by 4  at  60 per barrel Brent oil after cutting the payout in half in the second quarter of 2020  from 10.5 cents quarter to 5.25 cents quarter  when the pandemic hit the economy. Since then BP has raised the quarterly dividend to 7.27 cents  38.5  or 11.5  p.a.  which exceeds the policy increase of 4 . At current oil prices above  80 per barrel, it is very likely that BP can increase the payout by 10  annually at least.Furthermore, BP is strongly committed to share buybacks of at least . In 2023 BP allocates 60  of surplus cashflow due to high oil prices. Since the end of 2019, BP has already reduced share count by 14.1   from 20.241 bn to 17.379 bn shares . In the second quarter of 2023 BP bought back 323 million shares for around  2 bn. At  60 per barrel BP aims to buy shares for  4 bn but due to a good environment for oil companies, BP has At a current share price of  6,45 and if oil prices remain above  80, BP will buy back nearly 1 billion shares each year which represents a buyback yield of more than 5 . Hence, the dividend and buyback yield combined is close to 10 .BP's earnings have been volatile for years because of major shocks which have been mentioned before  COVID, Rosneft . However, earnings have always recovered strongly when the environment for oil prices were beneficial. What is the current outlook for oil prices and the most likely scenarioThe most important influences on oil prices are supply and demand  1 , economic growth  2  and OPEC policy  3 .Oil prices have recently risen to  91  WTI  and  95  Brent  per barrel, an increase of 33  since June. Global oil demand is expected to rise to while supply plunged to 100.9 mb d in July. In July and August oil demand hit a record of 103 mb d widening the supply gap. Although the supply situation will improve to 101.5 mb d by an increased non-OPEC  oil production, oil demand will exceed oil supply for the next months which will support current oil price levels.The global economic output will . Growth is driven by India, China and other emerging markets while Europe's economy will be outpaced. Economic growth will stabilize oil prices as well as global air traffic which . The global demand for travel is continuously high and consequently, it is likely that global air traffic will surpass pre-pandemic levels which will also boost global oil demand.OPEC  supply fell to 50.2 mb d in July because of a reduced production of Saudi Arabia. The OPEC  countries are interested in a tight market and won't add a significant amount of supply to the global oil production. The group announced a total of 3.7 mb d output cut in April and a revision of this decision is unlikely. OPEC  produces nearly 50  and OPEC 33  of global oil supply. The output cut will limit a production expansion and oil supply won't keep up with economic growth and demand. Hence, the OPEC policy supports high oil prices in the near future.All in all, a scenario with high oil prices above  80 is very likely  60  and has consequences for BP's valuation.The first scenario with the highest probability shows a significant undervaluation of BP. Even if we reduce the buyback amount of  6 bn by  700-800 million share based compensation, the buyback yield in combination with future dividend increases support an upside potential of more than 50 . Furthermore, the downside risks are limited as the worst scenario for oil majors still signals an undervaluation for BP. The higher oil prices climb, the more likely and faster BP can surpass pre-pandemic dividend levels.BP is not only undervalued compared to its peers, the company's shares still would have upside potential if oil prices fell which is not very likely near-term. A combination of economic growth, limited oil supply growth and an increasing demand for air travel are excellent conditions for BP shareholders. In the scenario of high oil prices above  80 per barrel, they can expect increasing dividends and a buyback yield of at least 5 . Finally, the shares have a significant upside potential of 55 .Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

A Rising Interest Rate Freight Train Is Coming For The Economy,"The quiet murmur of rising interest rates has now grown to the roar of an approaching freight train. The 10-year yield continues to rise, hitting a fresh 52-week high this week over 4.3 . The  this week and is now threatening to rise above 8 . After over a decade of zero-interest rate central bank policies  a.k.a. , surging inflation sparked an economic avalanche that threatens to turn the economy and markets as we know it upside down. With massive government deficits, analysts can't seem to raise their targetsSo why are interest rates rising so much  And what does it mean for the economy and financial markets  Let's dig in.The 2010s were a unique time in economic history. Due to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis, global central banks kept interest rates at zero  or less  for roughly 14 years. The US raised interest rates for a couple of years from 2017 to 2019 but ended up cutting them right back to zero due to COVID. In addition, central banks pursued  to push down interest rates on mortgages to below the free market rate. This had even more effect on the economy.Holding interest rates at or near zero had subtle but profound effects on the economy in the 2010s.ZIRP also made certain business models unusually profitable. Friends of mine got rich by doing not much more than borrowing money cheaply and buying real estate. Decent execution of off-the-shelf business models like  or Airbnb hosting made making money a cakewalk. Even simply buying a property for a 3.5  fixed mortgage in the 2010s and putting paint, carpet, and a tenant in it was good enough. During this time, vacant houses in California made about as much money from price appreciation  just by existing  as a typical household living there did by working.Crypto is another business model that took off because of ZIRP. With the economic inputs of interest rates at zero, inflation at 2-3 , and government borrowing a bit unsustainable, putting some of your money in another currency like Bitcoin  actually makes a ton of sense.Of course, the mainstream economic theory here is that by fixing prices for loans at an unnaturally low level, the Fed was going to create shortages. For example, QE created an artificial housing shortage, despite there being a  in the US than there was before the 2008 crash. Still, consumer price inflation was low and everything was fine, at least until around 2019. And low rates were popular with the upper middle class, who saw their home equity increase and their 401ks rise. But, like America's obsession with off-label Ozempic, it was too good to be true.The chaos of the pandemic brought these policies to a rapid end. Inflation surging from 2  to nearly 10  annually shattered the public's trust in price stability. The public started panic buying goods, there were shortages of all kinds of necessary goods and services in the economy, and alternatives to the US dollar became cocktail party conversation. This more or less forced the Fed to act by raising interest rates and reversing its QE policies. Had they not done anything, inflation likely would have continued to rise, as it did in the 1970s.Today, inflation is still significantly above target, and public trust in the currency is still not fully restored. The US government is running , and fewer and fewer investors are willing to buy government debt. Fitch recently downgraded the US's credit rating due to an  and a lack of will to raise taxes. After getting burned by inflation, the market is hitting back.To this point, the market has severely punished the prices of previously issued long-term bonds with low coupon rates. Long-term Treasuries  have fallen off of a cliff.This is simple supply and demand. The Treasury needs to sell trillions of dollars in bonds to cover its budget deficits, and the market has not been keenly interested in buying them. As long as government deficits go unchecked, interest rates will continue to rise. The so-called  from Beijing to Riyadh to New York are threatening to humble the US Treasury, voting with their keyboards to stop financing unsustainable levels of spending. Unless the Treasury either raises taxes or sharply cuts spending, the freight train will not be stopped. While it's theoretically possible that the White House could force the Fed to print money to buy the US debt, this would send an unmistakable message to our foreign creditors that it's time to turn off the spigot. Long-term bonds actually aren't a terrible value here if you trust the government's ability to raise taxes and maintain 2  inflation, but that would require some sort of signal that they're going to take deficits seriously first.Essentially, credit is getting more expensive and harder to get. Since household savings rates are near record lows, that's a big problem for borrowers. By industryAt a , a homebuyer with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home worth  721,000. At 4 , it's  649,000. At 5 , it's  587,000. At 6 , it's  533,000. At 7 , it's  486,000. At 8 , it's  445,000. Finally, at 9  mortgage rates a household with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home that costs  410,000, which is 43  less than they could at the 3  interest rate. This is purely mechanical from the change in financing costs, not due to opinion or sentiment. To maintain equilibrium at 9  mortgage rates, home prices would need to fall 43 .This isn't just theoretical. Mortgage rates have already soared from 3  to 7.5 , so 9  isn't even that crazy given where we already are. This interest sits on top of large home price increases during the pandemic. The typical household looking to buy a house now with a mortgage is making an almost existential choice by signing up to pay bubble prices at 7-8  interest. It's not going to end well, and DTI ratios are at or above their previous peaks in 2006-2007. If you're in the top 1  of income earners then do whatever you want, but if you're looking to buy a house and start a family you're making a much bigger gamble than you might think.It's going to be hard for interest rates to go down with the deficits the government is running, so the most likely outcome here is some sort of housing crisis sooner rather than later. It's not really a question of if, it's rather a question of when. Consumers are not displaying enough elasticity to interest rates due to their bias against renting, and it's going to cost them. Just because you should call an all-in bet for  20 does not mean you should call it for  2,000. It's the same with mortgages- housing was a great investment at 2016 prices and 2016 interest rates but a terrible one at today's rates and prices.The story isn't too different for automakers. Because the vast majority of buyers need to finance their cars, sharply rising interest rates are bad news for automakers. While manufacturers are free to offer discounted financing, it cuts into their margins. Far fewer people can pay  90,000 for a truck at 6  or 7  for a 5-year loan than could at 2  or 3 .March's bank crisis was sparked by regional banks taking too much interest rate risk, and then rising rates burned them. Now, rates are back at fresh 52-week highs. Where are all of these banks now, and how much in losses have they sustained  The crisis caused rates to fall, allowing smart banks to get out from upside-down bets. For every bank that took decisive action to reduce interest rate exposure this spring, there are likely several that put their heads in the sand. While big banks are fine, I expect dozens more of these smaller banks to end up being taken over cheaply by competitors or closed by the FDIC over the next 12-18 months. Bad bets on commercial real estate and long-duration assets virtually guarantee this. This will not be the last you hear about regional banksThis said, attrition in the banking industry could be an opportunity for well-run banks like JPMorgan .The days of losing billions to grab market share are effectively over now that capital has a price. While the 2010s brought gains in innovation, they also brought hundreds of VC-backed companies with flimsy business models. Expect many of these companies to go out of business over the next 12-18 months. This is just common sense.Large-cap valuations are near-bubble highs despite bond yields rapidly rising. With the economy being  revolutionized  by skyrocketing interest rates, it's worth considering whether you can meet your financial goals by taking less risk in bonds and cash. For every cloud, there is a silver lining and bad news for borrowers is good news for lenders.Also, it's not widely known but interest rates are priced into futures and options, which means that calls and long futures get more expensive, while puts and short futures get cheaper. Higher interest rates also accrue to short sellers who short stock, enforcing some discipline on the market by channeling capital away from junk companies to higher-quality, profitable companies.Current valuations for large stocks are suspect. The S P 500  currently sits at  in terms of its earnings. Stocks like Apple  and Microsoft  are trading for 30x earnings or more, while stocks like Tesla , Amazon , and Nvidia  are trading for 50-100x. Historically these kinds of valuations don't work out. On the other hand, you can get roughly 5.5  in money market funds , 5.5  in short-term bonds , and 4.4  tax-free in municipal bonds . Will stocks ever get cheaper than they are now  Since stocks have almost never been more expensive than they are now from a valuation perspective, it seems likely that they'll revert to the mean with bonds and cash offering better and better returns. Again, I think this happens sooner rather than later. in various countries tells us that higher rates and inflation will likely remain for 5-10 years. While a severe recession could bring balance back to the economy, this is hard to exploit because the assets that would benefit from lower rates  stocks, real estate  would likely have to get completely crushed first to set the conditions for another bull market from the bottom.While realtors are shouting from the rooftops to get buyers to  date the rate and marry the house,  overpaying for assets with teaser rates and betting that interest rates will go down and make the deal pencil is something that has burned millions of people in the past. This time is likely no different. History also shows that  tend to go up in times of economic stress.This also goes for the popular assertion that the economy will never slow down because unemployment is currently low. Consumption of food, services, and soft goods won't crash per se due to higher interest rates, but the borrowing to buy stuff will crash. Housing and autos  for consumers, and changes in these are how every business cycle starts and ends. Workers in these industries are the original source of unemployment shocks, and business investment operates on a similar cycle. This eventually trickles down to consumption, but it's a slow process. Student loans kicking back in on October 1st , as student loan debt service is about 1  of the US national after-tax income.You should care about rising interest rates because it greatly affects the fair value of assets. If you understand how interest rates affect asset pricing, you can be more  elastic  to changes in interest rates and use this to make money for yourself and reduce your risk. If you're overly emotional or dogmatic, you're more likely to end up paying the wrong prices for the wrong assets. To this point, rising rates are both a huge opportunity and a huge threat to investors. In a less dysfunctional world, interest rates should not have risen this much, and government budget deficits wouldn't be as atrocious. But we have to make do with the world we have, so this is how I view things as likely to play out going forward.Will interest rates continue to rise  If so, what will the effects be on the economy  Share your thoughts in the comments below   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Is There Still A Bull Case For Bonds?,"For those who have been bullish bonds and calling for a rally throughout 2023, it has been on the back of falling growth and waning inflation such thesisIt seems the traditional relationship between yields and the business cycle has broken down, at least for now.Indeed, while my own fixed income asset allocation quadrant has been suggesting an overweight position in duration is appropriate for this stage of the business cycle, this cycle has thus far indeedBut, to be fair, market internals have also been disconfirming the recent highs in yields, as indicators by the likes of the copper to gold ratio and the relative performance of cyclical stocks vs defensive stocks  which are both contributors to this model  have been making lower highs and lower lows while yields do the opposite. Historically, market internals have provided a fairly reliable gauge of where yields should be from a growth and inflation perspective.However, while growth has been slowing on the whole, the US economy remains robust and resilient, meaning the business cycle overall hasn t actually been an all-out tailwind for bonds just yet.Despite the plethora of unfavourable leading indicators of economic growth, the US economy continues to hold steady. Much of this resilience can be attributed to a combination of the followingAnd although we have clearly seen a slowdown  and probably recession  in the cyclical manufacturing side of the economy, the services sector is humming along nicely. We can observe this below by examining the recent momentum in a number of key economic data points. Outside of industrial production, growth in consumption, income and employment all remain in expansionary territory.While the trend in growth is by and large to the downside, the economy overall has been running pretty hot, and the expectation we are heading into recession  which is driving many fund managers to allocate to duration  has simply not yet played out.But I say that to say this. A recession may well be on the cards yet. As I detailed in my recent , the evidence continues to point to a slowdown in growth over the coming quarters, which should translate into hard data deterioration at some point in late 2023 or early 2024. This is an outcome that should favour duration at some point in this cycle, but we are not there yet.Of course, from a fundamental perspective for bonds, growth is only half the story. Inflation and inflation expectations also play a major role in determining the price of interest. Unlike the growth story, the deceleration in inflation has been much more clear cut. Headline CPI has moved sharply lower this year. The latest three-month annualised reading came in at 1.9 , just shy of the Fed s 2  target.Of course, core CPI has been far stickier as a result of persistent wage growth, but, the outlook for owners  equivalent rent  the largest component of both headline and core CPI  suggests the overall trend in core CPI is likely to be to the downside over the next 12 months.However, I would argue the downtrend in headline inflation looks to be running out of steam. Indeed, as I detailed , we could well be nearing a point in which many of the cyclical drivers of headline CPI - energy, food and commodities overall - are shifting from inflation headwinds to tailwinds once again. This is certainly a message being corroborated by my composite inflation leading indicator, whose downside momentum clearly looks to be waning and is not suggesting headline CPI reaches the Fed s 2  year-over-year growth target anytime soon.Of course, whether we do see renewed inflationary pressures show up in headline CPI as 2023 progresses depends much on how far energy prices can rally in the coming months. While I do not think we will see triple-digit oil prices this year, the fundamentals within the oil market continue to lead toward the bullish side of the spectrum  as I detailed .I would not at all be surprised to see  90- 100 oil in the coming months, an outcome which would once again put increased upside pressure on inflation breakevens  which themselves are highly correlated to the oil price, as we can see below , and thus put upside pressure on interest rates overall.The positioning dynamics of the bond market have become rather tricky to decipher in recent times. Bond bulls have been quick to highlight how bearish speculative positioning is towards the bond market, which is currently nearing multi-decade lows.While speculative positioning is indeed at its most bearish levels in decades  a signal which I would generally lend a great deal of credence , in this case it would be remiss of me if I were not to point out the large potential fault in the signaling power of this data point.This relates to the , a popular trading strategy deployed by relative value hedge funds. Such a strategy attempts to profit from dislocations between the pricing of cash Treasuries and that of Treasury futures. During periods when there is demand for Treasury futures from institutional asset managers such as pension funds  which seems to be the case at present, as I shall detail below , then this increased demand can create a dislocation between the price of the underlying itself and that of Treasury futures. This creates an opportunity for hedge funds to lever up in the repo market and buy the underlying while at the same time shorting the futures, attempting to capture the spread. This was a popular investment strategy prior to COVID-19, and we can see these strategies are seemingly once again being deployed by hedge funds by looking at measure such as hedge funds futures positioning  which is heavily short, as we can see above , Treasury repo volumes  which have soared to multi-year highs , as well as asset manager positioning in the futures market  which is heavily long . The Fed itself also recently  how such strategies are seemingly being utilised by hedge funds once again.Not only does this dynamic suggest institutional capital in the form of pension funds and the like are long bonds, but it also seems to suggest the heavily short speculative positioning in the futures market illustrated above may be somewhat misleading and not actually providing a reliable contrarian buy signal after all.If we assess discretionary positioning toward bonds through the lens of Bank of America s Global Fund Manager Survey, we can see that not only are asset managers heavily overweight bonds, but there is also a consensus among them that yields are going to fall from here. Previous instances where discretionary managers were as certain yields were going to fall marked major tops in bonds, not bottoms.Also confirming this level of bullish sentiment toward long duration is J.P. Morgan s client survey index.Unlike what speculative positioning in the futures market is indicating, it appears asset allocations and money managers are actually bullish bonds.Other measures of positioning are also sending similar messages. The put call ratio for the 10-year Treasury bond for example remains floored and is not signalling the kind of panic put buying indicative of market bottoms.In fact, as we can see below, just the opposite has occurred. Call buying on the TLT ETF has skyrocketed in recent months.Meanwhile, TLT fund flows have been positive for much of 2022 and 2023 as investors pile into the traditional recession trade, while the ETF's short interest is effectively non-existent relative to historical levels.Again, this is the kind of speculative behaviour generally seen at market tops, not bottoms. Undoubtedly, it appears everyone one is playing the deflationary cyclical game of the last 30 years without understanding the changing structural dynamics surrounding inflation and demand and supply - nowhere is this more evident that in the bond market term premium  more on this later .Alas, one group of traders we can be sure are actually short bonds and are providing some kind of reliable contrarian buy signal are CTAs, which are effectively systematic trend-following strategies. While not as short bonds as they have been, CTAs are indeed actually short the market, and, as we can see below courtesy of Goldman Sachs, there is plenty of juice CTAs can provide bonds should a short squeeze develop at some stage.It is also worth noting too how pessimistic the media has become toward bonds. While discretionary positioning does not yet reflect this narrative, this level of bearish sentiment in mainstream media is often noteworthy.So, if inflation has been falling and fund managers buying bonds, why do yields continue to go up  Simply put, this is a supply and demand story.Indeed, I have highlighted in previous articles on the bond market how unfavourable the supply and demand dynamics could be for yields, but, I must admit this bearish force has been far greater than I had anticipated. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change anytime soon.Though most will be aware of the fiscal situation the United States currently finds itself in from a Treasury issuance perspective, it is worth repeating. Since running down the Treasury General Account earlier this year, the US Treasury has been issuing new debt en masse, with around  1 trillion of Treasuries forecast to be issued in Q3 and Q4 of this year alone. That s a lot of supply.Of course, this is happening at a time when Federal tax receipts are falling and interest expenses rising, two trends which will only exacerbate this dynamic and worsen the fiscal situation.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continues to undertake QT and dump additional supply on the market, while foreign investors are themselves also no longer funding US deficits on net  and haven t been for some years now . As such, it is falling to the private sector to buy these bonds.And, while the private sector has been happy to comply thus far given the attractiveness of US government debt, it is true that when neither the Fed nor foreign investors are willing to provide the required level of demand,  in the absence of demand, supply sets the price.  Per the work of Totem Macro below, what this means is historically, excess supply has had a far more meaningful impact on pressuring yields higher than would be the case when the Fed was willing to support the market via QE and foreign investors were willing to finance US deficits.These excess supply dynamics remain a continued threat to the bond market. But it unfortunately doesn t end there.Japanese investors are the largest foreign owners of US Treasury securities. Japanese insurance companies and pension funds represent some of the largest pools of capital in the world, and US bonds are one of their primary holdings. So, when the Bank of Japan makes alterations to its yield curve control policy, this can have big implications for Japanese capital flows.Indeed, they have recently done just that, widening the 10-year JGB trading band from 50 bps to 100 bps. And, as noted recently by the , with ' yields going up in Japan, the risk is that Japanese investors will now begin to sell US fixed income and start buying higher-yielding Japanese fixed income. This is a big deal for global fixed income markets because Japanese investors are the biggest foreign holders of US Treasuries, and they also own significant amounts of US credit.We can see this dynamic in play by looking at the correlation of 10-year US Treasury yields and 10-year Japanese government bond yields. As JBG yields rise, Japanese capital allocators are incentivised to sell foreign USTs and buy domestic bonds.The depreciation of the yen relative to the USD also exacerbates this dynamic, as many Japanese investors hedge their FX exposure when investing in foreign debt assets. So, when the dollar yen FX rate rises  USD appreciates relative to the yen , hedging costs increase and domestic yields can become more attractive even if the yields are lower than UST yields. This dynamic helps to explain why the USD JPY FX rate  black line below  is so closely correlated to US yields  blue line below .This dynamic is perhaps better illustrated by comparing JGB yields relative to FX-hedged UST yields, as we can see below. The additional yield pick-up for Japanese investors when investing in USTs is much lower than the JGB yield when accounting for the hedging costs associated with foreign investment.This is the threat of the great repatriation of foreign capital. All else equal, rising JGB yields and a strong dollar incentivises Japanese investors to repatriate capital to finance Japanese deficits instead of US deficits, a dynamic which will only serve to further reduce demand for US government debt securities  at least at current rates .But once again, the story doesn t end there. Another spike in oil and energy costs could again result in capital flows from energy importers out of USTs and into domestic assets in order to defend their currencies - as rising energy costs lowers current account balances thus depreciating the currency - another risk to duration should energy costs  i.e. oil  start to rise again. Such flows are effectively equal to additional QT.Should the USD strengthen, this also gives reason for foreigners to continue to sell USTs to strengthen their own currencies  as the dollar trends to go up when Fed is conducting QT and the private sector must adsorb the debt while the foreign sector is selling . The recent devaluation of the Chinese yuan speaks to this risk, with  recently reporting that Chinese banks are trying to defend the CNY by selling USDs USTs.As we can see, the supply and demand imbalance clearly indicates their remains upside risk for yields and downside risk for bonds, regardless of the macro fundamentals for duration. These are very important factors at play that have not been anywhere near as prominent in recent times where the fundamentals favoured duration.From a technical perspective, the 10-year yield is at an interest juncture. After butting heads with recent resistance just shy of 4.4  and completing a daily 9-13-9 DeMark sell signal, this recent move higher in yields clearly looks to be running out of steam. Given the level of bearish media sentiment toward bonds at present, I suspect we will see this correction continue to play out over the next month or two, though I would be surprised if yields were to retrace all the way down to their major support level around 3.4  anytime in the near future. Indeed, barring any imminent crash in equities, recession or market event that sees the return of QE, it is hard to argue against this being a chart that looks like it wants to go higher overall.While what I have discussed thus far has primarily focused on the cyclical outlook for bonds, it is worth highlighting some of the secular risks for the bond market that could see yields move much higher over the medium to long term.This dynamic is most aptly examined through the lens of the term premium, which represents the additional compensation investors receive for holding a longer dated bond  i.e. 10-year Treasury  until maturity as opposed to continually investing in one year Treasuries and reinvesting the proceeds each year upon maturity. In theory, the term premium should account for the additional duration and inflation risks associated with locking up capital for a long period of time.As it stands, it appears the term premium for 10-year Treasuries is not at all reflecting any kind of structural risks facing markets.  of the term premium suggest it is still negative as investors are yet to demand any kind of meaningful compensation for actually bearing the additional risks for being long duration in a world of .We can see this below by comparing the term premium to various forms of long-term inflation expectations.The same can be said of inflation uncertainty, which has clearly yet to be accounted for by fixed income traders.Even the outlook for debt issuance by the US Treasury and the excess supply this is set to bring to the market are yet to be fully accounted for in the term premium.On a structural level, it seems clear there are a number of reasons why yields could go higher from here, or at least average a higher level that what we have seen during recent decades. These are dynamics all bond bulls should keep in mind.Summing it all up, there are clearly a very large number of factors at play here that are contributing, or attempting to contribute, to the movement in bond prices and yields. The economic resilience thus far has resulted in any kind of material growth slowdown or recession being pushed back, meaning the macro conditions are yet to turn truly favourable for bonds. Likewise, while the cyclical inflation trend has been to the downside for most of the past 12 months, there are signs suggesting inflationary pressures could again re-emerge as we close out 2023.Meanwhile, the supply and demand story for bonds remains as bearish as ever, with excess issuance by the US Treasury and the potential for the repatriation of foreign capital both serious risks that could lead to higher yields.Will we get a cyclical bond rally at some stage  Most probably, but the timing here is very difficult given the bearish factors in play. A significant rally in bonds will probably require a material stock market crash, recession, or the resumption of QE. This is particularly true given how discretionary positioning toward the asset class seems on the bullish side. For now, being long duration at present is not the right risk reward trade investors should be looking for, particularly given the attractive yields on offer from the short end of the curve. After all, we now live in a world where you can be paid to wait. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",39,2023-09-01T21:52:00.000-04:00
TLT: Bullish Ahead Of September Payrolls And The CPI Update,"Rising bond yields have taken the market by storm with the 10-year and 30-year Treasury rate at the highest levels since 2007, approaching nearly 5 . The setup has been a disaster for the bond market, including the iShares 20  Year Treasury BondThe fund technically tracks a basket of Treasury bonds with maturities greater than  and represents a good bond benchmark as one of the most widely traded exchange-traded funds in the market. While the trading action has been poor, we see room to take the other side ahead of a rebound.The potential for favorable indicators, between the September CPI as well as the payrolls report suggesting confidence that inflation will continue to trend lower could help build a consensus that the Fed is done withThe Fed's rate hiking policy in place since early last year, taking the Fed Funds rate from effectively zero to 5.5  at the short end of the curve explains much of the dynamic in rising yields at the long end of the curve.Still, what we're seeing now has evolved into more of a momentum-based selloff. Data shows that bond futures market positioning is at a, implying a bet on even higher yields going forward.As it relates to the macro backdrop, the interpretation is a view by some that  inflation remains a problem  and the Fed will need to keep hiking to bring the CPI down to the 2  target level.This line of thinking received some fodder at the September Fed meeting with comments by Chairman Powell leaving the door open for another rate hike this year, noting the group remains data-dependent.The  higher for longer  mantra was strengthened by the fabled dot plot forecast by Fed members for the Fed Funds rates in 2024 to 5.1  compared to 4.6  from the June update.All in all, it is fair to say bonds deserve to be higher compared to levels last year although we will argue that the move has been overextended.The key point here is that there is some uncertainty regarding the actual direction of Fed policy even over the next few months. The difference between a continued  pause  or a rate hike over the next Fed meetings has significant implications for the broader bond market.Importantly, that extra rate hike taking the Fed Fund Rates to 5.75  is far from certain with a case to be made that it won't happen. There is a deep divide in the market right now regarding where the Fed Funds rate will end this year.According to the, which extrapolates the probability for the Fed Funds rate move at each FOMC, there is currently a 52.2  chance the Fed ends the year at the December meeting with no change to the current 5.5  level, compared to a 47.8  odds for a hike.The point here is to recognize that the interest rate expectations and the corresponding market probabilities are dynamic. Several factors can work to shift those probabilities.A  good  or favorable data point suggesting lower-than-expected inflationary pressures between now and the next Fed meeting could be enough to keep the group on hold. If it becomes clear further rate hikes are unnecessary for the CPI to trend lower, this scenario would be particularly bullish for bonds and TLT with room for yields to correct lower.This would be reflected in the December rate hike odds repricing lower and potentially even pulling forward the room for a rate cut earlier in 2024. This would also be a positive for stocks, although we'll leave that to a separate discussion.On the other hand, bond bears are sort of hoping inflation surprises much higher with other macro data coming in exceptionally strong, forcing the Fed to turn even more hawkish. Here is the market-implied probability that a rate hike in December would become the consensus, as a further tailwind for bond yields to climb higher, and more downside in bond prices including the TLT ETF.Two major indicators are coming out over the next few weeks that can help set the record straight. First up is the September non-farm payrolls report due out on Friday, October 6th. The current consensus is for 170k jobs added, representing a slight slowdown from 187k in August.Our thinking here is that this otherwise  soft  figure confirms a gradual deceleration in the labor market as evidence monetary policy is working to cool demand-side consumer pricing pressures. For context, the average number of jobs added over the past year has been around 260k added per month meaning it's clear that the pace has slowed.What might even be more encouraging is room for the unemployment rate to climb above 4 , based on a growing participation rate that was the theme in August.This headline number returned to the highest level since 2021 indicating that the transmission of monetary policy to restrict economic activity within the credit cycle is working. We also expect wage growth to be subdued.In our view, it would take a  blowout  print higher implying the economy is exceptionally strong to raise an eyebrow at the Fed that the labor market trends are inflationary.A miss to the downside on Friday with the payroll number a bit weaker than expected would be a very bullish backdrop for bonds because it pushes back on the need for the Fed to keep hiking and brushes aside concerns that inflation is accelerating.If anything, bonds could react in a sort of  buy the news  dynamic, where any print is met with some market-wide short covering considering the recent weakness. We expect to see a rally in TLT here as part of a  short squeeze dynamic  against the excessive net short interest in the bond market.TLT bulls can also look forward to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12th. A lot of attention has been placed on the recent spike in oil prices, although the key here will be core trends. The September inflation update showed that the core CPI dropped to 4.3 , the lowest level in more than two years.This is a very favorable development we expect to continue over the next few months because this side of the consumer price basket covers categories like housing, automobiles, and services that are more directly impacted by higher interest rates compared to energy prices.All indications are that core CPI which had been stubbornly elevated for much of the past year is finally turning. The Fed looks at three and six-month annualized levels which are well on their way to being at the target range. Again, the data has said they are data-dependent, and the cooling CPI is as important as it gets to confirm the trend is on track.In terms of the headline rate, our call is that core can drag the broader index lower through 2024. Even as oil prices have climbed, we believe it would take oil significantly higher for it to begin driving a cost-pull inflationary wave. We can point to retail gasoline which remains as a national average as highlighted by the otherwise muted impact on the consumer price basket.Putting it all together, we see good value in bonds at the current level with room for TLT to rebound higher as interest rates stabilize and ultimately pull back.Investors can pick up TLT with a compelling  4  dividend yield on a forward basis, with a good chance the fund will deliver a positive total return over the next year in our opinion. A scenario where the 30-year Treasury rate corrects to  4.25  by year-end, implies TLT can reclaim the  100 as our initial target.Into 2024, the possibility that the inflation converges toward the 2  target more quickly than currently expected, would provide the flexibility for the Fed to consider rate cuts based on anchored expectations. This could evolve irrespective of economic conditions within the soft landing scenario where the economy averts a recession.A soft September payroll report and cool CPI can go a long way to reset the trajectory of Fed policy. TLT and bond market shorts covering within a broader repricing would kickstart a momentum trade to the upside.In terms of risks, it would be more a concerning spike or re-accelerating of inflationary pressures that would be necessary to sustain a selloff in bonds. Factors such as the national debt, with supply and demand dynamics of Treasury bond issuances, also play a role in this market, but to a lesser extent.The setup here is that bonds are oversold and the next move in prices is higher in our opinion. More aggressive traders can also consider the ProShares Ultra 20  Year Treasury ETF  which is essentially a 2x leveraged version of TLT meaning double the risk as well as potentially double the upside return in percentage terms.

Canadian Solar: EPS Outlook Plummeting On Solar Glut And China Risks,"2023 has been a particularly challenging year for the solar industry. The solar ETF  has lost 40  of its value this year, with virtually all those losses occurring over the past three months. One notable exampleOver the past month alone, CSIQ has plummeted by 20  due to a poor sales outlook and earnings report from its larger competitor SolarEdge . Further, although solar stocks have lostCanadian Solar has been a publicly traded company since 2007. Since then, it has gone through four  boom and bust  cycles where it doubled  or more  in value and erased all those gains. The same pattern is mirrored in most other solar stocks. In general, the boom and bust cycle is correlated to changes in CSIQ's EPS  however, there is a tremendous amount of speculative influence, considering there is often some overreaction in the stock price in either direction. See belowOne key issue with solar companies is that the industry is not as firmly rooted as others in the energy space. These companies are very capital-intensive, with Canadian Solar spending over  630B in CapEx last year, or nearly half of its current market capitalization. Accordingly, they operate with a fair degree of competition and are highly exposed to broader manufacturing trends.Many investors are attracted to solar companies because they see the long-term growth potential of the solar market. However, the greatest benefactors of that may not be the solar panel factories because they're exposed to the same competitive, interest rate, and inflation risks as all other industrial manufacturers. A slight decline in demand combined with a continued increase in global solar panel production can quickly push the market into a glut, erasing the relatively thin profit margins found by factories. Additionally, these companies do not naturally grow organically as many others but require significant capital infusions to expand. Thus, substantial sales growth will almost always require considerable equity dilution or debt financing.The operating margin and sales growth trends of Canadian Solar and its peer, Solar Edge, are very similar because they compete in the same market. See belowThe operating margins of these firms dipped dramatically from 2020-2022, mainly due to supply-chain challenges that increased production costs while  to slow. Today, are up dramatically as these companies adjust for rising costs, although they're still lower than many years ago. That said, the price hike is likely sufficient to lower demand, particularly considering that electricity price growth has stagnated after two strong years. Thus, the sales outlooks for these firms are now deteriorating more quickly.Canadian Solar is still expected to expand its revenue over the coming years. However, over the past year, there has been a significant decline in its immediate and longer-term revenue estimates, highlighting some potential for stagnation. See belowSignificantly, Canadian Solar relies on debt financing to grow its revenue, which comes at the cost of its equity stability. It has also diluted its equity to a small extent over recent years, though the pace has quickened. Further, we can expect that production costs, such as power, labor, and input materials, will continue to increase at or above inflation as in recent years. As a result, its  to stagnate through at least 2025, but no significant declines are anticipated, with annualized EPS running around  5 and potentially rising after 2025.The solar sector's largest issues are interest rates and inflation. Combined, these factors dramatically increase solar installation costs and lower most solar systems' ROI. Solar panel loans now carry  APRs, erasing most of the gains received by adopting the panels. Problematically, the solar market has not been tested by such high interest rates ever before, increasing the probability of overestimation, as recently seen in guidance cut.At the same time, the production of solar panels, particularly from China, is rising very quickly today. In light of waning demand, this situation has already created a glut of solar modules in many markets, with that  as long as US and EU interest rates constrain residential demand  and corporate . Combined with increasing weakness in , credit ratings, and rising solar panel production costs, I believe it may take longer than 2025 before we see a rebound in solar demand.  very cheap today, likely reversing some of the electricity price growth since 2020.Most of the company's manufacturing is in China, often viewed as a Chinese headquartered in Canada. At the end of 2022, 72  of its long-lived assets  1.67B in total  were situated in China  an additional 12  were in Thailand, but less than 1  were in Canada  see . Its annual report has 315 mentions of  China  and 365 of  PRC,  with immense details regarding associated risks relating to trade, ownership issues, geopolitical risks, taxation, and other factors. Additionally, 95 is in Asia, while just 3  is in Canada.Canadian Solar markets itself as a Canadian firm, which is technically accurate, but its core operations are mainly Chinese. China is essentially the only place in the world where solar panels can be manufactured cost-effectively due to other countries' environmental and labor cost restrictions. Controversially, Canadian Solar has  of using Uyghurs in China. Unfortunately, The same is true for many Chinese-made items  however, unlike , Canadian Solar cannot hide behind the issue through externally contracted factories since they indirectly own projects in Xinjiang. Although the company has since investigated the issue and , third-party that is not entirely accurate.Humanitarian issues aside, this controversy is a significant problem for CSIQ. For one, investors must realize that it is effectively a Chinese company that actively seeks to appear more Canadian than it truly is. That is not to say that it is dishonest, since its annual reports are clear on that fact, but it is true in investor marketing since very few other analysts have realized this fact. Of course, the US and other countries recently against solar panel imports made by China's forced labor factories. Aside from the slave labor issue, it is a problem that most of CSIQ's assets are tied up in China because US investors do not necessarily own those assets, instead being indirectly that generally do not protect foreign investors.In my view, in light of Solar Edge's substantial guidance cut, the latest income and sales estimates for Canadian Solar are likely overestimated. Interest rates are now around 5  from today through 30-year Treasury bonds, so there is no reason to expect any reductions in short-term borrowing costs anytime soon. Considering we see the yield curve steepen without rate cuts, it is possible that the Federal Reserve may hike rates again next year. Inflation has slowed, but it can rebound as it had numerous  which faced similar supply-side inflationary trends relating to geopolitics in the Middle East.That risk factor compounds Canadian Solar's woes because its COGS should now rise faster than its sales consistently as long as interest rates and inflation remain an issue. In my view, we may likely see the company's operating margins slip back toward zero as they had been years ago. Higher interest rates also push the company's borrowing costs up, just as its debt grows as it seeks to expand its operations. The company's financial debt-to-EBITDA is relatively high at 6X, particularly considering I expect its EBITDA to crash due to the sales and profit margin reversal. Indeed, considering its thin margins and high capital overhead, I believe there is reasonable potential that CSIQ's EPS will be back around zero by the end of 2024, far below current estimates.Short interest on CSIQ is high at 9.6 , meaning many investors are betting against the stock. Most analysts love the company and believe it is undervalued today, but may be dramatically underappreciating its China-related risk factors and broader glut risks facing the solar sector. As solar loan costs soar and solar panel production costs rise with global labor and commodities, I firmly believe Canadian Solar and most of its peers will soon see enough price competition that their meager operating margins will be wiped out again. We've seen this pattern many times throughout the company's history, so I do not see any strong reason to suspect it should not continue.The fact is that Canadian Solar is not a green energy growth company but a relatively old-school manufacturing firm with tremendous cyclical risks and capital needs. Further, it faces high exposure to geopolitical trade issues between the West and China and associated labor issue allegations. This is not to say that I do not believe Solar itself will grow, just that Canadian Solar, as a stock, has minimal upside potential related to the long-term expansion of the solar industry. So long as supply and demand rise together, a factory will not generally expand its income without raising external capital. Thus, CSIQ's sustained EPS upside, even with a great demand outlook for Solar, is minimal to me, while its downside risk associated with a glut is considerable.Overall, I am slightly bearish on CSIQ today and believe it will continue to lose value over the coming months as its 2024-2025 EPS expectations decline due to the glut issue. If the allegations of labor issues in China result in actions from Western governments, then CSIQ's downside would be even more significant. That said, the same can be said for most solar companies, given that essentially all solar panels are produced in Asia, . Personally, while the US has made laws to stop the labor issue, enforcement is , potentially because green necessarily afford higher prices.At this point, it is difficult to say where exactly CSIQ may land once its bearish trend ends. It is just now reaching back into its pre-COVID price range, mirroring expectations of EPS deterioration. To me, given a near-or-below zero operating margin outlook, high leverage, and China-headquartered assets, I would not personally buy CSIQ at any price, given there is too much room for black-swan risk factors and financial deterioration. However, I would be surprised to see CSIQ cross below  10- 15 per share anytime soon, given it did earn substantial profits over the past year. Even if its prospects are in sharp reversal, it is unclear if this issue will last until 2024-2025 or longer. Thus, while I am bearish, I would not short CSIQ today because it has already lost so much value, and we will likely not know clearly how its financial position will be impacted by the macroeconomic shift until early 2024.

"Nvidia Was Up 235% In 2023, Don't Expect It To Continue (Rating Downgrade)","It is our stance that the stock market is not logical, rather it's sentimental. There is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100   - only to fall 40   in aThis roller coaster ride is most evident in tech stocks, which happens to be our specialty. Therefore, we openly and frequently discuss with our free newsletter readers the importance of layering into a leading position, setting up buy plans ahead of time, and also the importance of taking gains once the technicalWe've had unwavering conviction in Nvidia's AI story . In fact, it was our leading position going into 2023 and  exceeded Stanley Druckenmiller at 29 , meanwhile, Druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading AI portfolio. The Street is also  for being early to  , which was a latecomer recommendation in March 2023. Ark Invest often discusses AI as a leading trend, yet almost  entirely. We point this out because we provided Nvidia as a stock tip for free, repeatedly, with top-tier analysis delivered on Seeking Alpha and through , with our own capital backing the research.We are a strong proponent of offering quality information at the free level. We offer top-tier analysis every single week in our free newsletter,   Unfortunately, free information tends to come from those who are unproven and may not be very good investors at all, while those with a proven track record keep trades close to their chest.Not only do we actively manage every position we own and send real-time trade alerts, but we discuss openly and frequently our thoughts along the way. Our track record on Nvidia over the past 1-2 years looks like thisThe single biggest issue individual investors face is a lack of quality information that is , , and comes with  around position sizing, portfolio performance, and how to handle sell-offs.It is this last point that we'd like to discuss with you today,  how to handle selloffs.  We were considered crazy for buying Nvidia in 2022 and we are considered crazy for trimming in 2023. Yet, in what is rare transparency for the financial world, we are sharing with you our plans with this leading portfolio position.On August 28th, we put out our price analysis on NVDA. We offered two general scenarios that we see playing out, which are still very much in play today. Here is what we said back thenAlso, in the last report, we were looking for a breakout above  480 to signal that a low was in, and we were heading toward our first overhead target around of  545. We did see a breakout, but it failed to hold, which was a warning of more volatility to come. This, coupled with some heavy distribution volume above the  440 price level, had us decide to take more gains in Nvidia. However, we do not believe current prices are ideal for a long-term, buy and hold mindset. Patience will likely pay off in the long run. So, it will be up to each investor to decide if they want to take on the risk of potentially getting one more high.For us, the reward is not worth the risk, which is why we have decided to trim. Our last buy at  410 in July is our last buy, and we do not have any more buys planned until we see a resolution. There are two other AI-related stocks that we like better in the near term, and when we enter these, we will notify our premium members with real-time trade alerts.This remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the  340 support. Below there, and the top is likely in.Nvidia is a core holding of ours, so we will likely never close the position, as long as the story and tech trend remain intact. However, we do strongly believe in taking gains, reducing risk, and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis. That being said, we believe we are approaching one of these moments. Even though we broke a key trendline today, we expect a bounce to occur soon. If this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels, we will trim our position even more.There has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO, Jensen Huang. So far, he has sold over  110,000,000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks. Regarding insider activity, there are many reasons insiders sell, which may have nothing to do with the business. However, when you see the executives within a company, like the CEO, it's worth paying attention to. Since June, we've seen about  175,000,000 worth of NVDA sold.In conclusion, our broad market work suggests that a complex topping process is forming. Many sectors and stocks have likely topped, while some big tech names look like they have the potential for one more high into the end of the year.Insider activity and institutional selling point toward another high being less likely. If we do get that second high, our plan is to trim more. Until the  340 support breaks, NVDA still has the potential for that last swing higher. Regardless, we believe being patient will pay off for those looking to buy a great company at a great a price. We are also being patient for when we add back to our position and feel it's better to be defensive at the moment.If you own Nvidia stock, or are looking to own NVDA, we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars, held every Thursday at 4 30 pm EST.

Surge Battery Metals Is The Lithium Giant In Nevada That You Haven't Heard Of Yet,"My email box and phone blew up last week with friends and family forwarding the big news of Lithium Americas   huge caldera-hosted lithium mine in northern Nevada. 'HaveHowever, as boring as I've been blathering on about lithium mining stocks, I couldn't be satisfied with being ahead of the curve on lithium in general. After all, lithium prices have declined precipitously from record highs, so it has been a stock-pickers market for lithium mining stocks.Back to Lithium Americas. 'Yes, and yes,' I said, but then I added a big new reveal  There's an early-stage lithium company, Surge Battery Metals  , that looks to be sitting on a lithium deposit that checks all the boxes that Thacker Pass does and is arguably better, but it is trading at 1 10th the value or less. This company's property is also in Nevada, ranked the number one mining-friendly region in the world by the . They've drilled some remarkable holes judging by lithium content, strike length and initial geology and metallurgy. So remarkable that  the Chairman of the company  a respected figure in the world of lithium, mining, and finance  a Director  former Rio Tinto executive and geologist  and the Chairman of another public lithium mining company that became a strategic investor  American Lithium   all had a similar initial response  Surprise, intrigue and sometimes head-shaking disbelief., Chairman of   his company's approximate 10  stake in Surge Battery Metals  beginning at 11 34 - Director, .  Source   - Chairman,   Source  I'm going to assume that readers are familiar with the lithium space. I'm not going to discuss the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries, and I'll expend little to no ink on the differences between the three general types of lithium mining, hard-rock, brine, and sediment clay. The reason I'm going to skip all that for now is I want to get this article out rapidly because I think after last week's big pullback after a breakneck run, that Surge Battery Metals warrants a strong buy recommendation. I am convinced of this opinion based on the current supply and demand picture, my experience investing in lithium stocks and investing in general. I think that Surge Battery Metals will be acquired for at least five times the current market capitalization in relatively short order. I want this article to serve as a stake in the ground at this point in time so I get the intangible  credit  for having informed a wider audience about Surge Battery Metals, hopefully to our mutual success.Of course, hope is not a reliable investing strategy. In my long investing experience though, simple comparative economics is quite reliable. That is just taking one product, company, or resource project, and measuring it against another more established and higher valued one, and determining whether the former is undervalued based on the qualities of each project and the market capitalization of the companies being compared. I'll do that with Surge Battery Metals' Nevada North Lithium Project.The Nevada North Lithium Project  NNLP  is in Northeast Nevada in Elko County. It now encompasses 725 mineral claims, a total area of 22.45 square miles, and is open in multiple directions. The expanded size model is over 8.5 times larger than just this past February 2023 based on the latest results of the drilling campaign, soil samples, and geophysics.What first caught my attention about Surge's NNLP last November 2022 was the below map, showing geologist Alan Morris' area-wide soil sample results across the original footprint of the project. Stunningly, the pink purple regions reflect lithium values  from 500 to 5,120 parts per million  ppm .Not only are lithium readings at the surface like this extremely rare, the whole economics of a project can get a huge boost if the surface readings are confirmed to run deep. And they do, as confirmed by a 2022 drilling campaign that posted the results belowAs you can see, these results are extraordinary in terms of grade and strike length, and rival the best results of clay sediment hosted lithium anywhere in North America. Some highlights are the over  in hole 5 beginning right at the surface, and hole 7 which boasts So far during the current drilling campaign, two holes assays have come back from the third-party lab and have produced the following resultsHere in NN23-01 we have about   to Surge Battery Metals, the shallow zone includes lithium content , which is apparently the highest ppm in Nevada ever confirmed by a lab.NN23-02 continued to expand the size of the project to the northwest, as an , and contained one layer of core length of .About eight more holes have been drilled, including the deepening of a few previously drilled holes upon further indications of additional highly prospective zones of lithium at lower levels.If the Nevada North Lithium Project appears to be as significant in size, grade, ease of lithium extraction, and level of impurities as Thacker Pass, the NNLP should be valued the same as Thacker Pass. If the NNLP proves to be of greater significance in the majority of these factors, it should be valued higher than Thacker Pass. This is the basic thesis.However, we certainly need to add a lot of points to Thacker Pass for its stage of operations including finalized permitting and approval, finalized mining flow sheet and plan of operations, defined metallurgy, and financing. Lithium Americas has been at this a long time and is clearing ground and commencing operations. They are much farther along, and there is a significant value attributed to project stage by the Market.Once Lithium Americas finalizes its split into two entities, one which holds the South American assets and the other which holds the North American assets, we will know how the Market values Thacker Pass. Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Jaberwock Research wrote a  with a valuation estimate on the separated entities. They ascribe a value to Thacker Pass of  4.009 Billion, discounted by .7, excluding a 636 Million investment from GM, of which half has been injected so far. They give a value to the South American assets of  2.354 Billion post cash of  167 Million and debt of  279 Million. Because the Market is currently valuing the combined company at  2.72 Billion in Market Cap, which is less than half of Jaberwock's discounted all-in current value, I'll use their ratio of 70 30  in favor of Lithium Americas' North American assets. This comes to about  1.9 Billion for Thacker Pass in terms of current Market Cap.On to the comparison. Here is a table of the most important clay sediment hosted lithium deposits in North AmericaFrom the table above, we can see that Surge's NNLP has higher average grades than even stellar Thacker Pass, averaging 3,437 from its drilling campaign thus far.In its initiation of coverage, the analysts at SCP Resource Finance  previously known as Sprott Capital Partners  estimates, based on last year's drilling alone, a resource of 2.5-3Mt LCE   . They believe that this season's just completed drilling could lift the resource towards . SCP further sees blue sky potential of the NNLP at .Upcoming holes are being drilled deeper, to up to 1000 feet, and previously drilled holes are being deepened after indications of deeper targets. 15Mt LCE could even be conservative in my opinion, and we'll find out soon from the assays of these deeper targets.'How can one make an estimate like this with only the assays from 10 holes ' some will protest. Fortunately, the nature of clay-hosted lithium deposits gives geologists confidence, as clay-hosted deposits often show remarkable consistency and continuity across a wide area.Thacker Pass sits in the McDermitt Caldera, an ancient lake inside that formed inside a collapsed volcano which collected-lithium enriched sediments from various geologic occurrences over millions of years - including of course the volcano's initial eruption - constrained by the volcano's edges. Over time these sediments became further enriched with lithium as detailed in one of the papers principally authored by Lithium Americas' Thomas Benson, , that garnered a lot of well-deserved attention in the press recently.The high grades of Li-bearing clay being found at the NNLP are similar if not higher than the grades found at Thacker Pass, and the regional rocks have been described as of  to the McDermitt Tuff soils that host lithium at Thacker Pass. The NNLP sits in the site of the Jarbridge Caldera, and it appears from the location and geology that the same factors that enriched the lithium-bearing clays at Thacker Pass could also be responsible for the NNLP's  of lithium ppms.Further, in the recent  with Surge director Iain Scarr, he mentions that there is more Hectorite present in the soils of Thacker Pass than present at the NNLP, hence extracting the lithium from NNLP should be less complicated and less costly.Speaking about soils, the SCP analyst points to a beneficially low magnesium content  2-4  and the presence of coarse calcite crystals which aid in extraction purification efficiency.Another key factor in mining is 'overburden', which is simply how much relatively worthless rock and dirt sit above the valuable resource that must be removed to get to the good stuff. As mentioned above, . Compare this to Thacker Pass, which finds itself in the opposite position. At Thacker Pass, the best grades are generally  and the lesser grades are at the surface. Overburden equals additional cost. Surge's project is blessed with high grade at the surface in the resource area drilled so far.To sum up the comparison, Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine is being valued in the Market right now at  1.9 Billion before the second  300 Million  cash infusion from GM, assuming the value of the entire company pre-split is 70  in favor of Thacker Pass. We will find out this week, perhaps before this article comes out. Regardless, some Seeking Alpha contributors see a value of Thacker Pass of up to about  5.7 Billion  excluding the  636 Million from GM .Let's be a bit conservative and give Thacker Pass a current value of  1.5 Billion. Surge Battery Metals has a current market cap of about  109 Million U.S. dollars and a fully diluted market cap of about  140 Million U.S. dollars.That is a  In doing this comparison, I asked myself what the likelihood is that the NNLP becomes a mine. Considering all of the positives and the comparison that at the very least gives the NNLP an equal value if it becomes a mine after it is proved out by the requisite amount of drilling, I have no doubt that it does become a mine. It will probably not be owned by the same corporation at that point, as I can see Surge Battery Metals being acquired for a substantial premium in relatively short order.After all, Lithium Americas reportedly had numerous competitors vying to take the stake that GM ended up winning. The U.S. Administration has recognized the urgency of a domestic supply of lithium and other critical energy metals, and plenty of companies are finding out the hard way that some nations are looking to nationalize or further control lithium projects. Case in point  the Sonora Lithium project in Mexico. The government of Mexico just  a number of concessions from Chinese giant , in a move that could delay another large source of lithium to a world that is estimated to be going into deficit for years.When investing in the mining sector, it's often wise to bet on the repeat performers. Their contacts, geological experience, and instincts come in especially handy in the relatively small community of lithium experts. It's a small community because for a very long time, lithium wasn't worth a whole lot. How times have changed.The  of Surge Battery Metals is , an experienced executive and financier who sold his last company, Millennial Lithium, to none other than Lithium Americas for  490 Million U.S.The  of Surge is , who before Surge was EVP of Transmission and Distribution at British Columbia's electric utility BC Hydro, serving 4 Million customers. He previously served as Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and Chair of the BC Oil and Gas Commission. is a geologist with more than 30 years at Rio Tinto, including serving as Commercial Director and VP of Exploration. holds a BSc in chemistry and a PhD in flotation technology. A holder of numerous patents involving lithium processing and extraction, Dr. Mehta is a world-renowned expert in lithium mining, extraction, and processing. is EVP at American Lithium Corp. and the board representative for American Lithium's investment in Surge Battery Metals. He is a professional geoscientist and brings more than 30 years of experience in the exploration industry to the Company, including working directly on American Lithium's TLC Claystone Project in Nevada.Here is a rundown of Surge's share structure from their most recent corporate deckThe Company raised about  7 Million dollars in June 2023, mostly from American Lithium, which has funded their recent drilling and exploration campaign. They reported about  9.6 Million on the  at the end of June. Warrants attached to that financing should bring in some more money to the company if American Lithium chooses to increase its stake in Surge, which I expect them to do. Other financing will of course be necessary in the future for Surge to keep up the pace of drilling. Considering Surge's prospects and the attention coming to lithium in Nevada, I think financing will not be a problem and could come from many sources, including another strategic investor.As detailed previously, Surge just concluded its second drilling campaign and has released results on two of them. There are about eight yet to be released after they are analyzed at the lab, including some that have been re-entered with a rig that can handle greater depths.Other news could relate to additional land acquisitions, additional strategic investors, and perhaps additional site visits another global automaker, which the CEO described after the initial drilling results were released.Then, the Maiden Resource Estimate  MRE  will be released, estimated by the company variously to be arriving as early as November 2023 but at the latest Q1 2024. More recently, company representatives have said that Q1 is more likely, to allow the incorporation of the results of the whole second drilling campaign.Below is my own standard list of the main risks I consider specifically when considering an investment in junior mining stocks, beyond the general risks inherent in any public company investmentWhat balances some of these standard risks in Surge's case is Lithium Americas' hard-fought but trailblazing success. They had rough patches along the way, had court fights and doubters of the technology behind lithium extraction from clay sediment, but emerged successful and are rumored to be close to a  from the U.S. government to fund mine construction.Surge is the beneficiary of the  Second Mover Advantage . By following Lithium Americas' playbook where it was successful and avoiding the minefields where it had difficulties, Surge could really expedite the timeline to a producing mine, or a buyout. Who better to guide the team than Chairman Graham Harris who led his company's buyout by Lithium Americas, and CEO Greg Reimer  who rapidly focused Surge on the NNLP and started to assemble a crack team when he saw what they had in the ground  Chairman Harris has done this before, and I was a beneficiary since I owned stock in Millennial Lithium.One final point concerns the price of battery-grade lithium. Spot prices are volatile, and reflect short-term supply and demand considerations, but most lithium is purchased on long-term contracts. Some might think that currently depressed prices in the spot market are a sign of a surplus of lithium. Maybe if viewed week-to-week, but the long-term demand picture is extremely bullish, and might even get desperate as countries increasingly look to protect their own national lithium interests, cancel concessions, and various mines get delayed or cancelled such as  in Serbia and Sonora in Mexico.Analysts at Macquarie have  that lithium supplies have been depleted now to the level where prices began to soar the last time.Sometime in the near future, but within a year, I expect Surge Battery Metals to be acquired by one of the big names in lithium such as Rio Tinto, Albermarle, BHP, Lithium Americas, or even a specialty chemical conglomerate, auto manufacturer or oil major. There are a lot of contenders out there, and if  I think the operative word is  Surge's official MRE confirms the highest-grade clay-hosted resource in North America, which has minimal overburden and favorable extraction parameters, I predict Surge's share price will ramp up further to reflect greater awareness of this remarkable project.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Scorpio Tankers Q2: A New Fleet, A Strong Strategy, A Promising Future"," , a leading provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the challenging market conditions, the company has demonstrated resilience and strategic financial management, which are key indicators of its potentialThe oil shipping market is influenced by a myriad of factors. These include global oil supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and broader economic conditions. Each of these elements plays a significant role in shaping the industry's landscape and, more specifically, the spot rates for oil tankers.Global oil supply is one of the key drivers of spot rates in the oil shipping market. Spot rates, the price for immediate charter of aCurrently, we are witnessing a period of relatively low oil inventories, which is contributing to an upward trend in spot rates. This situation is beneficial for oil tanker companies like Scorpio Tankers, as higher spot rates are leading to increased revenues and profitability.Another critical factor influencing the oil shipping market is the rate of fleet growth. The number of new ships being built and added to the global fleet can significantly impact the supply-demand dynamics in the industry. Currently, the industry is experiencing lower fleet growth levels relative to historical averages. This trend is primarily driven by high interest rates, which make the financing of new ship construction more expensive, and the fact that many shipyards are currently occupied with building other types of ships.This lack of new ship construction is leading to a tightening of supply in the oil shipping market. With fewer new ships entering the market, the existing fleet is in higher demand, which can further drive up spot rates. For well-leveraged oil tanker businesses like STNG, this situation presents an opportunity. With a modern and efficient fleet, they are well-positioned to capitalize on these market dynamics.STNG's financial results for  showed a net income of  132.4 million and an adjusted net income of  133.3 million. While these figures represent a decrease from Q2 2022, it's important to consider them in the broader context of the company's performance and the market conditions.The global oil shipping market is known for its volatility, with rates and revenues often fluctuating in response to changes in oil supply and demand, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. Despite these challenges, STNG has demonstrated a strong ability to navigate this complex landscape and generate increasing profits.Looking at the company's performance for the first half of 2023  H1 2023 , STNG reported a net income of  325.6 million and an adjusted net income of  328.9 million. These figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022, indicating a strong upward trend in the company's profitability.Furthermore, STNG's ability to maintain profitability despite the decrease in net income in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022 demonstrates the company's resilience in the face of market volatility. It suggests that STNG has effective strategies in place to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities, positioning it well for future growth.Management has been actively managing its debt through a combination of lease repayments, debt reductions, and new financing agreements.In , STNG exercised purchase options on several vessels that were previously financed under various lease agreements. This resulted in a significant aggregate debt reduction of  300.2 million. In July 2023, the company continued this strategy by exercising purchase options on six more vessels, leading to an additional debt reduction of  143.6 million. STNG also gave notice to exercise purchase options on two more vessels, which is expected to result in a further debt reduction of  36.5 million by the end of Q3 2023. This shows a strategy of wanting to deleverage, especially away from more expensive lease agreements.In addition to these debt reduction strategies, STNG has also secured new financing agreements. The company executed or received commitments for three separate credit facilities totaling up to  1.2 billion. The first credit facility, executed in May 2023, was a  117.4 million facility from a European financial institution. The second, executed in July 2023, was a term loan and revolving credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to  1.0 billion. Upon execution,  440.6 million was drawn from this facility to finance 21 of the company s unencumbered vessels. The remaining availability of this facility is expected to be drawn between Q3 2023 and the end of Q1 2024, primarily to repay and refinance more expensive lease financing. The third credit facility commitment, expected to close within Q3 2023, is a  94 million facility from DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, which will be used to finance four vessels.These strategies reflect STNG's proactive approach to managing its debt. By reducing its existing debt through the exercise of purchase options on leased vessels and securing new, lower-cost financing, STNG is effectively lowering its interest expenses and improving its financial position. This approach not only reduces the company's financial risk but also frees up resources that can be used to invest in its operations and growth initiatives.Scorpio's active share repurchase program is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. Share repurchase programs are often implemented when a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment. In their  Scorpios management outlined their thoughts on this explicitly stating  Share repurchases preferred over dividends when trading a significant discount to NAV.  During the most recent quarter, STNG purchased  283 million worth of shares at an average price of  48 per share. This move reduced the company's basic shares outstanding to 53 million from 56.8 million. Since the start of 2023, STNG has repurchased a substantial 8.6 million shares for a total of  421.1 million. This aggressive repurchase strategy underscores the company's belief in its intrinsic value and its commitment to capitalizing on what it perceives to be a market undervaluation of its shares. Over the past few months, STNG has been buying shares at prices ranging from  43 to  49 per share, demonstrating its commitment to this strategy and providing an idea of what they see is trading below NAV.Moreover, STNG still has  213 million remaining under its 2023 securities repurchase program. At current prices around  50 per share, this could potentially lead to the repurchase of an additional 4.26 million shares, or roughly 7.5  of the current shares outstanding. This further reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to an increase in earnings per share  EPS , all else being equal, and continue to boost the share price.It's also worth noting that STNG has preferred share repurchases over dividends when its shares are trading at a significant discount to Net Asset Value  NAV . This strategy suggests that the company is focused on long-term value creation rather than short-term yield.The age of a company's fleet is a significant factor in the maritime shipping industry, particularly for oil tankers. The typical useful lifetime of an oil tanker is between 20 to 30 years. After this period, the cost of maintaining and operating the vessel often outweighs the benefits, leading companies to retire and replace these older vessels.The global fleet's average age currently stands at 11.7 years. This figure is a crucial benchmark as it provides context for comparing individual companies' fleet ages. A fleet age significantly below this average suggests a company is operating with newer vessels, which often translates into operational and financial advantages.Scorpio Tankers Inc. stands out in this regard, boasting a modern fleet with a Deadweight Tonnage weighted average-year built of 2015. This figure is considerably newer than the global average and also surpasses some of Scorpio's direct competitors. For instance, International Seaways  and Nordic American Tankers  both have fleet average build years of 2011.Moreover, some of these competitors' fleets include ships that are reaching or have already reached their retirement age. This situation could lead to substantial capital expenditures in the near future as these companies may need to invest in new vessels to maintain their operational capacity.In contrast, Scorpio's oldest ship was built in 2012, meaning none of its vessels are approaching retirement age and many are debt-free and still have dozens of years of operation. This situation provides Scorpio with a significant advantage, as it can avoid the substantial costs associated with replacing older vessels for the foreseeable future.The benefits of a younger fleet extends beyond avoiding the costs of replacing older vessels. Younger fleets often have lower maintenance costs as newer vessels are less likely to require significant repairs. They also tend to be more fuel-efficient and are more likely to meet the latest safety and environmental regulations, which can lead to cost savings, operational efficiencies and help reduce political risk associated with older vessels. Scorpio Tankers' conservative dividend payout ratio of 10.42  demonstrates the company's strategic approach towards its long-term financial health. By retaining a significant percentage of its earnings, the company has more capital available for reinvestment into its operations and growth initiatives, and for reducing its debt load.A focus on debt reduction is particularly advantageous in the current economic climate, where rising interest rates are a concern for many businesses. By reducing its net debt, which has fallen from - 2,934 million in Q4 2021 to - 1,523 million currently, Scorpio Tankers is effectively lowering its future interest payments. This is significant because a substantial proportion of the company's debts are in the form of floating rate notes, the interest rates of which increase in tandem with market rates. A lower debt burden could even potentially lead to improved credit ratings and better loan terms in the future.Despite the expected drop in the Fleet TCE rate to  26,210 from  32,154 in Q2, the company's strategic financial management and modern fleet position it well to navigate these challenges. The company's focus on debt reduction and share buybacks over dividends suggests a long-term growth strategy that could yield significant returns for investors.The company's revenue is heavily tied to the global oil industry, and fluctuations in oil supply and demand can directly impact its profitability. This commodity price risk means that a drop in oil prices could reduce the demand for oil transportation, leading to lower revenues for Scorpio Tankers which is predicted by Scorpio in their latest earnings.Furthermore, the company's significant debt load, a portion of which is subject to floating interest rates, exposes it to interest rate risk. Should interest rates rise, Scorpio Tankers could see its interest expenses increase substantially, affecting its profitability and ability to service its debt. The company also faces regulatory risk as the shipping industry is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. Changes in these regulations could necessitate major capital expenditures, potentially impacting Scorpio Tankers' financial performance. Operational risks, inherent to the shipping industry, include potential accidents, piracy, and environmental disasters, which could lead to significant costs, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liabilities. Finally, the cyclical nature of the shipping industry and its susceptibility to global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in seaborne trade patterns create market risk for Scorpio Tankers. Downturns in the shipping cycle could decrease demand for the company's services and put downward pressure on shipping rates, which could potentially impact revenues.With all of this information on dividends, , stock buy backs and overall strong market tail winds. How do we value STNG not only against the overall market but also against some of it's peers  From a dividend perspective, STNG is trading slightly higher than their 4Y average of 1.97  at an estimated FWD rate of 2.11 . It is the lowest among its peers, especially when you add in INSW's special dividends that don't show up in their yield in the TTM or Fwd. But they also have a low payout ratio, so as they finish up deleveraging, and as their stock rises to a point they feel matches their NAV they will likely begin to focus more on dividends and less on stock buybacks. I imagine that target NAV valuation is around the  52- 55 mark, and I expect them to continue to have large stock buybacks below that price. Delving into the Price to Earnings ratio, Scorpio Tankers stands out with a trailing twelve months  P E ratio of 3.27, the lowest among its peers. This can be attributed to its relatively high debt load, as evidenced by its EV Market Cap ratios. This ratio provides a snapshot of a company's financial situation, encompassing debt, cash, and market value. STNG's position towards the higher end of this industry ratio suggests its financial strength may be less robust compared to competitors like INSW and DHT.However, the future looks promising for STNG. I anticipate that as the company manages its debt more effectively and harnesses the industry-wide earnings momentum to boost its cash reserves, it will be better capitalized. This improved financial health should enable the company to provide increased returns to its investors and drive a non-linear return, especially if Spot Charter Rates stay elevated. In my view, Scorpio Tankers Inc. represents an attractive investment opportunity, especially in terms of its Net Asset Value. Given the high valuations of ships and STNG's relatively new fleet, I believe purchasing its shares at any price below  57 represents good value. If the price drops below  40, it would be a highly attractive investment.It's important to remember, though, that the market is cyclical and can be significantly influenced by geopolitical events, which can quickly shift price targets. While this price target isn't high relative to the current prices levels. I like to set low Price Targets that I believe afford optimum risk reward ratios rather than pie in the sky valuations that companies will struggle to grow in to. Scorpio Tankers Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, strategic debt management, active share repurchase program, modern fleet, and low fleet to EV valuation.

"Yes, This September Nonfarm Payrolls Report Supports The Soft Landing Narrative","This morning's  came in white-hot at aboutThe market initially reacted with a sharp selloff, and yields spiked. By lunch hour, what started looking like a vicious selloff turned into a nice rally, complete with the S P VIX Index  falling 4  at 12 27 p.m. and the Nasdaq and Russell both up north of 1 . The expectations were for a soft report that showed a slowdown in hiring, particularly after the private sector  came in at only 89,000 earlier in the week.There were reasons to expect a weak jobs report. Still, in the end, economic strength in the labor market appears to have been greater than even the most optimistic economist forecasted. Indeed, many expected a hiring slowdown and a focus on economic weakness would be a problem.Now, the concern would appear to be the opposite  at least, that was the concern when markets first opened. However, this report seems to confirm that a soft landing is underway because jobs are being gained, and labor participation is high and steady. Yet, the wage gains are slowing and do not appear likely to reignite inflationary pressure.Nobody predicted a super-hot report, and those who discussed it thought it would play out very differently. Even seasoned market minds who discussed the prospect of a hot report were utterly wrong about how the market would respond to one. For example, consider this quote from Scott Wapner's program on CNBC yesterdayI am a big fan of Josh Brown's analysis, and while I don't always agree with his take on markets, I know he's a knowledgeable guy who does his homework. Frankly, yesterday, I would have agreed with his take. We look at the price on a screen like it is one thing. Like it changes at the whim of some unforeseen invisible hand. But the price is one of the best pieces of information you have because it reflects so many different decisions in one piece of information.The price may be one thing on your screen, but it is the sum of billions of decisions and transactions. So, the lesson is not that Mr. Brown is a lousy commentator  it is that the market humbles us all with its collective wisdom that inherently transcends what we can comprehend from the individual perspective. And I think the market took time to process the report and saw precisely what I saw  stark evidence of a soft landing. As you can see below, the recent rise in rates has not been because of inflation anyway  it's more about increasing term premia, which is .The analysis leading up to the report was a perfect case study of what happens when the crowd uses heuristics about second-order thinking to substitute for actual second-order thinking. In the market, various catchphrases tend to spread like wildfire and substitute the complex critical thought necessary to achieve alpha and a leg up over the crowd.  Good news is bad news  is one such aphorism that may have shreds of truth, but it also requires an underlying understanding of why to preserve intellectual dexterity.Firstly, let's dispel the assumption that the Fed doesn't want you to have a job right now. I'm sure Fed Chair Jay Powell and even the most hawkish members of the FOMC want you to have a job. It builds character and self-esteem. It puts money in your pocket. They want you to have a job for the same reason that old Mom and Dad encouraged you to get one. They don't want workers to have too high a degree of bargaining power in the market relative to employers because they can push up wages fast enough to reignite inflationary pressure. The Fed is trying to avoid a wage-price spiral, not trying to get you fired.But suppose the high labor costs don't lead to higher prices, and workers' ability to demand higher wages declines. In that case, you have the best of both worlds  falling inflation without the collateral damage of adverse dislocation in the labor market. So, this report confirms that a soft landing is indeed possible. Not only that, job growth appears to be driven by consumers at the lower end of the income spectrum, and labor participation has stayed at high levels, always a tonic for nervous hawks.When the market opened down, I was going to write that this was a buying opportunity. However, the market beat me to it. I can't stress this enough  I think a market rally on a scorching jobs report is a significant positive and, in some ways, a more bullish outcome than I could have imagined. I think markets will rise from here, and Q4 will live up to its seasonal strength.Look, there were definitely some angry bears this morning who thought they were about to cash in. That doesn't mean they're wrong about everything. The rising debt obligations of the United States and the potential for these levels to crowd out private sector activity are becoming more real by the day. At the same time, it may urge the Fed to make  higher for longer  last for less time than the market currently expects.The backdrop of political chaos in one of America's major political parties that could further gum up calcified political alliances that make reform difficult makes the problematic debt situation all the more ominous. Another significant risk is that the UAW strike could cause some economic dislocation. The following risks could derail any market rally, thoughFurthermore, inflation forecasts have been rising from economists. If they are correct and inflation isn't defeated, we may have much more volatility ahead of us, and the prospect of a Fed policy error rises dramatically.So, while the rally on the jobs blowout counter to expectations is very bullish and makes me want to buy, there are certainly no shortages of serious risks to contemplate. Any one of them could derail a rally and make the year-end on a sour note. Still, I think it is likelier that we climb a wall of worry and end the year on a high note.This morning's actions surprised a lot of folks, myself included. Nonetheless, your conclusion from the herky-jerky market action this morning is ultimately bullish. While the jobs number was hot, it did not indicate that wages would reignite inflationary pressure. So this turns  good news being bad news  into just plain good news. It also paves the way for the coveted White Buffalo of financial markets, a soft landing.Supply and demand is a seemingly simple concept, but it can be challenging to understand on a macro level when the labor market is involved. Like the price, headline labor numbers reflect a prodigious and complex reality that doesn't lend itself well to being boiled down to one number. But beyond the headline number, we're really after observations about collective behavior. The behavioral indicators suggest that it would be difficult to ignite the type of inflation that the Fed fears most. It is even more difficult now that wage pressures appear to be alleviating.If I am worried about a recession and I tighten my belt, but then the expected drop in demand doesn't materialize or demand increases, then not only have I likely expanded my margins. I probably need to hire an extra hand or two to help with all the business I didn't expect. I think this is what is going on in the economy, and I think countervailing forces make a soft landing likelier than recent rate angst would suggest.

My View On Wall Street: I Assess The Pros And Cons,"The S P 500 has declined about 9.5  since I last published the Equity Market PROs and CONs report on July 28th. At the end of July, investors were flying high as the major indices had put in an impressiveWe closed out another losing month in September and set sail into Q4, and now we'll revisit the PROs and CONS that are on the scene today. In this report, the  12-8 - with 2 issues that I consider Neutral.The last two months of trading in the market have been difficult for the BULLS. The major averages peaked in late July early August and have been trending lower everInvestor sentiment took forever to turn bullish this year. ironically it turned earlier this summer just in time for equities to peak and pull back in August and September. This typical contrarian indicator worked again. Now, it's back to bearish for investors. The Bespoke Investor Sentiment Composite is negative once again and CNN's Fear   Greed Index is registering  Fear  right now. Since the sentiment is contrarian, excess bearishness is considered Bullish.Seasonality was a 'Con' in my last PROs and CONs report, and unfortunately for the BULLS, it didn't disappoint. August and September weakness for equities held to form this year, but now seasonality moves back into the 'PRO' column as Q4 is typically the best time of year for stocks. As shown below in the snapshot from the Bespoke Seasonality Tool, the upcoming 3-month period has been the very best 3-month period of the year for stocks over the last ten years.The 100th percentile for gains is certainly bullish.Core inflation has come down and is showing signs of stability. Supercore inflation is deflating slower but still making progress. While inflation isn't DEAD, the stock market by its price action after the last report believes the peak is definitely in and is ready to deal with current readings for a while longer.Initial jobless claims have steadied while employment growth has slowed. Prime-age employment remains just shy of a record-high share of the population. While job openings have declined  indicating weaker labor demand , the level remains very high compared to historical readings.Consumers still have lots of cash on their balance sheets, even relative to much stronger consumer spending relative to pre-pandemic. While savings rates are low, consumer borrowing is well-covered by income and households can keep spending at a healthy  if slowly moderating  pace for some time. When consumers have jobs they will continue to spend. In addition, Corporations are not about to give up the employees they had a hard time acquiring after the pandemic. That keeps the labor situation  tight .A range of manufacturing industries are rapidly adding factory capacity in response to recent industrial policy  CHIPS, BIL, IRA . Construction on factories is running north of  200bn per year with hundreds of billions more in spending to come. At the same time, the housing market is still short of inventory and will be for years to come. Finally, infrastructure spending has accelerated sharply thanks to fiscal policy and is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a double-edged sword. Good news for select sectors of the economy but it also keeps  Debt  and  Inflation  elevated.During the 2022 bear market, rolling 12-month forward earnings estimates fell 6.5  from peak to trough. Since then, they have recovered almost the entire decline. Of course, analysts tend to lag the market, and estimates only started getting cut well after the 2022 bear market was underway. Still, underlying earnings are in good shape. Recent results have also started to turn more positive. The EPS beat rate fell from its historic post-COVID surge, but over the last few months has ramped back up again. A similar, more modest recovery in guidance raise rates is also taking place.The equity market thrives on  themes , and  AI  has been the market's theme in a big way for most of this year. There's a good chance this becomes a  rather than  wave. Over the long term that is bullish for equities. Every week there seems to be some new technology in the AI space introduced, and search interest for AI topics remains elevated and trending higher.The only question is when will real money hit the bottom line.Outside of the mega-caps in the S P 500, it has been a flat year for the market. So even though the cap-weighted S P 500 is still showing a 10  YTD gain, things aren't nearly as rosy underneath the surface. The median S P 500 stock is flat, while the median stock in the small-cap Russell 2000 is solidly in the red at -7 . That doesn't look like the  new  BULL market backdrop that the majority says it is. As the week ended I now see ALL of the indices barely above their Long term trendlines. This equity  market   is living on the edge.Main Street media always talk about the 2-year 10-year Treasury Yield curve. The Fed also watches another metric. The 3-month 10-year Treasury yield curve has now been inverted for a record 222 consecutive trading days. The curve reached its maximum point of inversion in early May at 183 basis points and has steepened to its current level of -75. Given that it has been nearly a year since the curve first inverted and the economy still appears to be steady, there's a growing consensus that the current signal has been a false alarm.But don't dismiss the yield curve too quickly. As shown in the table below, historically, the average number of days between when the yield curve first inverts to the start of a recession is 589 days.From the time the yield curve bottoms to the start of a recession, the average is 395 days. Based on these two figures, a recession in the second half of 2024 would fit right within the averages.The Leading Economic Indicators index published by the Conference Board takes a range of different economic and financial market data points into account and creates a single index that tends to deteriorate before recessions and recover before activity bottoms. As shown in the chart,  In other words, if we don't see a recession following this run of data, it will be an unprecedented result.The Leading Indicators have fallen for 18 consecutive months. Only two other periods have seen longer streaks of decline  the mid-1970s recession and the global financial crisis.There is a consensus view that the FOMC is near its terminal rate or close to it. However, the message we heard this week from Chair Powell is  It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That too is pretty scary. The Fed is in a box and along with the market is facing a lose-lose situation.Home prices have surged thanks to a mismatch between supply and demand. High mortgage rates mean existing homeowners are unwilling to surrender extremely low rates, further restricting supply.Those high mortgage rates also damage affordability driven by high prices. When combined, affordability has hit the worst levels since the 1980s, with the average non-managerial worker needing to pay the equivalent of 86.7 hours of wages to cover the mortgage payment for the median existing home assuming 5  down. And down payments are increasingly difficult to save up given high prices.The shock to the banking system delivered late last year and early this year has largely been digested by the market. However, leading indicators of bank credit suggest a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank lending over the next year.The SLOOS  Senior Loan Officer Outlook Survey  asks lenders whether they are seeing higher or lower demand for credit, as well as whether they are raising or lowering the standards they underwrite to. As shown in the chart below, the reported demand for credit and the reported credit standards suggest that commercial   industrial  C I  loan growth is set to slow dramatically.Declining credit outstanding would only do bad things for the economic backdrop.The terrorist attack in Israel highlights another U.S. policy error. From a financial point of view that brings the country into another conflict. The US  debt  issue was highlighted in last week's MACRO update. It appears the US is now supporting two wars. Ukraine, and now Israel along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the  since WWII. This country has never been more stretched and vulnerable, and at some point, this will have a serious impact on the MACRO economic scene. At some point, the market sniffs this MACRO issue as the serious threat that it is.Two years ago, we could look at an S P 500 P E ratio in the high teens, or even 20, and say that at least interest rates were low. Bespoke Investment group  On a trailing basis, the S P 500 trades for 20.6 times earnings, and while that is far from a record, it ranks in the 83rd percentile relative to all other readings in the post-WWII era. Comparing the earnings yield of the S P 500  inverse of the P E ratio  to the yield on the 10-year US Treasury, the current spread of 0.25 percentage points is the lowest since 2010.While 'the market' is expensive, the key driver of the valuation stems from the largest stocks in the index. As shown below, the 10-largest stocks in the index, which account for 32  of the S P 500, trade for a median of 31.7 times earnings with four stocks trading for over 65 times earnings.Meanwhile, the median multiple of the remaining 490 stocks is  20 times trailing earnings. That was OK when interest rates were zero, but at 5  we are in a different backdrop that typically takes PE ratios down.This  CON  has been on the list since the beginning of the year, yet stocks have risen. As mentioned earlier, the S P 500's earnings yield relative to Treasury yields and real rates is at its lowest levels in decades, meaning stocks are less attractive relative to risk-free rates. The S P 500's dividend yield was more than 100 basis points higher than the 2-year Treasury yield two years ago,  There is an alternative to stocks again. As uncertainty ramps higher, investors will reach for risk-free yield. All of that cash that many analysts and BULLS say is on the sidelines and will go into stocks, seems more like a  Hope  trade. Those analysts are living in the past.While inflation readings have come down dramatically over the last year, the June Year over-year reading of 2.9  might be as good as it gets in the near term. Huge month-over-month increases in CPI in early 2022 are now removed from the y y CPI tally, which will make it harder for CPI to continue lower in the coming months unless we see outright deflation which is not currently projected. Investors expecting the y y CPI number to continue lower may be surprised to see it keep ticking higher up towards 3.5 -4  through year-end and beyond. The latest PCE report confirms that inflation is still hanging on, and any further progress will be SLOW.From the October 2022 peak through the July 14th bottom, the broad trade-weighted dollar fell 8.4 . Over the last three months, it has risen close to 4 . Since 1973, larger-than-typical dollar rallies have led to lower-than-typical S P 500 returns. As long as the dollar is strong, it's doubtful the stock market will take off in a big way. Of course, the inverse statement is also true  a reversal lower in the dollar would set up a positive backdrop.The bull market's uptrend from the October 2022 low has been celebrated, but as I have continually pointed out the near-term technicals do not look good. They still have a lot to prove before I can BUY into the New BULL market scene.We've seen  since the market made its high for the year on the last day of July. For this negative technical action to turn, we'll need indices to break above their early September highsThe results of all five of the regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys for September were released. Altogether, regional Fed surveys have shown that manufacturing activity improved slightly in September. The PRO crowd will claim that we have seen the bottom and improvement is on its way.The folks that present the Bearish argument say  Show me . They point out that after two years of declines, the net readings are still in contraction territory. The fact that stocks hit such extreme oversold levels towards the end of September - a notoriously weak time of year for stocks - is a 'PRO' in the minds of an optimist, as there is a tendency for prices to revert when they get this overdone.Furthermore, Treasury yields, the dollar, and oil are all at extremes to the upside at the same time. It doesn't take much for a big reversal to occur when things get this one-sided. That is true BUT  extreme  conditions can last for longer than an investor wants to believe.  Hoping  for a change in direction is a bad strategy.This time around there are some distinct changes on the list. In July the standout on the PRO side was the trend reversal resulting in a BULL market backdrop that I said trumped just about all of the negatives. This time around we see that has changed again as many indices and the DJIA along with the Russell 2000 are back in a BEAR backdrop.On the CON side, the T.A.R.A. argument is still there and it has started to impact the market, especially when uncertainty ramps up. There is plenty of cash on the sidelines, but probabilities suggest a lot of that cash won't make it into equities due to the  risk-free  alternatives. This is one of the reasons I do not see another rip-roaring BULL market leg to new all-time highs on the horizon. The Earnings forecast is the one issue to watch, and  It is a fluid situation that can change quickly. At the end of the day that will control what happens in the very near term. After I put the report together, I came away with the feeling that the PROs are centered around the near-term prospects, while many of the CONs speak to the MACRO view.Last week's selling pressure bled over to Monday's  open  with the S P establishing a new intraday low during this  correction . However, buyers emerged and the S P rebounded to post a modest seven-point loss. The price action was typical for a market that is trying to find a bottom. Intraday rallies dissipate, and there is plenty of choppy price action. The NASDAQ snapped a 4-day losing streak with a modest gain. No such luck for the other indices. The S P extended its daily losing streak to 5, with the DJIA and Russell 2000 establishing 4 straight days of losses.More choppy trading on Tuesday was eventually resolved to the upside, something we haven't seen in a while. All major indices and every sector posted gains for the day as investors celebrated another  Turnaround Tuesday .The party ended there for the BULLS. The combined losses for the S P 500 in the last 3 days of trading tallied 3 . While the NASDAQ Composite fell 3.9 .

Rather, the issue is that many skilled workers of the national oil company have fled the country amid record-setting inflation and political chaos.

Enterprise Products Partners: The Highest-Quality 8%-Yielding Wide Moat MLP,"The energy sector is highly complex. It consists of so many fundamental influences and industries that it's easy to lose track - especially when looking for something specific.Essentially, the energy industry consists of three major partsAs the overview below shows, upstream companies are the ones that produce natural gas and crude oil, which is the basis for a wide range of products, including gasoline, diesel, and various chemicals.The companies turning raw products into finished products are refiners. However, in order for these companies to get access to feedstock, midstream companies are needed. These companies provide storage and pipelines to ship, i.e., oil to refineries.The finished products are then shipped to the end customer using midstreamHaving said that, upstream, midstream, and downstream all have pros and cons.Investors looking to capitalize on rising oil and gas prices are better off buying upstream companies as these companies have revenue streams tied to the price of commodities.Refiners are dependent on the crack spread, which is the profit margin of refiners that buy oil to turn it into diesel, gasoline, and other products. These companies also are price sensitive, just different from upstream companies.Midstream companies are the most boring companies - but in a good way.These companies are dependent on the amount of product flowing through their pipelines and contract prices. Most companies also have take-or-pay contracts, which allow them to generate revenue, regardless of whether customers use their pipelines.The benefit is that cash flows tend to come with very low volatility, which is great for dividend safety. The drawdown is that investors do not benefit from a potentially steep increase in commodity prices. On the flip side, investors also do not suffer if prices drop.The biggest risk is a scenario where commodity prices are so depressed that upstream companies are likely to reduce output. This could hurt volumes for midstream companies. The same goes for weak end-user demand.While I cannot make the case that midstream companies are without risks, they come with a great risk reward, given high average dividend yields and, above all, very wide moat business models. After all, it's extremely expensive to build a pipeline and terminal network.Once companies have a network in place, they quickly turn into cash cows. is such a company.This company may be one of the best in the business. It has a history of stock price outperformance, a top-tier balance sheet, loads of free cash flow thanks to a mature business model, a juicy yield, and a moat that can be seen from space.In this article, I'll walk you through my thoughts as I make the case that EPD is among the best high-yield midstream companies money can buy.As one of America's largest pipeline and terminal operators, EPD isn't unbiased. However, it makes a compelling case for a strong future of fossil fuels.For example, EPD makes the case that energy usage is essential to improve the UN Human Development Index. This index covers life expectancy, education, and economic wealth.As we can see in the overview below, the higher the Human Development Index, the higher the demand for energy.While, at some point, energy efficiency becomes key, as more energy doesn't improve the Human Development Index anymore  between roughly 150 and 200 Gigajoules per capita , it's fair to say that the development of economies is based on energy demand.It's why coal production was so important during the industrial revolution, as it allowed the US and other Western nations to start building wealthy economies. While we're now at a point where renewables are increasingly important, our wealth is built on coal, oil, and gas.Hence, EPD puts a big question mark in the chart below, as there's no way we can achieve Paris Climate Agreement targets in a scenario where the global population growth until 2050 is expected to be 1.8 billion.In light of these developments, the United States is the place to be. The United States enjoys some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world, a massive infrastructure network allowing it to produce and export these reserves, and stock-listed companies that allow investors to benefit from this.Looking at the chart below, oil, gas, and related liquids production is expected to see consistent growth, albeit at lower growth rates compared to pre-pandemic levels. That's why I'm also bullish on upstream, but that's something we'll discuss in another article.Additionally, the US will be an increasingly important export nation for crude oil, natural gas, ethane, LPG, and related.EPD has highlighted domestic demand versus total supply in the charts below. Note that by 2030, the U.S. will also be able to boost LNG  liquid natural gas  exports to more than 40 billion cubic feet per day. In 2021, that number was 11 billion.Having said all of this, rising energy production, higher export demand, and long-term tailwinds for fossil fuels are fertile ground for EPD.Founded in 1968, EPD is one of the oldest MLPs in the United States. With a market cap of  58 billion, it's also one of the biggest.In this case, its age is a huge advantage. The company is mature, which means it has an established network of pipelines and terminals without the requirement to spend a lot on growth capital expenditures.When dealing with midstream companies, I usually advise people to go with mature companies, as these are often able to pay dividends without having to borrow money.Looking at the map below, we see that the company has a network of more than 50,000 miles of pipelines, more than 260 million barrels of storage, 20 deep water docks, 30 natural gas processing plants, and 26 fractionators.Over the past 12 months, EPD spent  2.7 billion on capex. This is a combination of growth and maintenance capex.This number has been well-below pre-pandemic levels when the company had to consistently invest more in its business to grow it.Now, it benefits from strong  and rising  operating cash flow from past growth investments and subdued investment requirements.Before 2017, the company didn't generate  a lot of  free cash flow. Now, it's generating more than  4 billion in annual free cash flow.This number is expected to gradually increase to  6.5 billion by 2025, which would translate to more than 11  of its market cap.As a result of these qualities, the company has a 3.0x leverage ratio, which is extremely healthy. Hence, it has an A- Baa1 credit rating, one of the best ratings in the industry.FurthermoreFurthermore, unlike many peers that had to cut their dividends when a toxic mix of falling energy prices and high capex needs hit them in 2015 2016, EPD has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive years.Also, looking at the numbers below, the company has a well-covered dividend and self-funded capex. It's now a healthy cash cow with tremendous dividend potential, thanks to an expected double-digit free cash flow yield after 2024.These qualities have also allowed EPD to outperform its peers. Over the past 10 years, EPD shares have returned 71   including dividends . The Alerian MLP ETF  returned just 7 .When looking at our rating tracker, we see that the company enjoys the highest quality score in the industry, which is no surprise, given what we have discussed so far.Valuation wise, we're dealing with an attractive opportunity.The company is trading at 8.9x 2024E EBITDA, which is based on its market cap, roughly  1.0 billion in minority interest  income streams it doesn't fully own ,  27.5 billion in expected net debt, and  9.7 billion in potential EBITDA.This valuation is attractive, as EPD tends to trade close to 10x EBITDA.This would give the company a fair value 18  above the current unit price.The current consensus price target is  32, which is 20  above the current price, making my outlook a consensus outlook.Having said all of this, I expect EPD to outperform most of its peers on a prolonged basis. The company has the perfect low-risk business model, strong demand and supply tailwinds, a healthy balance sheet, self-funded operations, and a well-covered dividend.On top of that, its juicy 7.5  yield comes with a great valuation, making EPD a terrific tool for income-seeking investors.Enterprise Products Partners stands out as an exceptional player in the midstream industry.With a rich history, extensive infrastructure, and a rock-solid balance sheet, EPD's appeal is undeniable. Fueled by rising energy demand, export potential, and a mature business model, EPD boasts remarkable financials.Generating substantial free cash flow, maintaining a robust dividend growth history, and possessing a conservative debt profile, EPD promises a steady income stream and substantial growth potential.EPD's strategic position in the energy landscape and its juicy 7.5  yield make it a standout choice for income-oriented investors.The company's low-risk, high-reward business model, supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics, paints a promising picture for the future.As a seasoned player with a well-established moat, EPD is primed to deliver both consistent returns and a hedge against market uncertainties.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

Tighten Your Seatbelts,"Shifting supply-and-demand dynamics appear to be driving bond markets more than fundamentals, which makes for a bumpy ride.With our annual  outlook just around the corner, we ve recently been discussing some ofIn fixed income, we think a key theme will be one that most strategists did not have in their outlooks for 2023, but which was nonetheless prominent and could persist into 2024  the overwhelming importance of bond market supply and demand in setting prices and yields, which at times superseded the direction suggested by economic and credit fundamentals.We think it is worth singling this theme out. As we close in on the end of this historic tightening cycle, central bank policy is subsiding as a source of uncertainty, and the ebb andThrough the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. and global growth outlooks were becoming steadily more pessimistic. By the end of the year, for most economists and strategists the debate was not if, but when, the recessions would occur during 2023.What happened to credit spreadsFor the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index, they went from almost 590 basis points at the start of the fourth quarter of 2022 to as low as 430 basis points by March 2023. For the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Corporate Bond Index, they went from around 180 basis points to less than 130. For the ICE BofA Global Hybrid Corporate Index, they tightened from 340 to 240 basis points. The mini-banking crisis in March caused a spike, but spreads have drifted tighter again through the rest of the year.Was this because the U.S. economy unexpectedly continued to grow, even as China and much of Europe stagnated  Perhaps but that wouldn t explain why we saw the same journey in European high yield and emerging markets spreads.A much better explanation, in our view, is the dearth of new corporate bond issuance in the first half of the year. Throughout much of 2021 and 2022, corporate issuers financed aggressively relative to their needs, taking advantage of record-low rates. That meant many coffers were full by the close of 2022. Bond market inflows have been modest this year because many investors have been happy to sit in cash or money markets earning 5 . But with high yields now on offer, the inflows weren t negative and when that modest demand met almost non-existent supply, it tightened spreads.Right now, of course, attention is focused on the rates market rather than credit markets. Core government bond yields have burst out of their 2023 trading ranges, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield adding some 65 basis points in little over a month to trade higher than at any time since early 2007. What might be going on hereWell, certainly the U.S. Federal Reserve s steady drumbeat of higher rates for longer even though inflation has been declining is settling into the market psyche. It s difficult to lay the blame on changes to fundamental inflation expectations  The move in the nominal yield curve has been matched by a move in the real yields, leaving inflation expectations unchanged. Instead, meaningful changes in the supply-and-demand dynamic appear to be playing a large role here, as well.The August Treasury refunding saw a significant lift in coupon issuance, and the market has come to the realization that this is the beginning of a durable trend. While the Fed s shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening has been well-telegraphed and understood by market participants, the Treasury s growing fiscal deficit is surprising on the high side. Together, they currently amount to close to 10  of U.S. GDP, with quantitative tightening accounting for around 3 .Spending continues to rise, while revenues have dropped by 10  for the fiscal year-to-date relative to 2022, largely due to a heavy decline in capital gains tax receipts. The deficit is expected to be around  1.6 trillion this year, versus around  1 trillion last year. Current forecasts for 2024 are around  1.8 trillion, with rising interest expense continuing to contribute much of the lift. We think this means Treasury coupon issuance could roughly double from this year s level of just over  1 trillion to as much as  1.9 trillion in 2024 a massive supply shift.On the other side of the equation, in addition to the Fed going from large-scale buyer to seller, U.S. commercial banks, traditionally a major source of demand, are mostly absent because their existing bond holdings are both large and underwater, and because of heightened market and regulatory scrutiny following the mini-banking crisis earlier in the year.The offshore bid for U.S. bonds an important source of demand ever since the global financial crisis has also been all but eliminated as the rapid rise in U.S. short rates relative to those in many other markets has resulted in prohibitively high currency-hedging costs. Finally, active money managers  ourselves included  would usually have been keen to take advantage of such a dramatic rise in yields by adding portfolio duration, but holdings analysis and sentiment surveys suggest that, as a group, money managers have already spent much of their firepower.Does this mean the march to higher yields will continue unabated  Not necessarily. Three particularly large sources of demand loom on the horizon.The massive and ever-growing mountain of cash residing in money market funds and other short-term investments could start to move as soon as there is a whiff of change to monetary policy in the air. Likewise, as long-duration, high-grade corporate bond yields move into the 6 7  range, liability-driven pension fund investors may start to shift allocations toward them.Finally, while short- to intermediate-term correlations between Treasuries and risky assets have been consistently positive recently, that could change rapidly if risk aversion rises, creating a potentially strong bid for bonds.With such strong, shifting supply-and-demand forces waiting to exert themselves in Treasury and credit markets, investors would do well to be ready for sudden regime changes and volatile price action.We have waited a long time for value to return to fixed income markets. With nominal yields at levels we haven t seen in 16 years, combined with an attractive move to higher real yields, we are generally comfortable clipping a healthy coupon in today s market, even if the ride has become bumpier and is likely to stay that way.Tighten seatbelts and count the income.

"Global Medical: 7.7% Yielding Preferreds Are Expensive, A Look At Alternatives","Global Medical REIT Inc.  is a medical office building play that we have covered before. After two buy ratings, we moved to the sidelines in our last piece.There was really nothing strongly negative about theSource  GMRE's Q2-2023 was about in line but we saw the slow and steady impact from the interest rate hikes. Fixed charge coverage was steadily moving lower and we are likely to see the same trend in Q3-2023.Interest expenses are up substantially from Q2-2022 and funds from operations  FFO  and adjusted FFO are both falling under the pressure.It is fascinating that we are here despite a primarily fixed-rate regime for the REIT.The weighted maturity does still look small and that represents the biggest risk to the long term health of the company. The company is aware of this and is actively managing things before there are problems.SourcePortfolio level metrics look great, as they always have. We would not expect any deterioration here, outside of a very severe recession.GMRE has a soft lease maturity schedule for the remainder of 2023 and then we have over 14  coming up for renewal in 2024.Occupancy levels remain near 97  and this is the other area to monitor. While the two  office buildings and medical office buildings  are not identical, there are overlaps. It is not too uncommon to find doctors having clinics in general office space and also seeing general office space  upgraded  to accommodate doctors. With the plethora of office space that is begging for attention, this is a risk that investors should look out for. Keep in mind that doctors are not the class of tenants that will move to save a few dollars. Practice location and convenience are key. Most also have staffing shortages and moving to a new location might make that worse. But it is a longer term risk factor for this area. Even in the more complex area of laboratory spaces, which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  specializes in, we have seen . So while the asset class may be recession resistant, it is not going to defy the laws of supply and demand.Whichever way you look at it, GMRE.PR.A is of course safer than the common shares. After all, you have the large common equity buffer in front.But is this the best bang for your buck  Probably not. One issue we have with GMRE.PR.A is just how lopsided the setup is on this, thanks to the very high coupon of 7.5 . GMRE.PR.A trades right near par with a 7.7 . Now, that does not sound like a problem by itself, but you have the risk of a call, immediately in the next rate cut cycle. So you have minimal upside and yes, all the downside if interest rates go higher or if the gradual destruction of value in the company. We will illustrate our point further with two examples.In the realm of REITs, triple nets tend to be the safest. The parent company here Spirit Realty Capital  sports a BBB rating  GMRE does not have a credit rating . SRC has a . The weighted average lease maturity is over 10 years. On a credit quality SRC is definitely going to be miles and miles ahead of GMRE. But you get about the same yield from both preferred shares with SRC.PR.A giving you 7.48 . The big difference here is that SRC.PR.A trades at  20.06 offering you substantial upside to par in case of interest rate cuts.This is from EPR Properties  which . We will focus on this one, even though EPR has two other preferred share series. This one is a straight preferred  no convertible calculations  and offers a 7.91  yield currently. It too trades at a big discount to par and offers substantial upside in case of a rate cutting cycle.On a credit quality basis as well, we see EPR preferreds as somewhere between GMRE.PR.A and SRC.PR.A. So relative to GMRE.PR.A, you are getting higher credit quality and more upside if interest rates are cut.Common shares now offer a 9.4  yield and we think that will be maintained for the foreseeable future. Of course growth is going to be next to impossible as the AFFO payout ratio approaches 100  and the company can only issue equity below NAV. But the stock still has value and we think we can eek out 10-12  returns from here by opportunistically using covered calls. Our last executed covered calls are shown below and they reduced the volatility of our position substantially.The preferred shares seem remarkably expensive relative to what is available today. We would only be interested in GMRE.PR.A shares if they offer a 8.2  plus yield. targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety.

Market Is Set Up For A February 2020 Type Collapse,"Following the summer rally, the market has been on a gradual decline in recent weeks. Gains are showing signs of rapid unwinding after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated policymakers' support for  rates to tame inflation. TheThe latest Fed dot plot shows support for the Fed Funds rate to hit the 5.50  to 5.75  range by year-end, implying another 25 bps increase at either the upcoming November or December policy meeting. Rate cut expectations for 2024 have also tempered, with policymakers' latest projection implying a benchmark rate at 5.1  by the end of next year, which is about 50 bpsMeanwhile, the economy has withstood the most aggressive cycle of rate hikes in decades better than expected - both consumer spending and the labour market have been resilient, incentivizing an upward revision to the 2023 economic growth projection from 1  in June to , with the expected unemployment rate tweaked lower from 4.5  to 4.1 . Although data suggests a soft landing is possible, Chair Powell has denied such a scenario as the  and reiterated the Fed's stance to keep monetary policy in restrictive territory for longer.The remarks have taken the long-end Treasury yield above a  in recent weeks, while equity performance has also been . Although bonds have been pricing in the new normal of restrictive monetary policy for a while now, equity valuations appear to only now be catching up. We see several risks that are rapidly brewing into reality, which could suggest a sustained downtrend in the S P  and Nasdaq  valuations from current levels.Inflation has shown signs of  over the summer, but risks of a reacceleration are still running high. This is corroborated by August figures that came in , with both core and headline inflation running hot on the resurgence of energy costs and stubbornly high shelter costs.Specifically, oil prices have  climbed nearly  25 from their summer lows , representing  over the past quarter and trading comfortably above the  90 range. While oil prices have largely been driven by weak sentiment during the first half of the year, primarily influenced by fears of weakening demand due to China's deteriorating economy which has overshadowed OPEC  supply curbs, the reality of tightening supplies is settling in. And this is reflected in the recent surge in gasoline prices, which contributed to more than half of August's monthly price increase. Meanwhile, the outlook on food prices also remains mixed, as the combination of rising energy and labour costs alongside shortages in  and  due to extreme weather remain headwinds. Taken together, both core and non-core prices continue to face prominent risks of resurgence, underscoring August's figures may be a warning sign.With inflation still running hot, the higher for longer narrative is likely to settle in as the new normal. We fear that this setup may be ushering in the most adverse implication possible - the Fed may stop pursuing a Goldilocks soft landing scenario and opt for a forced correction of the economy, as the situation becomes increasingly politically driven. And Chair Powell's recent rejection of the economic soft landing as a baseline scenario is corroborative of this risk. The higher for longer rate environment has pushed Treasury yields toward an all-time high.  Treasury yields have rapidly surged beyond the 4.6  range, while the  is approaching 4.7 . Meanwhile, the rate-sensitive  yield has experienced a relatively gradual uptrend, reaching about 5.1 .At these levels, the government faces acute financial pressure to funding operations. For context, nearly a third of total U.S. government debt outstanding is set to hit maturity within the next 12 months, with more than a half set to mature over the next three years.This underscores the massive refinancing needed over the foreseeable future, and more importantly, the government's exposure to impact from an adverse rate environment. The  on related debt has already surged from 1.5  from when it was last financed, to now 3.0 . And the doubling rate is poised to climb further in tandem with rising interest rates, underscoring quarterly interest expense payments beyond the current all-time high of  in no time.The ever-increasing federal debt burden, coupled with rising debt service costs implies the potential for tax increases, which could adversely impact the economy further as still-hot inflation and tightening financial conditions run simultaneously in the background. More importantly, the combination will be adverse to the Biden administration's outlook on extending its term heading into the 2024 re-election. To prevent this unfavourable mix, Chair Powell and Co. may need to tighten credit conditions further to manually orchestrate the slowdown needed to put the economy into correction, putting conditions for a soft landing further out of reach.Adding pressure to this dire set-up is the mechanics of leveraged rate funds that have been increasing their short wagers on Treasury leading up to the September FOMC meeting. The net-short positions on Treasuries futures held by leveraged funds reached their  in more than a decade in August, incentivized by persistent economic challenges spanning  inflation, tight labour market and the hawkish Fed . The  on cash Treasury and futures prices may have also incentivized the build-up of bearish bets. However, the recent surge in yields could potentially lead to an unwind of this net-short positioning, and pressure bonds' performance further by creating shock waves that will ripple throughout the market. The unpredictably elevated nature of long-end Treasury yields is corroborated by the  of the five- and 30-year Treasury yield curve last week - a year after the curve's inversion reached its  in more than a decade.In addition to persistent inflation and tightening financial conditions, the overvalued nature of equity valuations at current levels is what greenlights the impending risk of a broader market crash. Prior to the onset of the late September market slump, the S P 500 had been trading at a record high of almost 30x forward earnings, representing a rich valuation premium to 10-year average of about 23x. Much of this uptrend had been buoyed by the market's frenzy for AI, with the Magnificent Seven stocks - namely, Apple , Amazon , Google    , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia  and Tesla  - trading at an average forward P E of more than 40x and accounting for about  of the S P 500 index's performance. But the S P 500, ex-Magnificent Seven, is not cheap either - it currently trades at about 24x estimated earnings, and still exceeds the 10-year average of about 21x on the normalized gauge. The resurgence of tech valuations is corroborated by the Nasdaq 100's lofty premium built-up this year - the tech-heavy index is currently trading at  estimated earnings, far exceeding its historical average of about .Although long-end Treasury yields have long been pushing new highs since the onset of the latest rate hike cycle, which have been adverse to growth valuations underpinned by cash flows further out in the future, the market's rally this year has largely defied these challenges most prominently observed during 2022. Markets had likely been pricing in expectations for an eventual normalization in the rate environment during the first half of the year, as improving inflationary pressures harbinger the impending unwinding of monetary policy tightening. This is supported by observations of historically low equity risk premium priced into market valuations.Recall that the ERP measures the difference between returns on equities versus the risk-free rate of return on Treasury. The yield on short-end Treasury bills had consistently exceeded the average return on equity as measured by the inverse of the S P 500 P E ratio during the first half of the year - a first since 2000 - likely on the back of expectations for increased visibility on an eventual trajectory back towards monetary policy easing. Even with the recent slump in stock valuations, the  on three-month T-bills still exceeds the average 4.2  return on equities computed on the inverse of S P 500 ex-Magnificent Seven P E ratio of about 24x, despite the latter's higher risk exposure.This suggests that the market's latest declines following the Fed's reaffirmation on a higher for longer rate reality is a reflection of swift adjustments to the ERP. While valuations have not budged in the face of continued rate hikes during the first half of 2023, they might very well start to as the potential of a soft landing and eventual policy easing are pushed back until further notice. Recall the CAPM model, which dictates the cost of equity based on both the stock and broader market's risk profile. The cost of equity is computed as the risk-free rate plus the equity beta multiplied by the ERP.The cost of equity is typically more sensitive to changes in the ERP than the risk-free rate itself. As markets are likely to upwardly adjust the ERP in response to the new normal of higher for longer interest rates, the discount factor on future cash flows accordingly increases, risking a further decline in equity valuations from current levels.Currently lofty market valuations also face brewing weakness among financial names. While market sentiment has normalized since the slew of regional bank failures in March, it does not materially change the reality that an elevated rate environment does not bode well for the financial sector. Higher rates essentially mean higher borrowing costs, and narrowing net interest margins for the banks. Customers will continue to be incentivized to rotate their deposits into higher-yielding products and accounts, impacting the availability of low-cost funding for banks to service its lending operations and, inadvertently, pressuring net interest income. Meanwhile, borrowing will likely remain weak in the face of an elevated rate environment as home buyers and investors stay risk-averse, which will hamper banks' earnings further.While both regulators and banks have  capital buffer requirements to better  cope with a severe economic shock , especially following the slew of bank failures earlier this year, the sector's exposure to weakness persists amid the elevated rate environment. As Treasury yields continue to rise, the value of long-term notes held by banks diminishes. While much of these losses stay unreported on P L, as banks stash the holdings away as  available for sale securities  with their unrealized gains   losses flowing through AOCI, the diminishing value of bond assets affects banks' level of equity on the balance sheet. The average capital requirement - or CET1 ratio - for large banks currently , which implies that for every  10 the bank lends, it must have at least  0.895 of capital in reserve. This also indicates that banks typically operate at about 10x leverage, which exposes them to risks of a significant equity value correction in the event of material depreciation to asset value - a case proven in the failures of , , , and .Taken together, the window of weakness on equities is rapidly expanding at current levels. The durability of current valuation premiums are becoming increasingly at risk, given weakness in underlying fundamentals amid the elevated rate environment.In addition to persistent inflation, higher for longer interest rates, and lofty equity valuations, there is also a broadening portfolio of other moving pieces indicative of further market weakness to come The U.S. government has narrowly dodged a shutdown this weekend with the agreement on a  for ongoing negotiations regarding long-term funding. But this does not eradicate the impending risk of a potential no-deal, which could bring on adverse implications for equity valuations.The market has historically rallied upon the end of a government shutdown averted shutdown. This was also the case earlier this year, when the government had averted a shutdown  and potential financial crisis  after an agreement to  the U.S. debt ceiling. However, the increasing frequency of government shutdown risks  two times this year  amidst an inflationary environment and tightening financial conditions is unprecedented. This is in line with the market's modest response to the latest risk of a government shutdown - much of the recent market downside realized were likely attributable to the reality of a higher interest rate environment settling in, which means that the averted shutdown is unlikely to be a  big source of upside  in the near-term.But the mire of political drama is likely to further dampen confidence in the U.S. government's ability to navigate the economy back to health. Current models estimate a  headwind to annualized GDP growth for each week of government shutdown that could potentially take place in the fourth quarter if the 45-day impasse ends with no deal. A further extension could also  the Fed's efforts to quell inflation , risking a reversal of recent progress made. The , which measures stock market volatility expectations, also remains dampened at sub-20 levels considering the current market risk profile. Under the , which divides the current VIX by 16 to gauge the implied stock market movement, current options pricing suggests a  1  daily movement in the S P 500. We do not think this has sufficiently de-risked for impending market risks.Instead, the modest VIX is likely underpriced for the current market risk profile set-up due to the supply and demand mechanics in options markets, influenced primarily by structured product funds. Specifically, options selling for passive income at some of these funds may be weighing on the VIX, resulting in the gauge's inadequate reflection of pent-up stock market volatility, which risks becoming an overlooked factor.Another implied risk to consider is the historical link between month-end options expiry  mopex  that happens on the third Friday of each month, and an equity market collapse. The onset of the equity market collapse observed in February 2020 had coincided with mopex on February 21. This eerily resembles the latest stock slump, which began the third Friday of September, in line with the latest mopex. The narrative on weakening consumption amid inflationary pressures and an elevated borrowing cost environment has been brewing for more than a year. Yet corporate earnings have largely stayed resilient, leading markets to contemplate if relevant risks have already been priced into current market valuations.The resilient labour market amid the latest cycle of monetary policy tightening has been a primary counteractive force to the adverse combination of dwindling pandemic-era savings and persistent inflation. But this last lever is likely going to give soon. Credit card delinquencies are  pre-pandemic levels, while the resumption of  this month is likely to weigh on household budgets further. Specifically, cutting out room in budgets for student loan repayments is expected to displace  in annual discretionary spending and impact GDP growth by 0.1  this year and 0.3  next year.Unfortunately, the added burden on consumer budgets also coincides with the timeline of which the lagging monetary policy effect on labour markets is due to materialize. Different parts of the economy have different sensitivities to monetary policy tightening. And for the labour markets, which has been resilient through it all so far, typically start to feel the impact of monetary tightening at the 18- to 24-month mark. That means the  full force  of the 0  to 5.5  rate hikes implemented since March 2022 are about to be felt by the labour market from here on out, potentially eradicating a key source of strength that has been keeping the economy afloat so far. With at least one more rate hike in the books, the impact of weakening consumer spending might finally be starting to hit the underlying fundamentals critical to supporting the market's lofty valuation premiums at current levels.While 2023 has largely defied the market's pessimism and turned out to be a good year for equities so far, vulnerabilities to a violent downturn remain close. The combination of Fed hawkishness, political motives, weakening economic fundamentals and a potential earnings recession could risk sending new shock waves to the broader markets, putting the case for a soft landing further out of reach. The set-up is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the durability of equity valuation premiums at current levels, driving up risks that the latest uptrend might be finally running out of steam.Thank you for reading my analysis.

"CVR Partners: 33% Dividend Yield, Breakout Appears Imminent","CVR Partners, LP  is a company that focuses on creating nitrogen-based fertilizers such as ammonia that is currently paying a 20 percent dividend yield. I know what you might be thinking. A company that pays over a 20 percent dividendBut before you write off CVR Energy due to its hefty dividend, you might want to dig deeper to see if this 20  percent dividend is too good to be true.Before we do that, let's examine a brief . The story began in 1893 with a farmer from Southwest Missouri named Howard Cowden. As a farmer, he began a cooperative to help farmers gain pricing power. Fast forward, andThen, in 1944, CCA bought an oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas. The Coffeyville refinery was originally built and owned by the National Refining Company  NRC , which traced its roots back to 1882 when J.I. Lamprecht from Cleveland built the refinery for kerosene.In 1966, CCA rebranded itself to Farmland Industries and its management began to try to grow the company aggressively. On May 31, 2002, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which was the largest agricultural coop bankruptcy in American history. One reason it went bankrupt was that it was in the middle of constructing a fertilizer plant in Coffeyville, Kansas, next to its petroleum refinery. This bankruptcy was thanks to the plant experiencing difficulty operating correctly after its launch in 2000.Having a fertilizer plant next to a refinery was supposed to make sense on paper as each ton of ammonia produced would require 1.18 tons of petroleum coke, and the Coffeyville refinery was able to produce over half the 500,000 short tons of coke the new nitrogen plant would need. This should have created strong synergies between the refinery and the fertilizer plant, but it was not operating well enough for the company to avoid bankruptcy.This fertilizer plant, which would one day become a keystone asset of CVR Partners, had cost Farmland  300 million to build but its interest in the plant was sold in March 2004 to a company owned by Pegasus Capital Advisors, a Connecticut-based private equity fund for just  11 million.Pegasus Capital Advisors sold the Coffeyville refinery and fertilizer plant just a year later on July 12, 2005, to Coffeyville Acquisitions, LLC, which was a partnership between Goldman Sachs   private equity arm, and the funds of Kelso Partners, a major private equity player founded in 1971.In April 2011, Coffeyville Acquisitions, LLC was ready to take the company public in the midst of a strong fertilizer market that had rebounded from the 2009 recession. Since April 2011, CVR Partners has operated as a publicly traded MLP.As described above, CVR Partners' main asset is its Coffeyville, Kansas facility. And in addition to that is its East Dubuque, Illinois facility. The yellow lines on the map below indicate rail lines that allow these two plants to transport their product to most states west of the Mississippi. Most important is the fact that these two plants operate in the corn belt which is where most of the demand for nitrogen fertilizer comes from.CVR Partners focuses primarily on nitrogen-based fertilizers such as ammonia. Here, we can see that broadly speaking, the United States is the  of nitrogen fertilizers behind China and India. has remained very steady over the past decade and with the world's population continuing to grow in many pockets of the world, demand should only increase. The chart below demonstrates how nitrogen fertilizer demand has jumped since 2020 and 2021.The following three slides are provided courtesy of .Here we see that North America's population is projected to remain steady for the next decade or so while populations in developing regions such as Asia and Africa are projected to explode higher. I would take projections like these with a grain of salt and expect them to fall short of the actual population. Nonetheless, these population booms in Africa and Asia won't have a direct impact on North American food demand but with the world being more global, they will unquestionably have an indirect impact.This following chart maps out the arable land person and demonstrates two things. If you want to own land, then you better buy some. Perhaps that is a better investment than shares in a fertilizer company. However, more related to this article and CVR Partners, LP is that in order to produce greater amounts of food for a growing population, larger quantities of fertilizer will be needed to create higher yields.According to the IMARC Group, global fertilizer demand is going to grow almost 4  compounded annually through 2027. And so there shouldn't be a drop-off in demand for fertilizer in the foreseeable future.Through 2022, the company continued to see a strong environment for their business. Sales volumes are not necessarily increasing, however, their margins are in the form of higher prices for their product. We can see this in the dramatic increase in Ammonia pricing compared to a more modest price increase in their inputs, Natural Gas and Petroleum Coke.Corn Stocks have declined in the past couple years which indicates that it is likely that more farm acres are going to be planted to corn in the coming years. As I have already pointed out, more corn acres being planted means greater demand for CVR's products.As the slide below says, 2021 demonstrated an inflection point in their business where farmers' economics improved, which resulted in higher demand for their product. Management sees this trend continuing into the immediate future.The company has maintained a fairly consistent balance sheet ratio. The business circumstances of 2020 and 2021 caused the company to have its debt-to-asset ratio increase but since then, it has begun to bring that ratio back down.The company operates as an MLP and so most MLPs have balance sheets that have higher ratios of leverage than other companies. For example, Magellan Midstream Partners which I just wrote about their , has a debt-to-asset ratio of over 75 percent.Here is the history of the company's dividend yield. It has maintained a flexible dividend policy as the profitability of the company fluctuated in more recent years. The question regarding CVR Partners LP is will the demand for CVR's end product remain strong and will the inputs required to produce their product remain low. In other words, will this spread remain favorable for the company  In 2022, we can see that based on the dividend paid, the spread has remained favorable. And thus far in 2023, the dividend has remained intact.The company reported solid results for the . This statement from the CEO Mark Pytosh summarizes the quarter.Despite a decrease in the price of their product year-over-year, their financial results remained strong and the company was able to pay a  4.14 per share dividend for the quarter. They were also able to increase production and sales volume thanks to great  operating reliability.  How did the operating results as well as the dividend remain this strong when prices for their product were decreasingThis was because natural gas prices, one of their input costs, decreased from  8 per Mbtu down to just over  2 per Mbtu. See the chart below.CVR Partners LP can be very tempting due to its very attractive dividend yield. But before we decide to chase the dividend, what are the charts telling us  Thankfully for bullish investors, the chart is also looking very bullish at the moment. The chart is in the process of completing what appears to be a bullish flag pattern. Traditionally, if this is a bull flag pattern, once the pattern has been completed, the price should continue climbing about the length of the  flagpole  on the flag. This isn't an exact science but rather just a rule of thumb.And if the dividend remains intact over the next few years, then there isn't any reason why CVR Partners couldn't double in price to adjust for the strong dividend. Although nobody can see the future, my expectation is that the market will be forced to realize the value of CVR Partners and that the share price will grow so that the dividend yield is more in line with other traditional MLP yields. I see the scenario where dividend yields decrease due to profitability decreasing as the more unlikely scenario.I believe the biggest risk that CVR Partners faces is twofold. Will there be another event like the pandemic that crashes share prices  Very unlikely in the near future. And second, will the supply of materials that goes into making ammonia and other nitrogen-based fertilizers see price increases  This is only a bad thing if there isn't also a comparable price increase in CVR's end product. These prices don't always move in lock-step but if demand for energy increases, it is also probable that food prices will increase as well.If MLP equity investing is a strategy that you like, then there may not be a more attractive MLP worth investing in at this moment. I think the broader market could experience some weakness going into early or mid-October which may be shortly followed with a breakout in CVR Partners from its technical bull-flag pattern.Based on projections from different organizations, the foundation for global and national demand for fertilizer is likely to increase, keeping demand for CVR Partners' products high. Should CVR Partners experience a technical breakout in price, I would watch closely for what charts continue to do and would keep a close eye on global supply and demand dynamics as well as prices for the company's input costs.

TLT Could Be A Winner Even Without A Soft Landing,"Stock and bond returns have dramatically separated over the last 18 months. While the bond market has priced in an  overheating  economy with high short-term growth with lower long-term growth  i.e., inverted 2s 10s yieldI think in the long run this dislocation is unsustainable and willTwo of my core tenants for initiating any investment  which I outlined in my original article  are A  don't fight the global liquidity cycle and B  make trades congruent with the economic outlook for the next 18 months. Funny enough, this article was written almost exactly 1 year ago - over that time, the S P 500 is up  13  and TLT is down by  9.5   total return . Unfortunately, the market over that time has behaved in a predictably irrational pattern, pricing in a best-case scenario soft landing for stocks while pricing in sustained long-term inflation for bonds. On a probabilistic list of outcomes, this would be one of the least likely outcomes and the Fed itself has forecast a .The chart above from the Felder Report shows the divergence between fed liquidity and market performance with the red dashed line at the end estimating liquidity dynamics over the next several months due to TGA balance needing to be replenished and fed tightening continuing at its scripted rate. This chart by itself makes me extremely wary of risk assets and should be at the center of every investor's mind. As liquidity tightens - cash is king and investments in risk assets should be heavily scrutinized. Combine this with tightening lending standards at the commercial banks and a restrictive credit cycle - the liquidity environment is not favorable.  Obviously, you could argue this is bad for treasuries too, I discuss this in the risks section .Bloomberg economists are predicting negative real GDP growth over the next twelve months - obviously, economists' projections  like Fed projections  should be taken with a grain of salt but combined with falling leading indicators should also weigh heavily on investors' minds as they consider the economic outlook for the next several months. As the credit cycle continues to roll over, the highly levered US economy will struggle to sustain positive output growth - ignore the credit cycle at your own peril.The stock market has not been as healthy as the large rally over the past 12 months would suggest. Gains have been highly concentrated among the  Magnificent 7  tech stocks, particularly for the NASDAQ and the impact can been seen in the divergence in performance between the equal-weighted indices vs. the standard index. I'm not sure anyone could convince me that 60x P FCF is a fair price to pay for these stocks no matter how high the quality and growth. If these companies were to produce 60x the cash flow they currently produce, their output would rival many countries. It's unreasonable to assume that companies this big will continue to grow at rapid rates  if not purely for anti-trust concerns . If valuations on these stocks mean-revert this would produce tremendous pressure on the entire stock market given the concentration of these stocks in major indexes.A chart I saw that really stood out to me as a strong late-cycle indicator is the SPX EPS   NIPA Profits going back to 1970. NIPA profits represent  income from current production  and are reported to the BEA for economic analysis. These profits can be thought of as  real  or  current  output vs. accounting EPS earnings which can be influenced over the short term by management teams. The idea is that in periods of declining economic activity but before the bottom falls out, management teams pull forward profits to the current period to bolster flailing earnings. However, this can only go on so long before the rubber meets the road and economic reality sets in causing accounting profits to mean revert  and often flip to a negative ratio with NIPA profits during recession. This indicator is extremely reliable in predicting recessions as you can see from the chart above and we are now at levels only seen previously 3 times since 1970. Even if there is not a recession, simple mean reversion of this ratio will put pressure on EPS across the board and should promote a more fearful   cautious environment in the stock market which should be beneficial for treasury securities.Another chart which I think is significant in assessing the current state of the cycle is the consumer excess savings chart above from JPM. The bank estimates that there are only  0.2T of excess savings left from COVID-era stimulus. While total savings are still at relatively normal levels, these savings are concentrated in the top 10  of wealthiest individuals in the US. As the bulk of Americans run out of excess savings, the demand impulse should continue to decrease.  The labor market has been strong over the past 18 months, but job openings have slowed and payroll gains have been in a consistent downtrend, exposing cracks in the labor market.Auto and credit card delinquencies have , again highlighting some weakness in the consumer balance sheet.Finally, I'll end with some quotes from the latest Dallas Fed manufacturing survey which I believe are particularly harrowing, as the narrative has shifted away from complaints about input costs and labor and towards softening consumer demand. If this softening demand materializes in a broad scale across the economy then the current economic expansion will end quickly as lately it's almost entirely been driven by consumption. TLT  - has underperformed dramatically since the Fed began hiking rates last April. Looking at the total return performance table, the recent underperformance has been so sharp that it's dragged the 5-year performance negative. This is pretty astounding when you think about it - what is essentially the longest duration  risk-free rate  has a negative total return over the last five years, demonstrating that no asset is truly risk-free  keep in mind this is a nominal return not an inflation-adjusted return .The long-term Treasury bond yield chart is one of the most important charts in all of finance - it's indicative of a number of macro trends which define the era we live in. Aging workforce, decline in productivity and labor force participation, sluggish growth, lack of innovation and perhaps most importantly uniformly dovish monetary policy which has encouraged low rates for the last 40 years. Obviously, there have been intermittent periods of rising rates but overall these brief periods barely stand out on this chart apart from the current cycle which broke one of the long-term downward channels  red lines on the chart . I would consider this a capitulation event and this early in the cycle, this is a gift from the market gods. An opportunity for a savvy and sober-minded investor who understands that the world is not ending to reinvest in one of the best performing asset classes of the past 2 generations. Opportunities like this do not appear often and what makes this even more compelling is the asymmetry of the trade.Buy when there is blood in the streets  - the classic value mantra applies here as the bond market has become overly pessimistic both on inflation and growth outlook. As I've discussed above, inflation is likely to be stickier than the Fed and most market participants are hoping but I also believe that the economy is in its most overheated state currently and will likely begin to slow in the coming months which will send rates lower. However, even if I'm wrong on my economic outlook  and trades should never be made on economic outlook alone -  and the economy does obtain a soft landing with cooling inflation, this will also result in lower rates  unless of course the economy emerges  than before and rate are permanently higher to compensate but that outcome is also unlikely given the demographic and long-term macro dynamics at play in the US economy .Furthermore, I like how the 30-year has been in a relentless march upwards despite cooling inflation, a FED who appears to be tapped out on interest rate hikes  or at least close to it , and some early signs of an economic slowdown. The bond market is so fearful that it refuses to allow for any optimism and despite the 30-yr being mostly flat for the year it has made a 50 BPS surge over the past 3 months while the stock market has been mostly flat. This divergence in return will almost certainly mean revert - risk premiums have been  over time and a large, sustained divergence in stock and bond performance is unlikely, perhaps impossible.The main risk to this trade, particularly in the short term in my opinion is the imbalance in supply and demand in the treasury market. The TGA remains relatively depleted and the US Treasury estimates that issuances will increase substantially heading into the end of the year. This fear of supply-demand imbalance has fueled the treasury selloff for the last few months.It's a little hard to predict quarterly changes in treasury issuance. Ultimately, the CBO projects the deficit to increase over the coming 10 years as social security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending growth outpaces growth in tax receipts. In general, this will put pressure on the treasury market in the absence of QE to soak up the excess supply. A  I think most of this fear is priced in and B  I highly doubt the Fed will allow the treasury market to implode given the implications for financing the US government and on the broader economy. While the Fed is not mandated to stabilize the treasury market, look at their actions since the GFC - they've been mostly committed to buying treasuries over this time period and I imagine they will return to form as quickly as possible. The US economy cannot afford massively higher rates on such a large debt balance and I feel comfortable betting on the rates mean reverting closer to pre-COVID levels. Obviously, no trade is truly risk free and if rates stay higher for longer, it will limit the upside of this trade. However, even in that case you can lock in an attractive yield at current rates which limits the downside.In conclusion, the treasury bond market has deviated substantially in performance from the stock market over the past 18 months. Historically, these deviations tend to mean revert and given the long-term trend towards lower rates since the 70s, I believe rates will continue to trend lower  even if they don't get back to the pre-covid lows . Buying TLT is asymmetric due to the high yield currently and worst case, can clip a strong coupon if rates stay at current levels.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Navios Maritime Partners: Buy For Strong Fundamentals And Potential Upside,"Navios Maritime Partners  deals in owning and operating tanker vessels and dry cargo. It provides shipping services mainly in Asia, Europe, and America. The company has recently reported its strong quarterly results and I believe it can sustain thisNMM is a global company that owns and operates tanker vessels and dry cargo. The majority of the company's revenue is earned by charging customers for the use of its vessels to transport their dry, liquid, and containerized goods. These seaborne shipping services are offered under long-term charters. Its business is geographically diversified in  and each of the geographic regions contributes 63.40 , 22.90 , and 13.65 , respectively to the company's total revenue. The company's portfolio consists of 175 vessels, diversifiedThe company has experienced a slight decrease in revenue in the period of pandemic as its revenue has decreased 5.18  YoY in FY2019 compared to FY2018. The pandemic negatively affected the seaborne trade activities. However, since FY2021 the company has experienced higher tanker rates than its long-term averages because of solid supply and demand fundamentals, which is also reflected in its financial performance of FY2021. The company has reported revenue of  713.18 million in FY2021, which is 214.5  growth compared to  226.77 million in FY2020. It has managed to sustain this solid growth in FY2022 as well and reported  1.21 billion which is 69.7  YoY growth.The seaborne trade activities were impacted after the pandemic, and later it experienced a hurdle to rebound the growth as a result of inflationary pressures and geopolitical issues. However, the scenarios are gradually changing in 2023. Though the growth has not surpassed the pre-pandemic levels, it is still steady. The tanker business highly depends on the global oil demand. Economic growth is said to drive the oil demand, as they are . According to a recent projection by the IMF, world GDP can rise by  and 3  in 2024. The oil demand is also anticipated to grow as marine trade activities for one of the major dry commodities such as  is estimated to grow by 2  in China and 3  in Europe. All these positive growth factors have created opportunities for the participants. Identifying these opportunities, the company has planned and completed some acquisitions of vessels to expand its capabilities. It has taken delivery of three newbuilding Capesize vessels. Recently, in August it also agreed to acquire one Kamsarmax vessel for  28.0 million, which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter. In addition, the company has also agreed to execute the acquisition of two newbuilding Japanese MR2 product tanker vessels. These vessels are expected to be delivered between 2026 to 2027. I believe this expansion can significantly increase the revenue of NMM as it helps the company in the accommodation of larger cargo volumes and facilitates it to capture the growing demand by creating capacity for additional shipping contracts. As per my analysis, this growth might be sustained for a longer period as a result of a rise in energy trade and population growth, which can boost trades of essential commodities.The company recently reported its quarterly results. It reported revenue of  346.93 million, up 23.61  compared to  280.66 million in Q2FY22. This growth was mainly fueled by to expansion of the fleet and a marginal increase in the Time Charter Equivalent  TCE  rate. The company has managed to beat the market's revenue expectations by  28.94 million, or 9.1 . Net income dropped by 4.95  YoY from  118.16 million to  112.30 million. The decrease in net income was driven by a rise in time charter, voyage expenses, and rise in debt. The decreased net income resulted in an EPS of  3.65. However, the company has managed to surpass the market's EPS consensus by  0.77 or 26.7 . NMM reported  270.05 million in liquidity and adjusted EBITDA stood at  201.6 million.The firm managed to perform well despite the macroeconomic pressures, which reflects its resiliency. I believe the company can sustain this growth in the future as the  confirmed that supply   demand fundamentals are intact, and the company is continuously focused on expanding its capabilities which can help it to capitalize on the growing opportunities. According to Seeking Alpha, the company's revenue might be  1.30 billion, which is 7.44  YoY growth. After considering the rising seaborne trade activities and supply   demand fundamentals, I think Seeking Alpha's revenue estimate is accurate. The company's 3-year average net income margin is 30 . I believe NMM can maintain the net income margin of 30  in the coming period as the management has confirmed that the supply   demand fundamentals are still intact. Therefore, I am estimating a net income margin of 30  for FY2023, which gives an EPS of  12.67.The company's debt has increased significantly in the last few years. Its long-term debt was  763.4 in Jun 2023 which is 234  growth compared to Dec 2020. NMM's 36  debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.6  while the other 64  has a floating interest rate of 7.8 . The company's large part of the company's debt is subject to changes in market interest rates. Currently, the interest rates are rising in the market to counter the rising inflation. Therefore, if the interest rates continue to rise in the coming period, it can significantly affect the company's net income margins.China is one of the prominent markets for the company, as it imports large quantities of raw materials from other countries and exports significant amounts of semifinished and finished goods. For instance, in 2022, China imported iron ore of 1093 billion tons which represented approximately 74  of the international marine iron ore trade. It also contributed 19  to the global marine coal movements in 2022. If the levels of imports and exports decrease due to changes in the country's economic policies, it can negatively impact the company's charter business and reduce its profit margins.The oil demand is highly interlinked with global GDP growth. The world GDP and oil demand are estimated to grow decently in 2023 which can create significant opportunities for the shipping industry. I believe the company's plans to expand its vessels through acquisitions can accelerate its growth by helping it serve a large number of customers and capture the growing demand in the market.After considering all the above factors and revenue   net income margin estimates, I am estimating EPS of  12.67 for FY2023, which gives the forward P E ratio of 1.68x. The company's forward P E ratio of 1.68x is 90.3  lower compared to the . NMM's primary competitors are  ,  ,  , and   as all of them offer marine transportation and have market capital in the same range.The company's forward P E ratio of 1.68x is 76.4  lower compared to the industry average P E ratio of 7.11x. The comparison of forward P E ratio of NMM with industry average and sector median P E ratio indicates the company is significantly undervalued.I believe the company might grow in the coming quarters as a result of positive demand in the industry and intact supply   demand fundamentals which can help it to trade at industry average P E ratio as according to mean reversion theory P E ratio has tendency to trend back to average P E ratio. Therefore, I estimate the company might trade at an industry average P E ratio of 7.11x in the coming period, giving the target price of  90.08, which is a 324  upside compared to the current share price of  21.23.NMM has performed solidly in the second quarter despite macroeconomic pressures. The industry has various supportive growth factors which can help demand to remain stable for a longer period, and NMM's current expansions of its vessels can help it cater to growing demand. However, it is exposed to risk of fluctuations in imports and exports of China and rising interest rates, which can contract its profit margins. The stock is undervalued, and we can expect significant growth from the current price levels as a result of rising sector-specific global opportunities and its expansion of vessels. Considering all the above factors, I assign a buy rating to NMM.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

A Trillion-Dollar Black Swan Right Under Our Nose,"Since bottoming back in October, markets have rallied to the surprise of many investors. After a few red days in a row, the bears are back out from hibernation, and even the famous Michael Burry is openly While subscribing to theories of imminent collapse has been historically a losing trade, I'd like to propose a theory for just that today.I see a lot of similarities between stocks today and stocks in 1987, a year that featured both a 40  rally and a 35  collapse  Black Monday .We've already seen the 35  rally, is a drawdown coming next  Some very specific features sparked the massive sell-off in October 1987, and some of these are certainly present today.Specifically, 0DTE options are now a trillion-dollar market, which could send stocks into a doom spiral.What1987 was definitely a  fun year  for investors. After a good year of sideways movement, US stocks really began to take off. From January to September, the S P 500 rallied close to 40 .Great start to the year, but spirits would soon be crushed. After selling off close to 10  from its highs, the stock market literally collapsed on Monday, October 19, 1987. The S P would end up falling back towards 200 points, interestingly, finding support at the 200-week MA.The worldwide losses are estimated to have been close to  1.7 trillion, and this sell-off. By November of that same year, the market would bottom and never look back.Now, let's look at some other variables to put this crash into context, and try to understand what was going on at the timeIn the chart above, we can see the SPX, the Dollar Index  in purple, inflation in yellow, the unemployment rate in orange, and the Fed funds rate in blue.A couple of notable things to point out. Firstly, employment is doing well. This sell-off had nothing to do with a recession, as we saw the market collapse while unemployment levels were decreasing.Secondly, inflation, though volatile and a bit higher than what we were used to before COVID, was, for the most part, under control.Overvaluations in the stock market are an easy answer. Stocks had run nearly 40  and gotten ahead of themselves  that much seems obvious.However, a lot of economists point towards monetary factors to explain this collapse. So let's focus now on the DXY, the Plaza Accord, and the Louvre Accord.As we can see, the dollar index had been weakening since 1985. This might well have contributed to the rally and was no accident. Through the Plaza Accord, the major economies of the world agreed to depreciate the dollar, which had reached very high levels following the Volcker Fed administration.This all changed, however, after the Louvre accord, which aimed to stabilize the value of the dollar. However, notice that the dollar did not immediately stabilize and, in fact, kept grinding down.There are a couple of things to take away from this. Firstly, we can see that the Fed started raising rates following the Louvre accord, which could be described as bad for stocks. What might have even been a bigger contributor to the 1987 sell-off, though, is the fact that the dollar failed to stabilize as quickly as some expected.This policy failure increased uncertainty in the market and also the likelihood of further monetary tightening down the road, which we did indeed see.While it is hard, and some might even say impossible, to pinpoint the exact reasons that triggered the market sell-off, there seems to be at least some consensus on what made things worse.In short, portfolio insurance and programmatic trading played a big role.Portfolio Insurance was developed in 1976 and became very popular leading up to the 1987 crash. The idea behind this was quite simple, and it was a matter of using stop-loss orders in order to prevent huge losses. Remember, this was over 30 years ago, and it was quite a novel concept at the time.What was not foreseen, though, was how these automatized  portfolio insurance  could create a self-fulfilling feedback loop of doom.Source  Too many sellers and not enough buyers. Pretty straightforward supply and demand dynamics playing out right in front of our eyes.The big question is, could this happen today  Let's compare the variables we looked at in 1987 with what we have todayThough not quite as strong as in 1987, we've had a pretty good start to the year, with the S P up over 20  since January.This has been accompanied by a controlled cooling of inflation and also a depreciating dollar. Unemployment is near historic lows, and we have just witnessed one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in history.Conditions are not exactly the same, but there are some similarities. Yes, stocks, especially the Nasdaq  have run a lot this year, and we could make an argument that a lot of them are overvalued.The US economy, like in 1987, seems strong, but this doesn't mean we can't sell off. In fact, it might be the complacency with this seemingly strong economy that could lull investors into a false sense of security.With that said, more tightening seems unlikely, as we should be nearing a pause. However, this could change if inflation remains sticky, an argument that I've made before.Lastly, in terms of the US dollar, it's hard to know where we are going to land. Exchange rates aren't thought of like they were back in the 1980s, and there is a lot less policy targeting it, but I do see a resemblance between today and 1987. There's certainly a lot of uncertainty.A lot of currencies have come under pressure in the last few months. The Yen has been making headlines as the BoJ tries to scrap its YCC policy. The Chinese Yuan has hit a  after the PBOC's rate cut and, of course, the British Pound had a rough start to 2023.While I'm still not sure how all of this could pan out, let's just say this opens up the room to surprises. Maybe the Fed is forced to tighten more as the dollar falls, or the dollar strengthens too much and takes a toll on the economy.Any of these issues could spark a quick sell-off, and the quick sell-off could become a 20  down day thanks to 0DTE options.So what are 0DTE optionsSource  Any option that expires on the same day is a 0DTE option, and while technically, these have traded for a while, they become a lot more prominent in the last year. In 2005, weekly options were issued by the CBOE, which allowed traders to use 0DTE options once a week. However, as of 2022, there are now 0DTE options on SPX futures available for all trading days.0DTE options offer high leverage and flexibility, and this might be why they have become so popular. How popular, you askAccording to this chart, 0DTE options set a new record on August 11th, representing over 50  of all the volume.This would represent a notional value of over  1 trillion, as  , and could lead to a  20  decline given the right circumstancesSource  Note that this analysis was made back in March, and the effect could be even greater now that 0DTE options are even more popular.Just like in 1987, 0DTE options threaten to exacerbate a market sell-off by creating unforeseen downward momentum.A 20  sell-off from here would take us back towards 3800 in the SPX, almost re-testing the previous lows. With that said, the 200 weekly MA offers some strong support at 3900, and it's worth remembering that this was where the market reversed back in 1987.All in all, while I have laid out the potential for slightly higher highs in the coming months, downside risk has definitely increased, and the popularization of 0DTE options opens up the door to a black swan event similar to 1987.Macro moves markets, and this is what I do at The Pragmatic InvestorJoin today and enjoy- Weekly Macro Newsletter- Access to our Portfolio- Deep dive reports on stocks.- Regular news updatesStart your  right nowJames Foord is an economist by trade and has been analyzing global markets for the past decade.

The Tesla Dilemma: Juggling Growth And Competition," stock still offers investors lots of upside potential  the carmaker continues to defend some of the best technology in electric vehicles, or EVs, on both production efficiency and product features  in addition, the Tesla brand remains the However, reflecting on the latest developments in the global EV market, it becomes also evident that the Austin-based automotive company faces multiple challenges in its road to  EV domination.  In this article, I will discuss my take on Tesla's  i  latest Model 3 launch,  ii  the broader price cuts  price war, and the  iii  changing market share.Overall, while I continue to defend the position that Tesla remains one of the most exciting growth assets listed on the market, I also understand that the goldilocks days of easy growth, notablyIn context of the Munich IAA mobility event, held from September 5th to 10th, Tesla unveiled a new generation of its best-selling Model 3 car. On the design angle, the new Model 3 sports updated bumpers and lighting, as well as a somewhat revised interior. With regard to performance specs  the rear-wheel drive Model 3 has a 0-62 mph  0-100 km h  acceleration time of 6.1 seconds and a WLTP range of 319 miles  513 km . The Dual Motor Long Range variant is even more impressive with a 4.4-second 0-62 mph  100 km h  time and a WLTP range of 391 miles  629 km . Both versions offer fast charging capabilities of 170 kW or 250 kW, providing up to 175 miles  282 km  of range in just 15 minutes when the battery is depleted.In my opinion, the new Model 3 launch is notable, because it is a welcome alternation in the carmakers strategy to fuel demand by simply cutting prices. With the new Model 3, Tesla may once again point with car buyers on product excitement, vs. price excitement. By the way, somehow Tesla's Model 3 update reminds me of Apple's  strategy with relaunching the iPhone over and over again, with minor tweaks. Tesla plans to sell the new Model 3 as early as 2024. And overall, early management commentary suggests that the new product my help to improve profitability by both lowering the cost of goods sold and increasing the selling price compared to the outgoing model.Tesla's new Model 3 launch is also important, because Tesla needs to update its  somewhat  older product portfolio to remain competitive with European and Chinese carmakers, who bring new models to the market at record pace. In other words, the times where Tesla was the only game in battery EV, or BEV, are over. In fact, in terms of global BEV sales and market share, Tesla's share now has dropped to only 15 , down from about 23  for the previous year.However, it is also important to note that the BEV market is still expanding rapidly, which renders the loss of market share less concerning. According to a research note by Morgan Stanley's equity research team , the global BEV sales in July 2023 YTD vs. the same period in 2022 are up a remarkable 36 , growing to 5,075,089 BEV units sold in 2023 so far. The growing market is supported by higher penetration levels in all regions  the U.S. at 8.0 , Europe at 15.9 , and China at 22.8 .Finally, while BYD Company's  17  market share has overtaken Tesla's, I would like to point out that Tesla is leading in the U.S. and Europe, while BYD is only leading in China, which is a more price sensitive market, although high volume.Looking beyond the new Model 3 excitement, I see Tesla's next growth leg supported by its next-gen vehicle platform, which could account for 4-7 million EVs produced by 2028 30, according to my estimates. For context, the next-gen platform is Tesla's most important hardware project right now, aiming to reduce production cost and efficiency for more aggressive EV volume scale. According to management guidance, the next-gen platform will be leveraged at plants around the world, and not only in Mexico as I have initially assumed. The platform is expected to be used for the production of the Cybertruck, Semi, and Roadster, as well as other future vehicles.Moreover, as the second major growth opportunity, Tesla continues to be working on FSD technology. In that context, Tesla's ambitions are likely to accelerate over the next 12 to 24 months, as the company is investing in AI and its Dojo supercomputer project. As an additional consideration when discussing FSD, I would also like to point out that Tesla has recently reduced the price of its FSD package from  15 tsd to  12 tsd, which could likely push adoption up by anywhere between 10  to 20 , I believe. But more data points are needed to see how penetration and gross profit maximization is optimized by price adjustments in FSD. Like in its pricing strategy for vehicles, Tesla is lately experimenting a lot with pricing. Thus, pricing on FSD may continue to evolve over the next few months  and personally, I would not be surprised if the starter package drops below the five figure benchmark.I see a challenging Q3 for Tesla  In my opinion, there could be downside risk to investors' expectations for volume and margin, reflecting planned summer production shutdowns which will push both production and deliveries down, while repeated, aggressive discounts on sales may limit profitability. Specifically, Tesla has recently estimated that both production and deliveries volume will likely be down in Q3 vs Q2, mostly driven by the discussed factory shutdowns around the globe. In that context, the company had about 16 days of sales in inventory in Q2, mostly in-transit vehicles, which may not be enough to offset the production impact from shutdowns happening in Q3.Tesla has so far never voiced any doubts to hitting the 1.8 million in deliveries target. But the data still suggests downside risk to the flattish deliveries consensus at present. And if volume is met, it might come at a considerable cost, e.g., pressuring profitability on purchase-inducing price cuts. In that context, Tesla also intends to manage the delivery mix between the Model 3 and Model Y by adjusting the pricing gaps between the two models on a weekly basis for specific regions to tailor to market-specific nuances on supply and demand.The manufacturing costs of Tesla's Austin and Berlin factories are improving on volume ramp ups  but overall scale effects are still well below Fremont at present. However, once Austin and Berlin reach more stabilized production levels, they will be able to implement cost reduction efforts. In my opinion, however, meaningful operating leverage from the Berlin Austin factory ramp will not materialize prior to 2024.Regarding the Cybertruck, Tesla reiterated that the company is on track for start of production and deliveries in Q4, with 250k in target annual capacity. The vehicle is a product specific to the U.S. market, and management indicated that it is difficult to estimate how many Cybertrucks can be sold in 2023 and 2024, since it will also largely depend on the demand for its other vehicles.Tesla continues to be an exciting investment opportunity. However, it is important to recognize the evolving landscape of the global EV market, which presents both opportunities and challenges. A few considerations stand out  First, the recent launch of an updated Model 3, focusing on product quality rather than price reductions, indicates Tesla's commitment to sustainable growth  Second, While Tesla's global market share has dipped, the overall EV market is expanding rapidly, with Tesla maintaining leadership positions in the US and Europe  Third, investors should keep a close eye on Tesla's next-generation vehicle platform and Full Self-Driving technology, which hold the key to the company's future growth.While I see a few potential challenges in the short term, particularly in Q3, I advise investors to maintain a long-term perspective on Tesla  and, as long as the company maintains leadership in EV technology, as well as customer love, I recommend to remain invested.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

JinkoSolar stock shines after strong global demand spurs module shipments,"Shares of JinkoSolar  on Monday after reporting a revenue beat for the third quarter, benefiting from a surge in demand for its solar products, and the company remains  confident  to exceed shipment guidance for 2023.Shangrao, China-basedThe company said premium high-efficient N-type products accounted for over 60  of total shipments during the third quarter. For Q4, module shipments are expected to be 23.0 GW.Since the third quarter, price declines in the supply chain have stimulated end demand. For the first nine months of 2023, newly-added installations of PV in China reached 128.9 GW, nearly 50  more than full-year installations in 2022. Meanwhile, intensified competition brought by changes in supply and demand, accelerated technical iteration, high interest rates in some regions, and geopolitical tensions caused some volatility in the global PV market, and posed challenges on all industry players.

Exxon Mobil: Take Some Profit Near All-Time High Prices,"Readers familiar with our writings know that we have been long-term bulls on Exxon Mobil . We posted our first  on the stock back in Oct 2021 andFast-forward to now, all these drivers worked out really well. The stock has delivered a total return of  100  since then  see the chart below , outpacing both the S P 500 Index and also the energy sector.However, we see that all 3 driversXOM was able to maintain quite respectable profitability, as measured by ROIC  return on invested capital  as shown in the chart below, in the long term. Its ROIC in the past decade averaged around 9.17 , far better than its close rival Chevron . However, due to a series of headwinds  mostly the breakout of the COVID pandemic and oil price fluctuations , its ROIC nosedived into the negatives toward the latter half of 2021.And our bull thesis started when we saw signs of its profitability turning a corner, as shown in the chart below. At that time, our thinking was that travel would recover and the Russian Ukraine situation would lead to a supply-demand imbalance, both helping to stabilize energy prices and boost XOM's profitability. Indeed, XOM's profitability staged a perfect V-recovery, as seen shortly afterward. Its profitability surged to about 25  ROIC in early 2023.However, its ROIC has since then pulled back a little bit to the current 21.4 . I don't view this pullback as a random fluctuation. I see it as a symptom of the changes in the underlying forces for several reasons. First, the pullback is also observed in other peers, such as CVX. Second and more important, the supply-demand imbalance has largely equilibrated by now, in my view, as detailed immediately below.A few key factors kept supply and demand out of balance in the energy past for the past 2-3 years. The top ones in my mind are  A  years of underinvestment in basic energy infrastructure, B  the breakout of the Russian Ukraine war, C  the global shipping congesting limiting the shipment of LNG  liquefied natural gas , and D  colder-than-normal winter temperatures resulting in higher natural gas consumption than normal  say the five-year period between 2017 and 2021 .All these factors have largely renormalized and found at least a temporary equilibrium point by now, with the exception of D. Weather is just weather and can always change randomly. As a result, you can see from the chart below that natural gas storage now sits above the historical average by a good margin. For readers unfamiliar with this chart, it shows the working natural gas inventory in the lower 48 states in underground storage. The units are a billion cubic feet. The grey area means the range - the difference between the max and min averaged over five years. The thick black grey line is the running average. And the thick blue line shows the current level. As seen, for the latter part of 2021 and throughout most of 2022, the inventory has been struggling below the average. But starting early 2023, the inventory has been building up and stayed steadily above the average.Crude oil stock is still near a multi-year low  see the second chart below . However, I anticipate its turning point is coming soon because of the changes in the fundamental forces mentioned above. Trading at a TTM P E in the single digit  9.05x as of this writing , the stock is still cheap comparatively amid an overall expensive market. However, its valuation no longer offers any meaningful margin of safety in my view.For a cyclical business such as XOM which pays steady dividends in the long term, the dividend is a much better measure of its economic earnings  than accounting EPS . As a result, dividend yield is a much better valuation metric  than P E  in my view. As shown in the chart below, the stock was yielding about 5.8  when we started our bull thesis, far above its historical average. But now, the situation is the opposite. Its yield is not only below the historical average but also at the lowest level in at least 5 years.There are other considerations surrounding the stock, both in the upside and downside directions. Some of the upside catalysts include its clean energy initiatives, which ought to ramp up and bear fruit in the long term. I anticipate capital spending in the alternative energy arena, notably renewable diesel fuels and hydrogen, to accelerate in the years to come. Management also controls costs effectively, in the way I see things. Through structural reorganization and operating efficiency improvement, annual expenses have been lowered by  7 billion compared to 1-2 years ago. Lastly, as mentioned earlier, its profitability as measured by ROIC is still at a very competitive level even if it pulls further back when compared to its own historical average or its close peers.However, my overall feeling is that the issues mentioned above will be the dominating forces in the near term, say the next 2-3 years. To recap, its profitability has already reached a peak  at least temporarily for the next few years . The supply-demand imbalance seems to have found a new equilibrium. From the supply side, the sector has reinvested heavily in the past 2-3 years to boost production. From the demand side, the world was forced to either reduce consumption or find alternative sources as the Russian Ukraine situation drags on. As such, XOM might still be a good investment in the long term  all upside catalysts mentioned above are long-term oriented , but I expected return potential in the near term to be very limited due to the lack of immediate catalysts.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

Unleashing NextEra Energy: Fast Dividend Growth And 30% Undervaluation,"The other day, I  Duke Energy , which is my only utility investment. While it carries a 4.5  yield, it has underperformed the market in the past ten years, making it a good yield play but not aIn this article, I want to shed some light on , the renewables-focused regulated utility giant. Headquartered in Florida, it's the oldest stock-listed utility, as highlighted in the  below.Despite its age, the company isn't boring.Over the past ten years, NEE shares have outperformed their utility peers, dividend growth stocks, and the S P 500 by a wide margin.However, the company is now in a downtrend.NEE shares are down 18  year-to-date and roughly 25  below their all-timeWhile challenges like persistently sticky inflation and the odds of a prolonged hawkish Fed policy are doing a number on stocks with high debt loads and somewhat limited pricing power, it also comes with opportunities.NextEra Energy became a dividend aristocrat in 2021 when it hit its 25th consecutive annual dividend hike.Currently, the company has 27 consecutive hikes with an 11.3  compounding average dividend growth rate over the past five years.While its dividend yield of 2.7  is somewhat subdued, it is blowing its peers out of the water when it comes to dividend growth.Furthermore, the company maintains a 58  payout ratio, which is below the sector median of 66 .So, when it comes to its dividend scorecard, the only drawdown is its dividend yield. But then again, it comes with higher growth and a lower payout ratio.In other words, ignoring everything else, buying NEE versus higher-yielding peers depends on one's own goals.If investors require income, alternatives are almost an obvious choice. Investors who aren't dependent on income may want to opt for a stock with a higher total return potential - on top of high, decent dividend growth with fantastic safety and consistency.While its stock price may not suggest it, NEE is firing on all cylinders.In the first quarter, the company achieved a remarkable 14  year-over-year growth rate in adjusted earnings, driven by new investments.Note that the company saw strong growth despite weather headwinds, which is impressive given how sensitive renewables are to weather headwinds  pun intended .The company's commitment to renewables and storage projects led to the addition of 1,665 megawatts to its backlog, which now totals around 20 gigawatts.Despite challenges like commodity price inflation and supply chain disruptions, Energy Resources remains stable, as it believes that its significant pipeline of projects positions it well for meeting customer demand.Additionally, Energy Resources is exploring opportunities in the green hydrogen market, aiming to leverage its renewables expertise to support this emerging industry.This was also reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.According to the The company also benefits from strong growth in its key market, Florida, where employment and GDP growth are outperforming the nation's average.Excluding changes related to weather and usage, the company's customer base grew by 1.1  in the second quarter  versus 2Q22 , which is a fertile foundation for periods when individual power demand rises as well.To deal with rising demand and investment in renewables, FPL's  Florida Power   Light  capital expenditures in the second quarter were around  2.5 billion, and the full-year 2023 capital investment is projected to be between  8.5 and  9.5 billion.FPL's strategy centers around solar investments, with a goal of adding 3,100 megawatts of solar through 2025.According to the company  emphasis addedAs these investments are expensive, the company's net financial debt has exploded from  20 billion in 2010 to currently more than  70 billion.By 2025, net debt is expected to have exceeded  85 billion.The good news is that NEE isn't wasting money. Investments in value-adding projects have caused EBITDA to grow consistently, allowing the company to maintain a 4x leverage ratio for roughly 20 years, as seen in the lower part of the chart above.This is a very healthy leverage ratio, which explains why the company enjoys an A- credit rating. That's one of the highest ratings in its industry.Nonetheless, the fact that utilities have a lot of gross debt isn't helping them in an environment of elevated rates, where borrowing is expected to remain expensive for a while. It's why utilities usually perform poorly when inflation rises.In periods of low falling inflation, NEE's stock does very well.NEE has a healthy balance sheet, and despite high rates, it continues to do well, which is why I believe that weakness offers opportunities.Thanks to the recent stock price decline, NEE's valuation has come down to earth. The stock is now trading at 16.4x NTM EBITDA, which has erased the entire post-pandemic valuation expansion.The current consensus stock price target is  91, which is 30  above the current price.While I do not expect the stock to immediately start an aggressive uptrend, I do agree with this target and believe that NEE is undervalued by at least 30 .NEE has an impressive track record of outperforming peers and indices for more than a decade, backed by a remarkable 11.3  five-year average dividend growth rate.While its current dividend yield may seem subdued, its dividend growth potential and low payout ratio set it apart.NEE's commitment to renewables and storage projects is evident in its backlog expansion, totaling around 20 gigawatts. Its exploration of the green hydrogen market, supported by tax credits, reflects a forward-looking approach.Fueled by Florida's robust market and a strategic focus on solar investments, NEE remains resilient despite its substantial debt.A healthy leverage ratio and strong credit rating provide a foundation for success.The recent dip in valuation indicates an undervalued opportunity for investors in NEE.With a consensus target price of  91, NEE offers the potential for a 30  upside and long-term growth and stability in the sustainable energy sector.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

What Affects The Price Of Gold: Conventional Wisdom Vs. History,"People buy gold and silver for a lot of reasons. For jewelry and adornment, for numismatic  coin collecting  purposes, to store wealth, limited industrial applications, to protect against inflation, and to guard against geopolitical turmoil and related threats to fiat  government-issued  currency. As it relates to investing, the list is narrowed  theFirst, it must be stated and underscored that there is nothing special about gold that makes it magically go up in value in response to inflation. Gold is a commodity, and like any other commodity, its price rises and falls according to supply and demand dynamics  with plenty of interference from gold futures speculation . In other words, the price of gold only goes up if people are willing to pay more for it. And, as inputs, commodities tend to be the first to feel inflation's power.Because it has been repeated so often that gold protects purchasing power from the ravages of inflation, it could be a classic instance of the tail wagging the dog. When people hear that inflation is high or going to be high, they flock to gold to protect their purchasing power thus driving the price of gold up. That increase in price then makes it look like gold did indeed track with inflation, but it wasn't the inflation that caused it. It was people buying gold due to inflationary fears. It's correlation but not causation. There have been  where gold went down in spite of inflationIn other words, trying to time the market and get in and get out of gold according to inflation reads and inflation expectations could result in considerable money loss.However, using gold as a store of value over extremely long periods of time could indeed achieve the desired result. This chart explains it allWith notable periods of divergence, gold and to a lesser extent silver have both kept pace with inflation. But the problem with this is that we have instruments that allow us to  pace inflation with zero periods of divergence, TIPS and I-bonds. So gold and silver become lesser vehicles if matching inflation is the stated goal. Another issue is that tracking with inflation via gold, silver, TIPS, or I-bonds means that the real return is still 0 . Purchasing power was maintained but wealth did not increase. If you can use an asset that BEATS inflation, why not use itGold and silver are non-productive assets. More than perhaps any other asset class, the value of these is inherently tied to how much someone else is willing to pay for it. Beyond limited use in industry and electronics, gold is just a mineral. Unlike stocks which represent proportional ownership of an entity that produces  and can produce more of  things that humans use, need, want, and demand, or real estate that serves a critical function to giving people a place to live, work, eat, etc., gold just sits there. As Warren Buffett said, sure you can fondle gold, but don't expect it to respond.In summation for this portion, yes precious metals can protect against inflation but only if they are held for the long term. But maintaining purchasing power is a far lesser goal than actually building wealth, so if you have to hold something for the long term anyway you might as well buy stocks or real estate, whose returns smash gold and silver.I am of the opinion that investing in precious metals for the inflation aspect alone simply isn't worth it. If you want to match inflation, buy TIPS or I-bonds. Better yet, beat inflation by investing in stocks and real estate for the long term. However, when coupled with a second factor, allocating a modest portion of one's overall portfolio to precious metals makes sense.Let me put it bluntly  if something like World War III starts up and the United States loses, our currency will almost certainly collapse. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the hot situation in Israel, and China's objective of someday re-taking Taiwan, plenty of folks are prognosticating about an outbreak of widespread war involving major powers. If the U.S. does not win that conflict alongside allies, don't count on being able to buy TIPS or I-bonds. If things get especially bad, don't count on your dollar bills being worth much more than the paper they are printed on. That is the doomsday scenario, a picture often painted by the  gold bugs .In that scenario where a strong government doesn't exist to issue and back up a fiat currency, silver and gold will be the likely fallback for a medium of exchange.An  describes it well. The U.S. dollar is....War could easily upset the value proposition of the United States.Even without a war or any doomsday scenario, the U.S. dollar is facing unprecedented challenges to its status as the world's reserve currency. This is due to the world becoming increasingly concerned about the U.S. capacity to meet debt obligations, alongside a rising China and other nations that would rather not bow to the dollar for settling global trades.At a BRICS summit earlier this year  BRICS   Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa , this theme was  by several world leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin said,  The objective, irreversible process of de-dollarization of our economic ties is gaining momentum.  President Xi Jinping of China was recorded as promoting  the reform of the international financial and monetary system . If any such  BRICS currency  comes into being even a decade from now, having gold and silver could very well act as a store of wealth insulated from any impact on the U.S. dollar. This is especially so if the rumors are true that any such BRICS currency would be backed by gold. It's worth noting that the past two years have seen  by central banks of various nations the world over.What happens to the price of silver and gold during periods of major conflict, threats, and social economic unrest  A few examples.Let's start with the most recent first, looking at a period that encompasses the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, indicated by the first and second red dots, respectivelyYou could make the case that gold shot up in response to COVID commotion, but you could also argue that the surge was simply a continuation of a previous bull trend that started two years earlier. The Ukraine situation saw gold soon then-after plummet by 19 .Next is The Great Recession which started in December of 2007, indicated by the red dotHere too the case could be made that the global shock resulted in a flight to the safety of gold, where prices pushed up by  200 in a few short months. However, the surge was short-lived. Before year end the price of gold had dipped below the recession start price, then starting a slow march upward that matched the global economic recovery.Now we look at September 11th, a day that changed the world. The price of gold went up by  20 in the immediate aftermath, but the settled back down quickly, flattening for a few months, and then slowly climbed through subsequent years. If this amounts to a flight to safety, it was cool and calculated. More of a meander to safety.Looking at WWII, where Germany invaded Poland in 1939  first red dot  and then when Japan brought the United States into the conflict in 1941  second red dot , both were in the midst of a significant fall in the price of gold. Global unrest indeed, but no surge in gold.The final example from the Great Depression certainly makes the strongest case for gold being a wise investment in instances of economic shock. From  360 to  800 in just a couple yearsThis list was not intended to be exhaustive. And it is certainly beyond the scope of this article to try and surmise fully why the price of gold behaved as it did in each given instance. The point is that significant events by themselves don't seem to send gold in a particular direction. Trying therefore to invest according to some potential doomsday event is an error, if history is any indicator. It's a mixed bag.But let's talk about an instance where there was no single shock to set things off, but rather a series of smaller events and conditions combined to create a climate that may have contributed to the meteoric rise in the value of gold that happened in the 1970sFrom  280 to  2,600 over ten years is a 25  annual growth rate. What a decade. What was going on that might explain some of the rise  Some things that have plenty of resemblance to today- Cold War with Russia- Stagflation- Oil embargo and subsequent energy crisis- Iranian hostage situation, with 60 US citizens taken- Russia's military posturing and invasion of Afghanistan- Yom Kippur or 4th Arab-Israeli warEerie, is it not  Replace a few words or names and those bullets basically describe today. None of those things individually had the same scope as WWII or the same shock as 9 11, but taken together they clearly pushed people's investing dollars into a perceived safe haven, gold of course.Now, to be perfectly clear, I am not predicting some meteoric rise in gold. Far from. Who knows what will or will not happen  However, it does underscore the importance of diversification among asset classes with an informed proportion of the portfolio sitting in precious metals, more so perhaps in instances where many monetary and socio-geo-political elements are in play.I am no gold bug. If I wanted to achieve one thing with this article, it was the hope that I could dampen the voices of the firms trying to make a profit by using current circumstances and in my opinion, using scare tactics to get people to buy precious metals. There is simply no proof that gold reliably spikes as a result of inflation and or big global events. That being said, it is one basket in which folks should have an egg or two as part of a long-term strategy of preserving wealth. Other baskets are real-estate, stocks, bonds, other commodities, and perhaps even a dash of foreign currency. No one knows what the future will bring on the U.S. or global stage. Therefore, touching various asset classes is wise. Limiting overt exposure to any single one is key.Fear of missing out and fear of loss should not be drivers of investment decisions. Data should drive investment decisions. I hope I provided here data that could round out the picture a bit and prevent folks from doing anything drastic. Buy gold and silver, but do so in a measured way that agrees with your overall life situation and goals.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Halliburton's Rise: Riding The OPEC Wave,"When I penned  on Halliburton , the stock was navigating a challenging phase, primarily attributed to declining commodity prices. My core investment premise hinged on the belief that production cuts would carve out a more favorable environmentThe move is largely due to the favorable production cuts by OPEC to support oil prices in the face of a potential fall in consumption due to a global slowdown.The global energy narrative took a compelling twist as Saudi Arabia and Russia confirmed their decision to extend  cuts, removing a consequentialThe cuts saw Brent crude prices surge past the  90-a-barrel threshold-a point unseen since November 2022.There is a strong argument that these factors, along with a possible conflict in the Middle East, will continue to drive prices higher, which will support the multi-year bull thesis I laid out in the last article. Here's what I expectAlong with the supportive macro environment for oil prices, there are other key business driversWe saw these drivers play out in the last earnings report, demonstrating that the firm has been collecting its fair share of wins.Halliburton's financial snapshot for 2023's second quarter is a testament to their resilience and adeptness.This was a strong report, and one can argue that the stock deserves to be up more despite the strong move due to supply and demand dynamics supporting a favorable outlook.Halliburton will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday, October 24. Investors should look for strong EPS figures  greater than  0.75 Share , but the highlight will be how the changing supply and demand dynamics from OPEC are affecting the business. I would expect a strong year-over-year performance across the board with less sensational improvements quarter over quarter.As you might guess, analysts agree that EPS figures will continue to trend upwards, and Halliburton has managed to beat expectations in each of the past five quarters.It is likely that we will see the expected growth materialize as the major economies are essentially fully opened, and we are unlikely to see any relief from OPEC in the medium turn. There is a risk that if a conflict should deepen between Iran and the US following the horrific attacks in Israel, Iran could aggressively ramp up production as it has in the past to raise funds. This would soften oil prices slightly, but a collapse would be unlikely without support from OPEC. It is likely that Energy will become a hot theme over the coming months due to these tensions, and firms like Halliburton could see some uncharacteristic volatility.Halliburton has undoubtedly proven its mettle amidst fluctuating commodity prices, with the stock showcasing an admirable 45  surge in just a year. This upward trend, fortified by OPEC's strategic production cuts and geopolitical intricacies, hints at the resilience and adaptability of the company. The Q2 earnings report further buttresses Halliburton's prowess in the oilfield landscape. However, investors should stay alert. As global tensions simmer, particularly concerning Iran and the U.S., the energy sector might be in for a rollercoaster ride. While Halliburton seems well-poised to benefit from a surge in oil prices, a recession could dent consumption and introduce headwinds. There is also the tendency of low-cost producers to ramp up production when prices are high. That said, the trade is a lot clearer than it was a year ago, though there is less meat left on the bone. I rate Halliburton as a hold.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

REITs Vs. BDCs: A Lesson In Contrarian Investing,"Some prefer real estate investment trusts  REITs . Others prefer business development companies  BDCs . I like owning both.Often, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of both. But sometimes, economic conditions are good for one but bad for the other. That makes them complementary assetsREITs and BDCs share in common the fact that they must both pay out at least 90  of their taxable income in order to avoid corporate-level income taxes. Instead of being double-taxed -- once at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level -- these vehicles avoid corporate taxes in exchange for their dividends being taxed as ordinary income rather than the  qualified dividend  rate.REITs and BDCs also share in common the basic business model of issuing capital  a combination of equity, debt, andBut that's basically where the similarities end. The biggest difference, in my view, between these two investment vehicles is thatThere are other differences, such asAnd so on.But for the sake of this article, the primary difference I want to highlight is the fact that REITs are  of debt  some of which is floating rate , while BDCs are  of debt  almost all of which is floating rate .All else being equal, rising interest rates are a  and a , while falling interest rates are a  and a .But we should be a bit more specific, because most of REITs' debt is long-term  5  years  in nature, while most of BDCs' loans have floating rates based on the shortest-term interest rate -- the overnight rate set by central banks.So, more specifically, we can state that  again, all else being equal , REITs benefit from falling long-term interest rates, while BDCs benefit from rising short-term interest rates.Both are basically , but during rising interest rates, that spread between WACC and investment yields typically narrows for REITs and widens for BDCs. During falling interest rates, the opposite typically happens.With that in mind, take a look at the price performance of the broad-based Vanguard Real Estate ETF  against the VanEck BDC Income ETF  in the first several months of 2020, when COVID struck and incited a sharp drop in interest rates.During this time, lower interest rates in addition to longer lease terms and an overrepresentation of financially strong tenants prevented REITs from falling as far as BDCs.Meanwhile, BDCs got hit by the double-whammy of collapsing interest rates and a sudden economic shutdown that hurt many of their private, middle-market borrowers. If the federal government had not stepped in to provide emergency lending and grants to these middle-market businesses, the damage would have been even worse.The situation so far this year could not be more different, though. The Federal Reserve has hiked their key policy rate aggressively, pulling long-term interest rates up with it, while the economy  i.e. middle-market borrowers and tenants alike  has remained strong.As the market has realized that BDCs' borrowers have mostly been able to absorb these higher interest costs, and that BDCs have rewarded shareholders with dividend raises and special dividend payouts, BDC total returns have begun to meaningfully outpace REITs this year.Again, the higher rates are a tailwind for BDCs and a headwind for REITs.We can see this even clearer when looking at examples of top-tier BDCs against top-tier REITs this year. Here are my top five BDC holdings and top five REIT holdings.  And yes, I know that one of these is a mortgage REIT, but I view its business model as substantially similar to that of a BDC, only concentrated on real estate companies.I like BDCs that are able to maintain a premium to their net asset values over time, because this indicates an ability to issue capital for accretive investments on a regular basis. The higher the premium to NAV, the lower the cost of capital, generally speaking.Of course, I like to buy these BDCs as close to NAV as possible, or at a discount to NAV in those rare circumstances, but the point here is that regularly trading at a premium to NAV is both an  and a  of quality. It is the higher quality BDCs that tend to enjoy such a valuation premium in the first place, and once they have that valuation premium, they can use it to issue lower-cost capital in order to win bids on lower-yielding loans for higher quality borrowers.MAIN is the textbook example of this, which is why it is my largest BDC holding. The company explicitly aims to increase its NAV per share over time along with its monthly dividend.Meanwhile, on the real estate side, four of my five largest REITs primarily  or exclusively  employ net leases, which are long-term contracts with fixed rental revenue streams and annual escalations rarely exceeding 3-4 . They also employ long-term debt ranging from 5 to 30 years in length, although most of them carry at least some floating rate debt on their balance sheets at times.This year, especially since the beginning of May, the BDCs  and ABR  have significantly outperformed VNQ on a total return basis.MAIN and ARCC, the two largest and arguably most conservative BDCs in this group, have understandably exhibited less volatility, both on the downside and upside. But they have also handily outperformed real estate so far this year.Meanwhile, when comparing the five REITs against BIZD year-to-date, we find the mirror opposite.All year, but especially starting in May, REITs have significantly trailed BIZD.CCI, a telecommunications infrastructure REIT, has performed the worst not only because of the  10  of its debt featuring floating rates but also because lease cancellations from the T-Mobile -Sprint merger are taking a bite out of revenue growth.ARE, the leading life science real estate owner and developer in the US, has also suffered from investors mistakenly equating it with office buildings, a drop in venture capital funding for biotechs, and an activist REIT investor's short report.Fundamentally, all five REITs continue to perform quite well, but the higher cost of debt has spooked many investors out of the names.Which is the better buy today for total returns over the next few yearsIf we had asked that question in March or April 2020, during a period of collapsing interest rates and extreme economic pain for private businesses, the correct answer would have been BDCs.Don't believe me  See for yourselfThat is because peak pessimism about BDCs  even greater than the pessimism for REITs  rendered phenomenal values for those stocks.The same holds for BIZD against the five  in my opinion  best-in-class REITs discussed above, with the sole exception of VICI.In the initial stage of COVID-19, VICI  the  Landlord of Las Vegas,  as I like to call it  shed over half its stock price and market cap. The very experiential, in-person activities at VICI's casino properties were obviously severely curtailed by lockdowns and social distancing. But this selloff also primed the REIT for a robust rebound as Las Vegas reopened and the world returned to normal.YTD, however, BIZD has outperformed VICI as we saw above.But we can't invest by looking in the rearview mirror. We have to invest by looking out the windshield. No one can buy past returns, only future performance.As the famous quip goes,  It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.But in my view, the much better bet to make today with one's scarce investable capital is on .I think it's plainly obvious that sentiment is much stronger for BDCs than it is for REITs. In general, investors are pessimistic about REITs and optimistic about BDCs.But this trend won't last forever. To quote the father of value investing, Benjamin GrahamI'm not advocating selling BDCs. I'm a buy-and-hold-quality-companies kind of guy, and I'm certainly not selling my high-quality BDCs  or ABR, for that matter . But I think REITs make the much better buy today.It isn't just that the pendulum of investor sentiment has reached its end on its current path. After all, it is usually the case that something has to occur to  the pendulum stop and reverse course.That something is the path of interest rates. We are at or very near the top in interest rates, not just by my own reckoning but by the projections of many experts. The forward path of SOFR  which is tied to the Fed Funds rate  is forecast to begin dropping dramatically in 2024 and settle out sometime in 2026.While I agree with these forward projections in a directional sense, I don't at all buy the notion that rates will come down in a slow and controlled manner. They never do.Like stock prices, the Fed Funds rate takes the escalator  or stairs  up during economic expansions and the elevator down during recessions.Going back three decades, the Fed has never been able to gradually lower their policy rate over the span of a few years. The Fed has seemed to have three modes  slam on the gas, slam on the breaks, or coast.If a recession comes sometime in the near future, and especially if the highest interest rates in 15 years break something in the economy, then interest rates will likely fall faster and lower than the expert projections indicate.Historically, this is how it has worked out far more than the slow, gradual lowering of rates currently envisioned.If the pattern of history plays out again this time, or even if it doesn't and the expert predictions for a slow, gradually downward drift of interest rates occur instead, REITs should outperform BDCs over the next few years.While I remain a fan of BDCs, I view the five REITs discussed above as being uniformly better buys today than the four BDCs and one mREIT.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently , I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash   in the  crack spread.  As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around  87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The  crack spread  is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of  32 barrel to  19 barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this  12 barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of - 12.96 annualized  3.24B quarterly .  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See belowHistorically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around  15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around  1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative   seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage . Its refining segment EBITDA was  3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as - 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected  1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at  1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about  5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a  1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of  5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around  830M, and its interest is currently around  142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra  972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at  4.67B, or  3.7B after taxes  21  historically . The company usually has  350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of  3.35B or an EPS of  8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at  7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at  1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of  448M, or  353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest  4M, or a  0.01 EPS . The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at  4.53 EPS  however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA  however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to  7.5 and a Q4 nearer to  1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4 , indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 , that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See belowAgain, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade  and today in particular  would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential ,  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves  both strategic and commercial , could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC  production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See belowAs the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around  -1 to  2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward  P E  of  30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a  highly sensitive   environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy GDX: Greatest Gold Lease Rate Spike Since Late 2008,"Believe or not, we may have reached for one of the strongest buy signals in the gold asset market since  was  in September 2008, a good 15 years ago. An unusualWhy should gold investors pay attention to lease rates  or what buyers are willing to pay in interest beforeLast week, I mentioned the jump in 2-month lease rates to multi-decade highs  and a large inversion position to later contracts  in a  on the  . For gold bugs, the outlook for gold assets has gotten even more bullish over the past few trading days.If you are new to the gold market and gold miners in particular, and you don't want to  1  carry the extra leverage and risk of NUGT or  2  delve deeper into which individual miners are the best to own over the next 6-12 months, I definitely suggest opening a position in the  . This product holds the biggest and most valuable mining outfits, giving you quick and diversified exposure.It's also the largest gold miner ETF for stronger liquidity in trading with AUM of  11.8 billion and a 0.51  annual management expense. GDX does pay a respectable dividend yield of 1.65 , slightly better than the S P 500 equivalent. I fully expect higher gold prices next year will lead to dividend raises from many of its holdings.The Top 10 holdings of GDX include  , ,  ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  , and  . You are buying a piece of mining assets located on all the world's continents outside of Antarctica, with ownership structures from percentage partnerships, to fully owned resource and production assets, to royalty financing firms getting a piece of future sales.This article will review how GDX has performed after similar spikes in gold lease rates over the last 15 years, with the 2008 instance holding the closest similarities to our current financial market condition, in my opinion.Below we can look at a 15-year graph of the gold prices vs. changes in lease rates, via GoldChartsRUS.com. I have drawn green arrows to point out the similarities between today and October-November 2008. Plus, I have circled in green the closet cousins for a spike in lease rates during late 2015, March-April 2019, and last year's autumn setup.Here is how each occurrence played out over the following months and years for both gold bullion quotes and GDX total return performance. The conclusion which is easy to reach  past lease rate spikes have foretold of coming price gains, usually large ones over time.Does a lease rate spike lead to an immediate jump in gold prices  The answer is not necessarily. It could take a few weeks or months for the gold bull run higher to appear. That's what evidence over the last 15 years has proven. However, if you buy now and close your eyes  ignoring daily fluctuations and news flow  for 6 to 12 months, I am quite confident gold bullion and gold miner pricing will be dramatically higher than today.That's exactly what the tight physical market setup is telegraphing for the future. To find a better balance between supply and demand forces, much higher quotes look to be necessary. Bringing existing above-ground gold supplies to market through the profit-motive is how capitalism works.Part of the tightness in the physical bullion market is related to  around the world since early 2022. If their buying continues, who knows how high gold can rise in constantly debasing U.S. dollars backed by mathematically unpayable Treasury debt numbers. Any dollar confidence crisis could shoot gold above US 3000 an ounce without much warning. This target is close to my long-term  fair value  calculation for gold using 60 years of relative pricing to other asset classes and U.S. money debt creation trends. I have explained this fair-value idea in previous gold silver articles over the years.And, if we get a recession soon, with new stress on the global financial system, another round of record QE buying of Treasuries  to prevent credit markets from freezing up  and increases in money supply aggregates  to prevent a debt-default depression  will only serve to stoke interest in the hedging characteristics of monetary metals, both gold and silver.I rate VanEck Gold Miners a , leaning toward a , if prices do not rise immediately, using a 12-month outlook. Gold and related mining concerns are not getting much positive attention in the press, and futures market positioning by  highlights a clear absence of bullish interest over the last year despite a  15  gold gain. That's a good thing, as the precious metals cycle turns up, plenty of new buying interest is now sitting on the sidelines. We'll have to wait and see if we are entering a new gold rush in investment interest into 2024. It depends on the economy's direction and how the Federal Reserve reacts.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Will Rising Interest Rate Avalanche Crush The Economy And Markets?,"For 14 years after the 2008 global financial crisis, global central banks held interest rates close to zero. In the U.S., cash interest rates never topped 2.5  and were near zero the vast majority of the time. In EuropeAfter the pandemic and massive government deficits sparked runaway inflation, this model was shattered into a million pieces. Interest rates continue to surge, and I'm not sure that Yesterday, the , with more possible increases to come today with bond yields continuing their landslide. Investors are paying even more. At the same time, home prices are still up about 40  from pre-pandemic. For some rough math, buying a  500,000 house with a 3  mortgage costs you  1,686 per month in principal and interest. Add in the 40  increase in home prices and finance it at 8 , and that principal and interest payment is  4,109 per month. At this rate, we might be at 8  mortgages in a matter of weeks.Should you still borrow as much as possible to buy a house  I think it's the biggest financial mistake that you as a young six-figure earner could make, especially since you can put your 20  down payment in a money market fund and earn hundreds of dollars per month in interest  5.5 . And if you don't think so, the price of money may keep going up until you do, courtesy of massive government deficits and the Fed's inflation-fighting mandate. I've  over the past 18 months.Some readers will think my work is a total airball because prices are only down like 1  from the peak. There's still time. I don't think the economy is going to handle 8  mortgage rates well at all and we're about to find out who's right. For now, homebuilders have sold millions of homes  When these reset, I think a lot of dual-income overleveraged people will be in trouble.Will we see 9  mortgages  We're not that far off. Old-timers may recall mortgage rates this high or higher, but to put them in context, you need to compare home price-to-income ratios as well to get debt-to-income numbers. , despite a lack of population growth and a rapid pace of construction. It doesn't add upConsumers largely refuse to save money, and the government is looking to borrow as much as possible as well. It's simple supply and demand  if everyone wants to borrow and there are few people willing to lend, then interest rates go up. People on the Internet say the Fed will just print more money to bail everyone out, but they really can't legally do it with their inflation mandate. History is filled with governments who print money to monetize the debt and wipe out the middle class.However, at least in the U.S. and Western Europe, central banks have experience fighting inflation and understand the long-term economic consequences of letting inflation skyrocket. In the U.S., the public was sick of the shortsighted economic policies of the late 1960s and 1970s and double-digit inflation. Fed chair Paul Volcker took a stand, smashing the inflationary psychology via an engineered recession. Germany cracked down even further on inflation, having learned from the traumatic, ingrained experience of the  Interestingly, that generation's children and grandchildren are today's business leaders there, and their thinking largely influenced the euro and the idea of  in Europe in the 2010s.At this point, it's highly unlikely that the Fed will turn around and print a bunch of money because doing so might drive inflation back not to 8 , but to 20  or more annually. History shows that Congress eventually gets the message, as they did when bond vigilantes forced both the  and  to cut spending.What good economists would tell about the large deficits of Bidenomics is that there's a risk of  the rest of the economy. Huge government deficits need to be financed by borrowing, and finding buyers financing the debt means that interest rates go up. People always say the government spends too much, but to run these kinds of deficits during peacetime and economic expansion . This has the obvious effect of diverting economic activity that would happen in the private sector to the government. Worse, so-called  can stop buying government debt, sending interest rates skyrocketing.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman recently  on rising interest rates in the U.S., which he's winning in spectacular fashion. He thinks the 30-year Treasury will go to 5.5  this implies mortgages would be at about 9 . It seems that the lessons of the 1970s have been forgotten, with  2,000 stimulus checks offered up by both parties as the reward for voting for them in 2020. We're paying for those now.The U.S. government either needs to cut spending or raise taxes, or interest rates might just keep going up. This inflation surge shouldn't have happened   the Fed should have ended QE far earlier, and raised rates sooner. The federal government should have spent about a trillion less in 2021, 2022, and 2023. I'm speculating here, but I think if they had, then interest rates would be 3.5  or so and inflation would be a bit above 2 .Mortgages get all the attention, but cars and trucks are expensive. They're even more expensive when you can't pay cash and need to finance them. Pre-pandemic, car loans were cheap  3-4  for good credit . Now, customers often need to pay over 7 . On a  50,000 car loan, that's the difference between paying  898 per month and paying  990. Car loan payments aren't as sensitive to interest rates as mortgages, but as amortizations get longer, the effect is greater. Again here,  since pre-pandemic, so there's a compounded effect. Last I looked, salaries are up about 15-20  since pre-pandemic, so cars and houses being up 40  each is bad news. Will American automakers sell as many cars with higher interest rates  Economic theory says no. There likely will need to be a transition towards more economical cars, be they electric vehicles  EVs  or hybrids, because aging consumers with thin balance sheets don't have any business with  1,000 car payments.I think this explains why the Fed and the White House are puzzled by why consumer confidence is so low despite unemployment being low. If I waved a wand and awarded you a  100,000 job but you have minimal other assets, in 2019 you could buy a house and car. Now, your options are much more limited, first because of pandemic shortages from money printing, and now because of skyrocketed interest rates. Despite making a little more money  on paper  than before, people are worse off in terms of purchasing power unless they went into the pandemic owning one or more houses and cars.In March, we saw several regional banks fail in rapid succession. Since then, things have been quiet, although interest rates have increased and lending standards have steadily tightened. If you recall from March, what crushed these banks was having far too much leveraged exposure to long-duration bonds yielding 1  or whatever when they got flooded with deposits in 2021. Then interest rates rose and rose until some banks went broke. While betting on bonds with leverage is historically a good trade  if you have some yield to work with , it requires a higher level of risk management skill. Banks like Silicon Valley Bank  didn't have that skill, so they went bust.I wonder what else is lurking out there with these regional banks  The 10-year hit a new post-crisis high today, and while companies like Charles Schwab  took  to fix their balance sheets, I bet a lot of them just stuck their heads in the sand. I'm not going to name names of banks I think are in trouble, but if you see some of these regional banks in the headlines soon being closed for losses, then you should not be surprised.I think it's also worth noting that like many parts of the economy, certain banks and fintech-type companies thrived in an environment where interest rates only went down. If they bet the farm on it, they're going to lose the farm if interest rates keep rising.Rising rates have a direct impact on the stock market by affecting the leading sectors of the economy that rely on loans  housing, autos, etc. . Another channel that interest rates work through is increasing bond yields and thus financing costs for companies over time. Rising rates also have an indirect effect on the stock market by allowing you to earn interest risk-free in money market funds.While many investors think things like  housing is the best investment ever and nothing can stop it,  there should be some level of interest rates that makes them change their minds. Maybe it's a 5  mortgage rate, maybe it's 7 , 8 , or even 10 . Similarly, for stocks, there be an interest rate on cash that makes you change your mind about wanting to own them. If the government decided that they'd pay 20  risk-free in Treasuries, would you really want to be punting your money on the NASDAQ  Recall that in the 1970s and 1980s, S P 500   of where they are now due to interest rates being sky-high.The question right now   cash interest rates are at 5.5 , while long-term interest rates are rapidly rising. Stock prices don't really make sense, either on a macro level or whether you dig into blue-chip companies and project their cash flows. Do you want to buy stocks for near-record-high valuations, or keep some of your money in cash  It's not an all-or-nothing decision, and the higher interest rates go, the more apt you should be to save and the less you should be to borrow. American consumers just haven't gotten the message yet, with savings rates near record lows. They will though, because the price of money will keep going up until it induces them to save.Lastly, the yield curve is sending a message. Inverted yield curves are associated with a recession warning, but once the recession actually starts, the yield curve tends to rapidly steepen. Often the curve steepens because the Fed is cutting, but if it's steepening because interest rates are skyrocketing, it likely has the same effect. This will be a real business cycle, not the computer simulation science experiment that the COVID economy was.Has a recession already started and we don't know it yet  Student loans for 40  million borrowers are due on October 1st. It will be interesting to see how everything shakes out. Volatility seasonally , and we're right on schedule, but it's not like the bottom has fallen out yet. Whether the rising interest rate landslide continues is likely key to knowing where markets go next. If we see the 10-year Treasury push towards 5.5  and mortgages make a run at 9 , then it's probably game over for the 2023 mini-bull market, with some combination of a housing crash, bank failures, and stock investors forced to face the reality of steadily rising financing costs for corporate America.

"Big Dividend Yields Going Higher, Dumb Debt, And Snark"," RatesWell, congratulations anyway  You get the same reward as everyone else  more national debt.The market seems settled on raising rates10-year Treasury rates  are sitting more than 60 basis points above the trailing 100-day average. Great. Jacking up interest rates is supposed to kill off the companies that were not productive, right  That makes it a good thingRates can be an issue for mortgage REITs  mREITs  and equity REITs. For equity REITs, debt is eventually rolled over at higher rates and investors have more alternatives. When interest rates are high because of inflation, investors don't get an alternative. CPI smoothing through the housing index suppressed the actual rate of inflation. Consumer prices were actually rising at double-digit rates for a while. But you probably know that, because you've gone places and seen prices. A useful techniqueWhen actual prices were growing faster than 10  and Treasury rates were under 1.5 , investors didn't have a choice. Equity is a garbage hedge against inflation in the short term, but a great hedge in the long term. Real estate  such as that owned by equity REITs  can also serve as a good hedge over long periods.Those low rates pushed investors into equity markets. Today, Chairman Jerome Powell is ensuring they can get paid on Treasuries. We can use TIPS  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities  to measure how much of the yield is coming from inflation expectations. If the TIPS yield is high, it means investors are being offered an unusually high real  inflation-adjusted  return in the bond market.When was the last time the 5-year TIPS yield broke this level  See the chartCool, it was 2006 to 2007. We all remember nothing bad happened then, so that's great.The Federal Reserve successfully convinced investors that they will keep elevated rates even if inflation subsides. Whether we get a recession or not, the Federal Reserve really wants to see interest expenses explode higher.The market already concluded that inflation would probably be back to about 2This can be a particularly hard environment for most investors. When interest rates increase by 50 basis points in a year, it's no big deal. When they rip higher like this, it slams into valuations.Higher interest rates delay demand. That reduces inflation in the short term, which is what everyone focuses on. However, bigger  create inflation. The recent inflation was not caused by monetary policy  which means interest rates . They were low for over a decade without causing inflation. Fiscal policy changed as we shifted from big deficits to  multi-trillion  dollar deficits. Some investors still believe that this is some kind of multi-decade-lagged impact of lower rates. I'll never reach those investors. Most of you can probably see that inflation picked up promptly after pushing trillions of dollars into the economy.Don't get me wrong. Interest rates have a lagged impact. But it isn't a multi-decade lag. Inflation didn't run under 2  for about 12 years, only to rip higher suddenly from the same low rates.The issue now is that apartment construction is plunging.Why does this matter so muchLet's be real. Most of Gen Z isn't going to be buying homes. Oops, did I hurt some feelings  Sometimes, reality hurts.What I want you to see is the navy line and grey lines. That's a huge drop. Bad. Starts are projected to fall from over 500,000 to 250,000.Do you know what impacts apartment rentsIt's supply and demand. That was a really obvious answer.So, how can a country get more affordable rental units  There are two stepsIt's like rent control, except it works. Developers clearly responded to rates as it drove a surge in production and a subsequent plunge.What do I say to the guy who assumes that building more apartments will just result in millions of new renters showing up to pay the exact same price  Nothing. That's dumb. Listen to conference calls and investor presentations. The big factor that puts pressure on rental rates is local supply levels.The mortgage REIT book values are going to be down. It will be either  all  or  almost all  of the mortgage REITs listed here. On the other hand, business development company  BDC  book values will be much closer to flat on average. There will probably be one or two outliers, but most will be pretty flat.The worst losses are probably going to be in the high single-digit percentages or low double-digit percentages. Buyer beware when using the trailing BV figures  which are included below . Our strategy for trading in the mortgage REIT and BDC space relies on having frequent updates. We update estimates most weekends. Most Mondays, we go into the market with new information. For reference, there are still some reports on Wall Street where an analyst has one update for the quarter. What's better  1 update or 12 updates  When rates are moving this fast, it matters.I've got another bold prediction, though. Absent a major recession or a plunge in interest rates  which would probably require a recession , preferred shares that are  fixed-to-floating  will have a tendency to climb toward call value as the floating date approaches. There are currently 3 mortgage REIT preferred shares that are floating  NLY-F, NLY-G, and AGNCN.Their share prices are  25.34,  24.73, and  25.59, respectively. That puts their floating yields in the range of 9.9  to 10.5 . Some of the mortgage REIT preferred shares involve more risk. However, many of them have bigger floating spreads. Personally, I will gravitate more toward the lower-risk shares. However, I am venturing into a few of the higher-risk shares where upcoming floating dates imply dramatic upside. If shares rally toward  25.00, then the yield to call becomes a more useful metric even if calls don't actually occur. Of course, this only applies to shares that will have a floating rate.Investors tend to like double-digit yields. Some of these shares hit the floating date and will see dividend rates jump 25  to 50 . As the floating date approaches, we've seen prices go higherOf course, that's only one example. Yes, there are others. No, they don't fit in this article. I already wrote the sections below and the piece is getting too long. If you think I'm wrong, just look at the stability in the share prices for NLY-F and AGNCN over the last 2 years. They were the first ones to float.If you missed the announcement, you should know that CIM announced CIM-B will float using SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment. I plan to provide a bigger update on that publicly. The announcement came only a few business days after we encouraged Seeking Alpha readers to consider contacting CIM about the situation. Particularly appealing was CIM's confirmation in the filing that this would happen automatically under the law. CIM's prospectus for CIM-B has nearly identical language to PMT's prospectus for PMT-A and PMT-B.Reading the waterfall intelligently results in a waterfall that doesn't function. The fixed-rate dividend wasn't a viable long-term fallback because the qualification was  no such dividend period  exists, rather than  no such rate exists.  CIM was explicit about their shares falling under the LIBOR Act and automatically switching to SOFR  Secured Overnight Financing Rate    the spread adjustment  about 26 basis points . It was an exceptional rebuke to a less ethical peer.I want to repeat that with different wording for anyone who missed it. CIM did not say   We're choosing to use SOFR.  They said it would happen automatically under the law. The only options they had were to accept SOFR   the spread adjustment or break the law. No other option. Hey PMT, why are you looking so shifty over thereI'll probably have a public article on it next week. For this week, I really wanted toI'm excited to keep hunting in the preferred share space.

It is available in our service, but those estimates are not included in the charts below.  Presently, a few other REITs also have no consensus estimate. Due to the way historical amortized cost and hedging is factored into the earnings metrics, it is possible for two mortgage REITs with similar portfolios to post materially different metrics for earnings. I would be very cautious about putting much emphasis on the consensus analyst estimate  which is used to determine the earnings yield . In particular, throughout late 2022 the earnings metric became less comparable for many REITs.I changed the coloring a bit. We needed to adjust to include that the first fixed-to-floating shares have transitioned over to floating rates. When a share is already floating, the stripped yield may be different from the  Floating Yield on Price  due to changes in interest rates. For instance, NLY-F already has a floating rate. However, the rate is only reset once per 3 months. The stripped yield is calculated using the upcoming projected dividend payment and the  Floating Yield on Price  is based on where the dividend would be if the rate reset today. In my opinion, for these shares the  Floating Yield on Price  is clearly the more important metric.Note  Shares that are classified as  Other  are not necessarily the same.

Fluence Energy: Armed With Disruptive A.I.,"Dramatic changes in the levelized cost of solar power are currently forcing a sea change in how our electric grid functions. In order to mitigate the problems caused by the widespread adoption of solar, we areThe passage of the  dramatically increased our  Instantaneously managing something as dynamic and complicated as our grid has always been beyond human capability, so up until fairly recently we wouldn't have considered it. Developments in Artificial Intelligence have changed everything.Fluence Energy, Inc.  is one of several companies currently positioning themselves to be able to compete for dominance in this highly disruptive emerging industry. With the company already vertically integrated for the production ofFluence Energy provides energy storage equipment and services. The company was formed in early 2018 as the result of a joint venture between AES Corporation  and Siemens . The two companies  AES's extensive research with Siemens' expansive global presence. Fluence  6.6GW of storage deployed, contracted, or managed in 47 different markets.Fluence Energy offers both hardware installation and maintenance services, as well as operational capability through A.I. controlled energy management software. They provide turnkey energy storage products with fully integrated hardware, software, and digital intelligence.Fluence also offers a variety of service and management packages. Customers who want a more hands off approach can sign up to one of their more full-service options.Fluence is a vertically integrated grid scale battery manufacturer. They are several generations into their development and currently produce a highly modular cube shaped battery. When used in their separate applications, Fluence gives each of their technologies its own unique brand. Their grid-scale energy storage product is known as Gridstack  their control and operation system is known as Ultrastack  their solar capture optimization system is known as Sunstack  and their commercial energy storage and load flattening system is known as Edgestack.The grid-scale battery market is projected to experience a  until 2031. The global smart grid market is projected to have a  until 2030. The United States renewable energy market is estimated to have a  through 2028, and the global market is projected to have a  until 2030.The  is one of the primary factors at play when examining long-term energy infrastructure trends. With photovoltaics achieving the title of  several years ago, additional inclusion of renewable sources seems inevitable. However, the adoption of intermittent sources has been warping the daily supply and demand curve for grid supplied electricity. This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve. Uncontrolled overproduction from solar has the potential to damage portions of the grid. This problem has grown severe enough that we are already disconnecting portions of commercial scale solar operations during the middle of the day.Since the initial adoption of our electric grid, it has operated on a continuous supply basis. Traditionally, because of the significant startup time for most power plants, changes in future demand must be forecast. Because of the need to avoid shortages, not only must demand be forecast, managers must intentionally overshoot that expected demand. Our continuously oversupplied grid operates with significant waste and is in dire need of storage capacity.Because they are viewed as the single most vital part of our current grid, the base load providers have enjoyed superior pricing power at the negotiating table. With our inverter technology already above the threshold where they can achieve a strong stable signal, and the rise of storage providers undermining the need for continuous oversupply, as even more decentralized sources are incorporated into the system the individual negotiating power of electricity producers diminish.As the total storage capacity within the system grows, and we incorporate more medium and long-term storage into the system, I expect that negotiating power will shift toward the storage providers. Eventually, they may be able to adopt a  stance while negotiating against any single source provider. For this reason, I believe only the most cost-effective base load providers will thrive in the coming decades.Also, I believe the need for peaker plants . Peaker plants are usually powered by natural gas. They are designed to be able to synchronize with the grid and achieve operational power from a cold start within a few minutes. We ask them to come online breifly to mitigate the spikes in demand that occur every evening. We also ask them to help us maintain stable oversupply during events which cause changes to usage habits on a truly massive scale, like the Super Bowl, the Olympics, or the World Cup.As the grid storage industry is incredibly disruptive, I also expect a price war to break out. Storage providers can collect free or almost-free electricity during periods of overproduction. In places where a significant portion of electricity comes from solar, this happens in the middle of the day, every day. They can later sell that electricity when it's trading at its highest every evening. In addition to experiencing an erosion of their negotiating power, I do not expect the source providers will be able to compete with actively managed storage providers if a price war breaks out.The thing to note here is that storage providers are financially incentivized to get their hands on as much overproduction as possible. Companies wanting to increase the volume of electricity they can arbitrage each day are going to attempt to install grid scale storage sites into as many markets as possible. This is one of the greatest shake-ups the industry has seen since its inception  we may even see already established utility companies begin installing storage into the service areas of rival utility providers. Over the next several decades, I believe the arbitrage business has the potential to scale into a truly massive industry.The machine learning software packages that we have been developing to actively manage multiple dynamic sources are what is making this possible. I think the companies which are able to develop the most capable A.I. are the ones which stand to benefit the most from actively managing our future smart grid.Fluence Energy was formed as an attempt by AES and Siemens to pool their knowledge and experience to produce a company capable of meeting the growing demand for grid scale storage. Fluence Energy expanded their capability with  in April 2022. Nispera collects and analyzes data from multiple sources to monitor production in real time.

While their parent companies have accounted for a significant portion of their business so far, approximately 81  of their backlog is with not-related parties. Their total backlog of contracts is up to  11.2B.They also increased the amount of assets they had under A.I. management by 800 MW and were able to place an additional 2.7 GW under contract for digital management. They stated this represented a 200  increase from the previous quarter.They previously expected to be adjusted EBITDA positive in fiscal year 2024. They are now revising their expectations to be close to adjusted EBITDA break even in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. They stated they believe they will not need to raise any additional capital and have ample liquidity to meet their cash needs for the next 12 months.Fluence has been experiencing significant revenue increases. Eight quarters ago Fluence Energy had a quarterly revenue of  98.1M. Four quarters ago that had risen to  342.7M  by this most recent quarter that had further grown to  698.2M. This represents a total two-year rise of 611.7  at an average quarterly rate of 76.47 .Their margins have been improving for the last several quarters. As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 4.38 , EBITDA margins were -4.88 , operating margins were -5.27 , and net margins were -3.57 .As of the most recent quarter cash and equivalents was  194M, short-term investments was  70M, and quarterly operating income was - 37M. Their share count has been growing at a fairly stable rate for the last four quarters. In June of 2021, total common shares outstanding was at 114.3M  by this most recent quarter that had risen to 116.9M, a 2.27  increase.As with many spin-offs and joint ventures, and unlike many start-ups, Fluence has not had to take on large amounts of debt on its path to operational viability. This most recent quarter, Fluence Energy had - 0.1M in net interest expense, total debt was at  3.4M, and long-term debt was at  0M.As the company approaches adjusted EBITDA profitability, I expect that these cash flow values will improve. As of this most recent earnings report, unlevered free cash flow was at - 123.4M, while levered free cash flow was at - 123.9M.Their total equity rose dramatically in late 2021 but has been slowly declining since then.Similar to my thoughts about their cash flow, I expect their returns will shift into positive territory as they continue to improve their margins. As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was -4.36 , ROCE was -1.89 , and ROE was at -4.38 .As of August 3rd, 2023, Fluence Energy had a market capitalization of  4.92B and traded for  28.36 per share. The company is not profitable so I cannot produce a PEGY estimate, but they do have an  of 35 . Considering their guidance for profitability, I view their forward EV Sales of 1.6x, Price Sales of 1.65x, and Price Book of 12.39x as showing the company as presently undervalued.Despite their positive guidance, the margin expansion and cash flow improvements might not materialize. With their cash and short-term investments, the company currently has  264.4M in unrestricted funds. Their most recent quarterly levered cash flow was - 123.9M, while cash from operations was - 74.5M, EBITDA was at - 34.1M, and operating income was - 36.8MI believe that arbitragers will eventually gain significant control over the price of electricity as supply and demand both vary throughout the day. However, this may not occur. If the general public views what the storage providers do as price manipulation, they may one day face regulations.Fluence Energy has multiple direct competitors including Stem , and Tesla  who are also developing thier own energy production and grid management digital intelligence. They also face indirect competition from companies such as C3.ai , which are developing digital intelligence services more focused on dynamic consumption management. While Fluence certainly does appear to be capable, their eventual dominance in this emerging industry is far from a guarantee.The company currently has  11.2B under contract waiting to be converted into revenue. This most recent quarter, they were only able to fill  700M worth of orders and yet signed  2.8B in new contracts. This  2.8B came in above their previous quarter's new contract value of  2.7B. The picture that is being painted by this trend is that demand for their product is currently outstripping the pace they can install new storage. It's fairly clear why the company believes they will be able to grow revenue  their waiting list is growing.The grid scale storage industry currently uses mostly lithium-ion based batteries, but I believe this will change. As the upcoming production ramp up of  comes to market, the total cost of grid scale storage  This should further increase demand for Fluence's products and services.Currently, most of the conversation within the industry is about short-term storage. As we further develop batteries more capable of handling medium and long-term applications, the storage market will find new demand.Fluence Energy is still transitioning from the introduction startup phase of the business life cycle into the growth phase. They are currently blessed with no long-term debt, and the low cost of solar should provide them with sustained tailwinds for years to come. I think their machine learning digital management packages have already proven themselves effective, and are probably one of the reasons the company is experiencing increasing demand. This company already has  11.2B in revenue waiting on them, and they are signing up more every quarter. Their margins have been improving and guidance is positive, so most of my remaining questions revolve around how quickly they can reach positive cash flow.Because of the disruptive nature of their technology, and their attractive long-term projected growth rate, I believe waiting to buy until after the company achieves positive cash flow may be a mistake.

Natural Gas Seems To Have Underappreciated Upside Potential,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Yahor Zaikou as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. It is not news that U.S. natural gas prices  are highly volatile. In addition to the usual cycles from overproduction to shortages in commodity markets, we are dealing with a commodity where the balance of supply and demand is so delicate that it can change dramatically even in response to single, hard-to-predict technical factors, such as the Freeport explosion last year. And, of course, natural gas price is highly weather-dependent, which apparently gives it an undeniable reputation as a widow maker.The analysis of natural gas supply andIn this article, by contrast, we will take a holistic approach and try to analyze the dependence of the price of natural gas on just one variable--how much gas is in storage. We will see how this dependence has changed in the past and try to look into the future.Below, you can see graphs of natural gas prices and storage surplus compared to the average of the previous five years. The first thing I noticed when I put these graphs together was that the words of natural gas producers' representatives that the current surplus will dissipate sounded even more convincing to me. This is not just an abstractly rational statement from the point of view of market laws, natural gas inventories have indeed always tended towards their average value, at least in recent years. At the same time, compared to production volumes, the deficit and surplus have never looked too large.The maximum surplus we see on the graph is produced in about a week, and the exports that have fallen due to an accident at just one LNG terminal in a few months exceed the current surplus. The market is constantly doing the delicate work of balancing itself.As you might expect, if one compares graphs of natural gas price and surplus, it is easy to see that they are related. Price minima were reached in 2016, 2020 and 2023 almost simultaneously with the maximum surpluses. This year's price minimum was higher than in the previous two cases, but the surplus was also slightly lower this year, so this year's price minimum fits nicely into the series of previous price minimums.At the same time, we see that the moderate supply deficit in 2022 coincides with much higher prices compared to previous years. To make sense of this, let's take a look at the graph below, where prices are shown as a function of the natural gas storage surplus. While what we see is far from a perfectly smooth line, the graph clearly shows that in recent years prices have depended on the surplus in one of two patterns shown in different colors.Until 2021, we have a flatter curve with a somewhat stronger rise in prices to  4 at the very left side of the graph when the deficit is at its maximum. Between 2021 and 2022, we have an impressive price increase to almost  10 even with moderate deficits. The difference between the two patterns is clearly visible just when there is a deficit of natural gas in storage, while when there is a surplus, prices are in the same range. Perhaps the reason is that when there is a surplus, the market pays more attention to the production cost below which the natural gas output will be drastically reduced, which will quickly bring the surplus to zero. The production cost apparently has not changed radically in recent years, in the sense that it has changed less than the statistical spread of the values on the graph. Anyway, the market is now in surplus, and we can't tell from this graph whether the later paradigm is continuing or whether we are back to the earlier pre-LNG paradigm. There is another way to find it out, we will come back to that later.It is important to note that although the temporal boundary between the two patterns is arbitrary to some level, in order to clearly separate the points, the border had to be drawn in 2021. In other words, well before the beginning of problems with Russian gas supplies to Europe due to the war and thus the paradigm shift that led to the emergence of the later pattern can hardly be explained solely by panic. It seems that between mid-2019, when the period of natural gas deficit in the market ended, and early 2021 when the deficit returned to the market something happened that changed the response of natural gas prices to its deficit in a big way, namely, it led to much higher prices. What exactly happened  I think the correct answer is that during this time period the amount of LNG exported from the US doubled, increasing by over 5 bcf d. As you can see in the graph below this was the period of the fastest growth in LNG exports in history and I have not found any other events of such magnitude in the natural gas market to put forward an alternative hypothesis.Also, from 2021 onwards, there has been a period of high prices in global LNG markets and there is a great temptation to attribute the high US natural gas prices to the impact of external prices due to the globalization of the natural gas market. In practice, it is not that simple. A very common and reasonable counterargument is that if LNG terminals are operating at full capacity for the U.S. natural gas market, it doesn't matter how much natural gas costs in Europe or Asia- it won't be possible to increase exports. But first of all, although I'm not an expert, I'll allow myself to speculate on the following topic. From my observations of export volumes, I can assume that LNG terminals have some freedom in how much gas to deliver at a given moment--- a bit more or a bit less. The monthly export high as seen in the graph above was reached in April of this year at 12,6 bcf d. This is quite significantly higher than in many of the recent months when Freeport was either already operating or still operating, i.e. nominal liquefaction capacity was the same as it is now. And all this time it was thought that export capacity was fully utilized. The market may believe that higher prices on global markets can lead to a 1 bcf d increase in supply  a value that seems reasonable based on the chart below , which is not a negligible amount. Such an increase in exports alone would bring the entire current surplus to zero in about 7 months. Second, whether or not the global market's impact on the U.S. is justified, it is definitely there, and has been for a number of years. Will it suddenly come to an end, given the fact that in the coming years we will see an increase in LNG exports and, as a consequence, a move towards the already undeniable globalization of the natural gas market  I doubt it.Importantly, the futures market also seems to believe that prices will continue to follow the trajectory from the later pattern, and thus we continue to be in it. As shown in the graph below, starting in 2025 the futures market predicts average annual prices just above  4. It makes sense that the futures market assumes that there will be a zero deficit on average for each of these years, because the market is effectively seeking balance.If so, then futures prices are consistent with the later pattern. The price-vs-surplus graph shows that natural gas prices near zero surplus are clustered around  4 for the second pattern, while the corresponding prices for the first are around  3.The main conclusion of this article is that during the next period of natural gas deficit, prices are likely to rise much more than the market currently expects. How far we are from that period-- depends on many factors, those are described in the introduction. The main one is the weather. In addition, such a forecast itself implies an increase in price volatility, not a decrease. Therefore, buying decaying financial instruments like  and  does not seem like a good idea to me, despite my bullish position on natural gas.I think it is better to buy shares of natural gas producers. However, the attention should be paid to their financial strength and their low production costs, which can ensure that the company will safely survive the period of low prices, if it lasts for some time. I also think it is important to pay attention to how a company hedges natural gas prices. The less hedges, the more upside in my opinion. For this reason, if I could only own shares of one natural gas producer, I would choose Antero Resources . But that is a pretty risky approach. Do your own due diligence.

Livent: Lithium Boom Or Bust? Analysts Are Rightfully Bullish,"The , one of America's largest lithium producers, is currently down 20  year-to-date. It has lost close to 60  of its value since its peak above  35 last year.In this article, we'll take a lookWe'll also discuss the risk reward as analysts continue to believe that LTHM is poised to doubleGiven its financial numbers and longer-term opportunities, I absolutely agree with that.So, let's dive inThe Livent Corporation, originally known as FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp., was established in 2018 as an independent companyThe company, whose roots go back to 1944, is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and specializes in the production of various lithium compounds, with a focus on high-performance lithium products.These compounds are essential in applications such as electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy technologies.As we can see in the overview below, Livent's core products include battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, butyllithium, and high-purity lithium metal.Additionally, Livent offers specialty lithium compounds such as lithium phosphate, pharmaceutical-grade lithium carbonate, high-purity lithium chloride, and specialty organics.In order to grow its business in an industry critical to supplying much-needed materials for the energy transition, the company has a growth strategy built on four pillars, two of which stand out to me.As the overview above shows, Livent has its first customer agreement with Ford for the delivery of up to 13,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year over an 11-year period.The company also announced a proposal to merge with Allkem, creating a leading global lithium chemicals producer.The merger offers increased scale, vertical integration, and growth opportunities.As of 2Q23, key milestones have been achieved, including regulatory notifications and applications and a preliminary S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC.Livent and Allkem shareholders are expected to vote on the merger in the fourth quarter of 2023.Almost needless to say, Livent anticipates significant growth in the electric vehicle market, driven by increased consumer awareness, government incentives, and the need for carbon reduction.Having said that, it's not an undisrupted uptrend for miners.The Wall Street Journal said it best when it wrote an  with the title on October 17.The article mentioned that one of Livent's peers, Albemarle , recently walked away from a  4.2 billion deal to acquire Australian lithium miner Liontown Resources.This decision was influenced by several factors, including a declining lithium price, financial concerns, and strategic considerations. The lithium price has plummeted from  66,000 per metric ton in 2022 to around  27,000 by October 2023, impacting revenues of the entire industry.One big factor is weakening Chinese demand.China's lithium market is adversely affected by weak consumer and business confidence, as well as an ongoing property crisis.EV sales growth in China decelerated to 37  in the second quarter, in contrast to the global average of 50 .Consequently, Chinese lithium carbonate futures have plummeted by approximately 37  since their introduction in July, leading to a substantial 35  discount compared to lithium hydroxide futures in the United States.After all, Chinese demand accounts for 40  of lithium demand.Although Western lithium prices are also under pressure, they receive some support from battery metal buyers in countries like South Korea and Japan, who aim to benefit from tax incentives tied to President Joe Biden's climate bill.Nevertheless, the decline in lithium prices may persist.  to Citigroup, lithium carbonate and hydroxide prices could drop another 15  to 20  in the near term due to weak demand, high inventories, and improved supply.During its 2Q23 earnings call, Livent commented on these developments, highlighting that lithium prices have stabilized at more sustainable levels after reaching historic highs at the end of 2022.The floor price is estimated to be above  30 per kilo in China, with the expectation that it will continue at this level through 2024.While there may be price spikes due to supply and demand factors, underlying market fundamentals remain tight.As a result, the company reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance, projecting revenue in the range of  1.025 to  1.125 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of  530 to  600 million.This guidance implies significant revenue and EBITDA growth compared to 2022, driven by higher volumes and average realized prices despite anticipated higher costs.On a longer-term basis, the company should continue to benefit from a widening supply gap, especially if rising cyclical demand meets a strong secular bull case.It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet. Analysts expect the company to lower net debt to  9 million this year, followed by a decline to  54 million in net cash at the end of 2024. This means that the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debt.As I mentioned in the introduction, LTHM's stock price has come down crashing. However, analysts still believe that the fair value is in the lower- 30s range.While I wouldn't be surprised if these targets were to come down a bit if the company hints at potentially prolonged weakness in the industry when it reports its earnings on October 31, we're dealing with a very attractive risk reward.Looking at the chart below, we see that the company has had a normalized P E ratio of 46x since it became an independently traded company.We also see that the company is expected to grow its earnings per share by 14  next year, followed by 3  growth in 2025. Needless to say, these numbers can be much higher if lithium prices rebound. They also can come in lower.Currently, Livent is trading at less than 9x earnings. Even a return to a 28x multiple in 2025  incorporating the aforementioned expected growth rates  could result in an annualized return of 77 .A higher valuation and higher expected growth could significantly improve that potential return.While I absolutely believe that the stock's fair value is more than 100  above its current stock price, we're dealing with a very tricky situation.Further cyclical weakness could easily cause this stock to drop another 10  to 20 .So, whenever we're dealing with high-return, high-risk investments, I make the case that the best way to deal with this valuation is to buy gradually and keep positions small.If you believe that lithium is right for you, I would start very small and gradually add to the position.In a scenario where LTHM keeps dropping, investors can average down. If LTHM rallies, investors have a foot in the door.I believe this is the best way to deal with a very favorable long-term investment opportunity that faces shorter-term cyclical risks.In light of the risk reward, I give LTHM a rating.But then again, if you mainly invest in low-volatility dividend growth stocks or similar, While Livent has faced a turbulent year, with a significant drop in stock price, there's an intriguing upside for investors who can navigate the cyclical risks.With a focus on lithium, a crucial component in EV batteries and renewable energy tech, Livent's growth strategy, capacity expansion, and commitment to next-gen compounds show promise.Despite the recent decline in lithium prices, Livent maintains a stable financial position and anticipates long-term growth opportunities.The stock is trading at an attractive valuation, offering a potentially high return, but it comes with a risk, considering industry uncertainties.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

The 2020 bottom was a spike low during the beginning of the pandemic that caused a tidal wave of selling in markets across all asset classes. For over three years,  800 has contained selloffs on the downside, with the price remaining below the  1,300 level. While  1,050 is the average level, platinum futures have spent most of the time below the  1,000 per ounce level.The May 2023  2,072 high on the nearby COMEX gold futures contract was a double top formation as the futures reached precisely that level in March 2022. The failure to reach a higher high led to a correction that took the continuous gold futures contract below  1,810 per ounce in early October 2023.Gold fell, reaching a low on October 6. The October 7 terrorist attack in Israel caused gold futures to turn higher, rallying to nearly  2,000 in late October and probing above that level on the nearby December futures contract.A close above  1,950 per ounce on October 31 will establish a bullish key reversal on the monthly gold futures chart, which could lead to new record highs above the  2,072 technical resistance level. Gold is the leading precious metal. While platinum's nickname was  for decades because of its rarity compared to gold, it has not lived up to that moniker in a decade.The platinum-gold spread measures the relationship between the precious metals.The chart of continuous NYMEX platinum futures minus the continuous COMEX gold futures shows platinum's premium rose to a record high at over  1,200 per ounce in 2008 when platinum prices peaked. Since then, platinum has lost its luster versus gold, with the spread making lower highs and lower lows. At around a  1,075 discount for platinum under gold on October 26, the spread is sitting near a record low, and the bearish trend remains intact, with platinum underperforming gold for the past decade and a half.In September 2023, the  reported a 2.2  larger platinum supply deficit than previously expected for 2023 at a record one million ounces. Growing requirements and flat supplies drove the shortfall between supply and demand.Catalytic converter, jewelry, and glassmaking demand has grown 27  to 8.2 million ounces in 2023, while supply remains at 7.2 million ounces, the same as in 2022. Platinum supplies have not increased because of ongoing electricity shortages in South Africa, the world's leading producer.The WPIC expects automotive and industrial consumption to deplete above-ground stocks in 2024, likely increasing the fundamental deficit next year. Meanwhile, the price action tells us that investors have ignored the supply-demand deficit, with platinum sitting just above  900 per ounce on October 26.The chart highlights the bearish pattern of lower highs and lower lows over the past months. Since peaking at over  1,100 in May, platinum futures fell below  860 per ounce. The price was not far above the low in late October as a stable U.S. dollar, and the rising interest rates have weighed on the price. This week, the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures fell to the lowest level since 2007. Higher rates increase the cost of carrying commodity inventories. The dollar is the international pricing benchmark for most commodities, and platinum is no exception. A higher dollar increases the cost of platinum in other currencies, weighing on the demand.Meanwhile, investors have shunned platinum despite the fundamental deficit. Trend-following traders have no reason to purchase the metal, given its bearish trend and underperformance compared to gold for years.The total annual platinum production of 7.2 million ounces equates to 224 metric tons.As the chart shows, South Africa produced 62.5  of the world's platinum in 2022, with Russian output accounting for 9 .The bifurcation of the world's nuclear powers, the wars in Ukraine and Israel, and tensions between the U.S. Europe and China Russia may only exacerbate platinum's supply shortage in 2024. While China is the leading platinum-consuming country, Europe and the U.S. are second and third. Since over 70  of the world's annual platinum supplies come from BRICS countries, the tensions could lead to supply disruptions or even trade embargos. BRICS countries are moving towards a BRICS currency, challenging the U.S. dollar for cross-border trade. Sanctions on Russia and trade restrictions on China have caused them to seek alternatives to the U.S. currency. Since China is the world's second-leading economy, a BRICS foreign exchange instrument could diminish the U.S. dollar's reserve currency role. When it comes to platinum, the tight fundamentals and production from BRICS countries may only exacerbate supply concerns, leading to higher prices.Moreover, platinum is a thinly traded precious metal. On October 25, COMEX gold's open interest was 467,547 contracts, representing 46,754,700 ounces worth over  93 billion at  1990 per ounce. NYMEX platinum's open interest at 81,905 contracts reflects 4,095.250 ounces worth  3.72 billion at  908 per ounce. The 2022 annual gold mine supply of 3,100 metric tons was 13.8 times higher than platinum production.The bottom line is that platinum is a thinly traded futures market, which could lead to significant volatility if the price turns higher. Low liquidity creates an environment where prices can rise or fall to illogical, irrational, and unreasonable levels that defy fundamentals. While platinum has been under pressure for years, the potential for a sudden and violent upside move remains a clear and present danger, given the supply-demand equation, BRICS production dominance, and gold's price appreciation.If platinum will resume its previous position as ,  the current price is a bargain. Risk-reward favors the upside, making platinum highly attractive in the current environment.The most direct route for platinum investment is via the physical market for bars and coins. However, physical platinum investment involves significant premiums to the spot or futures price because of the limited supplies.NYMEX futures are another investment avenue as they converge with spot prices during delivery periods as the exchange offers a physical delivery mechanism. Each NYMEX contract contains 50 troy ounces of platinum.The fund summary for the   statesAt  83.14 per share on October 26, PPLT had around  870 million in assets under management. PPLT trades an average of 68,729 shares daily and charges a 0.60  management fee.I continue to be a very frustrated platinum bull. However, I will add to long positions on further price weakness as the fundamental deficit, and BRICS production dominance is a potentially bullish cocktail for the metal long overdue for an explosive rally. Leave room to add, as picking bottoms in any market is dangerous. Platinum is cheap compared to gold, and its low liquidity could make a rally over the coming months and years explosive.The  is one of the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from a top-ranked author in commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,"  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of one-time expenditures.  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins. Therefore, there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business. That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders. Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard. Therefore, the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies. This should be expected when there is no formal standard. That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an  apples to apples  comparison.Obviously, the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made. But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown above.Rising prices of commodities should help that forward progress. But so will the transition of cash-using assets to cash generating assets.Longer term, the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company. That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products. Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances, this demands a flexible manufacturing process.The  be thought of as a starting point. The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitability.The main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity. Some products like asphalt, could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted product.Others, like gasoline, can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that  holds up better  during times of weak commodity prices  during a cyclical business downturn cycle .This process will likely take years  rather than happen overnight . That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions. Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time, this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happening.The other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production. This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary. Sometimes, the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required. Therefore, using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply source.Long term, there is still a very clear need for more refining capacity.As can be seen above, there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production. Clearly, management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing, or they would not produce it in the first place.But long-term, enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities. Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities. But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organization.While the company has made considerable progress, there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits process.In addition to the previous discussion, management plans to grow upstream production. While that makes downstream production expansion capabilities a priority as well, it does mean that this management has a full plate of future growth projects  on the table.An integrated company often means that growth in place often implies growth elsewhere to optimize profits.What this appears to point towards is high single-digit growth rates for the company well into the future. Now that the company is far larger than it was when I first initiated coverage, the initial frantic growth rate will give way to a growth and income strategy for the foreseeable future.That means total annual returns from growth will likely decline. But the increased safety of an enhanced downstream division will remove some of the corresponding risk to achieve what management likely believes is an acceptable proposition to Mr. Market.There are other possibilities in the offshore and overseas business. But probably the most attractive idea is for the unconventional business  or conventional depending upon the area  to find condensate that can be used by the company to make the oil produced flow through the pipelines. If this happens and is successful, then it would eliminate a major purchase from outside suppliers.Management has at times mentioned the need for condensate and wants to explore the acquired acreage for more products than the current natural gas production. But there is no guarantee of success. The speculative upside for shareholders would be company supplied condensate as a major cost reduction.Cenovus Energy Inc. management has done very well, as quarterly cash flow is up something like 16 to 32 times  depending upon commodity prices for the quarter  since I began coverage of this company about 5 years ago. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done.There is also a potential foray into the Chemicals business that many diversified giants have.The very low stock price valuation protects against the threat of downside principal loss over the long term. It should be noted that Mr. Market really has yet to give the company any credit for the larger downstream operation. This company is a strong buy consideration because the upside potential from all those acquisitions far exceeds any downside potential at the current price.As long as Cenovus Energy Inc. grows, I intend to hold the stock until the story changes materially. However, the volatile trading price does allow for a lot of trading opportunities along the way. So, there are likely to be a lot of ways to make money. With the currently low market valuation, the odds are in your favor.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

UAW Strike And Saudi Oil Cuts Are The Fed's New Inflation Nightmare,"August CPI and retail sales numbers  this week, signaling a new phase in the Fed's battle to bring down inflation. Adding fuel to the inflationary fire, United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain has declared a simultaneous strike at theHonor, trust, and respect are key in some aspects of life. Labor negotiations with Corporate America are not one of them. All that matters with union negotiations is leverage  Enter Shawn Fain, bulldog leader for the United Auto Workers union. Negotiations over the past year show that labor unions in key bottlenecks of the economy have been able to demand eye-popping deals with companies. Airline pilots demanded and , the Teamsters grabbed a deal to push UPS  driver pay in five years, and  and  have threatened strikes as well to renegotiate pay packages. This ramps up the pressure on the UAW to go big or go home in its own negotiations.So what's going on here with these huge pay increasesThe fact that major unions are demanding and getting large pay increases speaks to the amount of damage that has already been done to the purchasing power of workers. In the 1970s in particular, these kinds of wage demands led to inflation by creating what's known as a wage-price spiral. Now it's interesting to see these coming back in a big way, including the UAW's  to price increases.The UAW chose to begin by striking roughly 13,000 workers here, with the implicit threat that they can double down a couple of more times without depleting their strike fund. Their tactics are sharp here because they can virtually guarantee that they'll cost General Motors , Ford , and Stellantis  billions of dollars in lost profits either way. It's quite possible that the UAW could win the battle but lose the war, as the Big 3 auto manufacturers are not the most competitive globally and have a poor track record of handling change.Key parts of the American manufacturing economy are not competitive with Mexico, China, and Eastern Europe. As such, unemployment should naturally be a good amount higher than it is now. To keep this from happening in the post-2008 world, industry in the US and parts of Western Europe has been propped up by tax cuts, subsidies, and rock-bottom interest rates. Now inflation is taking this option away, which is likely to lead to a more difficult process of reeducating and retraining workers to be competitive in the 21st century. Elon Musk's Tesla  is competitive globally, but  than the union workers make, and the unions are demanding a 40  raise.The UAW striking here will directly increase inflation because they're walking off the job when they would be making cars. In the short run, this means consumers are likely to have fewer choices of cars and will face higher prices. This directly complicates the Fed's inflation fight, which has relied partly on used cars dropping to bring overall consumer prices back towards target. Also notable is how poorly stocks have performed after getting crushed by unions in negotiations. UPS stock is lagging the market by roughly 30 percentage points this year, while American Airlines  is lagging by more than 10  with the flight attendant union looking for a new deal as well. My guess with the automakers is that the union will get a surprisingly good deal, or will strike long enough to punish the stocks anyway. I'm less certain that the UAW is prepared for the shift to electric cars, many of which will be made overseas or in more employer-friendly jurisdictions like Texas.The Saudis are ramping up the pressure with supply cuts, and it's working. Oil fell from its highs of around  120- 130 per barrel when the economy slowed last fall and stocks entered a bear market. Now, supply cuts have WTI oil back into the  90s. One way to think about this is that the Biden administration wants oil as low as possible for the 2024 election and that the Saudis want it as high as possible. The Saudis won the first round in 2021 and 2022, but the Biden administration won the second with a warm winter in the US and Europe and the Inflation Reduction Act bringing optimism about the supply chain. The results of the third round remain to be seen, but it's going to be very difficult to escape higher oil prices in the short run if Saudi Arabia doesn't play ball.This is a huge challenge for the Fed. Though the Fed targets core inflation with its policies, the August CPI report showed that transportation services rose 2  for the month, the biggest rise of any category outside of energy  Transportation services are part of core inflation, underscoring the risks of another inflation surge happening under our noses. Does the increase in transportation services have anything to do with the Saudis driving oil up and labor unions in the transportation sector dropping the hammer  You bet it does. Oil has been higher in the past, especially when adjusted for inflation. The current surge in inflation has occurred without out-of-control oil prices. Imagine how bad prices for all kinds of goods and services would be with oil at  150. This isn't my current base case, but history shows that it's possible with war or supply cuts. If you believe  showing continued growth in oil demand over the next few years, this is going to be a structural problem for prices.Due to the base effects from last year and higher energy and transportation costs, inflation is increasing and getting further from the Fed's 2  annual target. Adding a prolonged strike at the automakers is not helping the cause, calling into question the market's belief that the Fed is most likely done hiking interest rates.The Fed has more or less boxed itself in from hiking in September by public comments various Fed speakers have made in recent days. For year-end, is showing that the Fed has roughly a 60  chance of staying put, vs. a 40  chance of hiking more. The Fed had already said they would hike once more in 2023, so traders will get more information about this from this week's meeting.  the Fed is still behind the curve by trying to do the minimum. The 30 30 Taylor Rule model runs in my latest calculations are calling for at least one more hike. What should the Fed do at this week's FOMC meeting  My guess is that they'll hold interest rates steady, but signal a hike in November and a higher level of interest rates and inflation for 2024 in their .The European Central Bank  the ECB  indicated that they're likely pausing hikes this week, and markets reacted mechanically by dumping the euro and panic-buying US stocks. However, what the ECB is really saying with their actions is that they're concerned about how deep the coming recession will be and are trying to limit the damage. This is likely why the panic buying completely reversed itself on Friday, while yields continued to grind higher. Over in Japan, they're struggling with inflation as well, and recent moves to relax their interest rate controls are . If the BOJ hikes interest rates and abandons yield curve control, that cuts off another key source of money that's helped hold interest rates low.The Fed is in the same quandary as the ECB. Union negotiations at home and oil prices shooting up mean that the economic models are probably right and that the Fed can't simply pause and pray. They'll need to hike one or two more times to avoid losing control of prices, even into early signs of a moderate to severe recession. 30-year mortgage rates are creeping towards 8  in the US, while car loans are moving towards 7 . It's hard for interest rates to go down with stubborn inflation and deficits as big as they are, and there doesn't seem to be any appetite to raise taxes or cut spending. I don't think the economy is going to handle this very well at all.Inflation was supposed to be gone by now, but recent data shows that  back to the upside. With labor trouble at home and the Saudis cutting oil production abroad, the Fed likely will have to tighten a bit more to balance supply and demand. This comes as leading economic indicators continue to worsen amidst rates for mortgage and auto loans hitting fresh post-2008 highs. That's bad news for traders expecting a Fed pivot and a corporate profit boom. The stock market remains overvalued. Therefore, I'm still firmly in the camp of holding money in cash paying 5.5  and waiting for a steep correction or crash in stocks before doing any significant buying. While there are always a few good deals in any market, the broad market indices look increasingly overvalued.

This Is Why You Should Stay Bullish,"One year ago, I advised investors in this report not to be bamboozled by conventional thinking. Most economists and market strategists were convinced that the rapid rise in short-term interest rates from the zero bound to what is now more thanThe fault in this line of thinking was failing to recognize that we are not in a typical business cycle. The combination of the pandemic, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, and the war in Ukraine over the past three years resulted in extremes in supply and demand that required us to step outside the box of conventional thinking. Regardless, the pessimists have dug their heels soFriday's jobs  for August was another step in the direction of a soft landing. We saw a continuation of slower job growth  187,000 , easing wage inflation, and an uptick in the supply of labor, which increased the participation rate. This is music to the Fed's ears in its effort to restore price stability without ending the ongoing expansion in the economy. The increase in the unemployment rate from 3.5  to 3.8  was largely due to new entrants in the workforce.The pessimists are already pointing to this increase as a warning sign that a significant stock market decline and recession are on the horizon, but they are again failing to recognize the strength of the foundation to this expansion and bull market.It makes sense to assume that when interest rates go up rapidly, consumers will spend less on goods and services, businesses will spend less on equipment and expansion, corporate profits will decline sharply, and unemployment will rise meaningfully enough to result in an economic contraction. The anomaly that helped us avoid this fate one year ago when inflation was more than 9  and interest rates were starting to rise was an unprecedented amount of excess savings held on consumer balance sheets. Bearish forecasters failed to appreciate the potency of this phenomena. It was the fuel that kept real  inflation-adjusted  consumer spending growing, which is why we avoided a recession.Now that excess savings has fallen closer to pre-pandemic levels, those who failed to recognize its significance are asserting that consumer spending will collapse under the weight of the lagged impact of higher interest rates. Again, a logical conclusion, but one that fails to recognize a new development long in the making.Earlier this year, I forecast that we would see a return to real wage growth just as excess savings no longer became relevant. To that point, last week's jobs report showed average hourly earnings growth of 4.3 , which is in excess of the latest Consumer Price Index figure of 3.2 . That is helping to soften the blow of lower savings levels and softer wage gains, but it does not explain economic resilience in the face of higher interest rates. Today's resilience is due to the fact consumers and businesses are far less sensitive to rising borrowing costs than they have been in the past.For all the concern about overleveraged consumer balance sheets, household debt as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product has fallen from more than 100  during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 to a two-decade low of 77 . This is a result of more responsible lending standards and more reasoned consumers.In addition, there has also been a dramatic decline in the amount of after-tax income required to service outstanding debt. The debt servicing ratio fell from a record high 13.2  to an all-time low during the pandemic, and it remains near a multi-decade low of 9.6 .The decline in outstanding stock of debt is the reason that the 500 basis points in rate increases by the Fed over the past 18 months only resulted in a 1.5  increase in the percentage of disposable income required to service that debt. This is helping to sustain consumer spending levels, and prolong the expansion, but it isn't just the consumer who is less sensitive to changes in monetary policy.Corporate debt has seen similar . The stock of outstanding corporate debt as a share of GDP at 43  is not far from its 2008 peak of 45 , but as a percentage of corporate net worth it is at a 50-year low. Additionally, the debt outstanding is predominately fixed rate and longer term with average maturities ranging from four to 10 years, depending on asset class. The percentage of investment-grade debt maturing after 2028 has risen to 56 , while the percentage of high-yield debt is up to 42 . This means that corporate America is also less sensitive to rising interest rates. In fact, the Fed's rate-hike campaign has been a windfall for most sectors of the S P 500 , because net interest costs as a percentage of post-tax profits have collapsed.During the ultra-low interest rate period from 2020-2022, corporations refinanced outstanding debt at fixed rates for longer terms in the same way that homeowners refinanced mortgages. When the yield curve inverted, due to the surge in short-term rates, corporations started earning huge sums on their cash balances in the same manner that retail investors are profiting from money market funds. This is boosting corporate profits and helping to fuel capital spending, as net interest costs have plunged to a 60-year low.Those who remain pessimistic will chant  higher for longer  when it comes to the Fed's monetary policy, which they assert will end the expansion and send the S P 500 to much lower levels than we see today. I could not disagree more for the reasons I have outlined. Consumers and corporations are far less sensitive to rising interest rates than they have been in the past. With the Fed's rate-hike cycle having likely concluded, and the disinflationary trend intact, a soft landing is looking more probable with each passing month. Estimates for corporate profits in 2024 are inching upward. I expect the S P 500 will achieve new all-time highs in the coming 6-12 months.Lots of services offer investment ideas, but few offer a comprehensive top-down investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense.

"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy","On April 20, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHere's a part of my takeawaySince then, the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 , beating the S P 500 by 300 basis points.Now, it's time for an update. Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks, updating my bull case, but we've also seen a confirmation of my thesis.After breaking out in July, crude oil futures are back at  90. That's despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growth.In this article, I'll discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so important.So, let's get to itLike every other commodity, oil is all about supply and demand.The supply picture is what worries me  meaning, it could cause high inflation for many years to come  because major basins in the U.S. are running out of steam.After the Great Financial Crisis, U.S. shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time  especially after 2014 . In 2007, the U.S. produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures  horizontal drilling . Now, that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot. It even annoyed U.S. producers, as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crash.So many smaller players went bust in the past few years.Now, things are changing. U.S. shale is running out of stream. We're not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth. Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves. They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacks.They have learned their lesson - especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of business.As the chart above shows, shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic. The only basin with growth left is the Permian  the big one .Even that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24.With the U.S. losing pricing power, OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerful.One of the reasons why oil is back at  90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC  mainly Saudi Arabia . Saudi Arabia wants to protect  80 Brent at all costs. It also seems to be willing to defend  90 Brent, given that they announced an extension of the cuts.Because of the supply squeeze, we're dealing with an increasing supply shortfall, pushing up prices.We can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here. While I'm obviously not a political insider who knows what, for example, the Saudis are up to, I can imagine what they are doing here.Looking at the chart below, we see that crude oil storage levels in the U.S. are way below anything we've seen over the past five years  and before that .Including the strategic reserves, reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longer-term average. Also, we're going into a major election year. I doubt Biden - or any Democrat - wants to buy back oil in this environment.Having said that, demand developments are also favorable.As reported by  on September 14, forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascent.The International Energy Agency  IEA  projects a record-breaking 102.2 million barrels per day for this year, with a relentless climb to 105.7 mb d by 2028.Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 7.5 mb d until it peaks in 2040.What's interesting is that the IEA  do not confuse this with the EIA  isn't  that  bullish. Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028.They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025, as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuels.According to Bloomberg's David Fickling, we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil - despite the overall positive demand picture of fossil fuels.Having said that, I agree with the outlook that fossil fuel demand isn't peaking. I do not believe that we're anywhere close to a peak, as we're at the start of massive growth in the middle-class population of India and various African nations.While India will make sure to build a future with less dependency on foreign energy  learning from China's mistakes , I do not see a scenario where oil demand turns into a headwind - ignoring cyclical recessions that happen occasionally. I'm talking about the bigger picture.OPEC also issued a  on September 14, reacting to the IEA's outlook and comments.Allow me to share a few quotes from OPEC's letter. I will add emphasis and my own view on things.OPEC is 100  right here. While suggesting that we could peak demand may very well be a wrong thesis, actively pushing for fewer investments in oil and gas is a serious issue. We're currently finding out what happens when rising demand meets slower supply growth. The middle class  and everyone below  gets squeezed.I often make the case that I am not rooting for high energy inflation. Although I have close to 20  energy exposure, my main concern is the protection of my portfolio, as elevated inflation is generally bad for the stock market.That's also why I'm writing this article.Lastly, I agree with OPEC when it comes to alternatives.I've been a number of times on Dubai-based Asharq TV, where I discussed energy policies. My point has always been to use the proceeds from fossil fuels to build alternatives. We should NOT cut reliable sources before we have good alternatives.That's the biggest mistake we're currently making.Putting all things together, I'm bullish on oil. While I do not rule out potential recession risks that could push oil down  20 to  70, I'm a buyer on major weakness, protecting my portfolio against what I believe will be a long-term uptrend in crude oil. I believe that triple-digit dollar prices are likely, which could come with a second wave of inflation - especially if the Fed is forced to cut rates at some point.While I do not own XLE, I believe that XLE is a great way to hedge against energy inflation without having to take on elevated risks.Incepted in 1998, XLE is one of the oldest ETFs on the market. It has a 0.10  expense ratio and a quarterly dividend. The current yield is 3.6 , which is mainly driven by Exxon Mobil and Chevron , who account for roughly 40  of this ETF.Furthermore, as the overview above shows, investors get access to refiners as well. The ETF also includes providers of energy equipment and services.This provides some diversification.Despite not having the benefit of owning tech stocks, XLE has outperformed the S P 500 by roughly 450 basis points over the past 12 months. This includes dividends.Although XLE could be a bumpy ride if we enter a recession, I expect XLE to keep outperforming the S P 500 for many more years.The energy sector is experiencing a remarkable transformation, and the signs point towards a sustained bull market in oil. Recent developments, such as declining U.S. shale production growth and OPEC's strategic output cuts, have set the stage for higher oil prices.The supply-demand dynamics are shifting in favor of oil, with supply shortages pushing prices upward. Contrary to predictions of peak demand, global crude oil consumption continues to rise, driven by factors like India's rising middle class.While there are differing opinions and biases in the energy debate, one thing remains clear  energy stocks, like those in the XLE ETF, offer a solid hedge against inflation and a potentially long-term uptrend in crude oil prices.Considering XLE's history, low expense ratio, and diverse holdings, it presents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to benefit from the energy sector's resurgence.In my view, oil is poised for triple-digit prices, and XLE stands as a reliable vehicle to navigate the energy market's opportunities and uncertainties.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Vonovia: Potentially Rewarding Due To Macro Tailwinds,"Note  All amounts in the article are in EUR. At the current exchange rate, 1 EUR is around 1.05 USD.In line with the German real estate sector, Vonovia   has seenI have been buying up German real estate companies since early summer, which was a contrarian move. I am a big believer in this approach. When everybody seems to think everything is bad and can only get worse, it is   not always, but very often   a good time to start buying. I was also following the discussion on Seeking Alpha on German real estate stocks and found the arguments of the bulls much more convincing. However, I am grateful for the bearish articles because they gave a balanced view.I started investing in almost every publicly listed German real estate company of a reasonable size which was not too dependent on new real estate development. I now think it is time to look at companies with significant exposure to new real estate development, too. I thought it was still too early a few months back, and it seems this was the right call.I ended up with a large position in Vonovia, Grand City Properties , and Aroundtown  AANFF . I did not intend to have a large position in Aroundtown. The company has significant exposure to commercial real estate and is the largest shareholder of Grand City Properties. As I own Grand City Properties too, it creates a cluster risk, and I generally see commercial real estate at the moment as riskier than rental real estate. However, the stock has gone up more than 90  since I started buying, so my Aroundtown position is now sizeable, too.I have a smaller position in LEG Immobilien  and did own TAG Immobilien , but I have already sold those shares. My position was small, and TAG Immobilien went up too quickly over a short period, so I did not buy more. I usually build up positions over several weeks or months, and sometimes longer, if the investment thesis does not play out as I think it should, but I am still convinced it is correct.In total, this investment in German real estate companies is among the best ones I ever made, and additionally, it played out in a very short timeframe. While I went in with conviction in the beginning, I admit it was not with a lot of research. It is now time to evaluate what the next steps are.Conventional analysts are not much help here   in my view. When I started buying there were Sell ratings with the target prices 10-30  above the share price. JP Morgan issued a Sell rating for Vonovia at the end of March with a target price of 18 euros. The share price was around 15 euros at the time. It is not much better now. Recently, Baader Bank  a German broker and investment bank  repeated its Buy rating for Aroundtown with a target price of 1.15 euros. The last time Aroundtown traded at or below 1.15 euros was in July, and it is already over 2 euros now. So, there is a lot of confusion around German real estate companies, at least among analysts.I did a deeper dive into Vonovia as this is my largest position, and I now think that I will be holding on to the stock for maybe one or two more years. Once the interest rates environment turns, Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds. I expect the share price to go back to 30 to 40 euros  where it was just a year ago , a further upside of 40-80 .Vonovia owns 550,000 rental apartments. Almost 90  of them are in Germany, around 40,000 in Sweden, and 21,000 in Austria.Housing construction in Germany is doing miserably. There is already a significant supply demand imbalance, and it looks like it will get worse. According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt  Federal Statistical Office   almost 28  fewer building applications for apartments were issued between January and July this year than in the same period last year. For single-family homes the numbers are even worse  building applications for single-family homes were down 36.5  YoY.The reasons for the lack of new housing construction are obvious  increased financing costs due to interest rate developments and high construction costs because of inflation.The official goal of the German government is to create 400,000 new housing units every year, to cope with the demographic development. This is not even that ambitious. Since 1950, when the German Federal Republic was founded, on average . In 1995, 602,800 new units were built, but in 2022, only 295,300. It looks like 2023 and 2024 are going to be even lower.Vonovia benefits disproportionally here. Firstly, . Secondly, growth mostly happens in  where Vonovia s apartment portfolio is concentrated. The top 7 large urban areas  Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, and Düsseldorf  account for more than half of the portfolio in Germany.The situation is so desperate that the local government of Berlin appointed a Commission on the  Expropriation of Large Housing Companies , in response to a public referendum in September 2021. It came back with the  that this would be legally feasible, although owners would need to be compensated. The  is that this has a next to zero probability of being executed, even if the legal opinion would turn out to be correct. This is not assured either. In 2019, the City of Berlin introduced a rigorous rent control law  called Mietendeckel , which was struck down by the German Federal Constitutional Court.Accordingly, Vonovia s vacancy rate in Germany is at a very low 1.9   it is 2.2  including the units in Sweden and Austria . The company has  due to rising construction costs and interest rates. Recently the  that this could continue into 2024.Compared to other countries Germany is a nation of renters   fewer than half of Germans own their own homes. Accordingly, tenant protections are strong. However, I find it hard to imagine a situation where the largest provider of rental apartments in Germany is not going to benefit from this supply demand imbalance in the long run. There does not seem to be a quick fix.I do not think this is reflected adequately in the share price yet. The EPRA NTA  net tangible asset value  per share was 49.67 euros at the end of H1, compared to a current share price of around 22 euros.A related topic is rent growth. Inflation and rent growth are strongly correlated but with a time lag. Vonovia s most recent investor presentation includes the following graph to illustrate the point.When inflation accelerates, rent growth initially lags because implementation is delayed by factors like regulatory constraints. However, rents are expected to grow faster and for longer once the inflationary pressure has subsided.In  the 12M rolling organic rent increase was  3.5 , compared to  3.4  in H1 2022  however, the rental EBITDA grew by 7.8  YoY due to reduced expenses and maintenance costs . According to management, it should reach between 3.6  and 3.9  by the end of the year.While accelerating, rental growth is still below inflation   for now, and it looks like this could change sooner rather than later. In September 2023,  slowed to 4.5 , significantly down from August when it was still 6.1 .Vonovia has three core debt KPIsDue to the write-downs in Q1 and Q2, the LTV is now 47.2  and Net Debt EBITDA multiple is at 16. The only KPI above the target is the ICR, which was 4.7.So, Vonovia is breaching two out of the three KPIs.While this is not great, I would argue that Vonovia has managed the downturn reasonably well so far.The company has enough liquidity, and all debt maturities are covered until the end of 2024. But It will need to refinance  or pay back  around 4-5bn euros of debt every year between 2025 and 2030. An investment grade credit rating and a revolving credit facility of 3bn euros  which was extended until 2026 in Q2  should help, but I assume that further disposals are necessary. In its , Vonovia says it is working on a JV in Northern Germany with a fair value similar to the sold Südewo portfolio   so around 1bn.Vonovia usually pays out 70  of Group FFO as a . As is common for German and European companies, this is once per year. To preserve liquidity, the payout was halved this year, but the dividend yield was still around 5  at the payout time in June.Most other German real estate companies skipped their dividend this year, so Vonovia stands out. The cash out was further reduced to around 373mn euros as the company has a scrip dividend program in place, and 45  of shareholders took advantage of that. For reference - the total FFO was 1,944mn in 2022 and 948.6mn so far in H1 2023  -9.5  YoY .As Vonovia has breached two of its debt KPIs this year due to the write-downs, a dividend payout next year is not assured, even though there would be ample room for one given the expected FFO. However, management is still guiding for a 70  payout. The expected FFO per share for the full year is 2.15-2.39 euros. So, the dividend yield would be between 6.8  and 7.6 , based on a share price of 22 euros.Even if a dividend payout does not happen, investors should keep the scrip dividend in mind. It is a nice way to avoid the German dividend withholding tax. The process is bureaucratic for retail investors, and from my own experience, I know it can take up to two years. For that to work, investors should not buy the ADR shares.As earnings were negative in H1 2023 due to the write-down, it is better to look at funds from operations to see how the valuation looks compared to the operational performance. FFO per share was 19.14 in H1 2023, so around 9.5 on an annualized basis. This is not expensive, and significantly below the historic average of around 20 over the last 5 years from 2018 to 2022.But it is in line with other German rental real estate companies. LEG Immobilien comes to 20.36  based on the H1 FFO , and TAG Immobilien to 19.64. Only Grand City Properties is lower with 15.71.The companies are also comparable regarding their NTA values per share compared to the share price, while all have a low number. Vonovia is at 0.45, LEG Immobilien at 0.46, TAG Immobilien a little higher at 0.53 and Grand City Properties again lower at 0.34.The difference in valuation is because Grand City Properties has appreciated much less YTD than the other three.My takeaway here is that Vonovia's valuation will probably only improve in line with the real estate sector and real estate prices. Once the macroeconomic environment for the sector improves, I think shares will go back to a range between 30-40 euros. So I intend to hold at least until shares reach 30 euros, and I realize that this could take at least one to two years.I own both Vonovia and Grand City Properties, but my position in Vonovia is larger. This is because of the difference in company size and the resulting difference in risk. Vonovia is part of the German DAX index and has a market cap of 18.39bn euros, Grand City Properties is much smaller with just 1.75bn.The biggest risk is the interest rate environment. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the investment thesis is still correct, in my view. As I consider the long-term macroeconomic environment favorable for Vonovia, it will just take longer to play out.A further need to write down the value of its assets is another risk. This would be bad for the share price, but Vonovia also has an additional covenant risk on its debt.The need for further write-downs could arise if prices go down more, but it is also possible that there is already a mismatch between what Vonovia thinks its assets are worth currently and what the real market prices are.This does not seem to be the case though. Vonovia has written down the value of its real estate portfolio by around 11  since the peak in June 2022. This looks to be at least in line with where market prices went. According to the numbers from , which are based on actual market transactions for new and existing buildings, prices have declined by an average of 9.9  in that period. There are regional differences, so Destatis segments the numbers into five categories, from rural to larger cities  where Vonovia has most of its apartments . In the top 7 large urban areas  Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, and Düsseldorf  prices for apartments fell by 9.8  in Q2 2023 compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Therefore, I think the depreciation Vonovia applied to its portfolio is adequate and gives maybe even some cushion.That does not mean prices cannot go down further. However, the downturn in Q2 2023 was already significantly weaker when compared quarterly  compared to the first quarter of 2023, residential properties were 1.5  cheaper  in the two previous quarters the QoQ decline was significantly higher at 2.9 and 5.1 , respectively.In the  from September 28  so quite recently  Vonovia says it is too early to give an H2 valuation guidance, but notes that based on the Q2 valuation there is a 25  headroom for compliance with bond covenants  not considering any positive impact from further rent growth and disposals .My takeaway here is twofold. First, prices can go down further in the short term, but probably not significantly. Second, it would take a very drastic macroeconomic shock for prices to go down a further 25  and for Vonovia to breach its debt covenants.Longer term, the dynamics of supply and demand point to rising prices, and rising rents.Once the interest rate environment turns, Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds. This could not happen in 2023, but I assume sometime in 2024.We have seen the share price above 50 euros in the past. However, I do not think we will get there anytime soon again. Those prices were driven by basically free money and those days are over for now. However, I expect that over the next two years, the share price could go back to 30 to 40 euros where it was just a year ago, an upside of 40-80  from where the shares are now.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cautiously Bullish Oil,"For the most part, indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish - as they have been for much of this year.On the term structure front, both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures. Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports, reduced production of Saudi heavy sour crudes  which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline  and a number of other factors, the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardation.Meanwhile, WTI calendar spreads  represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole. The EIA's  historically noisy  estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning, but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen. Regardless, the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at present.We can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above, as well as looking at refined product crack spreads. As we can see below, gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks, while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firm.Clearly, the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated, a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.Such dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand, whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages. Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present, having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline, or to reduce runs, thus reducing the amount of crude they consume. This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market. After all, refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oil.Thus, all else equal, unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm, it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the  95- 100 area in the near future, particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lower.Though, as we have seen, outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil. Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic, with the Dubai-Brent spread  a proxy for Asia China oil demand  continuing to trend lower overall and near parity.While the various Africa-Brent crude oil differentials also remain strong. This is an important relationship to track, as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell off.While the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight, we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September. Indeed, if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages, the picture has now turned unfavourable, as we are seeing far more builds than draws.In terms of commercial inventory levels overall, total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages. Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages, as do diesel stocks. The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present. For me to once again become uber bullish  though I remain cautiously bullish , persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the norm.In terms of the outlook for supply and demand, consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4, though to a lesser extent, prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024. Although such forecasts are full of assumptions and thus fraught with error, it is worth noting what the EIA, IEA, OPEC and others are expecting in terms of production and consumption. For now, consensus is expecting a 0.5-1 mb d deficit to close out the year, which if true, will show up in persistent inventory drawdowns as well as the key indicators of the physical market, which to me are far more reliable indicators of the outlook for oil. When it comes to positioning, this is unfortunately where things take a bearish turn.All good bull markets in energy are driven by low levels of speculative positioning  i.e. hedge funds and CTAs  who are then forced to cover shorts and drive prices higher on the back of favourable fundamentals. This is exactly what has occurred since speculators were caught heavily underweight crude oil around mid-year, thus providing the fuel for much of the subsequent rally from  70 to  95 crude.Now, despite a significant level of unwinding of speculative longs in RBOB gasoline and ultras low sulfur diesel  ULSD  futures, hedge funds and CTAs remain heavily long WTI futures, a dynamic which will prove a material headwind for oil. This is not to say speculative positioning cannot become even more extended, but the fundamentals need to be significantly bullish for them to do so.From a technical perspective, however, it is difficult to argue that recent price action remains favourable for bulls. We continue to see a trend of higher highs and higher lows, with the  90- 92 level now acting as key resistance. Should we fail once again to break through this level, then I suspect this is the market telling us how high the ceiling is for oil prices for the time being. But, as it stands, price action remains constructive and a break above  92 for WTI should usher in  100 crude in short order.The same can be said of the energy equities, with the XLE ETF  continuing its relative strength and very much looking like it wants to break out above the  93 level which has acted as key resistance for over 12 months now. Again, a decisive break to the upside would be telling in relation to the future movements in the energy space.On the other hand, it is also worth noting we are now entering the worst seasonal period for oil prices in the final few months of the year. The Northern Hemisphere's summer driving season is behind us, although it must be said seasonal swings in demand have had very little impact on price movements this year, as supply shortages have been the primary market driver.

Could We See $100 Oil In 2023?,"Goods things finally appear to be happening for energy bulls. After languishing in mediocrity over the first half of 2023, oil prices now appear to be recovering and could well be setting up for another leg higher. WTIAs it stands, the fundamental outlook for the market appears quite constructive for the second half of 2023, and, should these bullish factors remain in place, a rally to  90 bbl or even as high as  100 is not out of the question.Starting with the physical market, crude oil inventories have flirted with both builds and draws for much of the year - giving little fundamental signal in theThis was the largest weekly drawdown of US crude oil inventories since the data was first recorded in 1982. And, as we can see below, not only does this appear bullish on an absolute basis, but also on a seasonally adjusted basis.For crude oil, analysing inventory changes and inventory levels provides a decent real-time proxy for the supply and demand dynamics within the market. Should this record drawdown be a sign of things to come, this bullish turn in inventories should continue to support prices for the months ahead.In similar fashion to changes in inventory levels, the shape of the crude oil futures curve provides valuable insight to the ongoings within the physical market.Although the actual prices of the various futures contracts are themselves not useful predictors of future prices, the shape of the futures term structure does provide valuable information into the underlying fundamentals of the oil market, and is another excellent indicator of the status of the physical market. GenerallyAgain, similar to inventories, the term structure has provided mixed signals for much of the year as it has flirted with backwardation and contango.As it stands, the curve now resides in firm backwardation across the board, though not the same degree as was seen during 2021 and early 2022. Nonetheless, this remains a bullish outcome for now, as the market looks to be becoming increasingly tighter as we enter the second half of 2023.Prompt and longer-dated time spreads are also confirming this dynamic. Both are sitting firmly in backwardation and confirming the recent move higher in WTI.Meanwhile, US crack spreads for refined products such as diesel, jet fuel and gasoline have all also moved higher in line with the recent rally in crude, thus confirming the tightness in the market as indicated by the backwardated term structure. Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined products.From a positioning perspective, everyone and their dog has been either short or bearish oil for quite some time now, so there has been  and remains still  plenty of scope for a sustained positioning driven squeeze higher.Indeed, the managed money component of the futures market  i.e., hedge funds and CTAs  recently had their smallest exposure to oil in almost a decade as recently as early July. And, while their buying activity has fuelled much of the rally thus far, there remains plenty of scope for speculators to drive prices higher still.Likewise, total speculative positioning as a percentage of open interest remains close to favourable contrarian levels despite the recent rally.In terms of the supply and demand outlook for oil, it appears we could see deficits return to the market throughout the second half of the year  if they are not already present . Though I view their forecasts with a grain of salt, the EIA s projections suggest global demand will exceed production by 0.98 mm b pd deficit in Q3 followed by an additional shortfall of 0.38 mm b pd in Q4.Similar projections are being made by commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, who  suggesting a  Likewise, the IEA have also recently revised upward their demand forecasts, and now predict a 1.7 mm b d shortfall through 2H23.While demand overall still lags its pre-COVID trend, it has recently hit an all-time high. As  by Bloomberg s Javier Blas,  Whether we like it or not, it continues to look increasingly apparent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar lack the efficacy, efficiency and base load capacity to replace fossil fuels, so it stands to reason peak oil demand is still likely decades away.On the supply side, Saudi Arabia have confirmed they will extend voluntary production cuts through September, this puts the cumulative effects of Saudi s total production cuts over the past year or so at around 3 mm b d, meaning their overall production is now around 9 mm b d, below their estimated maximum of 12 mm b d. Meanwhile, Russia have also suggested they plan to cut exports by 300,000 b d by next month, after already agreeing to reduce exports by 500,000 b d in August.It seems increasingly the case Saudi Arabia have now positioned themselves as the world's swing producer of crude oil, given the lack of investment in US shale of late. This is likely a dynamic the Saudis will continue to leverage in the short term, as they have hinted that current cuts could be extended or even deepened. While Saudi Arabia s production cuts are largely responsible for the supply shortfall, we are likely to see throughout the second half of 2023, such supply shortages - coupled with reasonably strong demand - suggest the market will remain tight at least through the next quarter.From a technical perspective, the picture has improved dramatically this past month. WTI looks to have broken out of its downward ascending wedge pattern that has been slowly developing over the last year, whilst also breaking through key moving averages. As it stands, the  82 level looks to be key resistance for now, and whether or not we can break through this level will be very informative as to how sustainable any potential 2H23 rally can be.From a seasonality perspective, the outlook remains favourable for the next quarter.On the whole, the outlook for the oil market over the second half of 2023 looks quite bullish. Market technicals, trend and seasonality look to be taking a turn for the better, while fundamental indicators of the physical market such as the term structure, inventories and crack spreads also look to be leaning toward the bullish side of the equation.Ultimately, there appears plenty of scope for higher prices in the coming months. But, while I remain very bullish oil over the long term and expect to see prices reach mid-triple digits at some point in the future, I am skeptical that this will occur in 2023.Indeed, there are a number of factors at play which could put a ceiling on prices in the medium term. For one, as discussed earlier, much of the supply shortages seen in the market today are a result of Saudi s numerous production cuts. Should prices spike to the  90- 100 bbl level, it seems likely they will once again ramp up production to take advantage of these higher prices. What s more, while Chinese oil consumption has disappointed this year, we have seen the Chinese work to significantly increase their commercial and strategic stockpiles in recent months, and history suggests they could release these barrels onto the market should prices rise sufficiently. And finally, while the economy remains robust for now, the  for economic growth continues to appear subpar, which may or may not impact demand in late 2023 to early 2024. Either way, the second half of the year looks to be an existing one for energy bulls. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",27,2023-08-05T09:15:00.000-04:00
"Phillips 66 Vs. Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not","In the last 60 days, the refining segment has seen strong gains. So much so, that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface. After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads, the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels. However, all refiners are not created equal. In fact, when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US  Marathon, Valero, and Phillips 66 , you will find three different business structures.In this article, I will discuss two refiners, Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole, the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic. Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry . We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic. The pandemic's sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop, and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat. This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners. These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 12-18 months.Since greenfield refineries aren't exactly appealing in the public eye, and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry, the industry has shifted its investment focus. The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefits.To that end, several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits  more on that later  for producing renewable diesel. Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the works.As with most things, the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes. Currently, the EIA projects the 3-2-1 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024.Does all of this point toward the demise  or at least regression  of the refinery sector  Let's dive in to VLO and PSX to find out.VLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of  46 billion, just a bit smaller than PSX  50 billion . VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7,000 gas stations nationally. VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment. The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plants.When I look at Valero's , I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology, the Green Diamond Diesel brand, and ethanol production. These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal  possibly negative  economic value. As with any renewable initiative in an investing format, the measuring stick will always be how much 'green' it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineries.Below you will find Valero's Q2 10-K report. You can see that after impressive growth from 2022's numbers, the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12  of the companies operating income, up from approximately 5  in 2022. While not an overwhelming number, it is certainly a contributing factor to the company's bottom line.In my opinion, the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels' potential. To get our facts straight, I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves. The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data, is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining, although at much smaller volumes. Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon, we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involved.Diamond Green Diesel is VLO's brand for renewable diesel. In the 4th quarter of 2022, VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port Arthur. The premium generated by this product results from the multiple credit sources the government has established to spur its production. As shown below the price of RINs, LCFS credits, and BTC credits all play into the margin generated by DGD.It is important to note that currently LCFS credits are only offered in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington and thus the addressable market is relatively small. The pricing mechanism for these credits is affected by the number of 'credits' produced by low carbon sources and the number of credits 'consumed'  i.e. penalized  by high carbon sources. Therefore, this pricing mechanism could deteriorate as more renewable projects come online and replace high carbon fuel sources.More detail can be found at the The remaining price mechanisms for renewable diesel are the  and the   BTC . Both of these programs are administered at the federal government level. Similar to LCFS credits, RIN credits fluctuate based on supply and demand that is created by government established criteria.From the graph below  right side  you can see that the entire monetary value of renewable diesel is based purely on government subsidies with the feedstock costs significantly exceeding the selling price of the basic diesel commodity  Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD . Ultimately, dollars are dollars so I choose not to judge the source. It is important however, to understand the origination of profit.The ethanol group is by far the smallest of the three segments. But Valero has big plans for the small unit, again intending to capitalize on the government's various incentive mechanisms. It intends to do this via the combination of LCFS credits and by connecting the ethanol plants to a CO2 sequestration pipeline.VLO plans to connect eight of its 12 ethanol plants to a common pipeline to support CO2 capture. This entitles the company to the  invoked by the Biden administration. The 45Q tax credit is expected to contribute an additional  0.25 per gallon uplift when the pipeline enters service in late 2024. This credit, combined with the LCFS credits pose to significantly boost the profitability of the ethanol group by roughly  100 to  300 million on a quarterly basis.Given all the above data there is certainly opportunity for Valero to continue to boost overall profitability based on various government incentives. However, given the general size of both the DGD and ethanol segments, this most likely will not be sufficient to sustain the company's current performance should crack spreads decline as we enter 2024.Therefore, I believe VLO will face downward pressure in the medium term. This is based on two assumptions.1. Additional renewable projects come online that reduce the value of government incentives. RBN Energy has a very detailed discussion of this risk in its series, .2. The gradual adoption of electric vehicles will erode demand  or at least hamper meaningful growth  for conventional transportation fuels. This will gradually reduce crack spreads over time. I don't believe the pace of the EV transition will be sufficient enough to pose any near term risk. I view this transition as gradual, becoming more impactful over the course of a decade.PSX has a slightly smaller capacity and retail presence than VLO, coming in at just shy of 2 billion BPD refining capacity with around 2,500 gas stations. What I like about PSX is its diversification and not relying solely on refining. In the chart below you can see that refining only accounts for about 50  of its income. The remainder is spread amongst its midstream segment, marketing, and chemical businesses.Globally, the transition to cleaner burning fuels centers around the use of natural gas  methane  and or similar natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, and ethane. Europe and Asia are consuming these fuels at an accelerating rate, with a large percentage of it being sourced from the United States. This is where PSX's midstream business shines.PSX recently completed the transaction to boost its  in DCP midstream to 86.8  at the end of Q2 of this year. Following the DCP acquisition, the company owns or operates 72,000 miles of pipeline to transport products such as crude oil, refined products, NGLs, or Natural Gas to its export terminals. This allows the company to extract profits at every phase of the value chain from the wellhead to the docks, making it ideal for energy producers to transport using the PSX system.I am extremely bullish on LNG and NGL exports beginning to ramp significantly over the next 12-18 months.  for liquefied natural gas is expected to come online by the end of 2024 with additional projects still in the pipeline. This initial wave of projects accounts for nearly a 75  increase in US exports.Increased demand for midstream services will allow for margin expansion. This will enable PSX to have a thriving secondary business that provides solid and dependable cash flows. More importantly, since midstream businesses are generally fee based with only slight commodity exposure, they can hedge against declining refining margins.In the first quarter of 2024, PSX is expected to start up the Rodeo Renewed unit which is a conversion of the original refinery into a renewable diesel unit. As mentioned earlier, in the current market this carries significant potential for high margin production. PSX targets an annual EBITDA of  700 million from this project once it is operational.This project will be important for PSX to meet its stated projection to return  4.5 billion to  6.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024. , I showed that even taking conservative numbers for the Rodeo Renewed project and factoring in a 40  decline in refining margins, PSX should still be able to beat the high end of their return package guidance.PSX has overall less exposed to pure refinery risks than VLO. This is mostly attributed to the presences of its midstream business in DCP which provides a powerful diversification tool.Additionally, PSX is on track to complete an extremely large renewable diesel project in Rodeo Renewed. As mentioned earlier this has the potential for very high margins in the near term. As with VLO, I do feel the renewable diesel industry may see margin contraction due new supplies coming online.Another important comparison point would be the overall health of each company's balance sheet. The table below shows a stark difference in debt cash profiles between the two.PSX clearly will have some debt obligations to tend to over the next several years that could rob meaningful cashflow unless refinanced out into the future. Conversely, VLO is sitting in a very solid position, with more than enough cash on hand to meet all debt obligations for the next three years with ease. VLO certainly has the edge in this regard.Source  VLO PSX Quarterly and Annual 10-K reportsObviously, the common risk to both of these companies is declining crack spreads. With several incremental projects coming online in the next several quarters it is possible crack spreads drop in response to the supply increase. In this scenario, the overall profitability of both companies would drop back to more historical levels.I believe PSX's current business structure helps preclude much of this risk by having alternative forms of income from its midstream business that is inherently stable. Further, the midstream business focuses on natural gas resources that is in high demand around the globe. This attribute is key to my thesis that PSX is a more stable long term investment than VLO.A secondary risk to both companies is declining government incentives to produce renewable diesel as several new projects come online. A reduction in incentives will clearly impact these high margin products as they are not economically viable without this aid due to high feedstock costs. Due to the relatively small volumes of renewable diesel, neither company has sufficient exposure at this time to dramatically alter the course of the business. However, any anticipated growth aspects would be muted in this scenario.In this article, we reviewed the operational differences between VLO and PSX. Despite both being large scale refiners, their business structure is significantly different with VLO almost entirely focused on refining and PSX diversified with midstream, and chemical segments. However, VLO does have an upper hand in its balance sheet and near term debt requirements.The BoA thesis surely has merit, but is more applicable to VLO than PSX due to the latter's diversification from refining. This diversification provides for a safety net should crack spreads drop over the medium to long term. I therefore, in spite of the comparably inferior balance sheet, find PSX to be a more desirable long term investment than VLO. Further, PSX should have sufficient cash flows to manage its near term debt obligations. I previously included PSX in my  for a look into how I view its purpose in a dividend portfolio.

Move over Federal Reserve. Investors eye refunding at U.S. Treasury,"This week's FOMC announcement on interest rates would typically be the big-name event for investors, but not this time around. While a Fed hike in December is up for debate, no one expects the central bank to raise rates this week, especially given recent To satisfy the federal government's borrowing needs, the U.S. Treasury Department sells many types of bonds that span popular 2-year , 10-year  and 30-year  securities, floating-rate notes, inflation-linked bonds and other types of debt with differing maturities.

Safe Bulkers: A Dry Bulk Shipping Value Opportunity,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Christos Kolorizos as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Safe Bulkers, Inc.  presents a compelling investment proposition, currently trading at a substantial 38  discount to its target price and 24  below its recent 52-week high. Notably, its P E and P NAV ratios significantly outshine those of industry peers. My Buy recommendation is underpinned by the company's robust financial health and enticing valuation. This opportunity is nothing short of substantial for value-minded investors seeking exceptional potential. I recommend considering an investment in Safe Bulkers for the long term, as the stock boasts remarkable prospects for significant gains.Safe Bulkers is a global dry bulk shipping company that specializes in the transportation of bulk cargoes, including grain, iron ore, and coal. The company maintains a fleet comprising Panamax, Kamsarmax, Post-Panamax, and Capesize class vessels. It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  under the ticker symbol  SE , and its corporate headquarters are located in Greece.The company currently operates a fleet of 45 dry bulk vessels with an average age of 10.6 years, including Capesize, Post-Panamax, Panamax, and Kamsarmax vessels. Given that the global dry bulk fleet age averages approximately 11 years, the company is in a favorable position. Additionally, the company plans to expand its fleet by adding five more Kamsarmax vessels by 2025. On October 6, 2023, the company announced that it had entered into contracts to acquire two dual-fuel Kamsarmax vessels, set to be delivered in 2027. These new vessels have been designed to meet EEDI requirements. The company's robust newbuilding program for fleet renewal has already delivered 12 new vessels since 2019, firmly establishing the company as a modern and forward-looking player in the dry bulk industry.According to BIMCO's  report, it is anticipated that global dry bulk cargo volume will expand by 1.5  to 2.5  in 2023 and by 1  to 2  in 2024. The expected increase in average haul for 2023, ranging from 0.5  to 1.5 , is primarily driven by sanctions on Russian coal and increased shipments of iron ore and grain from Brazil.In October, the International Monetary Fund  IMF  , forecasting a 3  growth rate for the global economy in both 2023 and 2024. While this marks a slight improvement from their previous forecast, it remains notably below the average annual growth rate of 3.7  witnessed throughout the 2010s. I would argue that the prevalent issue of inflation persists as a significant concern in several economies, necessitating central banks to undertake interest rate increases, a measure that has the potential to impede economic growth.The IMF has projected that China's GDP will experience growth rates of 5.2  in 2023 and 4.5  in 2024, surpassing the Chinese government's target of 5  for 2023. Nevertheless, since June, there has been a noticeable deterioration in China's economic conditions, leading to apprehensions. In response, several banks have revised their forecasts downward, with Barclays, in particular, , falling below the government's target.Global iron ore shipments are expected to grow by 2.5  to 3.5  in 2023 and 1  to 2  in 2024. In China, steel production has risen by 3.5  this year, driven by higher steel exports, leading to a slight buildup in steel inventories. However, weak domestic steel demand due to a decline in new real estate projects could further decrease demand in the remainder of 2023 and 2024. Chinese iron ore imports have exceeded steel production, with imports growing by 6.9  between January and July, potentially leading to some inventory rebuilding in China. Excluding China, global steel production fell by 3.3  between January and July, impacting iron ore shipments due to lower import demand from China and competition from Chinese steel exports. Additionally, steel production in regions like Japan, South Korea, and Europe faced challenges, including high energy prices and low domestic demand.China is one of the main drivers of the dry bulk market. As , Chinese stocks rose a report on October 11 that a . I think this will give the push needed for the country's construction industry, which is a positive sign for the dry bulk sector.As per the International Energy Agency's assessment, there is a potential for global coal demand to experience a 0.4  increase in 2023, reaching an all-time high, followed by a slight decrease of 0.1  in 2024. There is also a potential for continued growth in China's coal imports in 2024, driven by the cost advantage of imported coal over domestically mined sources. Furthermore, should India effectively enhance its domestic coal production, this has the potential to expedite the decline in global coal shipments during the same year.The anticipated expansion of the dry bulk fleet is forecast to be 2.8  in 2023 and 2.1  in 2024. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that supply growth may remain constrained at a range of 1-2  during both 2023 and 2024, primarily attributed to reduced sailing speeds. Due to this, fleet productivity is expected to decline by 1-2  in 2023 and 0.5-1.5  in 2024. I believe the dry bulk shipping market outlook for 2023-24 is mixed, with demand expected to grow slightly but supply also forecast to increase, albeit at a slower pace. This suggests a slight tightening of the supply demand balance, but I am concerned that a probable low-demand scenario could lead to a weakening of the equilibrium.Average dry bulk freight rates have been on the decline since the second half of 2022. In August, the Capesize segment was the only category to witness an improvement in freight rates compared to the previous year. This improvement was driven by increased volumes and average hauls in iron ore and bauxite shipments, as well as a modest 2.2  year-on-year growth in the Capesize fleet. In contrast, all other smaller segments saw rate reductions due to decreased grain volumes, limited growth in minor bulk volumes, and an average 3.5  year-on-year expansion of the fleet. Reduced growth in iron ore shipments and declining coal volumes are anticipated, which may negatively affect the shipping sector.With China being one of the main markets of the dry bulk segment, its recent slowdown has raised concerns for me. However, I am cautiously optimistic that the Chinese government's new stimulus package could boost demand for construction materials and support the dry bulk sector. Overall, I believe that the dry bulk shipping market is likely to remain challenging in 2023-24, but I see some positive signs, such as the Chinese government's new stimulus package and strong coal demand. In 2024, from my perspective, the freight rates may either hold at similar to 2023 levels, based on the supply demand balance.In the , the company experienced a 19  drop in revenues compared to the previous year. This decline was attributed to 30  lower time-charter equivalent rates and a larger number of vessels exposed to the spot market. EBITDA decreased by 38  and Net Income declined from  87 million in 2022 to  35 million in 2023. These results were primarily due to increased financing expenses resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in operating expenses due to inflation. Over the last 5 years, the company has also been steadily reducing its leverage, which currently stands at 60  based on the latest financial statements. Furthermore, the company's Net Asset Value  NAV  has been consistently increasing at an annual rate of approximately 10  over the past 5 years.Safe Bulkers is well-positioned to benefit from current market conditions. Although I do not expect to see a significant improvement in the market, as indicated in the analysis above, the stock still holds strong upside potential. In 2024, only 24  of the total fleet will be under contract, leaving the remaining 76  to be deployed on the spot market. In my view, earnings for 2023 are anticipated to be lower than those in 2022 due to lower spot rates and increased market exposure as a substantial portion of the fleet's time charters expire in September. However, in the short term, the  since the end of August. However, this increase is primarily supported by the , an expected cyclical upside for the Capesize segment, which has risen from below 1,000 points to above 3,000.Key Assumptions and Valuation Methodology  as of the valuation date, October 9, 2023  Enterprise Value  EV  is determined through a combination of the Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  method, Net Asset Value  NAV  analysis, and Market Multiples. These three methods are weighted at 60 , 20 , and 20 , respectively. The terminal value is calculated as the average between the EV EBITDA multiple and the Discounted Terminal Value, which is based on a 1  perpetuity growth rate. The Weighted Average Cost of Capital  WACC  is computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM , resulting in an average WACC of 11 .Market Multiples  The market multiples used for the valuation are drawn from comparable shipping companies that exclusively operate in the dry bulk sector.Cash Flow Projections  The valuation accounts for all cash flows until September 2028. In calculating revenue, two distinct periods are considered. Firstly, for the remaining months of 2023, current spot rates are used for uncontracted vessels. Secondly, for 2024 and beyond, freight rates are calculated based on the five and ten-year average 1-year Time Charter  TC  rates for each vessel type, amounting to approximately  16,000 per day, depending on vessel size. For any loans maturing before the end of the evaluation period, it is assumed that they will be refinanced at prevailing rates.The company demonstrates significant potential for an upward trajectory, with an estimated upside of 38  from the current share price. The rates used for the projection are slightly below the company's last reported average rates, as the revenue projections are based on the 10-year historical average.The current P E and P NAV ratios are 37  and 29  lower than the market average, respectively, when compared to peer dry bulk companies. This fact lends support to my  BUY  recommendation.I have examined and presented below various sensitivities of the stock price both on WACC and on the projected Charter Rates. Before investing in the company, please consider the followingValuation  I have employed my own assumptions for calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital  WACC . The addition of a  3  equity premium is a reflection of my personal judgment. It's important to note that the weighting of the methods used to calculate the Enterprise Value  EV  may vary. The historical rates used were obtained from . In addition, I sourced certain financial data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Wall Street Journal and Infront-Analytics.Shipping Sector Cyclicality  The shipping industry is subject to cyclical patterns, marked by periods of prosperity and decline. These cycles are influenced by the volatile nature of shipping rates, which are shaped by shifts in supply and demand. Significant drops in shipping rates can negatively impact Safe Bulkers' profitability. The market outlook considered in this analysis is based on BIMCO's Dry Bulk Outlook Report.Market Risk  Like any stock, Safe Bulkers is exposed to global market risk inherent in the equity market.Safe Bulkers is a compelling value play within the dynamic dry bulk shipping sector, offering not just potential, but a clear path to significant upside. The company's combination of a formidable fleet, positive earnings outlook, and an enticing valuation make it an attractive proposition, particularly for value-focused investors seeking long-term rewards.From my vantage point, what sets Safe Bulkers apart is its commitment to a modern fleet and a forward-looking newbuilding program, strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the forthcoming improvements in the supply demand balance across the dry bulk sector, extending until the end of 2024. Furthermore, the fact that Safe Bulkers is currently trading at a discounted valuation relative to its peers sweetens the deal, presenting an attractive entry point for astute investors.

Uber: Profitable For Now,"Uber's  business has finally achieved profitability, on the back of higher margin advertising revenue and a more favorable competitive environment. While the cost discipline demonstrated by the company in recent years is admirable, Uber must find avenues to support growthUber is currently facing a highly variable demand environment, with post-pandemic normalization leading to increased demand for mobility services, partially offset by a softening of demand for delivery. In addition, freight markets have been weak due to a decline in consumer spending on products and a supply chain bullwhip effect. Some of this demand variability should begin to even out in coming quarters, leading to a further moderation in headline growth.From a competition perspective, Uber's main markets continue to be dominated by two players, although competition appears to be easing. The rapid shift in interest rate environment over the past 18 months is likely at least partly responsible for the improvement in profitability in ride sharing. The increase in the cost of capital has caused ridesharing companies to pull back on spending.Lyft was not competitive on pricing, but this has changed over the past 12 months. Uber now believes that its pricing is generally comparable to Lyft's. Despite this, Uber's share of gross bookings continues to be at or .Much of Uber's current efforts are focused on providing a greater range of services so that it can maximize revenue and profits. For exampleThis portfolio of products is currently at an  gross bookings run rate and is growing over 80  YoY. Uber also offers a range of service levels that help with price discrimination, like Uber Black and Uber Comfort. Offering a range of products across price points should help to drive growth and profitability, albeit at the expense of consumer surplus.Uber's new products are also extending the company from its traditional ridesharing background into more general transportation services. Uber now offers high-capacity vehicles at a low price point through its Uber Shuttle service. These vehicles that can support  at a time, running on fixed routes and timings across several cities in India, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt. In the UK, Uber recently added the ability to book .Uber's growth is also being supported by a number of international markets  Germany, Spain, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Argentina, amongst others  which are providing high growth, with Uber referencing a pool of bookings worth around  growing over 100  YoY.Membership is another focus area for Uber as it promises to reduce churn and increase user spending. While this may be a near term headwind for the business, increasing user LTV CAC ratios will be critical driver of improved profitability in the long run. Uber One members are profitable, but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members. This is offset by the fact that  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50  greater than non-member retention. Uber currently has something like , with membership numbers doubling YoY, and around 25  of the company's gross bookings come from memberships. Uber is also trying to upsell monthly members to an annual membership.Advertising is another important area of Uber's business, as it provides an incremental source of growth and has high margins. Uber's advertising business currently has an annual run rate of over , with a 1 billion USD target for 2024. This appears to be a solid revenue stream as well, with Uber suggesting a return on ad spend in the 7-9x range. Most of the advertisers on the platform are SMBs, although Uber is trying to increase penetration amongst CPG companies, enterprise customers and companies like Apple. The economics of this business are not really known at the moment, and Uber is likely investing fairly heavily in attracting advertisers and developing its ad product, but it seems likely that growth of the advertising business is in large part responsible for Uber's transition to profitability.With its recent transition to profitability, Uber is having its moment in the sun, but investors should not forget that the transportation, delivery and freight markets are likely to face a serious shakeup over the next decade, with the rollout of autonomous vehicles gaining steam. It should also be noted that Uber's revenue likely follows a power law distribution across cities, meaning that only a relatively small number of important locations need to be disrupted by robotaxis for Uber's business to begin to struggle.AVs could lead to more riders, as it will lower mobility costs, but depending on how the market evolves, it could increase competition or result in Uber being disintermediated completely. Uber has partnered with Waymo, amongst other companies, and believes that it can be a routing layer between supply and demand, allocating demand to autonomous partners when it makes sense. This vision will likely require that the supply of robotaxis is fairly diffuse, with a number of competing service providers. If there are only 1-2 service providers, Uber is likely to be disintermediated. At this stage, it seems prudent to assume that AVs will be a fairly concentrated market. The technology is complex and the heavy reliance on data creates global economies of scale. There are also likely to be significant economies of scale involved in building and maintaining a fleet of vehicles, which supports the development of a concentrated market.The robotaxi threat is likely to take time to play out though, due to the complexities involved in developing the technology, regulatory uncertainty and safety concerns. Despite this, progress is being made, and appears to have accelerated in the last 1-2 years.  its fully autonomous taxi service city-wide in San Francisco, after being spun out from Alphabet in 2016 and initially offering services in a public trial in Phoenix in 2017. Waymo and Cruise both recently received approval from California's Public Utilities Commission to charge riders for autonomous rides without a safety driver, day and night. Cruise has announced testing in 14 new cities and is targeting 1 billion USD revenue in 2025. Seattle, San Diego, Miami, Nashville, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. Dallas and Houston are .A wider spread rollout of robotaxis is an interesting development, as it will provide a greater volume and variety of data, which should lead to improved performance. Commercialization also provides cash flow, which will help to support the development of businesses that have so far been a black hole for cash. For example, Waymo reportedly spent at least  on autonomous vehicle development between 2009 and 2015. This could also represent an inflection point in the market, as Cruise's CEO has suggested that the underlying technology is now adapting relatively quickly to new environments.It is also a risky period though, as the proliferation of robotaxis is raising awareness of both the pros and cons of the technology. If large scale data demonstrates adequate performance, the regulatory environment is likely to become more favorable. A wide-spread rollout could also lead to coordinated action on regulations. High profile incidents that anger the broader population have the potential to set the technology back though.A  of Waymo's autonomous vehicles led by Swiss Re suggested that they are safer than human-driven vehicles, supporting broader adoption of the technology. Based on over 3.8 million miles driven by Waymo without a human behind the wheel, there were zero bodily injury claims and a significant reduction in the frequency of property damage claims. Swiss Re believes that the results are highly significant but given a human driver baseline of 1.11 bodily injury claims per million miles, more data may be needed to be sure. In addition, it is likely extremely difficult to compile data for humans and robotaxis where the vehicles face similar risk environments, adding to uncertainty in any analysis.While the technology is improving, it has not all been smooth sailing for autonomous vehicles in recent years, with Cruise facing the ire of protestors, as well as scrutiny from incidents with pedestrians and emergency vehicles.  its Via self-driving truck ambitions, although the reason for this is unknown. A number of employees have been laid off and the timeline for commercialization has been pushed back. Waymo plans to continue working with Daimler on a driverless truck though.After a period of distortion caused by the pandemic, Uber's growth is rapidly approaching the single-digit level. Revenue increased roughly 14  YoY in the second quarter, down from approximately 29  in the first quarter. Between pricing, frequency and users Uber believes it can maintain double-digit growth though.Uber has stated that drivers are currently the . As a result, the company is trying to add more drivers and improve retention and engagement. Uber believes that labor environment is now looser than it has been, with around 70  of drivers stating that they're using Uber due to inflationary pressures.User growth is rapidly returning to its pre-COVID trend, with no real sign of a slowdown in sight. In Uber's developed markets, less than  aged over 18 have ever used Uber, potentially providing a significant growth runway.Average frequency is still down from pre-COVID levels, but it is difficult to know whether this is just due to a shift in the user base. Spend per trip is up significantly, which more than offsets the lower frequency.Take rates are up, although Uber's Mobility take rate is elevated by the UK merchant model, with the company stating that the underlying take rate in the , driven lower by supply investments in international markets like LatAm and APAC.Uber's profitability has been improving rapidly in recent periods, with the company having a . The improvement in profitability is being driven by a shift in revenue mix, operational efficiency and operating cost control.For example, algorithmic improvements have led to something like a  over the last year. The rapid growth of Uber's advertising business has also been a significant margin tailwind. Some of these improvements have been offset by weakness in freight and shipping markets though. Insurance costs are also significant for Uber and have been rising sharply. In response, Uber has  in certain markets. The merit of an investment in Uber at this point is heavily dependent on how much the company can increase its profit margins, and whether robotaxis begins to negatively impact the business at some point. If Uber can eventually raise its profit margins to the mid-teens, it would be fairly attractively priced at the moment. I think there is a high probability that a strong drive for margins will eventually result in consumer pushback or increased competition though.I also feel that over a 5-10 year timeframe there is a reasonable probability of autonomous vehicles beginning to negatively impact Uber's business, making an investment in Uber a high-risk proposition. While this view has a high chance of being wrong, I don't believe the stock offers sufficient upside to warrant an investment.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

OPEC Upate October 2023 And EIA International Energy Outlook 2023,"The   MOMR  for October 2023 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is September 2023 and output reported for OPEC nationsThe IEO reference scenario has a sharp drop in OPEC output of 5.5 Mb d from 2024 to 2026, an alternative scenario  OPEC-DC est  is presented which will be discussed after the OPEC part of the post.OPEC crude output was revised higher in August 2023 by 33 kb d compared to last month s report and July 2023 OPEC crude output was revised higher by 22 kb d. When the World was at its CTMA peak for C C output in 2018, OPEC crude output was about 31300 kb d and by September 2023 OPEC crude output had fallen to roughly 3545 kb d below the CTMA peak in 2018.Preliminary data indicates that global liquids production in September was 0.1 Mb d less than last month and averaged 100.6 Mb d. World liquids output increased about 2.9 Mb d in the past 23 months  from 97.7 Mb d in October 2021 .Preliminary August 2023 data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks down m-o-m by 11 Mb. At 2803 Mb, they were 82 Mb higher than the same time one year ago, but 117 Mb lower than the latest five-year average and 182 Mb below the 2015 2019 average. As World Oil stocks continue to fall the risk of an oil price spike will increase.There was a significant draw on World oil stocks in 2023Q3 of about 133 Mb, if OPEC estimates of World Supply and Demand for Oil are correct. A continuation of OPEC cuts in 2023Q4 could lead to another 300 Mb of stock draw if OPEC estimates for oil supply and demand are correct in 2023Q4.Now a quick discussion of the EIA s IEO 2023. The IEO reference scenario for World C C output has a sharp drop in crude output from 2024 to 2026 of about 3.3 Mb d, but this is not reflected in their estimates for demand for the main liquid fuels  gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and residual fuel . From 2021 to 2022 the ratio of these 4 liquid fuels in barrels of oil equivalent to C C produced was about 89 , but the ratio jumps sharply from 2024 to 2026 as shown in the chart below to over 93 .My alternative scenario  DC scen  for World C C assumes the ratio of liquid transport fuel to C C production rises gradually from 89  in 2022 to 91  in 2031 and then remains at that level until 2035 and assumes the quantity of liquids fuel demand is unchanged. My expectation is that after 2030 the demand for transportation fuel is likely to be lower than the EIA reference scenario, but I did not add that assumption to the DC scenario presented below. The OPEC-DC est presented in the second chart of the post simply subtracts the EIA s IEO reference scenario for non-OPEC C C output from the World C C- DC scen presented in the chart below. I also expect that non-OPEC output may be slightly lower than the EIA has published in the IEO 2023 reference scenario and that OPEC C C output will likely need to be about 30to 31 Mb d from 2025 to 2030 in order for World C C to match the DC scenario in the chart below.

Why Lithium Stocks Are Falling,"It has been a difficult year for lithium producers. Heck, it has been a difficult six months, with the past month tumbling most noticeably.WhyAs I wrote on aNew entrants and old have been plunging headlong into developing more sources of lithium around the world. At the same time, this new supply is coming online   1  Chinese auto sales have declined since the government removed the juiciest of subsidies  and  2  EV sales in Europe and the U.S. have been held back because of semiconductor shortages.  On a larger level, China ended almost all subsidies and tax breaks for green energy, which triggered an across-the-board selloff inMore supply   less demand   falling prices for lithium.As of today, here is the decline in lithium, with this month being either the beginning of the end for lithium or somewhere close to the panic point from which it is more likely to recoverIt isn t just lithium prices, though lithium is the poster child for the Battery Revolution. Any minor glitch in electric vehicle  EV  sales tends to create panic in the streets. For instance, EV charging equipment provider Beam Global  reported better-than-expected  recently. Sales came in at  17.8 million, up about 380  year-over-year. BEEM is still a micro-cap company, but it seems to be on the right track. Yet the stock opened the next day at  10.20 and closed at  9.05.General Motors  sales of EVs fell in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The first quarter marked the end of certain U.S. subsidies. Ford  recently reduced some of its growth expectations for EVs. This is the type of news that makes skittish people think,  The sky is falling  The sky is falling  No, it isn t.One 12-week period is not indicative of future sales. And this interruption in demand does not mean there is likely to be any pause in seeking new sources of lithium. There will be new technologies that make it more efficient, however.The first step in making Li-Ion batteries is getting the lithium. Lithium is extracted from three different venues  brines, pegmatites, and sedimentary rocks. How the lithium is extracted means very different project requirements, extraction methods, governmental regulation, environmental considerations, and processing times.Historically, lithium extraction from brine sources has been more economical than production from pegmatite or sedimentary sources. Living in Nevada, I am geographically close to the action in that Tesla s  gigafactory is just down the road from me, and Albemarle s  Silver Peak mine  the only producing lithium brine operation in the U.S.  is only a few hours away. Often, our local news will pick up a story well before the rest of the nation sees it. Such was the case for my earliest purchases of Lithium Americas .We do not know how much more lithium may be found in the USA   once upon a time, America produced the most of any nation. Those days are long gone, however. Now, most of the brine-evaporation sources of lithium are in different desert areas with dependable solar evaporation.These basins are called salt lakes, salt flats, or salars. Lithium  brine  deposits represent about two-thirds of worldwide lithium resources. The best known are found in the salt flats of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.Even though most of these reserve deposits are found in The Lithium Triangle of these three nations, Australia is the world s largest lithium producer in total output, with much of it coming from the Greenbushes hard-rock lithium operation. More on that later.Among many other lithium producers, I own shares of Livent , which produces lithium carbonate from a world-class lithium brine deposit in Argentina  the Salar del Hombre Muerto. Allkem , an Australian lithium producer, is ramping up production at a contiguous site. These two companies are currently jumping through various regulatory hoops to be able to merge their assets, making it an even bigger factor in brine-evaporation lithium.Bolivia is likely to have the globe s biggest deposit of lithium, the Salar de Uyuni, which might contain as much as between 50 to 70 percent of  known  world reserves. But the statist government of Bolivia, for now anyway, insists on government control of all activity   and the Bolivian deposits are more costly to refine and have a much lower evaporation rate, anyway.Geothermal lithium brine deposits have been much in the news lately. Lithium has been found in Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland as super-hot saline is spewed from geothermal sites. In this stew are also found good quantities of potassium, boron, lithium, and other elements.I have a personal connection here, as well, albeit from a more distant time. Back in the mists of antiquity, I was working my way through UCLA with a dozen or so different jobs. One of these was selling lots on the shores of California s Salton Sea. It never became the next Palm Springs  just up the road a piece , but I thought it had potential, so I scraped up the then-massive chunk of money --  1,000 -- to buy a 2.5-acre lot there.I would have done better placing my money in a 2  savings account and compounding it over the intervening period, but at least it has kept me interested in the goings-on down there. There is already significant work being done. The Hell s Kitchen lithium and power project looks to have an estimated 30-year life with a total lithium resource capacity of 300,000 metric tons -- MT -- per year of lithium carbonate equivalent. We ll see.Lithium brine deposits can also be found in some deep oil reservoirs in North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and East Texas. In fact, Standard Lithium  claims to hold a property  and a unique process  on the U.S. gulf coast containing more than 4 million MT of lithium carbonate equivalent resources.I find this interesting because the oil   gas drillers have significant seismic and 4D technologies already in place, -- as well as deep pockets. Is it possible we will one day get our lithium from these energy companies, as wellPegmatite is a coarse-grained igneous rock that is formed from crystallized magma. Pegmatite lithium deposits  also known as  hard-rock  lithium deposits,  often contain extractable amounts of not just lithium, but also tin, tantalum, and niobium. We most often find the most lithium where mineral spodumene dominates.Australia produces the most lithium from pegmatite deposits of any country. Australian lithium production is on fire, with numerous global mining companies elbowing for position. Canada, the US, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and even nations we do not think of as producing lithium, like Finland and Ireland, hold financially viable pegmatite lithium deposits.Hard-rock ore that contains lithium is extracted at open-pit or underground mines using conventional mining techniques. The ore is then processed and concentrated in a number of different ways to produce lithium and its compounds. This kind of mining is more expensive than using evaporative techniques like brine deposits. The good news is that hard-rock lithium deposits have higher lithium concentrations than brines, making them still economically viable. Also, producing tin, tantalum, niobium, and more can help offset costs.Sedimentary deposits account for a growing piece of the lithium pie. These are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites.  Lacustrine  just means that these are sedimentary rock formations that formed at the bottom of ancient lakes.In clay deposits, lithium is typically found in hectorite, which is rich in lithium, but also in magnesium.  The name hectorite comes from a deposit first discovered in Hector, California.Many companies are in the research and development phase for their clay deposits, but no companies currently produce meaningful lithium from them.The most commonly known form of lithium-containing lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia. This deposit is owned by another company in my portfolio, one which is not often thought of as a lithium producer  Rio Tinto . RIO says it believes this deposit likely contains more than 200 million MT of lithium, which would make it one of the largest lithium deposits anywhere.In January 2022, after Anglo-Australian RIO had committed to pay more than  2 billion to execute the project, Serbia revoked its license. The ostensible reason was public protest over environmental concerns. It probably did not help matters that Australia deported Serbia s favorite son and tennis star Novak Djokovic for failing to comply with Australia s Covid-19 protocols. We shall see if one day royalties to Serbia become more important than other issues.Another example of sedimentary deposits is, yes, yet another of my  future energy  holdings, Lithium Americas. I have written early and often about the trials and tribulations of trying to extract lithium in this litigious United States of America. I first followed LAC as I read reports of the numerous lawsuits to protect  the environment  in my local newspapers.  The Lithium Americas site, Thacker Pass, is a couple of hours northeast of Reno, my nearest airport gateway.I find it curious that the voices most demeaning of nature s batteries  fossil fuels  who demand that we replace these forms of energy immediately with  green  sources are also the loudest in protesting our best opportunity to do so. LAC was sued in court by various First Nation tribes, by farmers and ranchers, and by all manner of organizers and followers from outside the area. These lawsuits went on for years.If we want green energy, we must understand that lithium does not grow on trees, that the sun does not shine 24 7, and that wind turbines are composed of all sorts of metals and materials that must be dug from the ground then, at the end of their useful life, disposed of by returning much of the dangerous materials with which they are built into the earth and atmosphere. TINSTAAFL.Possibly  bringing closure to this farce is the decision just this week between LAC, General Motors, which has agreed to off-take some  600 million of LAC production, Bechtel Construction, and North America s Building Trades Unions for the Thacker Pass project, which will now hopefully tap into the largest deposit of lithium in North America.If you ask me what lithium prices, and thus lithium companies, will do this week or this month, I haven t a clue. Since China removed incentives to buy electric, EV sales there are down. That says there is less demand, so prices may stay depressed. On the other hand, if governments or regulators or protesters dead set against disturbing Mother Earth -- from Serbia to Bolivia to the USA   prevent adequate supply, while demand increases, then the shares of lithium producers will rise again.I cannot say that a rebound will be immediate. I do believe the tale of Lithium Americas, having exhausted all opposition all the way to the 9 Circuit Court   yes, the 9 Circuit    may create enough precedent that other firms might not face the same uphill battle.I don t know exactly when the supply demand balance will create the momentum to resurrect these companies  share prices. But I am 100  certain that the balance will shift. When it does, earnings will increase or explode. When that happens the same people now selling  because they are going down  will be anxious to buy  because they are going up.I prefer to eliminate those middle steps. I own and am continuing to add to my holdings in the very best lithium producers. If you want some history, there are scores of articles written on SA about these firms. You will also find a half dozen or so that I have written, detailing in greater depth my belief in every one of these.

I Might Double My Pioneer Natural Resources Investment - Again,"I doubt it's a surprise to any of my regular readers when I say that I've been bullish on oil for a while. In this case, I turned bullish on oil in 2020, as I expected a significant shift in supply andEssentially, my thesis has been tightening supply growth and consistent long-term demand growth. The end of the U.S. shale revolution, OPEC cutting output to protect  80 Brent, and geopolitical risks are putting a floor under oil prices.Even the mighty Permian basin in the United States, which is the only driver of unconventional oil supply growth, is now losing steam.The most recent report showed that declines in legacy production are now more than offsetting production gains from new wells - natural gas remains in an uptrend.If we get peak productionThis is what long-term oil demand might look likeTo prepare for such a scenario, I have bought 19  energy exposure, which I expect to increase even further.I'm not rooting for elevated inflation. I just want to be prepared. After all, if I'm right, we could see a development that is negative for the market, in general. This would also apply to a lot of my other holdings.The chart below reinforces my view, as investments in oil supply remain well below levels that would support rising demand growth. This is inflationary, especially if demand comes roaring back.Given the shift in supply dynamics, I believe that upstream oil companies  the ones that drill for oil  are the best way to get the job done.In this case, I focus onOne company that checks all boxes is .On May 14, I wrote an  titled .That's exactly what I did, as the company now accounts for more than 5.3  of my portfolio.In this article, I went with a bullish title again, as I want to consolidate my energy holdings. I'm looking to shift some money from Chevron  into PXD purely because I prefer its aggressive shareholder distribution plans.While I haven't made a final decision on the CVX to PXD shift, I'll also deploy new capital, as I believe I need to own more oil.And what better way to buy oil than via PXDSo, let's dive into the detailsWith a  55 billion market cap, PXD is one of America's largest onshore oil producers. In the second quarter, the company produced roughly 370 thousand barrels of oil per day. It also produced 341 thousand barrels  48  of equivalent.It has a 0.5x net leverage ratio with a BBB  credit rating.The company exclusively produces its oil in the Permian basin, where it achieved industry-leading efficiency.For example, the company not only achieved higher-than-expected production in the second quarter, but it is also capable of boosting output with subdued CapEx.In the second quarter, the company raised its production guidance for the year while reducing the capital budget allocated to drilling, completions, and facilities.The oil production guidance midpoint is now 369 thousand barrels of oil per day, and the revised drilling, completions, and facilities capital budget is  125 million lower than the initial 2023 outlook.This adjustment was attributed to the efficient execution of well-productivity and operational activities by its teams, leading to a more capital-efficient program.The company's investment framework remains aligned with moderate annual production growth of up to 5 .Furthermore, the company's 2023 average well productivity significantly surpassed both 2022 and 2021 levels over the first 24 months of production.According to the company, its focus on full-stack development enhances long-term recovery and optimizes returns.Essentially, the company's substantial inventory of low-breakeven, high-margin locations positions it favorably compared to peers. With roughly 15,000 top-tier locations, Pioneer believes it is set for best-in-class development in the years to come.While it isn't visible in the chart below, the company has more than 20 years' worth of top-tier drilling, which surpasses any of its major peers.But wait, the good news continuesThe company is also getting better access to export markets for its natural gas. In the second half of this year, the company expects to sell 70  of its gas out of the basin. Next year, that number is expected to be 80 , thanks to new pipelines leading to the Houston Ship Channel.In 1Q23, the company received 19  higher prices for its gas than its peers.In general, it has much higher cash margins. In 1Q23, the company had cash margins close to  37 per barrel, exceeding any of its major peers.Thanks to these efficiencies, the company believes it can generate  27 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next five years at  80 WTI - that's the current oil price.27 billion is 49  of its current market cap. At  100 WTI, that number rises to  40 billion  73 .I'm adding the implied free cash flow yield because the company has a very ambitious capital return plan.The company aims to distribute at least 75  of its free cash flow to shareholders through its base dividend, the variable dividend, and buybacks.At  90 WTI, the company has the potential to achieve a double-digit return yield, which would be great for income-focused investors.On a long-term basis, I expect investors to benefit from total annual dividends exceeding 10 .For the third quarter  payable on September 21 for shareholders of record on September 6 , the company is paying  1.84 per share. This consisted of a  1.25 base dividend and a variable component of  0.59.The annualized yield is 3.1 .Please note that the steep drop in its special dividend is likely temporary.Now, oil prices are much higher, and investment volumes will likely subdue.I expect the next dividend announcement to come with a much juicier special dividend.I've spent the past few years praising PXD. Hence, I'm happy that PXD is outperforming its peers.Compared to pre-pandemic levels, PXD shares have returned 67  compared to five years ago. The Energy ETF  and Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF  have returned 52  and -2 , respectively.Going back ten years, the performance is somewhat equal at 67 , caused by the poor price levels of oil and gas after the 2014 peak.Going forward, I expect PXD to continue outperforming its peers and the S P 500, as I believe in prolonged sticky inflation and the tailwinds that come with a new era for oil supply growth.Hence, I'm considering buying much more PXD, including the proceeds of my successful Chevron investments. While I believe that Chevron is one of the best-diversified energy investments, I prefer PXD because of its focus on drilling and high shareholder returns.Please note that I haven't made a final decision. I may keep CVX and boost PXD purely using new cash.Valuation-wide, I believe that PXD is undervalued. This is mainly based on my oil outlook and its potential to generate strong, double-digit free cash flow at elevated oil prices.Investors will likely recognize that and keep moving funds into the company and its peers.The current consensus price target is  257, which is 9  above the current price.On a longer-term basis, I expect PXD to move well beyond  350 if oil prices go into triple-digit territory.My bullish outlook on oil has been reaffirmed as supply dynamics shift and demand remains strong.The decline in legacy production and the end of the U.S. shale revolution are bolstering oil prices, with the Permian basin losing momentum.To capitalize on this trend, I've increased my energy exposure, favoring upstream companies with deep reserves, efficient production, and healthy balance sheets.Pioneer Natural Resources stands out as a prime candidate, boasting industry-leading efficiency and substantial low-breakeven locations.With its strategic focus on shareholder distribution and potential for substantial free cash flow, PXD aligns perfectly with my long-term vision.While I may still decide on the Chevron to PXD shift, PXD's reserves, the potential for outperformance, and special dividends make it a compelling choice in the evolving energy landscape.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

First Industrial: Buy The Dip On This Fast-Growing REIT,"There are some stocks in growth industries that one can put on the back burner, and that may be the case with First Industrial . It s been a while since I last visited the stock It appears that my bullishness around the stock has paid off, as the stock has given investors a 16.6  total return, surpassing the 10  rise in the volatile S P 500  over the same timeframe.Like most REITs, FR s stock price has fallen over the past 30  days, but has held up well on a 12-month basis with flattish performance. In this piece, I discuss why growth investors may want to consider buying the stock on the dip, so let s get startedFirst Industrial is a self-managed REIT that specializes in ownership of distribution centers and light industrial properties across the U.S., with 69 million square feet of industrial space. With an equity market cap of  6.3 billion, FR is larger than peer Terreno Realty , smaller than Rexford Industrial  and industry giant, Prologis .Like its aforementioned peers, FR targets large, supply-constrained markets with higher focus on coastal regions. As shown below, FR s properties are concentrated around 15 target metropolitan statistical areas, with a quarter of rents coming from Southern California and a fifth coming from the Northeast.Unlike other REIT classes like office properties, the industrial segment has seen strong demand and FR is no different, with occupancy sitting at a high 97.7 . Moreover, FR set a company record cash rental rate increase on new and renewal leases of 74  during the second quarter, and this contributed to a robust 11  YoY same store NOI growth.These strong trends are supported by low vacancy rate of just  across the U.S., driven by tailwinds such as e-commerce, tenant needs for supply chain diversification as a result from the pandemic, and reshoring trends of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. As shown below, FR s high occupancy is in line with that of recent years, while its cash rental rate and same store NOI have accelerated.The supply and demand imbalance is further exacerbated by the fact that many higher leveraged private market developers are priced out due to higher rates. FR is well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic with its strong balance sheet and existing property base in property-scarce markets along the coasts. As shown below, industry-wide construction starts are down 47  from the peak in the third quarter of 2022 and the number of properties in the construction pipeline  industry-wide  is shrinking.Meanwhile, FR carries a strong BBB rated balance sheet with a reasonably low debt   preferred stock to EBITDA ratio of 5.2x, sitting well below the 6.0x level generally considered safe for REITs by ratings agencies, and has a high fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.0x. This gives FR capacity to support its developments, with expected completion rates ranging from Q3 FY23 to Q3 FY24 at an attractive weighted average estimated cash yield of 7.9  across 9 development sites. As shown below, FR has plenty of development pipeline across its  land bank  in its existing portfolio, giving it plenty of runway in supply-scarce markets.While FR s 2.7  dividend yield isn t particularly high, it has grown its dividend every year over the past 5 years, with it having grown by 47  since 2018. This has been nearly in lock step with FFO share, which grew by 49  over the same timeframe. At the current annual dividend rate of  1.28, the dividend is well-protected by a 54  payout ratio, leaving plenty of retained capital as a source for internal funding.Risks to FR include the fact that the industrial segment is cyclical in nature, and a hard landing resulting in a recession would impact nearly every industry, and could suppress rent growth. In addition, while FR carries a strong balance sheet, it isn t immune to higher interest rates, which could offset some of the benefits from rental increases.Lastly, I see value in FR at the current price of  46.63 with a forward P FFO of 19.3. While FR isn t cheap, it s not expensive either, considering its moat-worthy property base with plenty of development opportunities, its strong balance sheet, and recent growth metrics. Plus, analysts estimate  annual FFO share growth over the next 3 years, and considering the above, I believe FR has the potential to trade in the 20 P FFO range, which is its normal valuation over the past decade.In conclusion, FR appears to be a strong self-managed REIT with its specialized, irreplaceable properties in supply-constrained markets along the coasts and key inland markets. I would expect for strong rent growth and occupancy trends to continue due to secular tailwinds in e-commerce, reshoring trends, the supply demand imbalance, and the company s development pipeline. As such, investors seeking quality real estate and income ought to consider FR at the current price.Gen Alpha has teamed up with to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.

On a larger level, China ended almost all subsidies and tax breaks for green energy, which triggered an across-the-board selloff inMore supply   less demand   falling prices for lithium.As of today, here is the decline in lithium, with this month being either the beginning of the end for lithium or somewhere close to the panic point from which it is more likely to recoverIt isn t just lithium prices, though lithium is the poster child for the Battery Revolution. Any minor glitch in electric vehicle  EV  sales tends to create panic in the streets. For instance, EV charging equipment provider Beam Global  reported better-than-expected  recently. Sales came in at  17.8 million, up about 380  year-over-year. BEEM is still a micro-cap company, but it seems to be on the right track. Yet the stock opened the next day at  10.20 and closed at  9.05.General Motors  sales of EVs fell in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The first quarter marked the end of certain U.S. subsidies. Ford  recently reduced some of its growth expectations for EVs. This is the type of news that makes skittish people think,  The sky is falling  The sky is falling  No, it isn t.One 12-week period is not indicative of future sales. And this interruption in demand does not mean there is likely to be any pause in seeking new sources of lithium. There will be new technologies that make it more efficient, however.The first step in making Li-Ion batteries is getting the lithium. Lithium is extracted from three different venues  brines, pegmatites, and sedimentary rocks. How the lithium is extracted means very different project requirements, extraction methods, governmental regulation, environmental considerations, and processing times.Historically, lithium extraction from brine sources has been more economical than production from pegmatite or sedimentary sources. Living in Nevada, I am geographically close to the action in that Tesla s  gigafactory is just down the road from me, and Albemarle s  Silver Peak mine  the only producing lithium brine operation in the U.S.  is only a few hours away. Often, our local news will pick up a story well before the rest of the nation sees it. Such was the case for my earliest purchases of Lithium Americas .We do not know how much more lithium may be found in the USA   once upon a time, America produced the most of any nation. Those days are long gone, however. Now, most of the brine-evaporation sources of lithium are in different desert areas with dependable solar evaporation.These basins are called salt lakes, salt flats, or salars. Lithium  brine  deposits represent about two-thirds of worldwide lithium resources. The best known are found in the salt flats of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.Even though most of these reserve deposits are found in The Lithium Triangle of these three nations, Australia is the world s largest lithium producer in total output, with much of it coming from the Greenbushes hard-rock lithium operation. More on that later.Among many other lithium producers, I own shares of Livent , which produces lithium carbonate from a world-class lithium brine deposit in Argentina  the Salar del Hombre Muerto. Allkem , an Australian lithium producer, is ramping up production at a contiguous site. These two companies are currently jumping through various regulatory hoops to be able to merge their assets, making it an even bigger factor in brine-evaporation lithium.Bolivia is likely to have the globe s biggest deposit of lithium, the Salar de Uyuni, which might contain as much as between 50 to 70 percent of  known  world reserves. But the statist government of Bolivia, for now anyway, insists on government control of all activity   and the Bolivian deposits are more costly to refine and have a much lower evaporation rate, anyway.Geothermal lithium brine deposits have been much in the news lately. Lithium has been found in Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland as super-hot saline is spewed from geothermal sites. In this stew are also found good quantities of potassium, boron, lithium, and other elements.I have a personal connection here, as well, albeit from a more distant time. Back in the mists of antiquity, I was working my way through UCLA with a dozen or so different jobs. One of these was selling lots on the shores of California s Salton Sea. It never became the next Palm Springs  just up the road a piece , but I thought it had potential, so I scraped up the then-massive chunk of money --  1,000 -- to buy a 2.5-acre lot there.I would have done better placing my money in a 2  savings account and compounding it over the intervening period, but at least it has kept me interested in the goings-on down there. There is already significant work being done. The Hell s Kitchen lithium and power project looks to have an estimated 30-year life with a total lithium resource capacity of 300,000 metric tons -- MT -- per year of lithium carbonate equivalent. We ll see.Lithium brine deposits can also be found in some deep oil reservoirs in North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and East Texas. In fact, Standard Lithium  claims to hold a property  and a unique process  on the U.S. gulf coast containing more than 4 million MT of lithium carbonate equivalent resources.I find this interesting because the oil   gas drillers have significant seismic and 4D technologies already in place, -- as well as deep pockets. Is it possible we will one day get our lithium from these energy companies, as wellPegmatite is a coarse-grained igneous rock that is formed from crystallized magma. Pegmatite lithium deposits  also known as  hard-rock  lithium deposits,  often contain extractable amounts of not just lithium, but also tin, tantalum, and niobium. We most often find the most lithium where mineral spodumene dominates.Australia produces the most lithium from pegmatite deposits of any country. Australian lithium production is on fire, with numerous global mining companies elbowing for position. Canada, the US, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and even nations we do not think of as producing lithium, like Finland and Ireland, hold financially viable pegmatite lithium deposits.Hard-rock ore that contains lithium is extracted at open-pit or underground mines using conventional mining techniques. The ore is then processed and concentrated in a number of different ways to produce lithium and its compounds. This kind of mining is more expensive than using evaporative techniques like brine deposits. The good news is that hard-rock lithium deposits have higher lithium concentrations than brines, making them still economically viable. Also, producing tin, tantalum, niobium, and more can help offset costs.Sedimentary deposits account for a growing piece of the lithium pie. These are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites.  Lacustrine  just means that these are sedimentary rock formations that formed at the bottom of ancient lakes.In clay deposits, lithium is typically found in hectorite, which is rich in lithium, but also in magnesium.  The name hectorite comes from a deposit first discovered in Hector, California.Many companies are in the research and development phase for their clay deposits, but no companies currently produce meaningful lithium from them.The most commonly known form of lithium-containing lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia. This deposit is owned by another company in my portfolio, one which is not often thought of as a lithium producer  Rio Tinto . RIO says it believes this deposit likely contains more than 200 million MT of lithium, which would make it one of the largest lithium deposits anywhere.In January 2022, after Anglo-Australian RIO had committed to pay more than  2 billion to execute the project, Serbia revoked its license. The ostensible reason was public protest over environmental concerns. It probably did not help matters that Australia deported Serbia s favorite son and tennis star Novak Djokovic for failing to comply with Australia s Covid-19 protocols. We shall see if one day royalties to Serbia become more important than other issues.Another example of sedimentary deposits is, yes, yet another of my  future energy  holdings, Lithium Americas. I have written early and often about the trials and tribulations of trying to extract lithium in this litigious United States of America. I first followed LAC as I read reports of the numerous lawsuits to protect  the environment  in my local newspapers.  The Lithium Americas site, Thacker Pass, is a couple of hours northeast of Reno, my nearest airport gateway.I find it curious that the voices most demeaning of nature s batteries  fossil fuels  who demand that we replace these forms of energy immediately with  green  sources are also the loudest in protesting our best opportunity to do so. LAC was sued in court by various First Nation tribes, by farmers and ranchers, and by all manner of organizers and followers from outside the area. These lawsuits went on for years.If we want green energy, we must understand that lithium does not grow on trees, that the sun does not shine 24 7, and that wind turbines are composed of all sorts of metals and materials that must be dug from the ground then, at the end of their useful life, disposed of by returning much of the dangerous materials with which they are built into the earth and atmosphere. TINSTAAFL.Possibly  bringing closure to this farce is the decision just this week between LAC, General Motors, which has agreed to off-take some  600 million of LAC production, Bechtel Construction, and North America s Building Trades Unions for the Thacker Pass project, which will now hopefully tap into the largest deposit of lithium in North America.If you ask me what lithium prices, and thus lithium companies, will do this week or this month, I haven t a clue. Since China removed incentives to buy electric, EV sales there are down. That says there is less demand, so prices may stay depressed. On the other hand, if governments or regulators or protesters dead set against disturbing Mother Earth -- from Serbia to Bolivia to the USA   prevent adequate supply, while demand increases, then the shares of lithium producers will rise again.I cannot say that a rebound will be immediate. I do believe the tale of Lithium Americas, having exhausted all opposition all the way to the 9 Circuit Court   yes, the 9 Circuit    may create enough precedent that other firms might not face the same uphill battle.I don t know exactly when the supply demand balance will create the momentum to resurrect these companies  share prices. But I am 100  certain that the balance will shift. When it does, earnings will increase or explode. When that happens the same people now selling  because they are going down  will be anxious to buy  because they are going up.I prefer to eliminate those middle steps. I own and am continuing to add to my holdings in the very best lithium producers. If you want some history, there are scores of articles written on SA about these firms. You will also find a half dozen or so that I have written, detailing in greater depth my belief in every one of these.

"Kinder Morgan: Higher Leverage, But Lower Profitability Vs. Its Peers","Kinder Morgan  is a well-separated midstream company with operations in several fields. Among all, natural gas is the most important element that brings opportunity for the company from the management s point of view. That is because natural gasIn my previous  on Kinder Morgan, I rated the stock as a buy, and after that, it rose by approximately 6 . In my previous update, I investigated KMI s first quarter results and mentioned that according to the higher short-term demand outlook for natural gas, Kinder Morgan has strong opportunities for higher export. In this analysis, however, aligned with the short-term outlook, I investigated the long-term outlook for LNG supply and demand. Based on theFigure 1The management noted that although they have several projects in backlog, they are sure these projects will be getting done at attractive returns, well higher than the capital spent on them. Similar to their update on the first quarter of 2023, they have targeted  3.7 billion in committed growth capital on their backlog projects. But the point is what if these projects reach lower returns than what the management expects  In that case, they may lead to higher leverage for the company and lower distributed cash flow. For example, KMI s Wabash Valley RNG projects, which are part of the Kinetrex acquisition, have been more expensive than expected.During , Kinder Morgan s distributable cash flow declined slightly by 8  and sat at  1,076 million versus  1,176 million in 2Q 2022. Moreover, KMI s dividend yield is in the top 10-yield in the S P 500, which is an attractive element of the company. Meanwhile, the company s net debt amount is at a high level of  31.7 billion in 2Q 2023, which was almost constant with  31.6 billion at the end of 2Q 2022. Albeit high net debt levels are almost normal for companies in this industry, I believe the management is required to have some plan for deleveraging to reduce its interest expenses. With decreasing inflation rates, there is no need for high-interest rates in the future. However, we do not know when the Fed will decide to drop interest rates back to previous levels. As the management has no specific plan for deleveraging, it seems they have relied on lower interest rates in the near future, which I assume is not reliable.Figure 2To investigate KMI s financials more accurately, I have analyzed its leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers  Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners . In the case of leverage condition, Kinder Morgan s debt-to-Asset ratio is 45.4 , which is almost the same as ET s amount of 45.7 , while EPD has performed better and sat at 42.3  of the debt-to-asset ratio. Additionally, KMI s debt-to-equity level is circa 0.8x, which is slightly lower than ET s debt-to-Equity of 1x. Again, PDE has had the lowest level of circa 0.5x during the last 5 years  see Figure 3 .Figure 3   KIM s leverage condition vs. peersMoreover, analyzing KMI s return ratios versus the peer group indicates that ET and EPD have used their debt more efficiently. As it is indicated in Figure 4, KMI's return on invested capital is 3.9 , which is far lower than ET s and EPD s levels of 7.4  and 18 , respectively. This ratio indicates that EPD has been able to turn its capital from investments to profits more successfully. Additionally, KMI has the lowest return on assets level among its peers. Its ROA is 3.6 , which is in line with ET s 3.9 . However, well below EPD s ROA of 7.9 . Ultimately, KMI s return on equity sat at 8 , which is beneath ET s 12.6  and EPD s 20.4 . All in all, considering Kinder Morgan s leverage and profitability conditions in comparison to its peers indicate that the management could use debt more efficiently and thus provide more benefits for investors.Figure 4   KMI s return ratios vs. its peersFurthermore, considering KMI s dividend payment indicates that the company has paid dividends consistently and is growing slowly. Their last payment of , which was paid on August 15th, was in line with the previous quarter of  0.282 per share. Also, their dividend yield is 6.43 , which is very attractive. As a result, although Kinder Morgan is not an appropriate choice for growth investors in my point of view, the company is strong, and reliable for paying back dividends, thus a good choice for investors who would like reliable dividend payments albeit with slow growth  see Figure 5 .Figure 5   KMI s dividend payment and yieldKinder Morgan is one of the prominent midstream companies in North America. The company has a diversified portfolio of operations like services, refinery products, and infrastructure. Thankfully, their potentials and pipeline networks bring the opportunity to soak economic downturns and commodity price fluctuations. In this analysis, I have investigated short-term and long-term outlooks for LNG market supply and demand. Also, I have analyzed KMI s leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers  Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners. KMI has almost higher leverage ratios vs. its peers, while it has provided less profitability for its investors. When all was said and done, I believe a hold rating is appropriate for KMI stock.Thank you for your time, and I welcome your opinions and comments.

Lyft: Sub-Scale Discount,"Lyft  has made substantial progress toward profitability in recent quarters, but it remains a distant second to Uber . This raises questions about Lyft's ability to effectively compete, particularly as the market is becoming more dependentLyft generally competes in markets that are dominated by two main players. This could result in favorable competitive conditions if a stable equilibrium can be reached, but any easing of competition is likely to be tenuous due to the fact that Lyft offers a commodity service in a two-sided marketplace.Lyft's management team is not currently worried about a price war, likely due to a shift in the macro environment. The rapid increase in interest rates over theScale is a potential issue for Lyft though given that it is small relative to Uber, but this is dependent on a number of complex factors. While scale is a potential issue, it should be noted that economies of scale for ride sharing are largely local, meaning that Lyft is more competitive in the area that matters most than it might appear. Lyft's business is more concentrated geographically and is more focused on the ridesharing vertical. Ride sharing companies need sufficient scale to create a liquid marketplace, but beyond this, the balance of supply and demand is more important than scale. A denser network of riders and drivers can lead to better routing though, improving driver income and reducing pricing for riders.Data can also provide economies of scale at the national global level in areas like insurance costs and advertising. Advertisers will be attracted to platforms that can provide them with reach, accurate targeting and attribution data.Auto insurance is a problem for ridesharing companies at the moment due to elevated inflation in categories like auto parts and medical costs. Lyft has stated that insurance costs per ride  in 2022 and a further 17  in 2023. Data can be used to reduce risk exposure through better routing and network density can reduce the distance driven, resulting in lower insurance costs per trip.The balance between riders and drivers improved in the second quarter, resulting in the percentage of Lyft rides affected by prime-time pricing  and a larger percentage of intended rides converting into actual rides. The number of drivers using Lyft increased by over 20  YoY in the second quarter, and driver hours increased by more than 35 . This strength has carried over into the third quarter, with driver numbers up 25  YoY in July and driver hours increasing by nearly 45  YoY. The importance of drivers is supported by an  that drivers are currently the limiting factor in growth. Lyft appears to be well placed in regard to drivers, with the preference for Lyft amongst drivers who use both Lyft and Uber increasing .Lyft recently started pricing more competitively, which is supporting growth but weighing on margins. This change has contributed to strong growth in new and returning riders, along with an increase in the number of rides taken by each active rider. Intended rides increased , suggesting that strong demand will carry over into the third quarter. The conversion of intent into actual rides also continues to improve, which is likely closely related to the balance of supply and demand.Similar to Uber, Lyft now offers a range of products that aim to maximize the company's revenue and profitability. Wait and save is Lyft's most affordable rideshare option, allowing riders to pay less if they are not in a hurry. While this is a headwind to margins, it could help to reduce price shopping between apps. Wait and save trips , with volumes far exceeding what Lyft's shared ride business ever achieved.Lyft also offers a non-emergency healthcare product that provides patients with access to medical treatments and has government support. Healthcare rides grew by  in the second quarter and growth should be supported over the long term by aging populations.Lyft also offers B2B services which allow an employer to provide transportation for staff. Uber has a similar business and has  of these trips are on a premium product, which should be supportive of margins.Micro mobility is still a small but growing part of Lyft's business, aided by Lyft's acquisition of PBSC in the second quarter of 2022. PBSC has  and 95,000 bikes to 45 markets and 15 countries, with the acquisition roughly doubling Lyft's micro mobility business.Lyft is focused on branding, service differentiation and making the app stickier to drive growth and margins. Lyft's LTV CAC appears low, meaning the company needs to extract more revenue from existing users and reduce the cost of attracting new users. Uber is trying to improve its LTV CAC through memberships. Uber One members are profitable, but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members. This is offset by the fact that members spend  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50  greater than non-member retention.Advertising should provide Lyft with high-margin incremental revenue going forward as the company recently introduced in-app advertising.  on serving display ads, introducing video ads by the end of the year. This is potentially lucrative as users check the app nearly 9x per ride. Lyft is also able to offer advertising across 6,500 in-car tablets, 800 car-top displays, and digital screens at its bike share stations.Lyft's revenue in the second quarter was , up 3  YoY. The increase was driven by strong rideshare ride growth, partially offset by lower revenue per ride and a non-recurring legal expense that was classified as contra-revenue. Bike and scooter systems sales growth was also strong in the second quarter.Lyft expects third quarter revenue to be in the  range, a 7-9  YoY increase. This is based on anticipated rideshare ride growth of 20  along with lower revenue per ride due to Lyft's focus on pricing competitively. Lyft also suggested on the second quarter earnings call that fourth quarter revenue growth would be in the low to mid-single digit range QoQ, which implies that revenue will be fairly flat YoY.Rideshare rides increased 18  YoY in the second quarter, and the number of active riders and drivers each reached multiyear highs. The number of active Lyft riders in the second quarter was , an 8  increase YoY. Lower pricing negatively impacted revenue per active rider though, which was down 5  YoY.While it is easy to theorize about the impact of network density, economies of scale, etc. gross profit margins provide little evidence of a revenue   COGS benefit. Uber and Lyft's gross profit margins are similar and have shown no improvement with scale. This is impacted by revenue mix shifts across geographies and verticals though, making the impact difficult to assess.Lyft's  in the second quarter, increasing 10  YoY. This improvement was only due to a 275 million USD expense associated with Lyft's legacy insurance reserves in Q2 2022. Excluding this impact, Lyft's contribution margin declined by 18 , due to both lower revenue per ride and higher insurance costs. Lyft's contribution margin is expected to be roughly 45  in the third quarter, with the improvement driven by healthier driver supply dynamics and less contra-revenue.Lyft's third-party insurance contracts will renew in the fourth quarter, resulting in higher costs. The company plans on staggering renewals in certain states going forward, which it believes will give the company better optionality. Lyft is also trying to lower the burden of insurance costs through product and safety initiatives that help reduce accident frequency and improve settlement outcomes. This includes things like better routing and greater network density.Lyft's operating expenses  in the second quarter as a result of its cost restructuring initiatives. Lyft conducted a reorganization in April, creating a flatter organizational structure and resulting in more effective communication and decision making. While the benefit of recent cost saving initiatives is expected to flow into the third quarter, operating expenses will face upward pressure from volume driven costs and an increase in targeted marketing spend.While Uber and Lyft have both been able to demonstrate significant operating leverage over the past few years, it is operating expenses that demonstrate Uber's advantage. Lyft's operating expenses are quite low given the company's size, but Uber is able to spread its operating expenses across a much larger revenue base.Lyft's stock is priced broadly in line with peers based on its current profitability and growth rate. The stock trades at a significant discount to Uber though, which may be a reflection of the difference in scale between the two companies.Lyft remains some way off profitability, which is probably a concern for investors, even though Lyft's cash balance still provides it with a sizeable runway. Increased advertising revenue will be supportive of margins, but this will be somewhat offset by rising insurance costs. Lyft needs to significantly expand its business to remain competitive, which is questionable given current low user growth.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

This Holiday Shopping Season Could Be A Nail-Biter," The holiday selling season represents around 25  of annual retail sales and has always been an important catalyst for investors.When it comes to understanding what this holiday season may hold, it's helpful for investors to consider how the experiences of the past two years might inform retailers  expectations, especially around supply and demand.We also need to consider how consumers are faring in a much more uncertain macroeconomic environment.Back in 2021, consumer demand was strong coming out of the pandemic, but supply chain issues resulted in longer lead times for products to reach stores and inventories were depleted quickly.In response, retailers prepared for 2022 by increasing inventory, but demand plummetedFast forward to today, we find that while inventory levels are more balanced compared with the excess of 2022, the demand picture remains uncertain.Inflation has moderated, but the outlook for consumers has otherwise weakened. Despite recent improvements in real wages, many low-income consumers are still living paycheck to paycheck.The cost of living, including food and fuel, remains a significant concern, and we re seeing consumer spending dedicated to  needs   and food in particular  rather than  wants.Even higher income consumers are feeling the pinch with increased market volatility, a slowing housing market and employment uncertainty.Given the more challenging spending environment, we expect to see variation across the retail landscape this holiday season.Promotional sales have long been a holiday tradition, and this year companies may employ them to boost traffic. We don t expect promotions to be excessive, but we may see retailers announce sales earlier in the season to help smooth out holiday shopping peaks and troughs.In the end, we think that the success of the holiday season  and the year  is going to come down to the wire for retailers. And while they are better positioned in terms of inventory, consumers are in no rush and have the upper hand in waiting for deals.For investors, it will be important to identify areas of opportunity, notably in athletic wear and beauty.Retailers and investors remain defensive in their positioning, as it is difficult to identify a catalyst for accelerating demand heading into 2024.

Opportunity Knocks For Municipal Investors,"Municipal bonds posted sharply negative total returns in September amid heightened volatility. Interest rates rose rapidly and pressured fixed income assets as the market navigated a moderate rise in inflation, continued strength in the labor market, surging oilIssuance was light at just  28 billion, 23  below the five-year average, bringing the year-to-date total to  263 billion, down 8  year-over-year. However, issuance still outpaced reinvestment income from maturities, calls, and coupons by nearly  6 billion, weighing heavily on the market as seasonal net negative supply during theWhile the recent sell-off was significantly larger and more volatile than expected, seasonal performance weakness in the autumn was broadly anticipated. With the Fed nearing the end of its tightening cycle, we view the reset in yields and valuations as an attractive long-term buying opportunity. We foresee using any material pickup in issuance to add some duration and lock in durable yields.We maintain a neutral-duration posture overall, albeit slightly longer than last month. We prefer an up-in-quality bias and remain both cautious and selective in noninvestment grade. We advocate a barbell yield curve strategy, pairing front-end exposure with an increased but modest allocation to the 15-20-year part of the curve.Last month, Moody s revised its credit outlook to  positive  from  stable  for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority s  MTA   20.6 billion in outstanding transportation revenue bonds. Moody s also affirmed the MTA s  A3  rating. S P followed with a rating upgrade to  A-  from  BBB  and revised its outlook to  positive  from  stable  on October 4th. Additional state support has offset post-COVID-19 ridership losses and has enabled the MTA to nearly close forecasted budget gaps and stabilize liquidity. Weekday subway ridership on the nation s largest mass-transit system has slowly risen but remains at about 70  of 2019 levels. To offset fare losses, a state-approved 0.6  increase in New York City payroll taxes will provide an estimated  5 billion of revenue over the next five years. Continued support from the state, a full recovery of ridership, and the implementation of operational savings are key factors in any future rating upgrades.A recent rating downgrade of a small issuer highlights the importance of credit research and the need to analyze an issuer s entire debt structure prior to purchase. For example, S P downgraded Maryland Heights, MO from  BBB  to  BB  last month based on the city s refusal to support its nonrated 2018B Industrial Development Authority revenue bonds. The city was rated  AA  as recently as November 2020. The 2018B bonds were secured by revenues from a multipurpose ice arena that never became fully operational due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ice facility has faced operating imbalances since its opening in 2019, having relied on general fund transfers from the city to make debt payments on three separate occasions. Given the city s recent decision not to provide additional support for the ice complex bonds, S P has become wary of the city s willingness to pay its outstanding debt backed by annual appropriations. This technical default by a previously highly rated city underscores the need for in-depth credit analysis.This material is not intended to be relied upon as a forecast, research or investment advice, and is not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

AvalonBay: I Will Buy If Strong Growth Persists In Q3,"AvalonBay Communities  is a major apartment REIT with properties located in legacy markets on the East and West Coast. The REIT focuses on higher-end rental units with an average monthly rent of about  2,500 andLast time I  the stock was in May, when I issued a HOLD rating at  180 per share. I liked the way in which AVB was positioned and didn t mind the legacy market exposure, but I couldn t see a clear way to 10  returns. Since then, the stock has been quite volatile, reaching as high as  200, only to settle around  180 again. More importantly, the company has also released very good Q2 2023 results. Today s article is meant to update my thesis based on Q2 numbers and to give investors some insights of what to look for in Q3 earnings, which will be I ve touched on the topic of new supply in my original article. Here I want to provide a little bit more of an insight.It s no secret, that a large number of people and jobs moved to the South during and after the pandemic. This has resulted in a spike in construction activity in the region to about 4-5  of new supply each year. At the same time, new supply in the coastal regions has remained relatively stable at 1.5  per year.Over the past 24 months or so, the Sunbelt region has seen unprecedented growth, as confirmed by double-digit FFO increases of Mid-America Apartment Communities . But now things seem to be slowly changing, and legacy markets are starting to catch up. This will be clearly illustrated by very high rent growth in AVB s markets, but the point is that demand is strong, while supply remains at relatively normal levels compared to history  certainly the growth in new supply post-pandemic has been much lower in Costal markets than in the Sunbelt. With strong demand and stable supply, I see the risk of oversupply as minimal. For this reason, I actually slightly prefer the Coastal markets over the Sunbelt at this time.I think that one of the best ways to determine how a REIT is doing is to look at their ability to raise rents, which is especially important in a high inflation environment like the one we have today.Over the first six months of the year, AVB has done remarkably well on this front by increasing their same-store NOI by 7.9  YoY. It s notable, that the increases weren t uniform across the portfolio. Florida has seen the fastest levels of growth, but since this region accounts for less than 3  of the overall NOI, it didn t contribute meaningfully to AVB s bottom line. The Northeast, on the hand, has a high weighting and saw very high double-digit growth of 10-12 , suggesting that demand is coming back to cities such as NYC or Boston. On the other side of the country, California  and especially Southern California  has struggled with low rent increases of only 2  YoY.Right now, management s full year guidance calls for a 7  YoY increase in NOI. When Q3 earnings come out, one of the first things I ll want to see will be rent increases across various regions to confirm my thesis that demand is indeed coming back to Coastal markets. If management hits their target, FFO per share will reach  10.50.Last year, Sunbelt REITs experienced double-digit rent-growth, but that seems to be thing of the past as MAA's growth guidance for this year is largely in line with AVB's.Management didn t provide any insight on what growth will be like in 2024 and 2025. The general consensus seems to be for 5  same store NOI growth. On top of that, the REIT will be able to grow by adding new properties to their portfolio. Currently, there are 3,600 units scheduled for completion until the end of next year, which  if leased  will contribute another 4-5  to growth. As a result of these two factors, I expect AVB to deliver 6-8  annual NOI growth until 2025. This is largely in line with the expected growth for AVB's closest peer Equity Residential  and actually above the expected growth for MAA  and most other Sunbelt peers  which are likely to experience a temporary slowdown in rent growth due to a large spike in new supply.There are relatively few things that could derail this. AVB has an A- rated balance sheet with low leverage of only 4x EBITDA and the vast majority  92  of debt fixed-rate. Moreover, near term maturities are low and can easily be repaid from rental revenue if refinancing terms are not favorable.With that said, higher interest rates for a long period of time will hurt the stock price in the short-term as the market re-rates to adjust to higher interest rate expectations. But what's important is that even with high interest rates, cash flow is likely to grow as rent growth will most likely out-weigh interest expense increase. For this reason, I see AVB as quite well positioned for a higher for longer scenario - this would be supported by the fact that it is one of only seven REITs with an A- or better rating.The main risk to my thesis is that the tick up in rent growth in the Northeast will be short-lived, and growth rates will decline as soon as Q3. This would negatively impact future growth expectations and therefore the stock price. In fact, I see Q3 earnings as the breaking-point which will decide whether Coastal markets are actually coming back strong or not. This will, to a large extent, be determined by rent and NOI growth.A share price of  176 today puts the stock at a forward P FFO of 16.8x, which is slightly below where the stock traded last time, thanks to increased growth guidance for this year. The long-term average for AVB stands around 22x FFO. But I don t really expect meaningful multiple expansion, until rates come down.Until then, investors will continue to receive a 4  dividend yield and are likely to see cash flow increase by 6-8  per year. That s a slight improvement compared to my last article, as a result of very strong rent growth in Q2. I will be watching Q3 results closely and if strong rent growth persists, I will initiate a position, for now I reiterate my HOLD rating for AVB.If you really like AVB, though, it might be prudent to initiate a small position before earnings come out, because I suspect that if strong NOI growth persists, the stock price will move substantially higher on the announcement.

General Motors: Good Opportunity To Buy,"General Motors  continues to develop the EV business and is committed to its plans to capture this market by launching new models in various auto categories. Despite the recession, GM will continue to invest heavily in EVs, bothSemiconductor shortages for the automotive industry are almost obsolete, and strong consumer spending and still excess savings among the U.S. population have supported U.S. auto .From 2014 to 2020, the normal demandAmid a significant imbalance between supply and demand and still low auto production, the U.S. new car price index continues hitting .A similar situation can be seen in the US used car market, but price growth is considerably slowing .The situation on the new and used car markets is different. While automakers are struggling to restore production, new players are entering the used car market. Amid falling real incomes, rising utility bills, loan and mortgage rates, individuals are starting to sell their own cars.That said, new car makers like GM do see progress in terms of supply chains and semiconductors. However, due to the still high shortage of new vehicles on the market, automakers are still passing costs on to the consumer, albeit at a more moderate pace. GM's dollar margin per auto, according to our estimates, in Q2 2023 was  4700 vs.  5000 in Q1 2023,  4100 in Q2 2022 and the historical average of  2500.GM  about 980k autos, which was above our forecast of 889k autos. Although the consumer remains strong, production is recovering faster. At the same time, price increases are not stopping, forcing dealers and auto companies to build up inventories  GM's inventory level has increased from  15.4 bn to  17.9 bn since the beginning of the year . We have revised our 2023 auto sales forecast from 3.7mn units  3  YoY  to 3.8mn units  5.5  YoY , but cut our 2024 full-year sales forecast from 4.5mn units  21  YoY  to 4mn units  5  YoY  amid a nearly full recovery in US sales levels, but extremely weak sales in Asia due to the prevalence of high penetration in electric car sales in that region. GM's sales in Asia are 40  below GM's pre-market average sales of 250k autos per quarter. However, Asia's EV sales have gone up to 20-25  of all auto sales.As a result, we have revised our 2023 GM revenue forecast upwards from  172.5bn  10  YoY  to  173.8bn  11  YoY  and our 2024 forecast downwards from  209.5 bn  21  YoY  to  185.7bn  7  YoY .We have revised 2023 EBITDA forecast downwards from  22.8bn  9.3  YoY  to  22bn  2  YoY  and 2024 forecast - from  27bn  18  YoY  to  22.7bn  3  YoY  due to a decline in dollar margin per 1 auto from the average  5400 to  4700 in 2023-2024 amid reduced shortage of autos in the US and increased supply in the secondary auto market.The fair value for the stock is  51, based on our EV EBITDA multiple approach.Continued wage growth in the U.S., along with lower inflation rates, has supported demand for cars. As a result, GM's US car sales in Q2 2023 returned to pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the steady rise in auto prices and falling metal prices increased GM's dollar margin per vehicle. We expect the consumer to remain strong going forward and GM is a major beneficiary of the US auto market recovery.A key risk for GM is a potential recession in the U.S., as well as a decline in buying activity amid rising borrowing rates.Due to high market volatility, we recommend to form a position in several steps.

A Good Time To Be An Energy Bull,"In terms of oil market fundamentals, things remain relatively bullish, at least in the short term. Starting with commercial inventories, the EIA reported another 2.2 million barrel draw this past week, following a 2.1 million barrel draw last week.Following what has been a few months of persistent inventory drawdowns, crude oil supplies in the US are becoming increasingly tight.Not only are commercial inventories overall reaching the lows of 2022, prior to the Biden Administration draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but crude oil levels at Cushing, Oklahoma have fallen to only 22 million barrels  down from a two-year high of 43 million barrels in June .Such stockpiles are worryingly close to minimum operating levels, a point which brings into question the quality of remaining stocks.With inventories continuing to track well below their five-yearWith the inventory picture suggesting excess demand relative to supply, other indicators of the physical market also confirm this notion. Notably, the crude oil futures term structure is currently at its highest level of backwardation in over a year.Backwardation implies there is a supply deficit as market participants are willing to pay a premium for instant delivery, despite the associated delivery and storage costs. As a result, any deficit will need to be met via drawing down inventories. Clearly, this is exactly what is unfolding at present.Not only is this true of the term structure as a whole, but front-end prompt spreads are also suggesting the oil market is tight.However, while backwardation is bullish for prices, extreme backwardation and significant spikes in prompt spreads also tend to coincide with short-term peaks in price, something energy bulls should be aware of.The fact that crack spreads have diverged lower throughout September despite higher prices is one physical market indicator suggesting a correction in the oil price could be on the cards, particularly as we are entering refinery maintenance season.Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined products.One of the big drivers of this recent rally has been the significant level of speculative buying we have seen from hedge funds and CTAs.After being caught bearish  to the highest degree in nearly a decade  earlier this year, managed money positioning in the futures market has quickly gone from extreme bearishness to extreme bullishness.If we measure managed money positioning as a percentage of longs relative to total managed money, we can see hedge funds and CTAs are now equally as long oil as they have been in years.Similar spikes have at the very least coincided with short-term pullbacks in price. Given how swift this rally in oil prices has been, I suspect we are due for some kind of pullback, if only minor.While a short-term correction may be due, the medium-term outlook remains bullish. Indeed, not only do the real-time indicators of supply and demand remain favourable, but forecasts for the remainder of 2023 suggest this deficit is set to continue.Notably, the EIA - who are notorious for underestimating demand - continue to see a deficit through Q4 of this year.A view eschewed by Morgan Stanley.Meanwhile, oil analysts at Standard Chartered continue to call for a 1.3 mb d deficit through Q4, and expect inventory draws to continue into 2024.Although such forecasts are inherently difficult and error-prone, it seems we are likely to continue to see a supply and demand imbalance toward the bullish side of the spectrum as we close out 2023, an environment that should help put a floor under the oil price.From a price action perspective, the daily chart for crude continues to trade bullishly. The downtrend that encompassed the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 is clearly behind us, with the major moving averages now turning up and the important  82- 85 resistance level well and truly broken.However, as I have stated, it seems we are probably due for some sort of technical correction, if only briefly.Indeed, WTI recently triggered a 9-13-9 DeMark sequential sell signal and is now butting heads with the  92 resistance level.Thus, if I were a betting man, I would wager the next  5- 10 is to the downside, with any move back toward the mid to low  80s seemingly an excellent buying opportunity.On the whole, I continue to remain cautiously bullish on oil prices and energy stocks for the remainder of 2023. The real-time fundamental indicators such as inventories and term structure remain supportive, while the technical, momentum and trend picture is now firmly on the bullish side.The level of speculative buying and falling crack spreads do suggest we are probably in need of some kind of short-term shake-out, an outcome that would go a long way to setting up another leg higher as we close out 2023.However, having said that, as I  in my previous oil market update, there remain several factors in play that are likely to put a ceiling on oil prices.Indeed, much of the current supply deficit is a result of the ongoing Saudi production cuts and Russian export cuts. OPEC  spare capacity is now the highest it has been since 2010  ex-COVID lockdowns , and it seems they are once again becoming the primary swing producer of oil.Meanwhile, Chinese stockpiles have also been filled to the brim, so, should WTI or Brent prices spike into triple digits, I suspect the Saudis would be happy to ramp up production, with China also likely to release some of their commercial and strategic stockpiles onto the market.For these reasons, don t expect a spike to  150 oil just yet. That will happen, but I suspect it will be a story for 2025, once the US election has come and gone.Though a blow-off top is not impossible, it remains unlikely. For now, enjoy the favourable fundamentals as we close out 2023. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",12,2023-09-28T03:30:00.000-04:00
UGI Corporation: The Company Needs To Improve Its Leverage And Liquidity Conditions,"UGI Corporation  is a leading American company operating in several segments throughout the United States and Europe. The company distributes, stores, and transports energy products and services through its business territories. UGI s main operations are in four business segments  AmeriGasFigure 1   UGI s capital structure  in millionsFigure 2 -Propane is a super volatile business because it is affected by warmer weather, which lowers demand volumes and the supply and demand of both natural gas and crude oil. Analyzing UGI s leverage condition indicates that the company should improve its leverage condition in my opinion. In minutiae, after the downturn of 2020, when the leverage ratios sat at high levels, the company could improve its condition gradually. However, challenges like the Russia and Ukraine war, warmer-than-expected winter, energy conservation efforts in Europe, higher inflation rates, and the current interest rates environment caused the company s leverage ratios to almost hit their 2020 peaks. UGI s debt-to-capital ratio is circa 62 , which shows that 62  of the company s capital is funded by debt. Moreover, its debt-to-asset ratio has surged considerably since last year, reaching over 46 . Ultimately, UGI s debt-to-equity ratio is 1.2x, which indicates for every  1 of equity or ownership, the company has  1.2 debt. This ratio is higher than approximately 1.1x in 2020  see Figure 3 .Figure 3   UGI s leverage conditionFurthermore, the company s liquidity ratios are almost as low as the downturn of 2020. As it is demonstrated in Figure 4, UGI s current ratio plunged to 0.97x, which is far lower than its level of approximately 1.7x in mid-2022. Moreover, the company s quick ratio sat at 0.6x, which is far lower than the same time in the prior year and almost the same as 2020.Figure 4   UGI s liquidity conditionAs a result, the company s current liquidity condition has become their first priority as the management Figure 5   UGI s price return vs. S P 500As a result, I downgraded my previous rating to a hold for UGI stock.Thank you for your time, and as always, I welcome your opinions.

Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,"At the outset, our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in Israel.This past weekend, we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments, the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus, given their potential implications for oil production. Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high. This was part of a complex deal, brokered by the U.S., that aimed for Saudi Arabia's recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production. The talks were under close scrutiny by investors, asHowever, the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics. The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of near-term normalization in Saudi-Israeli relations. This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans, leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period, which could further deplete already low global oil inventories.Another significant player in the global energy market, Iran, is also expected to see a major shift in U.S. policy. Before the attacks, the U.S. had adopted a softer posture toward Iran, allowing it to approach pre-2018 levels of oil production. However, given recent events and Iran's known support for Hamas, the U.S. may adopt a stricter stance, potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supply.These developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties. Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation, affecting both stocks and bonds. In these uncertain times, assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge. In particular, we believe the energy sector, which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics, may offer an opportunity.That said, the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge, and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy. 2009-2023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC.

Plug Power: Profitability By 2025 Is Unlikely,"Despite its potential, hydrogen is currently not competitive due to its high cost and lower efficiency. Plug Power's  profitability projections  profitable in 2025  appear overly optimistic, given the company's increasing expenses relative to its revenues. In addition, share dilution and highThe total addressable market has immense potential as a possible storage option for excess electricity. Furthermore, it could include various transportation methods. However, predicting the future remains difficult  Factors such as production costs, competition from electric cars, future costs of batteries as potential competition for energy storage, future oil prices, andWhat seems to be clear, however, is that hydrogen has not yet established itself on the free market. After all, we still drive, fly, and heat with oil today and not with hydrogen. Global demand has increased in the last decades, but it remains more of a niche product. At the moment, many things are being politically pushed and subsidized, but in the long run, this will not be able to cancel out the free market.In the CO2-neutral future scenarios, it is assumed that hydrogen will be produced from surplus energy from renewable energy sources. But so far, this production method is by far the least profitable compared to hydrogen production from gas or coal.The way hydrogen can be used reminds me overall of oil and gas. Ultimately, it is also just a medium to release stored energy. The problem is that, so far, the hydrogen process is costly and not competitive. And if you use gas, coal, or oil to produce hydrogen, the entire process becomes pointless. Because then, we could burn these energy sources directly, which would be even more efficient since, with each energy conversion, a lot of energy gets lost, .Plug Power, however, bases its own story on the assumption that this future scenario of renewable energy to hydrogen will occur on a large scale and that the company will play a significant role in it.This may happen  I don't want to exclude that at all. With the previous paragraphs, I just wanted to say that there are still many question marks and, so far, few actual, hard facts that hydrogen will become established on a large scale. There are a lot of political plans, but ultimately the free market with supply and demand will prevail.First, a short overview over a more extended period for revenues, expenses, and net income.I have created this overview of the income statement of the last quarter compared to the previous year, showing where money is spent and how the revenue and cost development is in general.Overall, we can see that the trend is continuing, that expenses are increasing faster than sales, and thus the net income is becoming increasingly negative. The current margins are terrible. It is all the more astonishing that analysts expect the company to make a profit as early as 2025.I think this is highly unrealistic, and history does not support it either, as you can see from the fact that the earnings revisions look like this.The company is currently valued at an enterprise value of  6.4B. The market cap is  7.2B, and the company has about  1.6B in cash. Given the current losses of about  200M per quarter, these reserves would be depleted after another two years. This does not include issuing new shares  which will probably happen, see below . It is also possible that the cash burn will slow down as sales increase, but as shown above, this is not the case so far.Otherwise, a valuation of the stock is difficult. Surely it's not a revelation to alert readers to the expensive price-sales ratio.Ultimately, it is also somewhat subjective whether one considers the current valuation to be justified  Because if one believes that hydrogen has a glorious future ahead of it and Plug Power is a company that is operating in the entire hydrogen ecosystem and will multiply its sales in the coming decades, the share would be justifiably expensive.But this glorious future is uncertain  even the opposite could be true. At the moment, hydrogen is being pushed by politics and subsidies, and if these are removed one day, and the hydrogen industry has to stand on its own two feet, it is not sure whether it will survive.Also not mentioned yet in this article is competition. If hydrogen becomes a global cash cow, more and more companies will want to enter the market, which sometimes results in a price war and lower margins.Another risk for the adaptation of hydrogen is that this happens globally in different ways. The danger is that countries that increasingly rely on hydrogen as an energy carrier may have structural disadvantages compared to other countries that stick to oil and gas. If this were to happen, companies would relocate their production locations. Ultimately, hydrogen can only become established long-term if it gets cheaper.For me, these three things are standard checks I make in every article, as excessive stock dilution and stock-based compensation can put us, shareholders, at a disadvantage. In addition, insider trades sometimes contain valuable info about the confidence of management itself. Massive selling has occurred in 2021 but none within the last six months. Otherwise, we can see that the number of outstanding shares has risen massively and continues to rise slowly. Also, the SBCs are huge and currently account for more than 10  of this year s revenue.For my taste, not only Plug Power, but the entire hydrogen industry still has far too many question marks to be considered as an investment. If at all, then as a tiny position, but I'll stay out of it for now and watch further development. High valuations mean high falling heights, and there could be several reasons for this  disappointing financial figures, permanently little global adaptation, or waning political support, for example, after changes in government.

REIT Meltdown: 3 Rarely Discounted Buying Opportunities,"Is there a more reviled and shunned sector of the stock market today than real estateSince the beginning of 2022, publicly traded real estate investment trusts  REITs  have been one of the worst, if not  worst, performingIn sharp contrast to soaring energy stocks , real estate stocks  have suffered a decline of nearly 30  since early 2022.WhyIn ,  I talked about the three ways that rising interest rates typically cause REITs to dropThat last point is a major one. I hear from commenters again and again   WhyOf course, the 5  yields on cash offer no upside, growth, or inflation protection. But in any case, this is a big reason why investors have shunned REITs.And then there's one last reason why REITs have performed so badlyIt is true that real estate still faces continued struggles for years to come as hybrid work takes its toll on leasing demand, capital spending requirements ramp up in order to retain or attract tenants, and low-interest loans mature and need to be refinanced at much higher rates.For example, in the next three years, a steady slate of mortgage loans will continue to mature for mid-quality Class B office properties, which will put tremendous pressure on landlords and undoubtedly create ample pockets of distress.I would not want to be a Class B office landlord in Houston, for example, because of its unappealing combination of  25  vacancy rate and  25  of square footage with loan maturities in the next three years.Surely this will inhibit the growth of most office real estate going forward as the competition for tenants heats up.Again, though, office REITs make up a  sliver of the overall REIT universe.Perhaps some investors assume that other property sectors are suffering similar problems as office, but that assumption is incorrect.According to , both FFO and NOI for the overall REIT index hit new all-time highs in Q2 2023.Moreover, as I explained in ,  high interest rates are not  bad for REITs.That is because the higher cost of capital is causing construction starts of new properties to absolutely  across all real estate sectors. Hence you see headlines like this one from Yes, REITs are hurt by high interest rates. But they are not hurt  as bad as the many bank-dependent, highly leveraged private real estate owners out there.And now, with REIT prices down  30  from their early 2022 highs, publicly traded real estate stocks look like a phenomenal value, especially for certain heavily punished yet high-quality REITs.I'll pitch three of my favorite discounted yet high-quality REITs below. But first, let me demonstrate real estate's ability to powerfully rebound from selloffs like the current one.Across the last 7 recessions, REITs have been the worst performers, averaging a 22  drawdown during these periods. Although we have not been in an officially declared recession, consider that the almost 30  drawdown since the beginning of 2022 is worse than this average.But then, notice that real estate has been the  1 strongest performing sector during recoveries. Moreover, it is among the strongest performing sectors during expansionary periods.It is only during slowdowns and recessions that REITs underperform. And when it does underperform, the underperformance is typically  than what we've experienced during the current REIT bear market.As such, if and when a recession is finally declared and interest rates come down from current levels, REITs should be among the strongest performing sectors, if not  strongest performing, going into the next recovery phase.Let me demonstrate the power of this from the Great Financial Crisis.During the GFC, the REIT index got obliterated, losing nearly 2 3rds of its value from the Summer of '08 to the trough in March 2009, compared to  only  46  for the S P 500 .  and this is extremely important  those who bought REITs anywhere near their bottom in early 2009 were richly rewarded in the years after, as the REIT index outperformed the broader market   not considering REITs' higher dividend yields  until 2018On a total return basis  including dividends , REITs outperformed the market from their GFC trough all the way up to the beginning of COVID-19.The current selloff creates a very compelling opportunity for the long-term investor.Interest rates don't need to go all the way back to zero for REITs to outperform. They just need to stabilize at a more modest level in order to better align costs of capital with property cap rates. That will be a massive boon to REITs.Let's look at three of my favorite high-quality picks that I view as coiled springs, ready to outperform in the years ahead while generating strong dividend growth.If you've read my articles before, you've probably heard me pitch ARE multiple times. The Buy thesis remains the same, so I'll keep it brief here.ARE owns Class A, state-of-the-art life science   biotech laboratory properties located in the nation's most innovative and productive research clusters and leased to the world's most innovative and productive biotech companies.ARE has zero balance sheet stress. Its credit ratings are BBB Baa1. It has over  6 billion in liquidity. Slightly over 99  of debt is fixed-rate. And the weighted average debt maturity sits at 13.2 years  among the highest in the REIT space , with no maturities until 2025.The real concern is the amount of life science supply coming to market. Labspace is different than traditional office, and its demand outlook is vastly superior. But there are lots of traditional office owners redeveloping their empty buildings into new labs.The market is worried that this will spell the end of ARE's impressive record of double-digit rent growth.I'm not so sure.For one thing, the life science development pipeline is slowing down amid a drop in leasing activity This should eventually diminish the oversupply worries.Another, perhaps more important point is that ARE's property location and quality acts as a  moat  in itself. The best biotech tenants want to be located in the best life science buildings, especially those that are situated in highly productive research clusters -- multi-building campuses where biotech researchers congregate.Case in point  ARE expects to grow FFO per share by 6.4 , only a little shy of its 10-year average growth rate of 7.4 .Looking at price to operating cash flow, a proxy for FFO, we find that ARE has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFC.Between a 4.3  dividend yield and 6  average annual dividend growth rate, ARE looks like a phenomenal Buy for long-term dividend growth investors.CCI owns perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure portfolio in the United States, consisting of about 40,000 towers,  120,000 small cell nodes, and over 80,000 route miles of fiber cables.The telecom infrastructure REIT has taken a huge hit to investor sentiment from cancellations of tower leases used by Sprint due to the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile .The market seems to fear that CCI will never be able to revive growth. But management insists that it will be able to return to 5  organic revenue growth and 7-8  dividend growth after the bulk of the Sprint lease cancellations take effect in 2025. In fact, around 75  of this 5  revenue growth is already contracted through 2027.As I wrote in CCI's scale, cost of capital, and leading market position in small cells together act as major competitive advantages that should serve it well in the long run.Being priced at 13.3x AFFO, I think CCI has about 60-70  upside to a post-2025 fair value AFFO multiple of about 22x. That's on top of its 6  yielding dividend.By price-to-AFFO  and price to operating cash flow, as pictured above , CCI has  during its lifetime as a REIT.After its merger with Life Storage  LSI , EXR has become the largest owner and operator of self-storage properties.I like storage REITs because they have a strong history of outperformance as Americans have accumulated more stuff than they've been able to fit in the amount of housing they can afford, and therefore they've increasingly relied on storage units.In my estimation, EXR boasts best-in-class management  19-year average tenure for the executive team , cost of capital  BBB  credit rating , portfolio quality in top markets, and operational excellence. This operational advantage includes a top-tier technology package, which is one of the primary ways management expects the newly added LSI properties to outperform in the coming years as they are added to the system.There is perhaps no better way to exhibit EXR's quality than by looking at its massive long-term outperformance in total returns over its primary peer Public Storage  as well as the broader REIT index and the S P 500As for ARE, there is a lot of recent new supply of storage properties in many markets, which is expected to blunt rent growth for at least the next year. But also like for other property sectors, construction starts for new storage properties has plunged, which means that supply and demand should eventually come back into equilibrium and allow for organic growth to resume.EXR now yields 5.1 , far above its 5-year average of 3.4 , and the REIT has an extremely impressive history of dividend growth.And with an  80  payout ratio, that dividend looks well-protected and able to continue EXR's 13-year dividend growth streak.I wouldn't expect anything more than a measly raise next year, but a top-quality REIT like EXR is likely to return to strong growth within a few years.By price to operating cash flow, EXR has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFC in 2011.And at an AFFO multiple of 16.2x, EXR has about 35  upside to its 5-year average price-to-AFFO of  22x. I think shareholders will enjoy that upside and perhaps more within a few years.This is an exciting time to be a long-term REIT investor. The discounts offered for high-quality names across various sectors are ridiculous. But I'm not complaining. I'm buying.I believe buyers of blue-chip REITs will be richly rewarded for their bravery -- eventually.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

The Apartment Sector: Increasing Demand For Affordable Living,"In this paper, we will focusOver the past 12 months, demand for apartments has remained near record levels across key strategic markets and vacancy rates are well within their equilibrium ranges.Strong rent growth since the start of the pandemic has continued to fuel impressive NOI growth as leases have continued to roll up to market asking rents.SinceIf there has been a question mark regarding the apartment sector in both regions, it has been the high levels of development. In the U.S., the pace of new deliveries has pushed vacancy rates up toward their long term historical averages for institutionally managed properties  Exhibit 1 .Recent supply and demand trends may be somewhat misleading, however. Despite an increasing number of projects that are under construction, apartment units have been under-delivered over the past decade.Consequently, there has been a shortage of housing which has resulted in an affordability crisis in many major cities for both the rental and for-sale markets.In the U.S. for example, Exhibit 2  left chart  shows that since 1990 only 2.5 new multifamily units have been built for every thousand households - well below the average of 6.4 between 1960 and 1990.In Europe as well  right chart , construction permits issued for residential dwellings have yet to recover to their preGlobal Financial Crisis  GFC  levels.Most major markets in the U.S. and Europe are now facing a housing deficit with many needing more units to accommodate population growth than are currently being supplied. In fact, a research report from Freddie Mac - a U.S. government sponsored entity founded to provide liquidity to the residential sector - recently stated the U.S. needs an additional 3.8 million housing units to meet current demand growth.In Europe, the construction of new residential buildings is also unable to keep up with demand. The German Property Federation for example has reported that the deficit of housing in the country has reached its highest level in 20 years and that by 2025 the shortage may increase to 700,000 flats.As a result, across both sides of the Atlantic, the outlook for current landlords and developers remains positive and suggests that secular demand through demographics will provide a steady flow of new renters looking for space. While all property sectors rely on demographics as a primary demand driver, the residential housing sector, especially apartments, has an outsized reliance on population growth in prime renter age groups.Of particular importance is the shape of the population pyramid, which dictates where demand falls. Other important factors in conjunction with demographics are cultural norms that impact household formation and homeownership trends across regions.In the U.S. and Europe, a majority of households own their homes. Homeownership rates can vary greatly by country, however, with Romania having the highest rate of home ownership at 95.3  and Germany the lowest at 49.1 .Such high homeownership rates among Eastern European nations are an artifact of the rapid shift from planned- to market-based economics in the early 1990s.Due to the fiscal stress placed upon most former Eastern Bloc nations, tenants were offered a chance to purchase the dwellings in which they lived at low prices from the government.When we take into consideration amenities and quality of dwellings, high homeownership rates in these countries should not necessarily indicate a lack of demand for newer and higher-quality rental units.Rather, in many Eastern European nations, the relatively poor quality of existing housing stock could offer an interesting entry point for developers to provide more modern and highly amenitized apartment communities.If we look more broadly at the demographics associated with the rental population base, we establish that in both the U.S. and Europe, it is quite large.If we include the UK, there are roughly 357 million households in these regions, of which 32.1  are renters, meaning there are nearly 115 million rental households.The population trend charts suggest that in addition to existing rental households, there is an ample pool of renters that can provide increasing demand over the next decade.Millennials - those aged 27 to 42 - remain a dominant population group in both the U.S. and Europe, accounting for 20  of the population. Including Generation Z, the prime-renter age group expands to nearly 40 .While the U.S. and Europe are getting older with median ages of 38 and 44 years old respectively, younger generations have officially taken over from the Baby Boomers  Exhibit 4 .Young adults living with parents are another source of untapped demand. In many countries young adults are living at home longer than ever before. Data from the U.S. Census and Eurostat shows that between 2010 and 2022  the last year of available data , the share of young adults has increased.In the U.S. for example, people in the potential renter category living at home increased from 30  in 2010 to 31.4  in 2022, which represents roughly one million additional individuals who could form households and increase the demand for apartment units over the next few years.In Europe, the share of young adults living at home is structurally higher but has also increased over the past decade. More recently though, the share of young adults living at home has started to decline particularly post-pandemic, which will help drive demand for apartment units over the next cycle.Although the decision for young adults to live at home may be driven by numerous considerations, including cultural and social norms, family ties, and structural factors, it is also increasingly the case that affordability is becoming a larger issue.While affordability cuts across all segments of the residential sector, the current interest rate environment is both a blessing and a curse for the rental market. Monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe is very restrictive.In the U.S. for example, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate - the most popular financial options for homeowners - has increased to over 7  adversely affecting home price affordability, particularly for first-time home buyers looking for an accessible entry point into the for-purchase market.Historically, housing affordability has been dictated by a simple rule of thumb that allows a potential home buyer to estimate affordability as a house price of roughly three times their annual income.This has generally held up when applied to the median household when mortgage rates conform to spreads at equilibrium long-term rates. Nearly a decade of extraordinarily accommodative policy has rendered that relationship useless.House price-to-income ratios in the U.S. and the UK for example, have increased to roughly 5.5 due to exceptionally low interest rates following the GFC and again during the COVID-19 pandemic.In the U.S. for example, the median price of an existing house was  284,488 in December 2019 with an average commitment rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 3.7 .Today in the U.S. the median house price is roughly  400,000. Put another way, the rise in both interest rates and prices has increased the average payment for a home buyer by about  1,200 per month.The apartment sector to date has been a primary beneficiary of pricing increases within the singlefamily for-purchase market in both the U.S. and Europe. Just following the pandemic, U.S. markets saw net absorption in 2022 of 627 msf, which exceeded the prior record by more than 200 msf.The net result was a tightening of the market that saw apartment rents increase by 21  between 2020 and 2022 and, with it, a decline in overall affordability.In the U.S., the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  defines affordable housing as housing on which the occupant pays no more than 30  of gross income, including utilities.In the U.S., roughly 25  of markets we track would be deemed either unaffordable or at risk solely based on average asking rent and median household incomes across metro areas  Exhibit 7 .On the other side of the Atlantic, statistics from Eurostat revealed that 50  of market renters spent at least 40  of their income on housing in the European Union in 2021.Although more recent figures are not yet available, the spike in the cost of living and the rise in rents that occurred over the last year and a half have certainly worsened the average housing overburden rate, as nominal wages failed to keep up with rampant inflation.In Greece and the Netherlands for example, renters spend more than 30  of the income on housing. Across most European capitals, renting a one-bedroom flat in a central location can easily exceed the average worker's salary. The erosion of apartment affordability amid tight market conditions and strong rental increases recently has presented a quandary for many investors. While apartment rental values remain attractive relative to home ownership, they continue to stress household balance sheets on a practical basis.Portfolio managers looking to increase their allocation to the living sector and apartments are increasingly cognizant of rising cost pressures, particularly when it impacts new demand and tenant retention.While data on affordability are ample, hard data on the affordable housing market s performance are more nuanced and elusive. Many investors have multiple terms and definitions of what they deem to be affordable and there exists no hard benchmark for performance.Using HUD s definition of no more than 30  of a household s budget as a guideline for affordability, we can calculate the threshold for an affordable unit. At the median household income of  74,580 for 2022 in the U.S., the limit for an affordable unit would be  1,854 per month.Investors using a range around median household income of between 60  to 120 , which is typical in the industry today, would be able to target households with incomes between   45,000 to   90,000. This translates into a rental range of between of  1,120 to  2,240 per month.In the U.S., the national average for an institutionally managed two-bedroom unit is near the top of the affordable range. Fortunately, within the U.S. and Europe, there is a wide disparity between regions and apartment formats that provide investors with diversity.We suggest that investors focus on matching households in the middle of the income distribution with appropriately priced rentals. In the U.S., the middle of the household income distribution, as shown in Exhibit 9, ranges from  50,000 to  150,000 and represents 44  of all households and creates a very meaningful investment opportunity to serve. By focusing on middle-income households and diversifying investment portfolios across regions where apartment rents are more affordable, investors can ensure the ability to retain tenants and push moderate rent increases, thereby ensuring solid NOI growth and, ultimately, capital appreciation. While there is a decided lack of performance data for affordable or moderately priced housing, the literature suggests that such a strategy can offer both higher returns and lower volatility over time.A recent research paper, Moderate Income Rental Housing  Its Viability as an Asset Class for Real Estate Investment with Environmental, Social and Governance Criteria, used NCREIF data to estimate the performance of moderately priced rental properties against other segments of the NPI Apartment index, as well as comparing those results across other sectors.It found that between 2011 and 2021, moderately priced apartment properties produced a 9.3  return, outpacing all other major property sectors except for industrial  Exhibit 10 .4 The study can provide investors with some perspective and confidence as they look to increase exposure to the apartment sector.The apartment sector in both the U.S. and Europe continues to benefit from several structural tailwinds that are reshaping the way individuals live. Shifting dynamics within housing affordability and the distribution of income and wealth should provide the sector with a steady pace of demand over the coming decades.As the younger generations take over to become the dominant demographic groups in both size and spending power, we believe that investors should focus on the needs and desires of this growing pool of potential renters.The economic climate will dictate that investors focus on underserved segments of the income distribution, which will provide a stable renter base amid lower levels of affordability in the for-purchase market in both the U.S. and Europe.Shortages of rental units are also driving rents to unsustainable levels in many U.S. and European cities, thereby forcing many younger people to live at home longer.This has created a pool of untapped demand for the apartment market, particularly for affordable or moderately priced units. We believe that investors should concentrate on these underserved groups, particularly those in the middle third of the income distribution, which will allow for a diverse economic cross-section of renters at attainable entry points. , May 2021 , February 2023 Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2011 The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",1,2023-10-25T02:35:00.000-04:00

Jim will begin with some prepared remarks about the business and Sheri will follow with the financial review. Then we'll open up the call for questions.Today's call contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, and assumptions as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them after this call.Discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can be found in today's press release posted on our website.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. JimThank you, Rhonda. Total revenue for the third quarter came in as expected, increasing 3  over the second quarter. Our product business grew just over 5  as some WFE fundamental dynamics began to show small signs of improvement.We believe that some progress has been made for equipment inventory reduction throughout the system and expect several more quarters until normal levels are achieved.WeOur typically high-margin service business saw an abrupt decline in revenue due toFor the foreseeable future, we will continue to focus on optimizing our global footprint, driving operational efficiencies, and other strategic initiatives to further increase our value for our customers. These efforts will lay the foundation required to capitalize on share gain opportunities heading into the next ramp.We are in a strong position to increase our semi manufacturing leadership position with the available capacity and geographic flexibility to meet accelerated demand when it returns.Along those lines, we are very pleased to report that we have acquired HIS Innovations Group. They provide design, manufacturing, integration of components process solutions, and fully integrated subsystems to the semiconductor subfab segment.This acquisition adds a higher gross margin and value product offering, increases our vertical capabilities and synergies, extends our reach into the subfab area, and expands our addressable market by approximately  1.5 billion.With over 60 fabs under construction globally, this acquisition aligns with our long-term strategy to pursue sustained and profitable growth and will be rolled into our product division.Lastly, we are deeply saddened and concerned by the current events in the Middle East. We are taking the situation very seriously and I'm relieved to say that all our employees are accounted for and we're doing all we can to assist with their safety and well-being.Both of our facilities in Israel are running at the capacity required to meet production targets. Our commitment to support our customers worldwide remains a priority. Israel's policy ensures business continuity across the industrial segment, some ports and airports are currently functioning, and we can ship and receive the products and raw materials required to meet customer demand. We're also working together with other multinational companies that have substantial operations in Israel to ensure we are aligned and supporting each other.Overall, we are navigating through the demand variability in the current environment. Longer term, our increased scale, operational efficiencies, expanded capacity, and new capabilities position us well to maintain our leadership position and outperform the industry.And with that, I will turn the call over to Sheri.Thanks Jim and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. In today's discussion, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers only. As Jim noted, our products business performed well from a revenue standpoint in the third quarter. Our services business, however, was impacted by a sudden larger-than-expected reduction in wafer starts in Q3 and that impacted our overall profitability and earnings.Total revenue for the third quarter was  435 million compared to  421.5 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from products increased 5.1  to  380.9 million compared to  362.5 million last quarter. Services revenue was  54.1 million compared to  59 million in Q2 due to the scale back and wafer starts as I just mentioned.Total gross margin for the third quarter was 15.5  compared to 16.7  last quarter. Although product revenue grew sequentially, gross margin came in at 13.8  compared to 14.5  in the prior quarter and services was 27.4  compared to 30.3  in Q2.The reduction in margin was due to lower volumes for service and overall mix within each business unit. We continue to focus on cost improvements and operational efficiencies to strengthen profitability.Operating expenses for the quarter was  48.6 million compared with  49.4 million in Q2 and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 11.2  from 11.7 . Total operating margin for the quarter was 4.4  compared to 5  in the second quarter.Margins from our Products division was 4.5  compared to 4.3  in the prior quarter and services margin was 3.7  compared to 9.3  in the prior quarter. The drop in services margin was due to lower volumes and mix.Based on 45 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter was  0.04 on net income of  2 million compared to  0.16 on net income of  7.1 million in the prior quarter.Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.3  due to a shift in profits by geography. Our tax rate was trued up in Q3 for year-to-date expense and we expect our tax rate for Q4 and 2023 to be approximately 20 .Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents were  342 million, an increase of  21.2 million over Q2. Cash from operations was  36.2 million, similar to last quarter at  36.4 million.As we navigate through the current cycle, we will continue to manage our working capital. Given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and current industry dynamics, we are keeping our guidance range wide.With the addition of HIS Innovations Group, we project total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 between  420 million and  470 million. We expect EPS in the range of  0.02 to  0.22. This includes approximately  10 million of revenue and  0.01 of EPS for two months of operations from the acquisition.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator InstructionsThe first question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Krish. Let's see first just in terms of the service sales this quarter. I know they're a bit weaker on utilization rates last quarter, and you mentioned the sudden reduction of wafer starts impacting in September.Was there -- the main qualifier for this quarter  Or was there anything else in maybe just in terms of the mix that goes into the service division, if you've ever broken that down.Yes, hi Robert. The first part, we have seen reductions in wafer starts across the broad spectrum of fabs prior to this last quarter. What we saw early in the third quarter was one particular chipmaker, ratchet down mostly their memory fab pretty dramatically. They've been holding that up for half the time when others had already brought their utilizations down. So, that was -- I guess, you'd say, the last month will really fall. So, that was the main impact there.As far as your second question around the mix, I think maybe my answer on the first might answer that. But service is typically more dependent on logic than memory, but this is a rather large memory fab and had an outsized impact.Great. Thank you. And then maybe just real quick in terms of the timing of seeing the ramp down of that one customer is there any indication of maybe when the sales would pick back up. Is that something you think services would be growing next quarter or something more into calendar year 2024  Thanks.Yes, really difficult to predict. We're starting to see some of the fundamentals of supply and demand of these chips start to move towards a better balance. We start to see some ASP on some of these chips start to recover a bit.So, things are moving in the right direction, but as far as when the customers will start ramping up the supply side of the chips and use their utilization is up, it's still unclear. But I would say it's doubtful to see anything meaningful within this year.Great. Thank you. That s helpful.Operator Instructions  At this time, we're showing no more questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Scholhamer for any closing remarks.Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-25T19:57:08.000-04:00
"Mixed Signals For Earnings And Spending In Japan, But The BoJ Is Likely To Move On","We had expected to see some acceleration in earnings given the reasonably strong wage negotiation results from the last quarter, but disappointingly, headline growth rose 1.1  year-on-yearSeparately, real household spending rebounded 3.9  month-on-month in August, more than offsetting the previous month's decline of 2.7 . In year-on-year terms, it fell 2.5  versus 5.0  in July and the market consensus of 3.9 . We believe that household spending held up relatively well despite high inflation andThe Bank of Japan will meet for its upcoming policy decision meeting at the end of this month. The BoJ's policy choices are fairly limited, which puts the central bank in a difficult situation. Inflation has been above target for more than a year with no clear signs of slowing down, especially in core inflation. Meanwhile, both supply and demand inflationary pressures will likely add up even more in the coming months.The weak JPY is likely to pile more pressure on import product prices alongside the recent rise in global commodity prices, while strong tourism should also push up private service prices. Surveys and other activity data showed quite a solid recovery in services, which should remain the case in the second half of the year despite global headwinds.However, long-awaited wage growth remains quite lacklustre so far. As a result, the possibility of the BoJ hiking rates will be off the table for quite some time. Yet, the higher-for-longer narrative seen in the US pushed up JGB 10Y yields to the 0.8  level, which immediately raised concerns for the BoJ. We think it needs to respond to the recent market move with another yield curve control  YCC  policy change   and perhaps even consider the option of scrapping the policy. We believe that changes in forward guidance could be a good way to communicate with the market on its future policy move.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

"TotalEnergies: Energy Prices And Russia Drag On Earnings, But Still Decent Company","On Thursday, October 26, 2023, European energy supermajor TotalEnergies SE   its third quarter 2023 earnings results. At first glance, these results were mixed, as TotalEnergies managed to beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of revenueThe fact that TotalEnergies' revenues went down year-over-year is not necessarily anything that we need to worry about. After all, it was certainly not the only energy company to have experienced such a phenomenon with respect to its results. Exxon Mobil , which also reported lastAs long-time readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company's earnings results before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from TotalEnergies' third-quarter 2023 earnings resultsIt seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that many measures of TotalEnergies' financial performance came in weaker during the third quarter of 2023 than they did during the equivalent quarter of last year. One of the biggest reasons for this is that energy prices were lower on average during the most recent quarter than they were during the third quarter of last year. We can see this quite clearly hereWe can see that the price of oil did finally start to rise during this quarter following several months of suppression partly caused by the United States Federal Government flooding the market from oil using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Basically, as I  earlier this year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia made the decision to cut crude oil production in order to keep the balance between supply and demand very tight. In effect, what these cuts were intended to do was offset the impact of the sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The cuts remain in this place to this day, yet the Federal Government stopped selling oil from its stockpile back in mid-July. As of right now, there are 351.274 million barrels of crude oil in the nation's storage, which is the lowest level that has been seen since the early 1980sAs such, the United States probably cannot use its national storage stocks to artificially manipulate the price of crude oil anymore. After all, there is a minimum amount of crude oil that needs to be stored in the salt caverns simply to maintain their structural integrity. Thus, with the cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remaining in effect, the balance between the supply and demand for crude oil became tighter and pushed up energy prices.However, we still see in the chart above that the average price of crude oil was lower in the third quarter of this year than during the equivalent quarter of last year. This is reflected in TotalEnergies' results, as the company reported that it received an average of  78.90 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the quarter compared to  93.60 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the equivalent quarter of last year. It should be fairly obvious why this would have a negative impact on TotalEnergies' financial performance. After all, if the company received less money per unit of product sold, then its overall revenue will be lower all else being equal.However, all else is rarely equal with a company like TotalEnergies. As noted in the highlights, the company saw its production decline in the most recent quarter compared to the equivalent one last year. During the third quarter of 2023, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.476 million barrels of oil equivalents per day. That was a 7.23  decline from the 2.669 million barrels of oil equivalents per day that the company averaged during the year-ago quarter. That also had a negative impact on the company's financial performance. After all, a lower production means that it has fewer products that it can sell in exchange for money.When we combine the company's lower production with the fact that it received less money per unit of product sold, it should be fairly easy to see why the company's revenue would go down from period to period. The decline in revenue generally means that the company has less money available to cover its fixed expenses and similar things, which results in a decline in operating income. That is exactly what we see here.With that said, the company's crude oil production was actually up, even though its total production was down year-over-yearAs we can see, crude oil production went up by 101,000 barrels per day on average, which represents a 7.78  increase. This was more than offset by a massive decline in the company's production of natural gas, which decreased its oil-equivalent production overall. Perhaps the biggest reason for this appears to relate to the sanctions that the United States and the European Union have levied on Russia. According to a  that the company issued in March of 2022The company does not explicitly state in its earnings press release that it was the removal of Novatek  from its results reporting around the end of last year that is responsible for the production decline that we see reflected in these results. However, it seems likely as the company states that its hydrocarbon production went up once Novatek's production is excluded from the year-ago figures. During the third quarter of 2022, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.356 million barrels of oil equivalents per day excluding Novatek's contribution to its upstream production figures. The company's production excluding Novatek was 2.476 million barrels per day on average during the most recent quarter. That was a 5.09  year-over-year increase. Thus, it seems likely that one major contributor to TotalEnergies' weaker financial performance year-over-year is because of the Russian sanctions that were levied due to the situation in Ukraine.TotalEnergies did benefit from a few new sources of production in the quarter. These include the following projectsThe company states that these projects alone increased its year-over-year hydrocarbon production by 5 . While this was partially offset by things such as natural field production declines and the aforementioned problems with TotalEnergies' stake in Novatek, it is still good to see that some projects are coming on that are having a positive impact on the company. Clearly, it is not all bad news here.As I have explained in numerous previous articlesAs of the time of writing, interest rates in most developed nations are at the highest rates that have been seen in many years. After all, most developed countries printed enormous amounts of money to help support their economies through the COVID-19 lockdowns and this sparked a worldwide inflation crisis. Most central banks in the Group of Twenty nations have been raising interest rates over the past two years in an effort to combat this inflation crisis. However, TotalEnergies has not really been impacted by rising rates so far. As we can see here, while the company's interest expenses have indeed been rising over the past few quarters, its investment income has also been risingThis is partly due to the fact that energy companies in general have been using some of their good fortunes from supportive energy prices over the past few years to strengthen their balance sheets. That has been quite necessary considering that the market has not been especially friendly to traditional energy companies in general. As might be expected given these two factors, TotalEnergies has been reducing its net debt over the past several quartersThis has allowed the company to offset some of the impact of higher rates as it has a lesser amount of debt upon which it needs to pay financing costs. Meanwhile, the company has kept its cash and cash equivalents at a relatively stable levelThis has allowed the company to increase the amount of interest that it collects from things such as money market funds and short-duration bonds. This has helped to offset the added amount of interest that the company needs to pay on the debt that it continues to carry. Thus, the company's net interest expenses have not really been too badly impacted by the rising rate environment. This is certainly a better situation than what we have seen with companies in sectors such as utilities  see .As is always the case, we should take a moment to have a look at TotalEnergies' financial structure. The usual way that we accomplish this is by looking at the net debt-to-equity ratio. As shown above, TotalEnergies had a net debt outstanding of  26.690 billion on September 30, 2023. On the same date, the company had a total equity of  118.424 billion. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.23 today. Here is how that compares to some of the company's peersAs we can see here, TotalEnergies has considerably more debt than comparable American companies but it does compare reasonably well to its European peers. This is a sign that the company is probably not overly reliant on debt to finance its operations. We should not have to worry too much about the company's debt load, even in today's relatively high-rate environment.TotalEnergies has long been known for offering a relatively high dividend yield compared to many other assets that are available in the market. It is not necessarily alone in this though, as the entire energy sector is one of the highest-yielding sectors in the market. Indeed, the iShares Global Energy ETF , which tracks a portfolio of major traditional energy companies from around the world currently yields 4.58 , which is substantially higher than many other sector index funds.For its part, TotalEnergies currently has a 4.64  yield so its stock certainly does not disappoint in this respect. After all, there are not very many common stocks that boast such a high yield and have relatively strong forward growth prospects. Unfortunately, TotalEnergies' dividend has not been especially stable over the yearsOne of the biggest reasons for this is that TotalEnergies declares and pays its dividends in euros, despite the fact that the company actually reports its results in U.S. dollars. The fact that it actually pays the dividend in euros means though that those investors who hold the American Depositary Receipts  which is anyone who buys the shares that trade on an American exchange  receive the U.S. dollar equivalent of the dividend. It is pretty common for foreign companies owned by American investors to have a dividend that fluctuates with exchange rates for this reason.As is always the case though, we want to ensure that the company can actually afford the dividends that it pays out. After all, we do not want to be the victims of an unexpected dividend cut since that would reduce our incomes and almost certainly cause the company's share price to decline.The usual way that we judge a company's ability to cover its dividend is by looking at its free cash flow. During the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2023, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of  27.2054 billion but only paid out dividends of  7.5940 billion. Thus, the company easily generated more than enough cash through its ordinary operations to cover its dividends.We see the same general thing when we measure the company's free cash flow and dividends in euros. During the twelve-month period, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of  25.7336 billion but only paid out  7.1832 billion in dividends to the shareholders. Thus, the company is clearly not having any particular difficulty maintaining its dividends. We should not need to worry too much about a potential cut., TotalEnergies will grow its earnings per share at a 9.30  rate over the next three to five years. This gives the stock a price-to-earnings growth ratio of 0.73 at the current price. That suggests that the stock is undervalued at the current price. However, as I have pointed out in a variety of articles and blog posts over the past several months, nearly everything in the traditional energy industry appears to be significantly undervalued right now.Thus, the best way for us to value the company is by comparing TotalEnergies' valuation to its peers in order to determine which stock offers the most attractive relative valuation.As we can see here, TotalEnergies appears to boast a very reasonable valuation relative to many of its peers. This could suggest that the company's stock is worth purchasing today. That is especially true considering the rather strong fundamentals for crude oil, which we have discussed in numerous previous articles here at Energy Profits in Dividends.In conclusion, TotalEnergies' third quarter 2023 earnings results were overall quite decent even if they were worse than the company's numbers during the prior-year quarter. The fact that energy prices were lower in the reporting period compared to 2022 was a major drag on the firm's performance and the sanctions that have been levied by the Western powers on Russia also do not help. Despite this though, TotalEnergies still looks like a reasonable purchase right now as the company's valuation remains attractive and its balance sheet is strong. The fact that it sports a 4.64  yield at the current price only adds to its appeal. Overall, the company may be worth considering today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Ladder Capital: The Perfect Storm,"A few days ago, I wrote a  highlighting a few of my favorite commercial mREITs.As I consistently remind readers, I like owning commercial mREITs because I get the best of bothNow, to be clear, price appreciation is not guaranteed.And neither are high dividends.And that s why I maintain a healthy mix of mREITs and preferreds.I ve been adding more of both to my REIT portfolio that now looks something like thisI like this blueprint because it provides me with enhanced yield  preferreds and mREITs  as well as attractive total return attributes.I was fortunate to get greedy during COVID-19 and increase my exposure within the commercial mREIT sector.Of course, these returns were generated during unprecedented times, andAs you can see  above ,  was one of my top COVID picks which means that our team had to dig deep into the business model in order to gain confidence in our Strong Buy recommendation.As you can see, LADR is now trading at  10.58  per share  and shares have returned 12.3  year to dateLet s dig deeper into this interesting commercial mREIT so you can see firsthand why I m buying more shares hand over fist.In case you re not familiar with mREITs, a few excerpts from our overviewWithin the commercial mREIT sector, you can break down the REITs into two categories They originate or purchase loans for their own balance sheet and hold these on their balance sheet. Examples include Blackstone Mortgage  and Apollo Commercial . They originate and or purchase loans for their own account  balance sheet  or to be sold into a securitized vehicle such as CMBS  conduit . Examples include Starwood Property  and Ladder Capital.While senior secured lending is Ladder s core business, the REIT is diversified as shown belowAs you can see, more than 50  of LADR s assets are unencumbered and 84  of these unencumbered assets are comprised of first mortgage loans, investment-grade securities, and cash and cash equivalents.LADR maintains a considerable surplus of unencumbered assets over the amount required by its covenants, currently totaling over  1 billion. This cushion provides the company with a great deal of flexibility and enhances its liquidity profile.The balance sheet portfolio totals  3.5 billion with a weighted average coupon of 9.15 .Breaking down the loan portfolio, LADR focuses on middle market borrowers with an average loan size of  25 million  largest loan in the portfolio is  221 million . Compare that with these peersThis means that LADR takes a nimbler approach and is less exposed to large loans that could result in concentration risks. Since inception in 2008, Ladder has originated  45 billion of loans in more than 475 cities across 48 states.As you can see, Ladder is not a construction lender and has modest funding of just  272 million  as of Q2-23 . Importantly, the company s loan portfolio is 99  senior secured  first mortgage loans  with an average LTV  loan to value  of 67 . Compare that with these peersAs you can see above, LADR s loan portfolio is comprised ofWhile LADR is exposed to the office sector, 75  of these loans were originated post-COVID.In addition, two of the office loans  Miami and Aventura  account for 36  of the office exposure. These two larger loans  221 million and  110 million  have 30  borrower equity  around  138 million in total  with excellent performance.LADR did add a new loan to nonaccrual in Q2-23, a  35 million loan on a mixed-use asset in which LADR is pursuing foreclosure. The borrower s basis is  55 million which is comprised of 174 newly constructed multifamily units and three floors of office and commercial space in Pittsburgh.As mentioned previously, LADR owns around  900 million of  brick and mortar  real estate that consists of net lease properties  72  of real estate owned  and others  28 .The net lease portfolio consists of 156 properties leased to high-quality tenants  69  investment grade  like BJs, Walgreens, and Dollar General. The portfolio s gross asset value is around  663 million with a weighted average remaining lease term of nine years.The net lease portfolio generates  41.7 million of NOI and the other properties generate around  18.8 million annually.LADR s CMBS business is mostly confined to five-year loans, the carrying value of the securities portfolio is around  458 million, comprised of 82  AAA-rated and 99  investment-grade rated securities.In Q2 LADR received  75 million of paydowns. In Q2 LADR began to take advantage of opportunities to add to its securities portfolio by acquiring additional AAA CLO securities that are currently offering highly attractive returns.As of Q2-23 LADR had  1.1 billion of liquidity with a leverage ratio of 1.7x. This liquidity was comprised of  777 million plus undrawn revolver capacity of  324 million  with a maturity in 2027 .Unsecured bonds anchor the capital stack with  1.6 billion outstanding, or 40  of debt with a weighted maturity of 4.3 years with an attractive fixed rate cost of capital of 4.7  average coupon.LADR has a strong financial condition with a corporate credit rating one notch from investment grade  two of three rating agencies . LADR has a  50 million share buyback authorization in place with  44 million of remaining capacity  no purchases in Q2-23 .One key differentiator for LADR is its modest total leverage with a highly durable composition of financing alternatives.LADR emphasizes on unsecured and non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing with a substantial unencumbered asset base  as shown below .84  of unencumbered assets are cash, first mortgage loans, or investment grade securitiesAnother differentiator for LADR is management.The company is one of the few internally managed mREITs in which management and directors own  10  of the company  150 million equity investment . Also, employees are compensated based on profits and with a significant portion in stock.The executive management team averages 27 years of industry experience and the majority of the management team has worked together for  25 years.As seen below, this deep bench of seasoned professionals   managers average 11 years at Ladder and 23 years of industry experience.As seen below, LADR trades at  10.58 per share with a P E multiple of 8.1x   around 50  below the normal P E.The dividend yield is 8.7 , lower than most of the peers that average around 11 .Like many mREITs, LADR s earnings history is choppy.Unlike traditional equity REITs, mREITs like LADR generate revenue from loans which makes the earnings stream less predictable.As you can see below, the company generated EPS of  2.03 in 2018 and fell to  .49 in 2021. In 2022 the company generated EPS of  1.16 and analysts forecast  1.37 in 2023.LADR was forced to reduce its dividend in 2020 which resulted in a dividend payout of  .80 in 2021.Last year LADR paid out  .88 per share and currently the company is paying out  .23 per share  .92 per share annualized .Analysts are forecasting EPS of  1.37 in 2023, which means there s a cushion in which the company could payout a special dividend this year  which it has in previous years .Using the analyst numbers, LADR s payout ratio in 2023 is around 67 .As one analyst pointed out on the Q2-23 earnings call, LADR has  significantly over-earned it  dividend  year-to-date  which means that there s a good chance that LADR will boost the dividend  and perhaps gift a special dividend in December .Let s compare a few peersNow let s compare LADR s P E with the peersInterestingLADR has the lowest payout ratio and one of the best balance sheets in the sector and yet shares are trading at a discount  to the peers .Now let s take a look at analyst estimates for 2024 and 2025.While LADR may be the lowest-paying mREIT on our shopping list, we believe the total return prospects are compelling. The dividend is well protected, and I like the fact that LADR owns real estate  mostly net lease real estate .I believe shares are worth more than  10.58 and they could fetch as much as  12.00.Given the fact that commercial banks are slowing down dramatically  which faces more pressure on small developers with lingering debt maturities , LADR is well positioned to capitalize on new demand.Some of the demand will be in the form of traditional senior secured lending, and some will be in the form of growing mezzanine loans. As CEO, Brian Harris, said,  This is a market that is ripe for mezzanine lending, obviously, in special situations.I like this line of thinking.Traditionally mezz loans are riskier, but Harris is looking to provide an A B component which means splitting up the senior secured  in a 10-year fixed rate instrument  and the mezz loan  on LADR s books .Given the fact that LADR s wheelhouse is  middle market  customers  average  25 million loan size , this could create a lot of demand.Of course, LADR has plenty of powder right now   around  900 million   and I suspect the company will begin to put that to good use sooner than later.We believe LADR could return over 20  annually, which ain't bad given the fact that the yield is currently 8.7  with a likely boost coming soon.If I were a regional developer  like I once was  and I knew my shopping center loan was coming due  and my bank would not renew it , I would be knocking on LADR's door.Remember folks, the game is all about supply and demand.And managing risk is what separates the best from the rest.I like my odds with LadderJoin  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

"Clarus: Promising Initiatives, But Risks Still Present","Shares of Clarus  have fallen 20  YTD. Despite the fact that the company's management is quite optimistic about the future performance of the business, I believe that it is still not the best time to open aDespite significant pressure on both revenue growth and operating margins, management is fairly optimistic for the second half of 2023, but I believe the company's financials will continue to be under pressure in the next quarter, while shares are still not cheaply priced. In addition, the improvement in profitability is largely due to the recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment, which, in my personal opinion, is associated withClarus designs, develops, and manufactures outdoor equipment and products. The main business segments are Outdoor  48  of revenue , Precision Sports  31  of revenue  and Adventure  21  of revenue . The company makes sales both in the domestic market  56  of revenue  and in the international market  44  of revenue . The company was founded in 1957.The company . The company's . Domestic sales were down 27.2  YoY and international sales were down 27.1  YoY. In terms of business segments, the largest contribution to the decline in revenue was made by the Outdoor segment, where revenue decreased by 23.8  YoY, while in the Precision Sports and Adventure segments sales decreased by 26.7  YoY and 34.2   YoY, respectively. You can see the details of the revenue mix changes in the graph below.Gross profit margin decreased from 38.0  in Q2 2022 to 36.7  in Q2 2023 due to unfavourable changes in product mix and unfavourable FX. Separately, I would like to note the change in gross profit margin for each of the segments. Thus, we see the greatest decrease in the Precision Sports segment, where gross profit margin decreased from 44.9  to 31.7  due to the need to reduce prices due to high inventory levels in the industry, and in the Outdoor and Adventure segments, gross profit margin increased from 33.1  to 37.5  and from 38.5  to 42.2 , respectively. SGA expenses   of revenue  increased from 30.8  in Q2 2022 to 36.1  in Q2 2023.Operating margin decreased from 6.8  in 2Q 2022 to -0.3  in 2Q 2023. In the graph below, I would also like to demonstrate adjusted operating income, because in the 4th quarter of 2022, the company faced one-time expenses for impairment of goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets in the amount of  92.3 million.If we pay attention to the operating margin by business segment, we see that profitability continues to decline in all segments. Thus, operating margin in the Outdoor segment decreased from 2.8  to -3.1 , and in the  Precision Sports  and  Adventure  from 34.8  to 20.4  and from 2.4  to -2.8 , respectively.In addition, the company published guidance for 2023. Thus, management expects that in the second half of the year the company will show a decrease in revenue growth rates in the range from 0.5  to 7.3 , and the adjusted EBITDA margin will improve to 20.6 -22.8 .On the one hand, I am impressed by the current management initiatives  transforming our product development and innovation process, improving customer service and digital transformation , which are aimed at restoring business revenue growth rates and improving profitability.However, on the other hand, in my personal opinion, the operational and financial performance may take longer to recover, so I expect the company's financial performance to continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters. First, I think pressure on sales in the Outdoor segment  48  of revenue  will continue in the second half of 2023 because I do not expect a quick recovery in consumer spending, even if we see a slowdown in inflation, because consumers will continue to face increased day-to-day costs. If we look at  following the earnings release, we can see that management is talking about similar trends.In addition, the company published strong guidance, which implies a recovery in growth rates and profitability, however, if we look at the guidance in more detail, we can see that the main recovery is associated only with the 4th quarter of 2023, while in the next quarter  3Q 23  the pace Sales growth will continue to be under significant pressure.I would also like to note that the restoration of profitability is associated with an improvement in gross margin in the Precision Sports segment, where the company experienced the largest decline. However, it is my personal opinion that high inventory levels in the industry, consumer pressure from macro headwinds, and a decrease in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home will continue to put pressure on profitability in the segment. So I think the current guidance looks optimistic, but the financials are still quite uncertain.Moreover, I think that additional pressure on profitability may be exerted by the deleverage effect due to a decrease in the scale of the business because part of the operating expenses  salaries, distribution  is fixed. lower consumer spending, high industry inventory levels, and a decline in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home could put pressure on revenue growth rates in the coming quarters. investments in prices, unfavourable product mix, unfavourable changes in FX, increased marketing costs, and deleverage effects due to reduced economies of scale may have a negative impact on the operating profitability of the business. launch of new products, simplification of the cooperation model with partners, and expansion of the e-commerce platform for B2B and B2C sales may contribute to revenue growth in the future. recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment due to the normalization of supply and demand before the hunting season can provide significant support to the operating profitability of the business.Valuation Grade is C . In accordance with the P E  FWD  and EV EBITDA  FWD  multiples, the company's shares are trading at 7.5x and 8.5x, respectively, which implies a discount to the sector median of about 47  and 7 , respectively. Despite the fact that the stock doesn't look expensive, I believe investors need to wait for the next quarter's financial results before making a purchase decision because  1  I believe the company deserves a discount based on the size of the business 2   shares may trade at relatively low prices for long periods of time in the absence of clear growth drivers catalysts  revenue growth, improved profitability .Thus, at the moment my recommendation is hold. I believe that pressure on both revenue growth and profitability may continue in the coming quarters, while the shares are still not cheaply priced. I will be happy to change my recommendation to buy if I see that the company is able to demonstrate stable and sustainable improvements in financial performance in both domestic and international markets.

Argentina Lithium: $90 Million Investment From Stellantis Implies A Substantial Upward Rerate,"Argentina Lithium   Energy Corp.  has been a trending stock in Canada since the afternoon of September 27th when it  a  90 million USD-equivalent investment made by Stellantis N.V. . StellantisDespite the move up, I believe that LIT still has an upside potential of over 100  as a  0.55 stock price implies a  72 million CAD market cap, less than the money being received in the deal. Not only does LIT require a substantial upward re-rate, I believe that this deal is an absolute game-changer for all junior lithium plays in the region.Canadian junior market traders have witnessed a long history of claims from microcap resource explorers getting deals with larger companies that were either faked or greatly overstated. So there was understandably some nervousness or skepticism about this deal. Once it closed and documentation on SEDAR  the Canadian equivalent to SEC.gov  filed, there was no longer any issue about the deal being fake. What remains are two other criticisms1. Stellantis overpaid for LIT and could have just bought it out for that level of investment.2. Stellantis overpaid for LIT relative to other lithium players in Argentina.Had Stellantis just offered  90 million in a takeover offer, it likely would have succeeded in a buyout attempt based on the stock price prior to the deal being announced. However, Stellantis isn't interested in making an investment in a lithium company the same way private investors would, nor is it interested in operating a mine itself. Its interest in LIT is primarily in sourcing and securing a supply of lithium in Argentina so that it has enough of the resources to build its fleet of electric vehicles. It is willing to far overpay relative to market cap in order to ensure that LIT has enough cash and financial motivation to build out a mine and ship lithium to the company's front door starting in 2028. Stellantis has the right of first refusal on any future financing needed or sale of lithium to third parties on production beyond the 15,000 tonnes outlined in the offtake agreement. Further evidence that the company's primary motivation is securing supply and making sure LIT has the cash to get the mine operational, regardless of cost.The second argument is a more interesting one, and could imply a substantial upward re-rate for other junior lithium players that have mostly been overlooked while the price of lithium has crashed recently. But after speaking with LIT's CEO Nikolaos Cacos, it's clear that Stellantis had direct company-related reasons to target LIT. The two companies were negotiating the deal for over a year, and closed it despite the drop in the price of lithium. One prime motivating factor was Joseph Grosso being the Chairman of LIT, and the . Grosso has a history of success bringing resource projects to operations in Argentina, a very important factor when dealing with the sensitive and volatile nature of the country's geopolitical and economic climate.The other major motivating factor was location. LIT's  is Rincon West, a 3,742.8 hectare-sized land package  460.5 hectares wholly owned, the rest under option  that is adjacent to Rio Tinto Group . Rio   825 million for the 83,000 hectares of mining rights from Rincon Mining less than two years ago. Stellantis was very interested in securing supply from this specific spot as the lithium arm's race in the Argentinian Lithium Triangle heats up.However, Stellantis isn't solely interested in Rincon West, although that will likely be the near-term focus. LIT has three projects just south of Rincon West with Antofalla North, Pocitos and Incahuasi being approximately 10,000, 26,000 and 25,000 hectare projects, respectively. So Rincon only makes up around 5  of the total land in the Lithium Triangle that is either wholly owned or under option to LIT. There is a lot of lithium potential for this company and it's all proximal to each other, which was likely the clinching factor for Stellantis calling first dibs. In this context, a  60 billion market cap company  overpaying   90 million for a  20  stake in a company that has secured about 65,000 hectares within the Triangle makes sense.The company's  shows that Rincon has an active drill program underway with drilling planned in Antofalla North in 2024. These projects are all in the early to very early stages and will take years before fully operational mines are present, but this is no issue for Stellantis as it's looking to secure resource for planned production five years from now. The single biggest obstacle to roadmaps being achieved in the junior capital world is a company's ability to fund all of its plans. With that obstacle removed for LIT and a large partner interested in seeing things move along as quickly as possible, I expect these timelines to be met or possibly even exceeded. Subject to timing of government permits and availability of equipment and labor in the region.If we are thinking from the perspective of a large automaker trying to secure supply within a competitive Lithium Triangle, Stellantis didn't overpay, it paid the amount it needed to pay to accomplish a needed goal for future development plans. I liken this to an NFL football team that is desperate to secure a quarterback in the draft with the 5th overall pick. The teams drafting ahead of them already picked quarterbacks. Now this team has to draft what it feels is the next best one available with the 5th pick, even if that QB is rated the 10th or 15th or 20th or 25th best prospect overall by all the so-called experts. The team will have tryouts and interviews with the QBs leading up to the draft, and then analyze which one still available best fits their organization.It doesn't matter what other people think of LIT's land package or accomplishments relative to other junior explorers in the region. They aren't the multi-billion dollar vehicle manufacturer ponying up  90 million betting on LIT's future ability to perform. It only matters what Stellantis thinks. The rest of the investment community must make its own buy and sell decisions knowing that Stellantis is highly motivated and capable to ensure LIT succeeds.As one member of that investment community, I have to assess what I believe to be a fair value for LIT based on the information I have, as well as the caveats and potential roadblocks that must be overcome to get to that valuation in a timely fashion.As with every explorer, LIT is pre-revenue. It has about  2 million in expenses a quarter and this burn rate will substantially increase going forward as it attempts to accomplish the plans laid out in the roadmap for its four properties. Given the substantial investment by Stellantis, I believe that financing risk is completely taken off the table, as long as Stellantis remains a solvent entity. Any unexpected cost overruns or delays to expected production in 2028 might result in dilution but won't result in insolvency. I expect the cash runway from the investment to be a minimum of three years and if that cash is spent wisely, any further financing will happen at a superior valuation than today.Argentina has historically been reasonably friendly to mining, and I don't expect that to change given the economic opportunity that lithium will provide the country. Being a member of the Grosso Group and getting the deal with Stellantis are two pieces of assurance that the company will be able to navigate at least one project through to production by 2028.Stellantis is paying  90 million for an option to hold a 19.9  stake in the public listing, fully diluted. If Stellantis exercises this option, it would receive 53 million shares  out of a then total 266 million , essentially paying approximately  1.70 USD or  2.30 CAD for the shares. The simplistic analysis would be that if Stellantis is willing to pay that much, investors should be able to feel comfortable holding until at least that price range. But it may not be that simple.The first issue to overcome is that this deal is in Argentinian Pesos. Due to the country's high inflation rate, the currency has been on a consistent downward trajectory. Therefore, LIT is looking to transfer most of that cash into USD and CAD, with some expected slippage in the 10  range. I expect the net result to be  80 million USD or  110 million in CAD.There are currently 130.2 million shares outstanding along with 71.7 million warrants with a weighted average strike of  0.44 and 11.3 million stock options with a weighted average strike of  0.31. In the week between announcing the deal and closing the deal, SEDAR documentation shows that 150,000 warrants were exercised for shares. This share overhang may have accounted for the pullback in the stock price and may continue to apply some selling pressure going forward. Upon exercise of all of those derivatives, the share count would increase to 213 million but would also lead to an additional  35 million in cash.Between the  110 million CAD-equivalent received from the Stellantis deal and  35 million from the exercise of derivatives, total cash in the bank would be  145 million,  0.68 per share. This is a reasonable floor valuation for LIT. The cash from Stellantis is earmarked for exploration and mine development costs or the purchase of additional properties in Argentina with some corporate expenses allowed. It can't be used for purposes like buying back stock or paying dividends. However, I don't see how cash received from the exercising of warrants would have that same restriction. It might seem silly to use cash received from the exercise of warrants to buy back shares, but in this circumstance, it makes sense to do so should the stock remain below the  0.68 level for an extended period of time. That may be one way to offset any overhang from the warrants being exercised.The component of the deal that will provide LIT investors with the highest long-term value is the offtake agreement. It calls for  up to  15,000 tonnes per annum of lithium produced over a seven-year period. However, with the way the offtake agreement is worded, I interpret it as Stellantis being at LIT's all-you-can-eat lithium restaurant and other customers only being allowed in once Stellantis has had its fill. For the purpose of my analysis, I will assume 15,000 tonnes shipped starting in 2028. The price paid by Stellantis will be market pricing based on the prior calendar quarter's price of the relevant sub-type of lithium as quoted by Fastmarkets with a small freight discount.Violent swings in the price of lithium will likely continue, making price predictions for 2028 difficult. Though the bearish movement seen in 2023 is very unlikely to be the same market sentiment five years from now, unless a new battery technology comes along that puts a significant damper on the demand for Li-ion batteries. Pricing is much more likely to be above  50,000 per tonne than  20,000 per tonne, but I will take a reasonably conservative middle-ground price of  30,000 per tonne.From there it's a matter of simple math. 15,000 tonnes at  30,000 per tonne is  450 million in revenue. Assuming a 35  margin, that's  158 million in gross margin. Take off another  30 million or so for SG A and 25  for taxes and LIT is left with approximately  100 million per year in net income. Apply a 10x multiple and we are looking at a billion dollar company. Now it's time to look at the obstacles to be overcome in order to get to that level.As I mentioned before, this deal takes financing risk off of the table. Any additional funds needed for construction will be found. However, that will come at the cost of dilution. While Stellantis wouldn't have signed this deal without having a strong inkling that LIT will have the resource ready for shipment starting in 2028, until we have feasibility studies available on the properties, this remains a big  if  for the investment community. As seen in the roadmap above, LIT is still at the starting stages of drilling.Based on the vague nature of the economics and timing of lithium operations - the same level of vagueness any early-stage explorer would have - I require a discount rate of 75 . That would take the billion dollar valuation down to  250 million. My analysis assumes LIT's full ownership of the operating subsidiary, and that Stellantis exercised its option to convert into shares, leading to a total of 266 million outstanding. All cash would be used in mine development so nothing would be available to buy back shares or could be added to the enterprise value to pad the valuation. This leads to a  0.94 US per share target, or approximately  1.30 for LIT's Canadian listing.The steep 75  discount is a by-product of a 4-5 year wait before LIT generates revenue, a lithium price which has been volatile and will continue to be volatile towards 2028  though I expect more upside than downside , and the fact that we have no economic reports out to assess construction costs, cost to mine, grade or total resource estimate yet. If any of these variables were to be substantially below mine and Stellantis' expectations, it would hurt the  1.30 price target. Conversely, if these issues met or exceeded expectations, the stock should head towards this target. But because of the strong cash balance today, I believe the floor on LIT is high enough that there is an asymmetrical reward-to-risk outcome even in a less than favorable performance scenario.I have three ways to evaluate a fair price target on LIT. First, the CAD cash per share estimate assuming all derivatives are exercised leads to  0.68. That could be seen as a minimum target for short-term holders who aren't really that interested in the lithium story, but want to take advantage of the opportunity provided by Stellantis' aggressive cash-heavy investment. The second method would be to use Stellantis' valuation based on paying  90 million US for a 19.9  stake, leading to a valuation of over  600 million CAD or  2.30 per share. The third would be to take my back-of-the-napkin math on the offtake agreement to come to  1.30 per share, then re-assess the position should the stock price hit that level but company accomplishments might require an improved discount rate. No matter what method I use, at  0.55, LIT is ambiguously a buy and hold.Going back to my NFL Draft analogy, let's say Team Stellantis decided to draft the QB that was deemed the 15th best pick by the pundits. Now only the 10th, 20th and 25th best-rated players are available at the QB position. The options for QB for the rest of the teams just dropped from four to three, and it also doesn't preclude Team Stellantis from drafting another quarterback because they plan to do A LOT of passing in the next few years. Okay, so the analogy isn't perfect, but it gets the point across. Stellantis just made an aggressive move to take one junior explorer from the Lithium Triangle essentially for itself, but that doesn't mean that it's done. Buyout offers for  and  have also taken place in 2023, further limiting cheap junior options to securing lithium supply.This M A activity makes the remaining explorers inherently more valuable and the companies looking for lithium supply more desperate. We should be seeing a substantial upward re-rate across the board in Argentina, but the price action since LIT's deal first came to light hasn't indicated as such so far.One such floundering company is Lithium South Development Corporation , which sits just about at its 52-week low. It sits around a  40 million CAD market cap, a little more than half where LIT is now without a  90 million deal. There may be a good reason for that as LIS is further along with its drilling and resource estimate.Lithium South's flagship project is , which sits right in between LIT's Rincon West and Antofella projects. There are a number of larger players in the region, namely POSCO Holdings Inc.  which is directly adjacent to LIS' 5,687 hectare project.LIS  a preliminary economic assessment in the past and has recently  its lithium resource estimate by 175  after further drilling in 2022 and 2023. It now has 1,583,100 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent with 1,462,900 of that being measured. If there was another company looking for 15,000 tonnes of LCE per year, it appears that LIS would be able to provide that for the next 100 years.LIS is a company I own and therefore have more familiarity, but there are numerous publicly traded companies with early-stage projects in the Lithium Triangle, such as Argosy Minerals Limited , Lithium Energi Exploration Inc.  and NOA Lithium Brines Inc. . Companies with holdings primarily in Chile but within or close to the Triangle also can't be overlooked, such as Lithium Chile Inc.  or First Lithium Minerals Corp. FLM CA . I encourage investors who are interested in the region to do some research into those names.Junior lithium companies have been pounded into the ground due to the general bearish market in the small-cap space and with the diving price of lithium in particular. What LIT's deal with Stellantis shows, along with other M A activity in the region, is that high interest rates, inflation and general geopolitical instability is not going to stop the supply and demand imbalance of the lithium industry. The electric vehicle manufacturers will determine the viability of this industry, not the general macro climate nor Wall Street pundits. If a deal like this between LIT and Stellantis can be made in the fall of 2023, imagine what the value of lithium companies in Argentina will be when bullish supercycles become the buzzwords of day again.

URNM: Your Stepping Stone To Uranium Mining," is exposed to U.S.-listed uranium miners. Here I discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of investing in this space. I also discuss the key drivers behind URNM andUranium serves as the crucial fuel for nuclear energy, playing a pivotal role in supporting our transition towards a net-zero carbon future. Nuclear energy possesses a distinct advantage in providing a cost-effective, dependable, flexible, and scalable source of baseload power.Unlike renewable sources like wind and solar, nuclear power generation does not rely on favorable weather conditions, making it highly reliable and available around the clock and during different seasons.Furthermore, its scalability ensures that we can meet increasing energy demands without the need for extensiveInvestors who understand the need for uranium but don't want to figure out how to invest in this space may consider investing in an ETF, like the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF.URNM is a U.S.-listed uranium ETF focused on uranium miners and physical uranium. Below you'll see its top holding by weight.What should jump out to you is that this ETF is significantly weighted towards Cameco  with 17  of its total weight. That being said, it also includes a range of other miners.And this brings me to another consideration. As investors in this space, you may be aware that this ETF is not the only ETF offering similar exposure. Indeed, the Global X Uranium ETF  is for the most part quite similar. There are some minor differences, such as substantially more concentration, for instance, Cameco makes up a quarter of the URA ETF rather than less than 20  with URNM, but I don't believe that's a real game-changer.I know that this may irk some readers, who may point out that URA has more liquidity or an ever-so-slightly lower expense ratio, but I believe this is overthinking the uranium thesis.I contend that the uranium thesis is either going to work or it's not. And that's tied, for the most part, to uranium prices.And if it does, one ETF may be slightly less volatile, meaning the URNM will probably be slightly less volatile given it is less concentrated at the top, but overall they are tied to the same idea, which is indirectly the uranium price, see below.If the underlying commodity, uranium, does well, the whole sector will move higher.Furthermore, readers should also know that the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF is not the only way to seek exposure.In my opinion, the drawback of investing in URNM or URA is the cyclical nature of the uranium industry. As you know, the uranium mining industry is cyclical. When uranium prices are high, mining companies can thrive, but this will bring on excess uranium supply, which will dampen uranium prices.That being said, I would counter that notion by asserting that in the next couple of years, there appears to be a shortfall between uranium supply and demand estimates.As you can see above, there are close to 200 million pounds of uranium in demand right now, with around 150 million in production. Meanwhile, even now, despite more attention towards this sector, it remains quite a small space, see below.And opening a new uranium mine can take many years, requiring capital and favorable regulation.Yes. I believe that if one is right on the thesis, one may consider investing in a uranium producer, such as Uranium Energy Corp.   disclosure  I'm long UEC . Investors don't need to only consider UEC  indeed, there are several other uranium producers in North America that are also worthwhile considering.The significant advantage of investing in the producers, rather than an ETF, is that individual producers will benefit from operating leverage. However, the drawback will be the volatility of the underlying stock.Investing in the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF offers exposure to U.S.-listed uranium miners, which is essential given uranium's critical role in supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon future through nuclear energy.This energy source boasts cost-effectiveness, reliability, flexibility, and scalability, providing a stable baseload power supply that isn't dependent on weather conditions, unlike renewables like wind and solar. URNM, although slightly less concentrated compared to other similar ETFs, presents an opportunity for investors to tap into this sector.However, it's important to understand that the uranium industry is cyclical, with potential fluctuations in uranium prices. Yet, with a current demand-supply gap, uranium producers like Uranium Energy Corp. offer a more leveraged investment option, albeit with higher volatility.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

"D.R. Horton: Likely To Outperform, Despite The Cyclical Housing Market","D.R. Horton  is a stock that requires no introduction, as the largest homebuilder by volume in the US since 2002.With a well-diversified home portfolio rangingDHI's performance over the past few quarters exceeded expectations indeed, with growing home sales and backlog, despite the elevated borrowing costs and uncertain macroeconomic outlook.For example, the  Mortgage Average is still highly inflated at 7.49   0.59 points MoM   0.83 YoY  as of October 05, 2023, compared to the 2019 averages of 3.8 .The US housing shortage is likely triggered by the  at 4.04M units in August 2023  -0.03M MoM  -0.4M YoY  as well, compared to the hyper-pandemic era peak of over 6.5M homes and August 2019 levels of 5.25M homes.The combination of reduced inventory and robust housing demand has directly triggered the expansion in the  to  420.28K by August 2023  -2.9  YoY   47.3  from August 2019 median of  285.27K .Based on these developments, Chen Zhao, lead of Redfin's  economics research, also projects that home prices may remain elevated moving forwardFor now, DHI has been able to report an  of  9.1B   5.1  YoY  in FQ3'23. This is on top of its impressive home  land sale gross margins of 23.2   1.5 points QoQ  -6.7 YoY , compared to the   -1.4 points YoY .Part of its tailwinds may be attributed to the management's price adjustments and increased incentives  to  caused by higher mortgage rates.These strategies may have narrowed the gap of the median sales price between  and  to only 5.4  at  407.10K and  430.40K by August 2023, respectively. This is compared to 11  in August 2022 and 14.7  in August 2019.These developments have naturally resulted in increased demand for new homes, as demonstrated by DHI's growing net sales orders of  8.7B in the latest quarter  1.1  QoQ   26  YoY .Despite these incentives, the homebuilding company still records a robust Return On Equity  ROE  of 24.3   and a Homebuilding Return On Inventory  ROI  of 31.8  over the LTM  -9.9 points sequentially .These numbers also well exceed its FY2019 levels of 17.2   -0.4 points YoY  and 18.1   -2.1 points YoY , respectively.As a result of its outperformance thus far, investors need not fret about DHI's growing total inventories of  22.98B in the latest quarter  1.8  QoQ   6.1  YoY  in our opinion, which are compared to its FY2019 levels of  11.28B  8.5  YoY .This is because 44.8  of its total inventories is attributed to residential lots held for sale, 14.4  is attributed to its ongoing rental portfolio, and  33.7  is attributed to construction in progress.With only a small percentage of its total inventories attributed to completed and unsold units at  6.9 , based on our estimation, it is apparent that new housing demand remains red hot no matter the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.The estimated numbers above are based on the DHI management's FQ3'23 report hereThe DHI management has also offered a FQ4'23 consolidated revenue guidance of  9.9B  1.8  QoQ   2.8  YoY  and home sales gross margins of 23.75  at the midpoint  0.45 points QoQ  , compared to .For now, the Fed expects to achieve its  only by 2026, implying that the higher interest rate environment may also continue for a little longer.These factors point to DHI's likely outperformance over the next few years, since the gap between existing and new house median prices may remain narrow for a little longer, naturally sustaining its profitability and backlog as discussed above.For now, DHI mostly trades at impacted FWD valuations compared to its 5Y means, though still improved compared to its 1Y means and the sector medians, implying Mr. Market's confidence in its outperformance compared to its peers.For example, DHI is expected to sustain its impressive pandemic era-like outperformance ahead, with the consensus FY2025 estimates implying more-than-doubled top line expansions and more-than-tripled bottom line expansions against the pre-pandemic levels. This is on top of the normalized EPS CAGR of  38.3  between FY2016 and FY2022.This growth rate well exceeds the second and third-largest homebuilding companies in the US, Lennar Corporation  at a normalized CAGR of  26.4  and PulteGroup  at  28  between FY2016 and FY2022, demonstrating why we believe DHI deserves premium valuations.Based on the consensus FY2026 adj EPS estimates of  15.66 and its adj FWD P E valuations of 7.83x, we are also looking at a long-term price target of  122.61, implying the DHI stock's decent upside potential of  17.5  from current levels.Then again, thanks to DHI's impressive rally since 2020, the stock's forward dividend yield of 0.96  appears lackluster compared to its 5Y average of 1.09  and sector median of 2.51 .With it currently retesting its previous 2021 and 2022 resistance levels in the  100s range, there may also be moderate volatility in the near term.As a result, while there appears to be a relatively attractive risk  reward ratio for DHI, warranting our Buy rating, interested investors may want to observe the situation for a little longer and add according to their dollar cost averages.While market analysts from the National Association of Realtors  NAR  have already postulated the end of  the August 2023 data still indicates a very tight housing supply at 3.3 months. This is compared to  the historical , which is associated with moderate price appreciation  and  a .Since 82.4  of all American homeowners report an average fixed-rate mortgage rate of , market supply may remain tight over the next few years of an elevated interest rate environment, potentially delaying the eventual recovery of the US property market.While DHI is a homebuilding company and therefore, not directly exposed to the resale market condition, the ongoing headwinds may still pose uncertainty to its eventual valuation and stock recovery. This implies that the stock is only suitable for investors who are patient and have a higher risk appetite.Lastly, investors must also note that the housing market is highly cyclical, with the macroeconomic outlook remaining uncertain over the next few years. While  is still robust in September 2023, we believe that the housing market may remain sluggish moving forward, due to the imbalance between supply and demand.This is a chicken and egg problem, in our opinion.

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Things Are Likely To Get Worse Before Getting Better - Sell,"  Last year, Israel-based liner company ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd., or  ZIM,  attracted strong retail investor interest dueWhile ZIM barely makes the Top 10 of the world's largest liner companies, the company has pocketed its fair share of the recent container shipping bonanza.Since  on the Big Board in early 2021, ZIM has declared a whopping  38.45 per share in dividends.Like all liner companies, ZIM has been enjoying record-high earnings and cash flows for most of the past two years, but with container rates essentially back at pre-pandemic levels and significantly increased operating expensesLast month, ZIM  weak second quarter earnings, with freight rates down 67  on a year-over-year basis thus resulting in negative Adjusted EBIT and Net IncomeZIM's total cash position  which includes cash and cash equivalents and investments in bank deposits and other investment instruments  decreased by more than  1 billion sequentially to  3.24 billion, mostly due to the massive true-up dividend payment for 2022 and material debt service paymentsNet debt at the end of Q2 was up by almost  1.0 billion to  1.6 billion as newbuild deliveries with long-term charter commitments continue to increase the company's lease liabilities, a trend which is expected to accelerate over the coming quarters.Please note that year-to-date, the company has only taken delivery of four out of a total of 42 publicly-disclosed newbuilds chartered on long-term contracts from various lessors between 2020 and 2022In addition, ZIM has recently taken delivery of four 12,000 TEU newbuilds from Seaspan, but the company has not disclosed the terms of these leases.Please note that the newbuild vessels are of substantially larger average size than the company's existing fleet.While ZIM has a total of 47 vessels with lease expirations in 2023 and 2024, even when assuming zero extensions, the company's total capacity is going to increase substantially at the worst possible timeMoreover, based on management's statements during the questions-and-answers session of the , ZIM is likely to renew the majority of its expiring leases while redelivering only the oldest and least efficient vessels in the fleetFurthermore, the company has agreed to make an aggregate  490 million in down payments upon delivery of the Seaspan newbuilds While the new vessels should help reduce unit costs over time, they will also increase overall lease expenses and particularly net debt very substantially over the next few quarters. For my part, I wouldn't be surprised to see the company ending 2024 with well above  5 billion in net debt.Just last week, competitor A.P. Møller - Mærsk A S or  Maersk  , ,   of a further increase in industry-wide blanked capacityFollowing a short recovery in July and August, container rates have resumed their multi-year decline in recent weeks with rates again approaching post-pandemic lows.Not surprisingly, the company has reduced its original 2023 outlook substantiallyAssuming ZIM's second half results mirror the first half of the year and considering the above-discussed down payments upon Seaspan newbuild deliveries, I would estimate the company's cash balance to decline to approximately  2.6 billion by year-end.Should 2024 be more of the same, I would estimate ZIM's cash balance to decrease by another  1  billion dollars next year.To put it another way  The company needs the market to turn around by 2026 at the latest point to avoid running out of funds.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services reported weak second quarter results and reduced full-year expectations materially.Even after net cash outflows of more than  1 billion in Q2, the company still commands more than  3.2 billion in cash, bank deposits and liquid investments, albeit this number is likely to come down further over the next couple of quarters.Assuming no changes in industry conditions, the company would likely run out of funds by 2026.Considering the weak market environment, which is about to be exacerbated by an elevated number of newbuilds scheduled to join the worldwide fleet over the next few quarters, I am reiterating my  rating on the shares.A surprise improvement in consumer sentiment would almost certainly result in higher demand for far east-made goods thus supporting rates on the company's most important .Investors should always keep a close eye on charter rate movements as reported by  or other leading industry services.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

What Will Stop The Sell-Off? Putting The Brakes On Treasury Yields,"The 10-year US Treasury yield has climbed ever higher in recent weeks. Technical conditions are in the driver s seat for now, but fundamentals should prevail over time.US Treasury yields have surged, withTechnical conditions the dynamics of supply and demand are out of balance in today s bond market. That is, bond prices have succumbed to selling pressures because marginal buyers have so far failed to materialize. We see a number of contributing factors.First, the sell-off has developed momentum thanks to a series of triggering events since early this year. In April, it was the resolution of the banking crisis. In May, the debt ceiling debate. June saw better-than-expected growth, and July concerns around Treasury supply. August saw reduced liquidity, as is typical of late summer. September brought breaches of technical support, with prices reaching new lows when quantitative strategies and momentum followers that trade based on technicals shorted the market. A dearth of counterparties exaggerated the effect on valuations.Second, foreign buyers have been selling US debt in the continuation of a longer-term trend. China s holdings of US Treasuries, for example, are down about  175 billion since last year. Japan, the largest non-US holder of Treasuries, has also been trimming its position.Third, in the last couple of weeks, fund flows have begun to slow, following strong flows of more than US 200 billion into core and government bond funds year to date. This has put a crimp into marginal buying, since asset managers in aggregate are already long duration and have little dry powder left. Dealers have been slow to provide a backstop. And banks are reluctant to extend duration, with the regional banking crisis still in the rearview mirror.To our mind, today s macro picture doesn t support an extended sell-off, which historically has accompanied a very different set of . For example, fundamentals look quite different today than in October 2022, when yields reached prior peaks.Then, the fed funds rate was at 2.5 . Today it s at 5.5 . Then, the Federal Reserve had just begun its aggressive hiking cycle. Today, the Fed is likely finished raising rates or close to it. Then, consumer price inflation  CPI  was at 8.2 . Today, it s at 3.7 with core CPI running 2.5  and approaching the Fed s target. The , too.The outlier among economic conditions is the labor market. September s addition of 336,000 workers is the strongest since January. Clearly, the jobs market is still strengthening, albeit at a slower rate than in 2022. This means the Fed will need to see tangible evidence of slower growth to have confidence in the inflation outlook.We don t think we ll have to wait forever. Higher yields mean tighter financial conditions, which in turn weigh on growth. We expect  as data weakens in the coming months.Once the tide begins to turn, sidelined cash should flood back into the market, rapidly driving yields down and prices up. In the meantime, elevated yields are good for bond investors, since over time most of a bond s return comes from its yield.That s why, with yields at once-in-a-generation highs, we believe the current bond rout is creating .

HR's merger with HTA has significantly improved its portfolio scale, diversification, and efficiency. Large mergers always take time to integrate, but HR management has stated that they are on target for 5-7  earnings growth and 4-6  same-property rent growth in 2024 by taking advantage of redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio.HR has a healthy development redevelopment pipeline that will contribute to earnings growth. HR's strategy is what they describe as a  cluster  strategy. The goal is to own multiple buildings in close proximity to each other, either  on campus  or adjacent to the property of a major healthcare system like a hospital. For instance, here is an example of a cluster that HR formed in Atlanta.HR acquired five buildings in two transactions and then acquired development property nearby. They currently are renting 357k square feet and have the ability to develop an additional 184k square feet in an area where HR is already managing property and is very familiar with the supply and demand dynamics. All real estate is local, and there is a lot of value in developing in an area where you are already a successful landlord.Like most REITs, HR has seen its valuation compress thanks to rising interest rates, despite the fact that HR has no material debt maturities until 2025, giving them plenty of time for rates to change before they are forced to refinance.Now is a great time to be buying up shares while you can receive a much higher yield than HR has historically had. The market is selling off REITs based on the near-term reality of higher interest rates while ignoring the long-term benefits of rent inflation, growing demand for medical properties, and improved efficiency for HR with its larger scale.We are happy to get paid while we wait for the market to realize the value it has overlooked.BTO and HR can provide strong income from the banking sector and the healthcare sector without having to take any additional steps.

PHX Minerals: A Good Natural Gas Royalties Play,"  is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale plays in Oklahoma, Texas, and LouisianaThe company does have operations in a few otherAs stated in the introduction, PHX Minerals is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale regions of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas but also has operations elsewhere in the country. The company s operating locations are not the only unique thing about this company, though. Its business model is somewhat unique as the company does not actually drill for resources on its acreage. Rather, it simply takes a royalty or working interest in any well drilled on its land.I explained the difference between a royalty and a working interest stake in my previous article on this company, but the important thing is that PHX Minerals receives a portion of the production from any well that is drilled on its acreage. The well is actually drilled and operated by an upstream exploration and production company such as Southwestern Energy , Continental Resources, Chesapeake Energy , and several others depending on the basin in which the company operates. However, the company s practice of taking a stake in a well s production does expose it to some of the same factors that affect the performance of other energy companies. One of the most important of these factors is energy prices.Unfortunately, energy prices were something of a drag on PHX Mineral s recent financial performance. As of the time of writing, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is down 10.90  over the past year but it was down quite a bit more over most of the trailing twelve-month periodThe performance of natural gas has been even worse. Natural gas at Henry Hub is down a whopping 69.03  over the past twelve monthsThere were a few reasons for this poor performance. In the case of crude oil, the Federal Government was selling crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for much of the second half of last year as well as through July of this year to attempt to keep the supply of crude oil high and prices down. I explained the reasons for the low natural gas prices in a  earlier this year, but two of the major reasons were the warm winter and the temporary shutdown of the Freeport LNG facility. These two factors caused a glut of natural gas in North America, which pushed prices down due to the economic law of supply and demand.Natural gas prices are generally more important than crude oil for PHX Minerals due to the production profile of its acreage. In the second quarter, the company received a total of 2.304113 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent. Of that, 1.854485 billion cubic feet was dry natural gas. Thus, approximately 80.49  of the company s business is natural gas as opposed to crude oil or other hydrocarbons. Clearly, natural gas fundamentals are much more important to the company than crude oil. This is a good thing because the long-term fundamentals for natural gas are better than crude oil s long-term fundamentals as we will now discuss.This decline in resource prices has certainly had an impact on PHX Minerals  financial performance. In the second quarter of 2023, the amount of natural gas that was produced on the company s acreage was close to record levels, but the price was substantially lower than in the same quarter of last yearPHX Minerals reported an adjusted EBITDA of  4.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to  7.2 million in the second quarter of 2022. This lower cash flow is despite the fact that the amount of natural gas that the company received as royalty payments was quite a bit higher than in the same period last year. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a near-term catalyst that would drive natural gas prices back up. We are seeing some upstream producers beginning to reduce their production, but this will take quite a while to make its way through the system. Currently, forecasters are  that the upcoming winter will be more typical than last year, so that could help reduce some of the natural gas oversupply if they are correct. However, it remains to be seen if the forecasters are correct about this, and how much of an impact it will have on the balance between natural gas supply and demand.The long-term fundamentals for natural gas are much better than the near-term ones though, which is fortunate for PHX Minerals. As already mentioned, PHX Minerals has significant acreage in the Haynesville Shale. The Haynesville Shale is very well-positioned to supply natural gas to the liquefaction plants that are being constructed along the Gulf Coast. The demand from natural gas from these facilities will likely be enormous. Indeed, Wood Mackenzie states that the liquefaction plants currently under development will increase the demand for natural gas by 10 billion cubic feet per day by 2030It seems reasonable that a significant percentage of the natural gas that will be supplying these plants will be produced in the Haynesville Shale and the Permian Basin. This is due mostly to their proximity to the Gulf Coast. The other major natural gas-producing region in the United States, Appalachia, will probably end up supplying East Coast utilities and the handful of liquefaction plants that are being constructed near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As of the time of writing, 48.74  of PHX Minerals  total royalty production is in the Haynesville Shale, which is substantially more than any other basinThus, it is reasonable to assume that the company will benefit from any growth in natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale. After all, that scenario would almost certainly result in the company s customers needing to lease more acreage on which to produce natural gas to satisfy the demand. PHX Minerals seems to realize this as it has been focusing its recent land acquisitions on the Haynesville Shale. We can see that quite easily hereAs we can see, about half of the acreage that the company acquired this year was in the Haynesville Shale. It was substantially more than half of its acquisitions in 2021 and 2022. This all represents acreage that the company can lease out to its customers. Clearly, management sees a great deal of opportunity in the Haynesville Shale. I do, too, and this is one of the things that we can appreciate about this company.As mentioned in the introduction, PHX Minerals has a very strong balance sheet. We can see this by looking at the net debt-to-equity ratio. As of June 30, 2023, PHX Minerals had a net debt of  23.5 million compared to  120.1 million in shareholders  equity. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.20 today. This is lower than the 0.29 ratio that the company had the last time that we discussed it. That is a positive sign as it indicates that the company managed to strengthen its balance sheet somewhat over the past quarter. Here is how the company compares to some of its peersI pointed out one important thing for this comparison in my previous article on PHX MineralsThis is a good situation that strongly implies that we should not have to worry too much about the company s leverage. The company s use of leverage or lack thereof is somewhat more important for an energy producer like PHX Minerals than it would be for many other companies because of the inherent volatility of energy prices. Overall, everything looks good here.As I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, pretty much the entire traditional energy sector appears to be substantially undervalued relative to the broader market. This continues to be true despite the fact that the energy sector has outperformed the S P 500 Index  by quite a lot over the past month. This chart shows the iShares U.S. Energy ETF  against the S P 500 IndexThe weakness in the broader market has brought the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S P 500 Index to 19.88 at the current levelPHX Minerals is quite a bit below this, though. As of the time of writing, the company s forward price-to-earnings is 9.35 . Here is how that compares to the energy producers that we used for the peer comparison earlierPHX Minerals is only the median company here, which might imply that the stock is fairly valued. However, it is clearly substantially well below the comparable ratio for the S P 500 Index. As such, it is very hard not to call this company undervalued. Overall, it is probably worth thinking about adding to a portfolio, especially if you want to have some exposure to the liquefied natural gas growth story.In conclusion, PHX Minerals is a somewhat unique independent exploration and production company that appears to be well-positioned to profit from the coming liquefied natural gas boom. The company s cash flow has struggled a bit from the low-price environment, but this will hopefully resolve itself as the demand for natural gas continues to grow since producers will probably restrict output until prices rise. PHX Minerals Inc. stock is trading at a reasonable price and the company boasts a very strong balance sheet. Overall, it might be worth considering as a play on natural gas.At Energy Profits in Dividends, we seek to generate a 7  income yield by investing in a portfolio of energy stocks while minimizing our risk of principal loss.

K2 Hedge Fund Strategy Outlook: Fourth Quarter 2023,"Higher macro and market volatility, along with greater dispersion, creates an environment rich with opportunities for active trading. We think the key to success for hedge funds is to identify these opportunitiesThe US Federal Reserve  Fed  marked an investment regime shift in March of 2022 by raising interest rates and the cost of capital. Since then, all stakeholders have been in a constant state of adjustment and recalibration. We do think that central banks have a big hurdle to tame inflation to their stated target levels. As we look at the world today, we see real cash rates at very attractive levels, the cost of capital rising to even higher levels for companies, governments expanding their debt levels, increasing costs for consumers, and intensified geopolitical tensions. We expect the cost of capital to remain high for the foreseeable future as central banks keep the cost of funding elevated to keep inflationary pressures at bay. The resultant investment climate is one of increased market volatility across all asset classes, more divergent security performance, and investors shortening their time horizon.Equity market neutral hedge funds are positioned well, in our view to capture security dispersion in a responsible, risk-oriented, non-directional approach. We continue to overweight global macro discretionary managers for all the reasons mentioned above but want to highlight that manager selection is of upmost importance in this regime. Insurance-linked securities are one of the most idiosyncratic investments to pick up excess yield while offering diversification to portfolios.Rates have risen higher and faster than just about any market participant would have predicted two years ago. That transition has been difficult for certain assets and investment strategies, but history suggests that higher prevailing rates create attractive opportunity sets for hedge funds. The table below demonstrates that hedge funds, and long short equity in particular, perform better in higher rate regimes, which tend to separate winners from losers. In a low-rate environment, weaker companies can more easily secure financing, that financing is less impactful to the bottom line, and customers may be less discerning given their own financing situations. With rates now significantly higher than they have been for the past decade plus, those weaker companies will start to shift to risk management mode while the stronger companies can seize opportunities and profit. We believe equity market neutral managers are well suited to capitalize on this setup as returns are very much a function of dispersion.Cross-asset correlations are a key consideration in most portfolio construction and risk management techniques. Many modern investors have implicitly or explicitly built in an assumption of negative correlation between equities and government fixed income over the last few decades. However, this dynamic has recently flipped, with the two asset classes no longer offsetting each other s risks, and instead, seemingly compounding risk within a portfolio. Investors may need to seek diversification elsewhere, whether through allocations to other asset classes or to tactical trading strategies with no structural long or short biases.Macro managers, who tend to focus on these types of big-picture cross-asset relationships as a matter of course, and who can shift dynamically between longs and shorts, may be facing an attractive trading environment and may also provide a source of much-needed diversification for broader portfolios. To the extent hawkish central bank policy is a contributing factor to this new correlation dynamic, we believe those managers with the expertise to evaluate policy paths may be well-suited to capture the opportunity set.The focus of most ILS managers has shifted to the January renewals as we move through the end of a relatively unimpactful hurricane season  at the time of this writing . There remains a supply and demand dislocation within the broader insurance and reinsurance markets. This dislocation, while not as pronounced as last year in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ian, is likely large enough for spread and pricing levels to remain elevated. Given the increase of demand for risk transfer and relative lack of capacity in traditional reinsurance markets, we expect to see several sponsors and cedants utilize the catastrophe bond market to transfer retrocessional and reinsurance risk. In response to loss trends and challenging reinsurance markets, many cedants have materially shifted their portfolios since the start of 2022. In some instances, cedants retained higher levels of risk in 2023 given the severe supply and demand dislocations ahead of last year s renewals. This will likely lead to pent-up demand for reinsurance from these cedants at higher price levels and cleaner risk from a structural perspective.Investments in alternative investment strategies and hedge funds  collectively,  Alternative Investments  are complex and speculative investments, entail significant risk and should not be considered a complete investment program. Financial Derivative instruments are often used in alternative investment strategies and involve costs and can create economic leverage in the fund s portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses  as well as gains  in an amount that significantly exceeds the fund s initial investment. Depending on the product invested in, an investment in Alternative Investments may provide for only limited liquidity and is suitable only for persons who can afford to lose the entire amount of their investment. There can be no assurance that the investment strategies employed by K2 or the managers of the investment entities selected by K2 will be successful.The identification of attractive investment opportunities is difficult and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. Returns generated from Alternative Investments may not adequately compensate investors for the business and financial risks assumed. An investment in Alternative Investments is subject to those market risks common to entities investing in all types of securities, including market volatility. Also, certain trading techniques employed by Alternative Investments, such as leverage and hedging, may increase the adverse impact to which an investment portfolio may be subject.Depending on the structure of the product invested, Alternative Investments may not be required to provide investors with periodic pricing or valuation and there may be a lack of transparency as to the underlying assets. Investing in Alternative Investments may also involve tax consequences and a prospective investor should consult with a tax advisor before investing. In addition to direct asset-based fees and expenses, certain Alternative Investments such as funds of hedge funds incur additional indirect fees, expenses and asset-based compensation of investment funds in which these Alternative Investments invest.This material is intended to be of general interest only and should not be construed as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy.

How KNOT Offshore Partners LP Is Poised For Significant Share Price Rebound," is a leading company in the shuttle tanker industry. The company operates 18 shuttle tankers out of global feet of 78. The company is listed in New York with a USD175 million form is a master limited partnership  MLP , and its general partner is Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers Management AS  KNOT Management . An MLP is a type of publicly traded partnership that combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded company.KNOT Management is responsible for managing KNOP's shuttle tanker fleet and handling the various operational aspects of the business. This includes vessel operations, maintenance, crew management, and adherence to safety and environmental standards.After the company cut the dividend in January 2023, the stock went down by 70 . The company revenuesOnce dividends are reinstated, the share price should start regaining the previous trading levels, which means tripling the current share price. are specialized vessels used to transport crude oil from offshore oil fields to onshore facilities. There are only 78 shuttle tankers in the world serving the North Sea and the fields of offshore Brazil. They are designed to be able to work on high seas where conventional FPSOs cannot operate. The industry was pioneered by Knudsen, the parent company, in 1978.There are only  by three companies in two regions  Brazil and Norway . Only five new ships have been ordered while over 20 ships that are more than 20 years old should be scraped soon. As it takes three years for a ship to be delivered there is very good market visibility for the next at least five years. The market on the supply side is tight and with the scraping will get even tighter.Demand for shuttle tankers is increasing. There is a rapid expansion in production in both the North Sea  the large Johan Castberg field, for example  and Brazil via Petrobras, and others will require additional shuttle tankers.Higher production, new fields about to start producing, and limited supply or potential supply of vessels make for a nice bottleneck situation later in 2023 and in 2024 as producers scramble to secure the transport of their oil on shore.In the 2Q23 the While shuttle tankers can perform the regular function of the regular oil tanker fleet  they are a bit slower because they are heavier , regular tankers cannot substitute shuttle tankers. In periods of lacking demand for shuttle tankers, these operate as regular oil tankers, which limits the downside. When demand is high, the rates increase materially. This is happening now in the Brazilian market, where KNOP operates 14 of its 18 vessels. The Norwegian market should tighten from early 2024 as the new fields come into production.Since the 3 Quarter of 2022, KNOP stock has been totally annihilated. Several reasons caused the share price fallThe above resulted in a dividend cut from  2.08 year to  0.11. Reaction to this was predictable. Dividend investors sold in droves for tax reasons, for the lack of visibility and income. Moreover, many MLP investors became concerned that the group would buy 70  of what they don t own on the cheap, like many other MLP sponsors.As of 2Q23 none of the adverse scenarios have materialized. Most concerns were resolvedThere are only , none of which is materialKNOP secured charter coverage for 2023, is negotiating to extend the two Petrobras tankers coming due, and is starting to explore long-term charters for the remaining assets. It also appears that the best opportunity to take the company under the sponsor has passed, at least at the low. As the dividend was decreased, the company used its cash to pay down debt. The issues have been resolved and the remaining are being addressed.The company's The company position has normalized - KNOP is now in a similar state it was when it was paying above USD2 in dividends per year Gary Chapman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of KNOT Offshore Partners LP, stated  emphasis addedDespite all this progress, the company has been left for dead. Trading at  5.5 per share it is remaining at a steep discount to the  15-20 share NAV of the ships and the  3-4 share of free cash flow generating capacity.So what should we expect in 2024  Given that the FCF share should expand to over  3 share, there should be a resumption of dividends.It is not possible to model such a scenario with sufficient accuracy but given the previous precedents, it is not hard to imagine a  2-3 share dividend in 2024 and beyond. Either way, the net present value of any of the outcomes is very attractive. At a little over  5 per share, we should be able to get all our investment back over the next 3 years or so, representing a very attractive IRR. Given how oversold the shares are, any incremental good news should help to rerate the stock higher.Since this is not a biotech stock or economically sensitive equity, there are exogenous factors that can affect the stock. Delays of the Equinor project, geopolitical conflict near the Norwegian waters, an accident, or a belated offer by the parent company to take the stock under may cause the stock to underperform my expectations. However, given that the stock is already trading well below steel, the risk-reward of investing in KNOP is very positive.KNOP is down 70  due to multiple concerns that resulted in a dividend cut. Most of the concerns have been resolved and the financial performance remains stable. As the issues have been resolved, the dividends should be reinstated. Before the dividend cut, the stock was trading at a dividend yield of over 12 . At the current share price, the previous dividend would represent a dividend yield of 40 . The stock is up for a material rerating.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Quick Thoughts: Should We Fear The Rapid Rise Of Interest Rates?,"Since July, bond yields have been on a tear. The US 10-year Treasury yield has jumped from 3.75  in the third week of July to a recent high of 4.81 . Rising government bond yields have pushed up new borrowing costs for companies and households. For instance, the conventional 30-year US fixed rate mortgage is about 7.3 , its highest level since 2000. Compared to its lows during the pandemic  closer to 4  an American taking out a US 325,000 mortgage will today pay nearly US 10,000 more per year in interest.Rising term premiums haveObserved long-term interest rates  often referred to as nominal bond yields  can be decomposed into three components  1  the path for the neutral real short-term rate of interest  2  compensation for expected inflation  and 3  the term premium.The neutral real rate of interest is the rate adjusted for inflation that neither stimulates nor hinders economic activity. It should prevail when the economy is in equilibrium, i.e., enjoying full employment and price stability.However, when savers lend money to borrowers, they must also consider inflation. Inflation erodes the nominal value of their loans. Lending rates  whether in the form of loans or bonds  therefore embed an expectation of future inflation, which lenders tack onto the real rate of interest when extending credit.Finally, lenders whether individuals, banks, or bondholders typically require extra compensation to account for uncertainty and for the likelihood that the value of long-term credits  e.g., bonds  will fluctuate more than that of short-term credits. For example, the price of a 10-year bond will move more in response to a given change in interest rates than the price of a two-year note. As compensation for both uncertainty and price volatility, therefore, long-term lenders also tack on an additional rate of return, commonly referred to as the  term premium.  The term premium explains why yield curves typically slope upward, reflecting higher interest rates for long-dated notes and bonds relative to shorter maturity borrowings.Here s the rub  Real interest rates, inflation expectations and term premiums are all unobservable. That doesn t prevent clever economists and bonds specialists from trying to estimate them based on other pieces of data. Using various analytical approaches, it is possible to derive reasonable estimates for all three.Armed with estimates of the real neutral interest rate and expected inflation, subtracting those two numbers from the observed bond yield gets you to the term premium. The following chart shows one such estimate of the term premium the Federal Reserve  Fed  Bank of New York developed, and how it has behaved since 2009.Note that since mid-July, the term premium has spiked, jumping by 1.3 percentage points, a move that accounts for even more than the observed rise in nominal bond yields. That s because measures of the real rate of interest simultaneously fell and expected inflation only increased a bit.More noteworthy is the fact that term premiums were negative for most of the past decade. That flies in the face of theory, which says that lenders need to be compensated for longer-term lending.The negative term premium of recent years reflects several special factors, of which probably the most important being the monetary policies of the Fed and other central banks. Those had two components  1  large-scale asset purchases, dubbed  quantitative easing,  or QE for short  and 2   forward guidance,  namely strong reassurances that super-low interest rates and QE would remain in place for considerably longer  i.e., until full employment and price stability had been sustainably restored .Accordingly, lenders  knew  that interest rates would remain stuck at low levels. That removed uncertainty that in normal times probably would have prevailed. Lenders also didn t have to fret much about the volatility of their long-term bonds, given that the actions of central banks firmly pinned down both short- and long-term interest rates. Extraordinary monetary policies effectively crushed term premiums the extra compensation investors would otherwise demand for uncertainty and volatility.As previously noted, the components of the nominal bond yield cannot be observed. That leaves open room for doubt. For example, using different methodology, the Fed Bank of Richmond has constructed a measure of the neutral real interest rate that in contrast to the one the New York Fed produced indicates that the neutral real rate has recently been rising. If so, then the term premium has not been the only reason behind the recent surge in bond yields.In our view, however, the New York Fed s approach to disentangling bond yields is more persuasive. To state it as simply as possible, if the Richmond Fed s estimates of a rising neutral real rate were correct, it would imply that the economy s speed limit would have accelerated.That seems unlikely, as there is little evidence in the incoming productivity data to warrant that conclusion. For well-known demographic reasons, the growth of the labor force has slowed. And if trend growth were accelerating, why would it have suddenly jumped in mid-2023  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if the US economy were suddenly embarking on faster, non-inflationary growth, the equity market would probably be leaping ahead. Instead, since mid-year it has stumbled.In short, the New York Fed s estimates of the real neutral rate and, by extension, of the term premium are more closely aligned with other data gleaned from the economy and markets. The term premium appears to us to be the primary culprit for rising bond yields in recent months.Some observers have argued that the latest jump in bond yields is tied to changes in the supply and demand for bonds. Little wonder  Just as the Fed  and other central banks  have stepped back from bond buying  and have shrunk the holdings of bonds by not replacing all of those that mature , governments around the world have run up big deficits, requiring heavier bond issuance. In the United States, the issuance calendar has become particularly loaded in 2023, as the Treasury had to also replace depleted cash levels from earlier this year when it was trying to prevent a US default stemming from Congress  delay in raising the debt ceiling.Yet all these things have been  known-knowns  for much of this year, even in the second-quarter of 2023 when interest rates were much lower than today. So those who argue that a combination of QT and big budget deficits are behind rising bond yields are left without an answer to  why now  To us, the timing of the latest surge in bond yields is difficult to explain merely in supply demand terms.Finally, it is worth recalling that the US economy has proven resilient to the massive Fed rate hikes since early 2022. Fiscal stimulus, the ability of households to draw on savings, a tight labor market, and a greater reliance on fixed rate borrowing  insulating for a time households and companies from higher borrowing costs  explain that resilience. But consequently, the Fed has clearly signaled that its policy will remain tight for longer. The Fed s resolve to see the economy weaken to assure its inflation target is met has probably contributed to the rise in yields because it has removed hopes for rate cuts in 2024. Still, it remains a mystery why 10- and even 30-year bond yields should have reacted so strongly to changes in interest rate expectations over the next few quarters. Hence, even  high for longer  cannot fully account for the observed rise in bond yields since July.Our conclusion, therefore, is that rising term premiums are behind the rise in bond yields. For the economy, it is important to note that resilience is not forever. New borrowers and those who must roll over their maturing debts will soon have to pay much higher borrowing costs, as highlighted in the example at the beginning of this note. Moreover, there is some evidence that the labor market is showing signs of softening.Studies from the Fed Bank of San Francisco show that household excess savings are almost depleted. And additional shots of fiscal stimulus are unlikely, given Washington gridlock. Accordingly, an economy that was almost certainly set to slow now runs a greater risk of recession. That matters for equity and credit investors, where asset values depend on corporate profits. Before the latest jump in interest rates, optimism was growing about the outlook for higher corporate profits later this year and in 2024. That optimism had helped to underpin strong 2023 gains in equity markets. Now investors must wonder if those expectations weren t too rosy.Higher US yields also boost the value of the dollar. All else equal, that tends to undermine commodity prices. And, on cue, oil prices have recently plunged. Meanwhile, a strong dollar is not welcome in some parts of the world. Japan is reported to have intervened to prevent the yen from sliding below 150 versus the dollar. Emerging fixed income and equity markets typically fare poorly when the dollar becomes too strong. Finally, no region has been spared higher yields stemming from rising US rates. Bond yields in the eurozone, which is already teetering on the edge of recession, are heading higher.Bond yields have surged. Many explanations have been offered. We think it is mostly about term premiums. But whatever the cause, the effect is mostly unpleasant. Unless bond yields settle back into lower ranges, global growth is likely to be lower, profits expectations will come under pressure, and risks to equities and credit fixed income markets will be on the rise. are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. involve interest rate, credit, inflation and reinvestment risks, and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. Low-rated, high-yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default. are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets.The government s participation in the economy is still high and, therefore, investments in China will be subject to larger regulatory risk levels compared to many other countries.____________1.

I Believe Rio Tinto Is A Long-Term Bargain Thanks To Net Zero,"It's time to talk about mining and the climate. In this case, we'll discuss the impact of climate measures on metals demand and related developments.On May 15, I wrote an  titled For example, an electric car requires more than 5x more metal than a conventional car. Offshore wind requires massive amounts of copper and zinc. Solar requires silicon and copper.In this article, I'm updating the bull case, using new findings and new data on  own progress. The company is tremendously well-positioned to benefit from rising copper demand, robust iron ore demand, and investments in rare earths like lithium.ISo, let's dive into the detailsAlthough I have 20  fossil fuel exposure, I'm not opposed to clean energy. On the contrary, the reason why I own so much oil exposure is that I do not trust the way governments are handling the energy transition. It's a way to protect myself against energy inflation, not a protest.A forced energy trend leads to inflation, especially because we're now closing perfectly fine coal plants and reducing investments in affordable energy sources.The problem is that the energy transition requires a lot of time and resources. This cannot be forced.For example, looking at the data below, we see that according to the IEA, demand for rare earths will explode. Under current government policies, we could see close to 15 kilotonnes of rare earth demand by 2040. If we follow sustainable development goals, that number could be 35 kilotonnes. Right now, that number is barely a fraction of that.The chart below also shows that China dominates the production of rare earths - even after accelerated investments by other nations.To make things worse, China does not only mine 70  of global rare earths, but it processes 87  of it and refines 91  of it.In other words, if Western nations  the main drivers behind net zero  want to expand their footprint, new mining needs to be accelerated, not just because of a lack of demand.That's where Rio Tinto comes in.  reported last month that the company is on its way to becoming a meaningful lithium producer, focusing on its own capacities instead of buying other producers.According to the article  emphasis addedHaving said that, let's take a closer look at how RIO is doing.Despite strong secular tailwinds, RIO's stock price isn't going anywhere. The problem is that cyclical growth is weak.Looking at COMEX Copper futures, we see that prices are elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels but well below the post-pandemic highs.I believe that favorable supply and demand dynamics prevent commodity prices from going much lower. This was different in the years between 2011 and 2020.It also helps RIO's financials.Despite challenging operating conditions, Rio Tinto showed resilience in the first half of this year, achieving solid underlying earnings of  5.7 billion, a free cash flow of  3.8 billion, a 20  return on capital employed, and a 5  production increase in the first half of 2023.As a result, the company will return  2.9 billion to shareholders, reflecting its disciplined capital allocation and maintaining a net debt of around  4 billion.The company also made a number of strategic investments.As one can imagine, commodity prices were a significant factor impacting financials, with a notable decline in prices for iron ore, copper, and aluminum compared to the first half of 2022.Also, during the earnings call, it was noted that despite some moderation in inflation, it continued to affect costs. The firm also reported cost pressures due to tight labor markets and operational issues in specific projects.The Iron Ore business remained a strong performer, benefitting from increased sales and production, notably from Gudai-Darri. The aluminum business saw operational improvement, with metal volumes up 9  due to the recovery at Kitimat. The highlight was Oyu Tolgoi's first sustainable copper production, a significant milestone for the company. However, operational challenges were noted in Escondida and Kennecott.Having said that, and with regard to the aforementioned growth plans, Rio Tinto plans to steadily increase capital allocation for essential CapEx, sustaining and replacing projects, and decarbonization efforts.Growth investments, including Simandou and other potential projects, are in the pipeline. The company outlined a clear capital expenditure profile, expecting CapEx to rise to  10 billion in each of the next two years.During its earnings call, the company made clear that it sees opportunities in sustainable metals production, driven by increased demand in sectors like solar panels and electric vehicles.The trajectory of aluminum demand in the solar sector, especially in China, is promising. EV sales growth, supported by government policies globally, is expected to boost copper demand, benefiting Rio Tinto. These trends align with their strategy for growth in aluminum and carbon production.However, in China, the company sees slowing iron ore demand.According to In light of these investments, the company maintained its commitment to dividend payouts, declaring a 50  payout to shareholders, amounting to  2.9 billion in the first half of this year, as I already briefly mentioned.When it comes to financial stability, the company has an A-rated balance sheet with a sub-0.5x net leverage ratio.So, what about its valuationThe chart below shows the percentage RIO shares are trading below their all-time high compared to the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite economic indicator. As we already briefly discussed, cyclical headwinds are overshadowing secular growth tailwinds.Nonetheless, analysts are very positive about the stock.The consensus price target hasn't declined since early 2022 and is still at  80, roughly 27  above the current price. Even the lowest price target is above the current price.RIO shares are trading at just 4.7x forward EBITDA, which is one of the best valuations of the past ten years.I believe that RIO has the potential to soar well beyond  80 or  90 per share over the next 2-3 years.However, I also believe that as long as global economic growth indicators are hinting at elevated recession odds, we won't see much upside.Hence, my strategy would be to accumulate RIO shares on weakness. If I didn't have so much cyclical exposure already, I would be a gradual buyer at current prices. If it drops further, investors can average down.For now, I own Caterpillar , which is highly correlated to mining stocks.Eventually, I believe that RIO is poised to benefit from a perfect storm of cyclical and secular tailwinds, pushing commodity prices beyond prior highs.At that point, growth investments will pay off, allowing the company to benefit from better prices and higher volumes.As a result, I will stick to a  rating, which I will upgrade the moment we get a rebound in cyclical growth expectations.In a world where climate measures are reshaping the mining landscape, it's essential to understand the growing demand for metals in the transition to net-zero technologies.Rio Tinto, a major player in the mining industry, is strategically positioned to capitalize on this demand surge, particularly in lithium for electric vehicles, aluminum, and copper.Despite cyclical challenges, the company shows resilience, with solid financials and strategic investments in various projects to sustain and grow supply.Its commitment to sustainability and growth, combined with an attractive valuation, suggests promising potential.Given ongoing economic uncertainties, accumulating Rio Tinto shares during market dips could be the way to go.Ultimately, Rio Tinto is well-poised to capitalize on both cyclical and secular industry shifts, making it a promising long-term investment.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Orient Overseas International: Weakening Freight Environment Leads To Downgrade,"In our  on Orient Overseas  International  Limited   from the 1st of May this year, we concluded that our view ofThe share price is down 24  since our previous article, which had a Hold stance. However, due to the monstrous dividend payment, the return for investors has been a positive 4 .OROVY published its FH 2023 financial results at the end of August, so we want to revisit the thesis again.They say that a picture can tell a thousand words.This graph from OROVY s  shows howIt was not so much the volume that dropped, it was the freight.The total number of containers shipped in FH of 2023 was only reduced by 1 , but the revenue from the operation dropped by 59  Y-o-Y. The operating costs only dropped by 26 .The main reason for this large difference between the drop in revenue and cost lies in the fact that OROVY needs to pay charter hire on vessels chartered in, regardless of whether they sail or not.Their lease commitments on vessels chartered in, as of 30th June 2023, stood at  382 million spread evenly over the next five years. OROVY should be able to trim their fleet even in the SH of 2023 as more than 30 vessels, totaling over 200,000 TEU capacity are coming off charter in SH of 2023.That is good news.Their Capex requirements as of 30th June 2023 were  3.75 billion, which is mostly payments to be made on their new-builds. Most of this will be financed, so it is not a total drain of cash.On the topic of cash, it is quite large at  7.8 billion, but it is important to note that they did  burn   3.4 billion over the last twelve months. Since it would be too optimistic to expect a quick recovery in the market, it will only take a couple of years, and that cash pile will have disappeared.To get a better understanding of this cash drain, you may want to read SA's excellent contributor Henrik Alex's last   which is in the same predicament as they too will burn cash. We agree with his thoughts that the negative cash effect of having expensive vessels under charter and a falling freight rate environment will cause cash to be drained.OROVY will be able to release a portion of these vessels throughout 2023 and early 2024. This will help their situation. On the other hand, they have new building payment installments to be made, which is also a negative impact on their cash flow.This leaves us with the topic of dividends. It surprised us that the company decided to pay a large dividend and even a special dividend for the interim period of FH 2023.After all, the operating cash flow in FH was  548 million, a far cry from the  6.24 billion it was a year earlier. From this cash flow, they will pay out to shareholders a regular interim dividend amounting to  455.6 million plus a special dividend of  112.3 million.Here is their dividend history over the last five years.It is in our opinion not prudent to distribute more in dividends than what the free cash flow is. Especially, in view of the challenging market condition.OROVY did not do any share buyback over the last six months.It is, as we just mentioned, a challenging market. One could say it is the perfect storm, with a reduction in demand and an increase in supply.It is particularly the supply that is the most worrisome, and this author has pointed this out in several articles covering companies such as SFL Corporation  and Maersk .A vast majority of the new ships coming out are large vessels plying the main routes.To make things worse, there is not enough scrapping of tonnage.Even the pointed out in their FH 2023 financial report, that demand is not coming back any time soonThese comments came in relation to a liability they have toward Long Beach Container Terminal, which is lasting for 20 years from October 2019. OROVY has guaranteed a certain minimum volume for each contract year. Failing to meet this, they will have to pay the terminal owners a compensation. It has been estimated they need to make a provision of  894 million to cover this.It is difficult to predict. Especially about the future, as the Danish physicist Niels Bohr is said to have proclaimed.How will the economy look like a year from nowWe can only rely on past data of supply and demand and try to inject a  reasonable  estimate of what it is going to be in the relatively near future of say  one year .Even the respectable economist John Galbraith once said thatOur prediction is that the giant liner companies will have no choice but to fight for the business of filling up the growing fleet of vessels by offering lower prices.At least for the next two years. What happens thereafter, is anybody s guess.The risk to the thesis is that we misjudge the supply demand equation. A sharp improvement in demand could help OROVY to deal with the over-supply of new vessels.However, we believe the chance of this is small.We believe lower freight and volume will continue to drain liner companies, such as OROVY of much-needed cash and dividends will be a thing of the past.In terms of putting a valuation on OROVY, many fellow authors here on SA like to use the traditional method of Price Book value. From that perspective, OROVY and most of its peers look very attractive, although OROVY is not as attractive as its peers.In a falling market, which all of them are experiencing, how much you theoretically could get for the assets is not that important.Surviving - that is what matters now.Fortunately, for most of them, they do have manageable debt loads. Now they need to batten down the hatches and sail through this storm, as they have done in the past.We cannot put an exact price where we would judge OROVY to be a  fair price . Lower, or no earnings, will resent any kind of valuation we may put on it.We believe the share prices will come down, and that is the main reason why we are inclined to downgrade OROVY from a Hold to a Sell.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Other additional factors not anticipated by managementI would now like to turn the call over to FabioThank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.For the third quarter of 2023, we reported net revenues of  4.4 billion with adjusted EBITDA of  324 million translating to a 7.4  margin. Throughout the quarter, we experienced very volatile market fundamentals and persistent consumer inflation. Nonetheless, we remained focused on our strategies of diversification, key customer partnerships and operational excellence. Given our consistent execution, improved margins relative to prior quarters across all regions.In the U.S., our key customer partnerships drove significant growth in case-ready and strong performance in Small Birds where our operational excellence efforts improve our efficiencies in Big Bird. We continue to further diversify our portfolio in both branded fresh products and prepared offerings given our growth with leading retailers and food service providers. Based on this combinated efforts, the U.S. improve its profitability compared to previous quarters.As for the U.K. and Europe, we further diversify our marketplace presence through branded innovation and recently launched new products, secured additional long term supply arrangements with key customers and drove further efficiencies in our manufacturing network and back office to operational excellence. As a result, we have reinforced our foundations for profitable growth.In Mexico, we experienced a strong third quarter given improvements in live operations, favorability and feed inputs and currency and balance supply and demand fundamentals. Our diversification through branded and prepare offerings continue to gain marketplace traction and our operational excellence efforts to drive efficiencies and expand capacities remain on track.In the third quarter of 2023, ready to cook production of U.S. chicken experienced a decrease of 1.9  relative to the same period last year. USDA estimates primarily influenced by fewer headcounts along with more typical changes in industry production given seasonal trends. The most recent USDA outlook for Q4 of 2023 indicates that the industry continues to reduce excess and chicks placement relative to last year, suggesting a more restrained supply scenario in the near future.Concerning our cold storage supply, reported September 2023 USDA cold storage inventories are below prior year and indicate the levels have declined relative to June 2023. Breast meat remains in line with the end of June levels and dark meat inventories continue to trend below last year.Considering the overall supply of protein, USDA expect a slight reduction in domestic protein availability for the remainder of the calendar 2023. This reflects a view of slow growing broiler supply compared with contracting beef and pork availability. With relative lower beef and pork availability, food inflation higher than historical average and current economic uncertainty, chicken may be advantaged given its availability, affordability and flexibility.Domestic volume demand for chicken improved significantly in the third quarter of 2023. The retail channel momentum continued, providing more balanced growth in volumes across all departments. The fresh department was supported by volume growth coming across both front half and back half cuts, and we are finally seeing increased promotional activities.We remain positive on the potential of this category expected in competing protein supplies, increasing competing meat prices and more normal promotional activity has contributed to consistent sales volumes over the quarter. Elsewhere in the retail category, the frozen department has added incremental volume and unit sales, and we are now seeing volume sales growth from both the commodity and value-added frozen segments. Meanwhile, the dairy prepared department has steadily added in both units and dollar sales.In the foodservice channel, volume sales also increased. Commercial distribution volume demand has improved as the number of operators purchasing chicken has grown and those operators, already with chicken have experienced an increase in velocity. Similar to retail, Q3 of this year was reflected of a more balanced volume growth across front half cuts and back half cuts. The non-commercial distribution sub-channel increased volumes, albeit at relatively lower prices compared to the record prices of last year.As a result of improving retail and food service volume sales and balanced supply during the quarter, wholesale pricing for commodity chicken experienced price improvements during August and September, especially on breast meat and tenders providing a lift to cut out pricing.Commodity prices have recently reverted to the normal seasonal pricing patterns and are now close to historical leverage, which is not a sustainable level, considering the industry's elevated costs from grain, labor and other inputs relative to prepandemic levels. Nonetheless, the supply and demand balance appears to be improving as we enter Q4 of 2023.On the exports, Q3 was remarkably stable and with solid demand for U.S. broiler. The reduction of 2.2  on year-over-year exports was mainly driven by China, where sales were down 28 , mainly due to ongoing high path avian influenza and relative limited eligibility for export among poultry-producing states. Excluding this impact, U.S. exports will have been up 2.5  year-over-year, a good indication that strong demand exists for U.S. products globally.High path avian influenza emerging commercial turkey flock towards the end of September and beginning of October. Although these were the first deductions since mid-April and occur far from major broiler producing states, it does increase vigilance throughout the industry. As for business implications, most of our trading partners have adjusted their trade restrictions to reflect impact zones or states in the event of a commercial outbreak.Other than China, we do not expect to see material disruption to trade in the event of an  HPAI  break in commercial broiler. Consistent with the previous quarter, as volume sales have maintained growth in the channel, U.S. cold storage inventories of combined dark meat have trended below a year ago and up 19  below the five-year average. Driven by a 32  reduction in year-over-year last quarter inventories at the end of September.Based on our current trajectory, we expect our exports to continue to outpace last year, as we further diversify our client base and country of destination portfolios. We're exporting supporting an already healthy U.S. dark meat market potentially exists for relatively strong pricing and demand than typical expected in the fourth quarter.Turning to feed ingredients. Harvest is progressing in the U.S. despite below-trend yields, the historically large corn acreage has contributed to a recovery in U.S. corn ending stocks for the '23, '24 crop year. Production is forecast at just over 15 billion bushels making the largest crop since 2016. Ending stocks are currently forecasted at 2.1 billion bushels, an increase of 55  year-over-year.The large U.S. production comes certainly after a record Brazilian corn crop that is still compete priced. Global ending stocks for '23, '24 are forecasted to sell 14 million metric tons, assuming favorable South American weather and Argentina's production returns to normal levels after a remarkably weak prior year. As for soybeans, U.S. crop is estimated to be nearly 4  lower year-over-year, because of a reduced acreage and limited yield improvements, resulting in another year with historical low ending stocks.Nonetheless, last year's record crop in Brazil remained competitive in export markets, creating a large demand for the U.S. production. Though only in the planting stage, both Brazil and Argentina soy-crops are expected to be larger year-over-year, boosting global supply, like corn, South American weather will be key in realizing growth.U.S. soybean meal market should be well supplied, given continued crush industry expansion, assuming Argentina's forecast rebound in soybean production is realized. Further price pressure could arise. Although soybean or inflows can be heavily influenced by biofuel policies. The growth in production and diversification of import inflows should balance supply and demand.Turning to wheat. Global production is currently forecast to fall by 6 million metric tons from last year, largely driven by a drop from Russia's record crop. In U.S., wheat production increased 4.4 million metric tons from last year whereas Australia and Argentina estimates have been reduced, given slightly unfavorable growing conditions. Black Sea exports continue without an agreement between Russia and Ukraine that should be monitored.Our U.S. business continued to navigate very volatile market fundamentals in big bird segment, along with persistent consumer inflation. Our diversified portfolio across bird sizes mitigated this prolonged challenges and we maintain our intense focus, and operational excellence and cultivation of key customer partnerships. Within big bird, the team continue to drive action points to further enhance operational excellence in our manufacturing locations.During the quarter, we achieved improvements in production efficiencies, both at the live operations and other clients. These efforts were also aided by enhanced market fundamentals during the quarter, but work still remains to consistently realize sustainable margin levels.In case ready, the team improved our volumes to keep customer partnerships. We increase distribution additional, promotional activity and improvement mix. In addition, the team maintained its operational excellence in both quality and service levels despite significant disruptions from Hurricane Idalia in the Southeastern United States. Equally important, we further diversify our sales pipeline, we differentiated high attribute effort that helps driving traffic and differentiation to our key customers.Small Bird remains strong given stable demand from QSRs, robust daily performance with key customers and sustained operational excellence. Given their consistent quality and service levels, the team secured additional business throughout the quarter and beyond across retail and foodservice. Our efforts to further diversify our portfolio to prepare foods continue to gain momentum.As the team realized significant growth through increased distribution, promotional activities and innovation. In retail, our fully cooked branded offerings Just BARE and Pilgrim's collectively grew 65  compared to last year. Within foodservice, the team reinvigorated growth with distributors, schools and commercial chains through our targeted expansion teams.Digitally influenced sales continue to play a role on commerce for prepared branded offerings. Our key customer media partnerships and investments have demonstrated their effectiveness as click-through rates are nearly double industry standards and consumer acquisition costs have fallen off. Equally important, digitally sales increased 90  over the past year.Given the exceptionally well-received shopper reaction, we look forward to increase partnership through the trade to further diversify our portfolio through branded offerings. Similar to the U.S., our U.K. and European business experienced an environment with continued consumer inflation. Improved pork fundamentals and relative affordability of chicken help mitigate this impact, but the team remains focused on our strategies.To that end, the business trended its key customer partnership with leading retailers and foodservice providers through targeted promotional activities and customer-specific offerings. The team also secured additional long-term business with selected retailers through efficient supply chain capabilities and differentiated product offerings.Our diversification through branded products continue to progress as both Fridge Raiders and the Richmond brands gained share throughout the quarter. Innovation also continues to play a key role as we launched over 100 items, many of which are designed to reinvent our fresh meals category.Our new product performance is becoming increasingly recognized throughout the trade as we receive multiple awards for development and launch execution. We continue to drive diversification and key customer focus through operational excellence efforts. To-date, we've made significant progress in the optimization of our manufacturing network and back-office support activities.Moving forward, will explore additional opportunities throughout our production footprint to increase efficiencies and drive scale to meet our growth aspirations. We will also continue to closely monitor various economic indicators. Wage growth is now ahead of inflation and consumer confidence has resumed in support trajectory.Based on these factors, consumers may be willing to increase protein consumption, trade up within retail, or pursue away-from-home eating opportunities in foodservice. Given our diversified portfolio and key customer presence across channels and operational capabilities, we are positioned to adjust to these trends and accelerate our growth.Turning to Mexico. The business experienced a strong performance in the third quarter, given improvements in live operation, grain and currency favorability and more balanced supply and demand fundamentals in the region. The business strengthening its key customer focus, given continued growth with leading retailers and QSRs. Equally important, our diversification efforts through branded offerings continue to gain traction among retailers and consumers alike.In Prepared Foods, the Pilgrim's brand grew double-digits compared to last year, whereas our recent Just BARE launch has been exceptionally well received through the marketplace. Moving forward, we'll further cultivate our branded presence through additional marketing support for the Unique Taste and Favorites and the introduction of a Just BARE fresh offering.We continue our commitment to driving profitable growth through continued investment and operational excellence. We have completed our expansion in the Merida region and expect to initiate production in the first quarter of 2022, increasing the geographical diversification of our progress. Also, our projects to enhance biosecurity for live operations, our progress as planned, and it should be completed according to schedule.We're also proud to have published our sustainability report in September to highlight our continued progress on our journey to become a leader in environment, social and governance matters. We have made significant progress against the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals since 2019 as our team members' Global Safety Index improved by 54  and our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse emissions intensity fell by 20 .We continue to invest in the communities in which we serve as we have funded over  50 million in projects through our Hometown Strong initiatives and we provided higher education tuition fee for 350 team members, all members of their families to our better futures.Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Matt Galvanoni.For the third quarter of 2023, net revenues were  4.36 billion versus  4.47 billion a year ago with adjusted EBITDA of  324 million in a margin of 7.4  compared to  460.5 million and a 10.3  margin in Q3 last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 7.0  in the U.S. compared to 14.7  a year ago.For our U.K. and Europe business, adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 6.1  for Q3 compared to 4.0  last year. In Mexico adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 12.4  compared to a loss of 1.5  a year ago.Moving to the overall U.S. results, our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 came in at  174.1 million compared to quarterly profit of  418.3 million a year ago, when the Jumbo Cutout was just starting to come off its all-time highs. Over the last three quarters we've grown U.S. profitability sequentially despite volatile market conditions.Our key customer partnerships helped drive strength in our case-ready business during Q3 and we see further momentum in retail volumes continuing. Also, the U.S. Small Bird and Prepared Foods businesses continued to their strong 2023 performance during the third quarter. Our Big Bird business realized quarter-over-quarter improvements through a combination of operational excellence programs and enhanced market fundamentals.In the U.K. and Europe, adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was  80.4 million versus  48.5 million in 2022. Through its previously discussed operational excellence efforts, the business improved profitability over 65  year-over-year and it is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing profitability.During Q3 the business also continued to benefit from the back office integration and its network optimization programs. As inflation moderates, the U.K. consumer should return to more normal shopping patterns, enabling further growth for our business.Mexico generated  69.5 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 compared to a loss of  6.3 million last year. The Mexican businesses experienced more balanced supply demand fundamentals or reduction in birds disease challenges and it's live operations due to teams extraordinary efforts and foreign currency favorability. Overall, our SG A in the quarter was lower year-over-year primarily due to a decrease incentive compensation and legal defense costs in the U.S., as well as other targeted cost efficiencies achieved in the U.S. and U.K., Europe businesses.We spent  146 million in CapEx in the third quarter which is higher on a more normalized run rate basis primarily due to our investments in the Athens, Georgia expansion and construction of our new protein conversion plant in South Georgia. We reiterate our commitment to investment in strong ROCE projects that will improve our operational efficiencies through automation and tailor our operations to address key customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for Pilgrims.Although the U.S. chicken commodity market has been quite volatile over the last year, our overall balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. As of the end of the third quarter, we had over  2 billion in total cash and revolver availability. After quarter-end in early October, we completed a  500 million long 10-year notes offering and paid off our 2027 notes through a tender operating process.Also in October, we entered into a new five year U.S. credit facility which was upsized by  50 million to  850 million is now unsecured. We're pleased with the results of these recent transactions and the overall interest in our debt offerings. Following these transactions, our net debt maturity is now not until 2031. Our liquidity position provides us flexibility during times of volatility in the U.S. commodity markets and allows us to explore further growth opportunities.As at the end of Q3, our net debt was approximately  2.8 billion with the leverage ratio of 3.5x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which is outside of our target ratio range of 2x to 3x. We anticipate this quarter to be the peak of our leverage ratio as we're about to last very challenging fourth quarter '22 and first quarter 2023 results, given the depressed U.S. commodity market pricing during those periods.Net interest expense in the quarter totaled  33.5 million. We anticipate our full year net interest expense to be approximately  160 million excluding refinancing costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8  and 9.8  year-to-date. We are now estimating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14 . As a reminder, this amount could fluctuate depending on the final mix of earnings across our tax jurisdictions.Our capital allocation approach will remain disciplined as we look to grow the company and will continue to align our investment priorities and their overall strategies and portfolio diversification. Key customer growth, operational excellence and commitment to team member health and safety.Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead.Good morning, Fabio and Matt. Congrats on the very strong results. On the two questions, so first of all, we saw a very nice improvement and continued improvement just sequentially as it relates to the business in the U.S. from an operating income perspective. Now as we look into next year, and assuming maybe Mexico to stay as strong in the U.K., as well to continue to improve. How do you think about the potential of profitability in 2024  Or in other words, do you think it's achievable to reach what would be more of a normalized level of 6  to 8  operating income margins in 2024  That would be my first question.Sure. Thanks for the question. Ben, as always, we look at our differentiated portfolio. We created this portfolio a long time ago where we target to have a portfolio that can capture upside on the commodity market. So, we have a big exposure to the commodity in the U.S. with the Big Bird operation, but we can protect the downside and have more stable business with our kids ready, our Prepared Foods and our Small Bird business.If you look at the performance this year, the Small Bird, the Prepared Foods and the case ready has performed really well. At the same level as the year before. What has been very volatile has been the commodity business or the Big Bird segments. Looking into the next year three things, I think, are very important for us to identify and to monitor. I think, one is the competing proteins.As we see by the USDA numbers released yesterday, we're expecting limited growth in the domestic availability of total protein in the United States, being beef really down, compared to year-over-year. And at a very expected high price, which tends to favor chicken in promotional activities, both in the retail and food service. I think we're also seeing a moderation in the high prices of grain.As we said, we are having very favorable production, especially on the corn side, which should help our costs overall. And also the promotional activity for the chicken, both, again, in the retail and food service. Also, our operations have improved. I think we're lapping - the big problem that we have in staffing, because of the pandemic. All of our operations are now fully staffed.We still have a lot of operational improvements to capture based on training and based on full operations and better mix, but I think that should help our operations next year. So what we have is a scenario that is posing some headwinds for chicken overall. Or tailwinds, in terms of now what can change, of course, the economy can be different if the consumer has less available money to spend. But on the overall chicken has been more resilient to even economic downturn scenarios.Okay. Perfect. And then my second question, I guess that one is for Matt. Just coming back on the capital allocation side, and you just said on the call, to continue to invest in high returning projects, et cetera. Can you update us on what you're expecting full year CapEx to come out  I mean obviously, we're year-to-date already almost at the levels we were in full year last year. So is that run rate about  150 million for the fourth quarter, should we expect that to come in as well  And how do you think about CapEx into next year  Is there a normalization  Or you would still expect some elevated levelsYes. Good question, Ben.  We dealt  in fourth quarter and look, I think in total for the year, we'll definitely be north of  550 million. Our run rate should maybe slightly slow down as we wind down the Athens construction, but we still will be finalizing our construction in our South Georgia facility, which are two of the bigger strategic projects, which we've been mentioning over the last year.So the run rate that we've been having at kind of this  140 million probably pretty close to what I would see kind of going into the fourth quarter in full year north of  550. I think relative to next year, I think what we'll do as we get through our budget process and our strategic focus here as we wind through our budgets here in the fourth quarter and meeting with our Board, we'll be giving updates to you guys on that, at our earnings call in February.But generally speaking, we break this minute, we don't have those larger strategic projects that have been initiated similar to the Athens and South Georgia protein conversion, which would tell us to it'd probably be down slightly for sure year-over-year.And also, over the last two years, Ben we invested heavily in automation as we have been talking about, especially on the breast deboning automation. And as we have the plants fully staffed, of course, we're always looking to the payback of those projects, but we don't expect significant investments in that scenario.Okay. Thank you. Congrats again.Thank you, Ben.Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning.Hi Ben. Good morning, Ben.Fabio I want to pick up on some comments you made just around the fourth quarter. You noted that supply production levels are trending down through kind of most of the third quarter, and it looks to be continuing into the fourth quarter based on the leading indicators. You noted prices are at a historically average level, but relative to grain prices seem unsustainably low. In light of that and the demand backdrop that you've laid out, do you think we could have a counter seasonal move in breast meat prices  As we move through the quarter, recognizing I know the prices are under pressure a bit to start the quarterYes. It's a great point. But usually, Q4 is the lowest price for chicken, because of all the events that we have Thanksgiving and Christmas is typically not the best sales moment for chicken as we have a lot of features on the other proteins. I think starting mid-November and beginning of December, what we usually see in our industry is a big increase in terms of demand because of the expectations for the beginning of the year.I think people talk about New Year's resolution. But I think it's more after the Christmas and after New Year, people go back to the normal buying patterns and chicken is an everyday item that is very important for our families. So what we expect, similar to prior years is a reduction in supply. And we're seeing, as I mentioned, that on the exits that are informed by USDA.And we're seeing a pickup in demand starting mid-November, beginning of December, and that's when we expect the prices to start increasing. I think the volatility has been really strong on the breast meat. If you look at the cut out, there'll be other parts where we are seeing a much better supply and demand scenario. I think wings that was very low last year as it was priced out of the menu and many food services.It's coming back to the menu. So we're seeing a steady increase in the price of wings. Of course, the wings season that just started also helps. And we're seeing, as we mentioned, steady improvement in the exports as the leg quarters from the United States are very competitively priced compared to all the other proteins available on the export scenario. So when you think about the cutout, we're seeing more volatility on the breast meat, but very well supported on leg quarters and on the wings.Okay. Very good. My second question is related to Mexico. Another strong quarter there. Can you provide any color on the go-forward outlook for 4Q  And then Hurricane Otis, it doesn't look like you guys have operations where that made landfall and was, most of the devastation was concentrated. But do you expect that to have any impact on operations at allYes. Sure. On Mexico, as we always mentioned. It can be very volatile quarter-over-quarter, but we expect to be really strong year-over-year, and that's not different this year. I think last year, we saw a very strong first quarter and a very weak second quarter. Of course, that was based on some internal issues that we have on the live operations.First half and second half, yes.Yes. But this year, what we are seeing is a strong demand for chicken. As I mentioned, I think the first semester and even Q3, which is not normal because what happens normally, the seasonality in Mexico is that as schools are out, people change their buying patterns, and we see a weakness in the purchasing of chicken. And as the school come back, we're seeing a lot of available income coming for school supplies and also an impact in demand.But this year has been different than other years, and we see a very strong Q3. October, September and October has always been the lowest levels of pricing in Mexico, and that was not different. This year, but we are seeing prices already recovering. There is always the competition of competing proteins and imports from both United States and Brazil, impacting the demand in Mexico as well. But I think that we are seeing a very favorable scenario coming in the next quarter.Yes. And Ben, just a couple of things to follow-up. One is I could say also foreign currency volatility is something we're currently always monitoring there in Mexico. And your question relative to the storm, my understanding the storm hit the - off  coco  area, which does not, it's not an area that has a lot of production for us, and it has now thankfully dissipated. The storm is not nearly severe. So, we're not seeing, at this point, any severe impacts to our operations at this time.Okay. Great. Thanks so much.The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on some of the operational improvements. In the press release you alluded to on covering some incremental opportunities. Can you elaborate a little bit on what those are  And is there any way to quantify, I guess, the magnitude of those or the contributions of those improvements that you've realized so far this year and then the new ones going forwardSure. Thank you for the question, Andrew. Yes, every year in the budget time, we identify the opportunities for operational improvements. We call that opening the gaps. And then also during the budgeting we created action plans to close those gaps and capture those operational improvement. Typically, we expect around  100 million to  200 million in improvements every year, doing things to more efficiently capturing better yield, better live operations and better mix.So last year was no different. We identified a lot of operational improvements that we can take I think the biggest challenge was the staffing of our plants. So, we were not fully staffed. It was very difficult to attract talent to our operations. And as the 2023 started, we're seeing an improvement in that scenario. And as I mentioned, right now, we are fully staffed. So, I think the challenge right now is to train all of our team members to operate efficiently and capture those improvements, as I mentioned.Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess I just had a question more broadly on your market share. I mean given some of the dynamics and the sales trends and distribution, et cetera, that you've called out. It would seem certainly like you're gaining share in the U.S. And I'm, in particular, interested on the distribution side with respect to case ready. If you could talk maybe about what's going on there  I mean do you think that you're taking share from other key players in the industry  Or is there a broader growth here  That you're servicing with the key customers that fits into  How would you characterize what's going on there  Thanks.Yes. That's a great question. When we think about market share, we don't look overall. We look into the individual segments, right  And as we mentioned, we have a very well-balanced portfolio. We are the leaders in the Small Bird category, and we've been gaining market share as our presence with key customers have been increasing. So we're gaining market share with our key customers and our key customers are winning in the marketplace, and that's more different on the case-ready segment.We've been growing our market share because we've been increasing our market share with our key customers and our key customers are growing faster than all the other customers or players in that segment. As an example, we increased, the market increase in Q3, 3.4  in the fresh category in the retail, and we increased 9 . Because of our penetration in those key customers, again, that are growing faster than all others.On the Big Bird category, I think there have been a lot of additions in the last for 5 years in this industry, and we have not increased in number of plants. Of course, we have improved in terms of number of heads and we have improved in terms of yields. But in that category, I think we've been having a very stable market share.Great. Very helpful perspective. Thank you very much.The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning.Good morning, Peter.Maybe to actually follow-up or ask Andrew's question a bit different on market share. One of the dynamics I feel like we're seeing, at least within U.S. retail, is maybe a shift from kind of the center store or some of the frozen categories to the perimeter, just as consumers are kind of being more, choosy with dollars. Given you guys kind of have exposure in both parts that just, it seems like that kind of is what you're seeing as well, maybe that the perimeter is gaining share relative to the frozen or seller store categories. But wondering if you can just comment on kind of that dynamic and what you're seeingNo, I think it's a great question, Peter. And yes, I think we are seeing customers shifting from the frozen category to the fresh category, maybe on IQS to the fresh category. I think we have a great offering that differentiates our key customers. As we mentioned, we produce tailored products to our customers that are differentiated and targeted towards their specific segments. So we have Fresh from Florida.We have Fresh from Texas. We have differentiated offerings in terms of no antibiotic ever in terms of Veggie Fed that we tailor our products to their specific customers. We augment that with our, just BARE brand, which is a higher antibiotic offering that complements the portfolio of our key customers. And that's why I mentioned we've been growing on the fresh category.Now on the frozen category, the fully cooked category for Pilgrim's  have been increasing year-over-year, which are Just BARE launches and Just BARE penetration. So for us, what we are seeing is the growth in the frozen fully cooked category through our Just BARE and Pilgrim's brands and a growth in our fresh offerings with partnership with key customers on customer brands.What is reducing and you're absolutely right. This is what we call IQS, which is more a commodity operation that is a frozen offering of a non-value-added breast meat or wind or tender.Got it. No, that's helpful. And Matt, your comments just around the balance sheet, right, the leverage position has kind of improved here or should continue to improve here into the next quarter. Just given where the cash position sits on the balance sheet, how are you thinking about opportunities to redeploy the cash, whether that be opportunistic share buyback, which you guys have done in the past or potentially M A opportunities that are out thereYes. And I think just one thing just to make sure everyone's cognizant of. We see the cash balance at the end of the quarter. That number will be down  350-ish million with the tender offer we did, because we did the bond offering for  500 million and paid down debt for  850 million. So just to make sure people are cognizant there that our cash balances are close to that  500 million,  550 million area at this stage.Our view on this, look, is we want to grow, but we're going to grow in a disciplined manner. We've done some nice CapEx with some key customers for some different attributes that they may want in their products that where we've had some higher CapEx run rate, more of an organic growth perspective. And we see more of those opportunities coming. And so, the way we look at it from a cash perspective right now is growth in a disciplined manner. I don't know, Fabio, do you want to add anything furtherI think that's absolutely right. We're always looking for creating value for our team members and our shareholders. And we look for acquisitions that complement our portfolio. We are always looking for things that, we can add value and operate it better or complement our portfolio of brands or geographies. So, I think the market has been really strong on M A activity, and we will do an acquisition when we believe that will create value for our company.The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.Good morning, Adam.Good morning. So a lot of discussion on boneless market and you've alluded to the volatility in the market and you did see some pretty notable almost some unusual counter-seasonal strength through the third quarter. I would love to just get kind of your thoughts on kind of how, what was really driving kind of the market just as we think about incremental potential sources of volatility moving forward, kind of more recently was an interesting one that would be helpful just to frame, think about what could, how that could recover if at allYes, sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, we've been seeing that the volatile part of the cut out has been the breast meat. As I mentioned, leg quarters has steadily increased. Wings resumed their growth trajectory with being back to the menus and more featuring, but breast meat has been really volatile. We saw some big increases at the end of the quarter, and that was mainly restocking of the, both the foodservice distributors and the, what we call industrial.So, the further processors and the branded companies that sell on the retail, I think over the beginning of the year, what we saw was with high prices at retail, those industrial customers, as we mentioned, we're actually buying less. And we saw that in every single earnings release from the big brand names that they were selling at a higher price, but a lower volume.And I think that was combined with lower production with a reduction in their inventories as well. So I think we saw during the end of the quarter, a little bit of restocking of those. And we saw some pickup in the demand on the retail. I think we saw a lot of features. We always mentioned that the commodity segment was always augmented by the case-ready demand during the grilling season. And I think we saw that late after Labor Day this year. But we are seeing that as of now as well.Where the case-ready category or the retail category with increasing features is actually buying big bird breast meat from commodity players to augment their offerings on the retail. So I think that big increase was based on these two factors, more industrial for the rebounding or rebuilding of the stocks more retail based on the features. And the foodservice continues to be strong.I think the distribution on the foodservice, as we see the number of servings and penetration on the menu, chicken has improved once again because of the availability and the higher price of the competing proteins.That's helpful. And then if I just have a second question on the U.K. and Europe and the margin had a nice kind of sequential improvement again, just help us think about the visibility that you have on the margin on the profit side moving into the first half of next year. Is there any concern on volatility in hog markets  Or do you think that you're now in a better balance between the network and the Fresh poultry, the Prepared Foods and the Pork businessYes, that's a great point, Adam. Yes, as we build this portfolio, we have a very well balanced between Chicken, between the Fresh pork and Prepared foods, both meat and meals. I think we have invested in innovation as well. I think that has been one of the great strides that we made on helping our key customers to succeed just like we do in the U.S. investing into innovation.As I mentioned, we have more than 100 new products launched, especially on the news scenario. On the fresh, I think what we are seeing is that Pork has helped with a more balanced supply and demand. I think now the live operation of pork is profitable in Europe and was negative for a significant amount of time, and we are the highest have the highest integration of all players in U.K. And on the fresh chicken, what we are seeing is a significant increase in demand because of the affordability of chicken. As we are seeing inflation in Europe was really high.And it was over the wage inflation. But right now, that change, and we're seeing that wages are actually outpacing inflation. So the consumer must have more available income. We are seeing the translation of that into the consumer confidence in the region, and we expect an overall increase in the demand of protein.Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.Thank you, Adam.The next question comes from Priya Ohri Gupta from Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi. Thank you so much for taking our question. Matt, one for you, if I could start. Your free cash flow performance has been coming in better, largely driven by strength in working capital. Just given some of the commentary you guys have made around the grain market, how should we think about working capital for the full year as it relates to cash from operations  Could we end up being in a more neutral position on working capital  Or is there even scope for it to possibly be positiveThanks for the question. I think it's probably overall more net neutral. I do see, though, as you pointed out, grain moderating. We have already started to see some of that. That started to hit our P L here we'll call it sort of in the second half of the quarter of Q3.And we do see a little bit more moderation here on the grain side. So that should be beneficial to us, both from a P L perspective, but also as you point out, a working capital perspective. So we do see a little bit of continued improvement from where we sit today, but I wouldn't take that just too far at this stage.Okay. That's helpful. And then can I, I just wanted to follow up around the more constructive comments around the European consumer. You just talked about how wages are outpacing inflation and you're starting to see increased more confidence is really sort of dovetailed with some of the more cautious commentary we've heard from others around the European consumer versus the U.S. consumer.So how, I guess, how sustainable do you think some of these stronger trends in terms of the U.S. consumer could be relative to sort of uplifting protein demand  Should we think about this as quarter-to-quarter, I think that we should track  Or is there something more sustainable that we could think about as we model out into '24Yes. I think in Europe, what we were seeing, it was an overall reduction in demand, especially on the red meat category and a little bit of pork too because it was more expensive than all others. Chicken was actually steady or gaining a little bit of, let's say, market share in the overall protein category. As we mentioned, as we're seeing the economy improving, we were seeing that the consumer with more available income, and we expect a better overall demand both in retail and in foodservice.I think also when we were seeing a little bit of higher inflation in Europe, what we were seeing people trading out of some branded and going to more the retail brands, which typically are more affordable, and despite that, we saw a growth in our Richmond because of the strength of the brand, but we believe that, that could be a nice change, and we can see consumers going back to some branded offerings. Which could help, especially the Richmond brand and our Fridge Raiders brands in the region.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Fabio for closing comments.Thank you very much. Over the past year, we've experienced many challenges throughout our business, ranging from volatile market fundamentals, persistent inflation, elevated input costs and compressed spread across proteins. Nonetheless, we continue to invest in our business and building the best team in the industry, driving profitable growth through key customer partnerships, diversification and operational excellence, making our foundation even stronger as conditions change.Moving forward, we are confident on market condition improvements as wage growth is outpacing inflation, floating spreads and return to more normal levels and grade production has increased. Regardless of external factors, we remain relentless in our focus on execution of our strategy, reinforcing our competitive advantage and becoming the best and most respected company in our industry is creating a better future for our members. Thank you for joining us today.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T15:32:10.000-04:00
W. P. Carey Is Fairly Valued: No Margin Of Safety,"The economics of REITs as an asset class is influenced by two cycles. There is the space market cycle which has to do with the supply and demand for a particular type of space. For a sale-leaseback specialist such  W. P. Carey is a spread investor. W. P. Carey acquires a company s real estate and then leases it back to them on a long-term, triple-net basis. To finance the purchase of the real estate, they access debt and equity markets at a lower cost than the rental revenue they earn from the leaseback. The tenant takes care of substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property, including real estate taxes and property insurance. W. P. Carey simply collects rent and profits from the spread between the rental income earned and the cost of the capital used to acquire the real estate.For a REIT, this spread can be calculated as the difference between the capitalization rate, or cap rate, and the cost of capital. The cap rate is the net operating income divided by the value of the assets and the cost of capital can be decomposed into the cost of debt, the cost of equity and the relative weights of each form of capital employed in the business.Let us first estimate the cap rate.Please take a look at Table 1 for the implied capitalization rate for the Diversified REIT sector for the last seven quarters.There has been a steady upward trend in cap rates for the diversified REIT sector. If we take the average of the two recent quarters, we arrive at average cap rate for the current half year at 7.54 . To this estimate, we should probably consider some adjustments. W.P. Carey has meaningful exposure to Europe and cap rates have not yet shown the same trajectory in Europe as they have in the U.S. In the , the CEO echoed similar sentiments and remarked that transactions in the first half of the year were executed at a cap rate of 7.3 . We shall use this cap rate for our analysis.For W. P. Carey to earn economic profit, their cost of capital must be less than 7.3 . Let us now turn our attention to the cost of capital for W. P. Carey.In order to calculate the cost of capital, we have to calculate the cost of debt, the cost of equity and scale each cost to the extent they are used in the business. Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by W.P. Carey. Please take a look at Table 2.Now that we have the relative weights, we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost. Please take a look at Table 3 for the cost of equity. There are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity. We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM  in which we essentially add a spread to the risk-free rate and scale the spread by the volatility of a particular stock.The beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market. The beta is 0.79 implies that W.P. Carey s stock is less sensitive than the market. Conceptually, this is justified since W.P. Carey s revenue stream is secured by counterparties that are often investment grade tenants. It is for this reason that triple-net lease REITs are sometimes considered bond-like investments and are frequently classified as a defensive holding. Moving on to the next statistic, the risk-free rate. I use the 10-year Treasury which is a frequently used proxy for the risk-free rate. The last input is the equity risk of 4.40   reflecting the most recent monthly data coming from . This is well within the historic range. The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 7.76  .Now that we have a cost of equity, let us now estimate the cost of debt. Please take look at Table 4 in which we provide the issuer rating for W.P. Carey and the median yield for similarly situated fixed-income investments.The implication of the cost of debt is that should W. P. Carey wish to secure or refinance debt at about the 10-year tenor, it would be facing a cost of debt of 5.75 . This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 5.75  of their long-term debt because fixed-rate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower. In general, businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates. Because of this, the actual cost of debt will be less. Nevertheless, W.P. Carey has a 2.45  due February 2032 priced at  77.25 that exchanged hands at a  on September 8. The issue is callable so that would lend support to our 5.75  estimate.Now that we have a cost of debt, the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital. Please take a look at Table 5.The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate level. Additionally, W. P. Carey does not have any preferred shares outstanding.In Table 6 we quantify the amount of the value that is created by W. P. Carey by subtracting the cost of capital from the cap rate.In the current macroeconomic environment, W. P. Carey is able to generate value to the tune of 30 basis points.A REIT creating value is only part of the picture. While it is necessary condition for a potential investment, it isn t a sufficient one. We also have to ask to whom does that value accrue to  Fixed income holders  Management  Equity investors  As equity investors with minority interests, we want to make sure that at least some of that value created shows up in our account.To estimate how much value is created on behalf on equity investors, we will revisit the cost of equity calculated previously.We estimated the cost of equity using CAPM which is a statistical way of ascertaining the cost of equity. There are other methods to estimate the cost of equity. Also, cost of equity is the terminology used from the company s perspective. It is the  for them to obtain  capital. From the investor s point of view, the cost of equity is the required rate of return for an investment. And for many investors, particularly REIT investors, the required rate of return has two components  the current dividend yield and the growth rate of the dividends.Please take a look at Table 7 where we look at the total return as the current dividend yield plus five-year growth rate as supplied by Seeking Alpha.In the next Table, we compare the total return just presented to the cost of equity presented in an earlier table.We can see from Table 8 that there is currently a negative value of three basis points. Had there been a minimal  difference, that would not have changed the investment picture. You want to see a wide, positive difference as a signal that there is an adequate margin of safety in the investment. An adequate margin of safety is important in an analysis like this in which a small change in one variable can exert a meaningful difference in the results.A second takeaway from the foregoing might be that the stock appears efficiently priced by the market.The spread between the cap rate and cost of capital is positive and a welcome sign for W. P. Carey in particular and probably other REITs in the diversified sector as well. While W. P. Carey creates value as a business, an investment in the equity is not as compelling. The cost of equity estimated using CAPM can be thought of as an opportunity cost and the total return that can be obtained at today s price does not meet the opportunity cost hurdle. There are factors that can change this investment picture. The factors that can change the investment picture that are beyond management s control include changes to the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium. The factors that can change the picture that is within management s sphere of influence include the value of dividends paid per share and the rate of growth of the dividends. Of the two, a modest increase in the dividend growth rate would be a welcome development.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Valero: Despite Massive Strength, I'm Considering Selling (Rating Downgrade)","It's time to discuss an investment that has been with me since I started my current dividend growth portfolio in 2020. I bought  during the depths of the pandemic whenWhile I was unable to buy it at the bottom  I was down more than 20  at some point , the stock has turned into one of my best investments, returning almost 200 , excluding dividends.I'm bringing this up because the company has gone from an underperformer with many issues and a high risk of dividend cuts to a company that is firing on all cylinders.Not only is it benefiting from ongoing strength in gasoline demand, favorable margins, and past tailwinds that have resulted in a tsunami of cash, but also newThe bull case has gotten so good that I'm considering taking some money off the table - especially in light of potential economic issues down the road.In this article, I will share my thoughts and discuss the company's risk reward so investors know what's going on in my mind.Let's start with the bigger picture.The chart below shows the relationship between the VLO stock price   below its all-time high  and the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite leading indicator for economic growth.While the correlation is far from perfect, we see that economic downtrends almost always result in steep losses for VLO investors. Almost always.Right now, VLO shares are up 16  year-to-date, less than 4  below their all-time high.Meanwhile, the ISM Index has been below 50  the neutral line between growth and contraction  for ten consecutive months.Despite economic headwinds, refining companies enjoy strong tailwinds that are mainly supply-related.Earlier this month,  highlighted some of the biggest issues driving favorable refining margins.According to the article, oil executives are seeing a critical issue of inadequate crude-processing capacity due to a lack of investment, coupled with more frequent shutdowns, as refiners prioritize higher margins and defer planned maintenance.This pattern emerged during the APPEC by S P Global Insights conference held in Singapore. The consequence of this situation is the heightened vulnerability of fuel prices, particularly diesel and gasoline, to abrupt fluctuations whenever unexpected outages occur.For example, unplanned plant shutdowns have been occurring almost weekly in Europe.According to Bloomberg, Frederic Lasserre, global head of research   analysis at Gunvor Group Ltd., makes the case that many refiners have delayed routine maintenance, making them susceptible to unexpected technical glitches resulting in surprise outages.Especially after the pandemic, too much supply was offline, which forced refineries to produce at elevated utilization rates.Not only is this an issue in Europe, but stockpiles are tight in general.In the United States, inventories for finished products are dropping faster than expected.To make things worse, Russia is increasingly using its energy leverage.On September 21,  reported that Russia is temporarily banning exports of diesel in order to support domestic supplies. This hurts Europe and global supply in general. After all, if one region sees a lower supply, it needs to import from other regions.Having said all of this, instead of easing prices due to new post-pandemic supply, the situation remains tight, pressured by outages, persistent demand, and new geopolitical issues.Refinery companies are winning big time.Over the past three years, America's two pure-play refinery stocks, Marathon Petroleum  and Valero Energy, are up 439  and 234 , respectively. I excluded Phillips 66  due to its massive footprint in chemicals.With this in mind, what do we make of VLO at these pricesIn the second quarter, the company massively benefited from the aforementioned tailwinds.Its refineries had a throughput capacity utilization of 94 , capitalizing on tight product supply and strong product demand in the U.S.The company also started its Port Arthur coker, which has the capability of adding up to 100 thousand barrels of crude oil capacity to the company's daily capacity.Valero also expanded its renewable products.Looking forward, Valero anticipates that low global light product inventories and tight supply-and-demand balances will continue to support refining fundamentals.Global demand for transportation fuels has rebounded substantially, with gasoline and diesel demand on par with pre-pandemic levels and steady growth in jet fuel demand.This outlook reinforces the company's dedication to its core strategy of operational excellence, capital discipline, and delivering on its commitment to shareholder returns.When it comes to its commitment to shareholder returns, the company is seeing tailwinds that were unimaginable a few years ago.For example, in 2012, the company spent more than 100  of depreciation and amortization on sustaining capital expenditures. In 2022, that number was 55 , indicating much more efficient operations.Furthermore, the company's total CapEx requirements are below the longer-term average, thanks to lower growth CapEx, as major projects have progressed nicely over the past few years, generating additional earnings.Hence, after spending 2020 and 2021 protecting the , the company is now back on track, repurchasing stock and raising its dividend.Last year alone, the company distributed  6.1 billion to shareholders, which was a blowout record and still less than 50  of its net income.In the second quarter, the company made clear that it has a strategy of balancing dividends with share repurchases to ensure an optimal allocation of capital to provide returns to shareholders.As the overview above shows, Valero's share repurchase program is a fundamental element of its capital allocation strategy.The significant allocation of funds, amounting to  951 million in the second quarter for the repurchase of shares, shows the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and belief in the intrinsic value of its shares  buying back shares when the valuation looks attractive .The repurchase of roughly 8.4 million shares in the quarter alone reflects the proactive steps Valero is taking to manage its outstanding shares and potentially enhance shareholder value.Having said that, the current dividend yield is 2.8 , which is nothing to write home about, at least not in the energy sector, where drillers often pay much higher yields.On January 31, the company hiked by 4.1 , which shows that it is still mainly focused on buybacks instead of hiking its quarterly dividend commitment.Nonetheless, going forward, I expect dividend growth to pick up.The company has a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, which is one of the best numbers in its sector. It is expected to lower net debt to less than  3 billion next year, and free cash flow expectations indicate a  12  free cash flow yield next year.In other words, if the company were to spend every penny of free cash flow on distributions, it could distribute 12.3  of its market cap to shareholders.I'm not saying that will happen, but it shows how much cash this company is generating.Note that free cash flow is expected to fall in the years ahead. This is not an indication that Valero is doing something wrong. It shows that analysts are expecting a normalization in refining margins, as no analyst is willing to incorporate prolonged geopolitical issues and other supply forces in their estimates. I can get behind that.However, it means that any tailwinds could lead to higher expectations for the quarters and years ahead.This part is so tricky. Not only because nobody knows how long refinery margins will remain tight but also because the global economy isn't doing so well right now. We could easily run into a scenario where demand destruction offsets tight supply.Having said that, the company is trading at less than 4x 2023E EBITDA. That number rises to 6.6x 2025E EBITDA due to the aforementioned decline in expected margins.If we apply an 8x multiple, we get a price target of  177. The current consensus price target is  145, a dollar below the current price.My opinion is that the company will generate higher-than-expected earnings  including EBITDA and free cash flow  over the next few years. I do not expect supply to rebound as quickly as expected, and I'm also not a supporter of the thesis that quick EV adoption will significantly hurt demand.If anything, emerging demand in markets like Asia and Africa will likely provide strong export demand growth for decades to come.Having said that, I'm considering selling a bit of VLO.This is not a call to get people to sell VLO. This is just my view on the mid-term risk reward.I believe that VLO has a very bright future, and if I decide to sell, I will be on the hunt to buy back at lower prices. That could be triggered by a further decline in economic growth, causing potential demand destruction to offset supply tailwinds.Valero Energy has transformed from a struggling investment to a major success.The refining industry, despite economic headwinds, is thriving due to supply-related factors. Recent geopolitical shifts, like Russia's temporary diesel export ban, emphasize this.Valero's strategic growth and financial discipline bode well for investors. The company's prudent capital allocation strategy, boasting a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, signifies a commitment to shareholder returns.Nonetheless, given the current risk reward and other investment opportunities, I'm considering selling a bit of Valero Energy Corporation to potentially buy it back at lower prices if I get the chance.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

"Wall Street Bulls And Bears, A Macro Review","Investors often get caught up in the day-to-day, week-to-week market action and often let the MACRO  long-term  view get confused with what happened yesterday, orThe MACRO view captures more of the fundamental backdrop and as we know the market can and often does diverge from what that might be telling us. In the near term, sentiment can overreach boundaries to both the upside and downside. Over time it is the MACRO scene that eventually wins out and that is why it's important to always have that view embedded in anAs regular readers of my missives are aware, since early 2022, I saw the emergence of the BEAR market that eventually took the S P to a 19  loss by year-end '22. Since Q3 '22 there were numerous calls for a very bumpy ride for both the economy and the market, as investors navigated the Fed's rate hiking cycle and high inflation backdrop. In essence, I was not among those that were calling for a soft landing. Instead, my view was that a recession was inevitable in '23.Despite the 'soft' economic data being reported and many indicators pointing to recession, I was fortunate to spot the change in the market price action in May and saw confirmation of a BEAR to BULL reversal in June, and now more confirmation in July. Price as it always does was the deciding factor that outweighed the poor fundamental backdrop that still exists today.The bottom line  By using  market action  by following the MACRO long-term technical view we were able to spot the BEAR market in February '22 and now the reversal to a BULL market in June of '23Analysts and economists can point to a myriad of reasons why the market has not followed the MACRO fundamentals, but I will highlight the TWO that had the most impact.Now let's switch back to the  MACRO view. First, we'll speak to the  - then to the  The reality is that we are still navigating several confusing cross-currents in the economy.With two negative GDP prints in the first half of 2022, many  including myself  believed the recession was here and in my view, the Stock market dropping into a BAER trend confirmed that. Since then we've watched GDP climb 2.6  in Q4 '22, 2.0  in Q1 '23, and 2.4  in Q2. Clearly, the economy is more robust than most believed it would be. Economists - including those at the Fed - are quickly abandoning their recession forecasts and concluding that the Fed may have successfully pulled off a soft landing. But while GDP growth in recent quarters appears solid, the economy is not nearly as robust as the headline data suggest.2Q23 GDP growth  2.4  quarter-over-quarter, annualized  is not as robust as the headline number indicates. Personal Consumption Expenditure  PCE  contribution to GDP growth slowed from 2.79  in Q1 to just 1.12  in Q2. Recall that PCE is not only about 70  of GDP, but it is also the most stable component of GDP.Other data points are also worth mentioning. We've already discussed the fact that while GDP  Gross domestic product  is increasing, GDI  Gross Domestic Income  is declining.GDI counts what all participants make from the sale of what is produced  i.e. wages, profits, taxes .Consider the following. In Q4 '22 GDP  2.6 . GDI  by 3.3 . In Q1 '23 GDP  2.0 . GDI  by 1.8 . One measure says the economy is expanding at a reasonably robust pace. The other says that the economy was in a recession earlier this year.If we look for other clues about how good or bad this economy is going the picture remains foggy. We've seen the Leading Economic Indicators fall for 15 straight months.However, the Conference Board also publishes the index of coincident indicators which consists of four economic indicators each of which rises or falls roughly coincident with the overall pace of economic activity. One such indicator is payroll employment, which has been climbing rapidly and is contributing positively to the overall index. Another coincident indicator is industrial production, which has declined slightly in recent months and countered some of the strength contributed by employment. As a result, this measure of current economic activity has been essentially unchanged for the past six months, which seems roughly consistent with the average of the GDP and GDP data. and why this post-stimulus fundamental scene has been a nightmare to figure out. The no-recession camp has consistently  to their credit  said the steady gains in employment confirm that the economy is not in or headed for a recession. Equally important, the surprisingly large declines in GDI suggest that the economy is not nearly as robust as the GDP data indicate. Thus, the Fed's decision to let the data guide them about what to do next seems warranted.The irony is IF the economy is as strong as the GDP data suggest, inflation is going to be very stubborn and remain above 2 -3 . Steady growth at those levels will soon begin to push inflation higher and force the Fed to raise rates further to cool things down. Investors are euphoric by the recent slowdown in inflation, but the euphoria may be short-lived. Increasing Energy prices may also be another factor that supports stubborn inflation.The Blue Chip Consensus increased its Q3 GDP estimate from -0.6  to 0.4  but reduced its estimate for Q4 from 0.1  to -0.1 . For Q1 '24 the consensus is 0.4 , Q2 at 0.9 , Q3 at 1.6 , and Q4 at 1.9 . At the very least these forecasts align with what I have believed for a while. However, it's not aligned with what the stock market is saying, and that suggests this situation could change once again. That leaves investors with a scene where economic growth is in such flux that anything can happen, and that If you aren't thoroughly confused by this investing scene allow me to toss this tidbit in as well. Before I do, let me remind you again that despite the near-term fundamental mess, The SAVVY Investor strategy will follow the Just like everyone has a nose, everyone has an opinion on what happens next with this economy. Let's try to stay with an OPEN mind while looking at the FACTS. No matter what your opinion is I believe we have to recognize what we are facing. At is a STRETCH to believe is going to have  on the economy down the road. That's just not feasible, nor is it a HIGH probability of occurring.The downgrade of the U.S. credit rating started a renewed conversation on a serious issue.The U.S. is now paying a record 663 billion in debt in '23. That interest is expected to grow exponentially to a point where 1 trillion a year in interest payments will be the norm.Stay tuned.After the S P 500's three-week winning streak came to an end, investors entered the scene on Monday in a risk-on-buying mood. Buying was concentrated in the Industrials  Financials Turnaround Tuesday arrived with a massive risk-off vibe across global markets that bled over to the U.S. scene. The US Dollar moved higher, Treasuries lower, and crude oil traded down as the U.S. markets opened.The gloom was driven by concerns over Chinese growth  poor trade data , and Moody's downgrade of US banks. If that wasn't enough, Italy went into  attack  mode when Poor sessions on Wednesday and Thursday had the BEARS celebrating their dominance as they sent all of the indices down for the second straight day. Friday turned into a mixed session that left the S P with a loss for the week, making it back-to-back weekly losses. It was the same for the NASDAQ Composite , while the DJIA rallied and posted a modest gain for the week. was largely as expected and the generally benign report rallied bonds and stocks as the report saw Fed funds futures further pare risks for a rate hike next month. Implied rates now suggest less than 10  chance for a September tightening, down from about 12 . And the probability of a November boost has fallen to about 26  from about 33 .However, Powell's July  super core  measure edged up to 0.2  from unchanged, and rose to 4.1  y y from 4.0  y y, and that should give investors pause. rose 0.3  in July on both the headline and core,  These follow June's unchanged headline. For the headline, There will be another inflation report before the next Fed meeting. In my view, the door for another increase remains wide open. dipped to 71.2 in the August preliminary report after climbing to 71.6 in July from 64.4 in June. Sentiment has improved from the record low 50.0 print from June 2022 and is near the best since October 2021. But it is still well off of the cycle high of 88.3 from April 2021. The weakness was in the  component which fell to 67.3 from 68.3 previously.When the cart comes before the horse there is rarely any forward movement. That's what we have seen in the transition to EVs. The cart is here but the horse in the form of charging stations and overall  convenience  hasn't been delivered. According to automotive research firm Cox Automotive,  that's a 342  increase from a year ago when only about 21,000 did so. At the current pace of sales, it would take 92 days for dealerships to sell all their electric vehicles.What's worse many models are now selling below MSRP  Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price  adding to the losses that are already I'm not sure we have ever experienced anything like this. Rush to produce a product that will lose billions as it's manufactured. I'll simply ask, how is that not a negative for the economyWhen we open this can of worms, we discover a lot more than what is being told. .In the entry-priced segment,  at around  9.78 per 100 miles. Entry-priced EVs charged mostly at home cost  12.55, while those charged at commercial stations reach  15.97., costing approximately  11.08 per 100 miles. This is lower than the cost for primarily home EV charging  12.62  and for mostly commercial EV charging  16.10 .It's not until we get to the  luxury  segment  the EVs most can't afford and be employed  do we finally see a shift in favor of electric vehicles and there are still  issues . High-end EV drivers charged mostly at home paid around  13.50 per 100 miles, compared to  17.56 for a comparable ICE car. Luxury EV drivers Eventually, EVs  become more economical than gas-powered cars but then there are the inevitable problems with the power grid that is still powered by fossil fuels. I emphasized the word  may  because  Does anyone believe rates  as demand rises  So I'll ask another question, what is the advantage of this RUSH to electric  And reiterate the initial concern. How is this entire transition not going to impact the economy negativelyI'll stand by what I have stated since the initial phases to go electric were initiated. This will be the biggest boondoggle ever imposed on any economy in the history of civilization if these mandates aren't scrapped quickly. The negative economic impact could be enormous. - Common sense may be entering the scene. Ford reported second-quarter earnings that revealed widening losses in its electric vehicles unit. That coincidentally prompted CEO Jim Farley to say  You're going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us .It's a first step that follows the lead of Toyota. They saw the handwriting on the wall, keeping their hybrid line intact, and were roundly criticized when they announced that strategy. In my view, they had it right from the beginning.Perhaps the laws of supply and DEMAND will be allowed to play out instead of MANDATING a change that clearly is NOT ready for prime time.The aforementioned announcement of a 40  windfall profits on their Banks is another example of a ball and chain being placed on capitalism. The government wants to use the proceeds from the  tax  to help those struggling with the cost of living. We've seen how the  have backfired here in the U.S.Their strong financial system was part of the reason for helping prop up Italy's economy as GDP growth came in above forecasts recently. Punishing a business that is running successfully, producing profits, and adding to GDP growth is a recipe for general economic disaster. While Italy calls itself a capitalist country, with this announcement socialism has entered the scene. That keeps the MACRO analysis questioning the prospects for global growth, and keeping the forecast at lows.The pullback from the July 28th closing high picked up momentum this week. It wasn't until the S P hit a key support level did we see buyers come in.During these  reversion  trades it becomes a question of whether the S P can bounce from here or break lower opening the door for further weakness. It's not uncommon for an index to retreat back to the breakout level, and for the S P that would target the 4200 range. But that came to an end recently as the S P 500 recently ended its streak of overbought daily closes at 45 trading days dating back to the Friday before Memorial Day. That was the longest streak since September 2020 and the 23rd time that it closed at overbought levels for 40 or more trading days.We've noted this multiple times but it's worth repeating  while the market is due for a pullback, these types of streaks occur in BULL markets, and by definition, Bull markets are periods of above-average returns.Bespoke Investment GroupWhile the S P 500 pulled back from overbought levels this week, it remains well above its intermediate-term support levels and the uptrends off the October lows remain firmly intact. This creates a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the market hasn't shown any signs of technical deterioration, but on the other, there's still downside potential before solid support levels are even tested.The breakout levels for the S P 500, DJIA, and the NASDAQ 100 have been easily identified. After long uninterrupted rallies, it's not uncommon for breakout levels to be tested. These levels The big news recently was a sudden increase in long-term Treasury yields as the 10-year yield increased from 3.97 , up to 4.20 on August 3rd, before settling at 4.15  on Friday. That leaves the 10-year uncomfortably close to the October 2022 closing highs of 4.24 . For the moment resistance has held and what happens next in rates could determine where the stock market trades in the next few weeks.I can't tell you where the market will be at the end of next week or the end of August, and a little gut check to keep the bulls honest is always on the table, but the picture between now and year-end still looks positive. There are different patterns on display for different indices and sectors, but they all have ONE thing in common the intermediate and long-term trends are UP.That should remain in the back of our minds as we now go thru what is the first real challenge to this 2023 rally.Given the choppy action in the market this week the small-cap Index  trades sideways after another failed attempt at a key resistance level. Since the November '21 high it has been a series of LOWER highs for the small caps. History tells us the Russell 2000 small caps are a good predictor for the US economy. This price action adds to the argument that the US economy is not on a solid growth trajectory, and there could be trouble ahead.Six weeks into the third quarter and the Q3 game plan is working to perfection. Laggards are now winners, and the Leaders have pulled back. A subtle shift to Value from Growth is underway. I suspect this could start to balance the scales and leave some investors wondering why they may have worn out their welcome in the HOT momentum tech trades.The Energy ETF  continues to show strength as it cleared the March April highs. With a decisive close  89  above those levels  87  the stage is set for a run at all-time highs  94 . In addition, all of the energy sub-sectors have rallied nicely. They are overbought in the short term, but the underlying trends suggest dips should be bought.The Oil service sector  pulled for a day back after making a new high, then followed up with another new high later in the week. It is due for a pullback, but if I am correct about the long-term prospects of this area of the market, it could only be getting started. After a slow start, the sub-sector is up 14  for the year.Many individual stocks in this group are extended, however, they are BUYS on dips.The group was a big part of the Q3 strategy forecast and it's working out nicely. WTI has strung together a seven-week winning streak on its trip to a close above  83 on Friday. The rally has taken out both the 50-Day moving average and 200-DMA after prices consolidated almost the entire year. While the move higher in prices has been dramatic, it has come with tighter physical markets.Refined product prices are starting to firm as well  wholesale gasoline futures trade at the highest levels since October, while diesel futures are trading at the highest levels since January. That's thanks to both the move higher in crude oil prices and higher refining margins per barrel. Gasoline premiums over crude are around  45 while diesel margins are around  90, a level unheard of before the invasion of Ukraine. That bodes well for the  refiners . Valero  and Marathon Petroleum  are the go-to names in that groupI've highlighted the reasons why crude supply can stay constrained and with the Saudis in control of pricing, they will do what is best for  and that keeps prices elevated. On the negative side, while we aren't there yet, Energy costs may once again become a problem for the US economy. High energy prices will keep inflation elevated. If it does, Energy stocks will once again become a  in the general market. I see no reason to lower exposure to the group.After two months of sideways action in a trading range, the Nat Gas ETF  broke to the upside. In typical fashion, this volatile commodity gave most of that gain right back on the following day. I continue to HOLD my position for the long termThe Financials  were humming along holding onto support until Moody's downgrade of the banking system came along. It wasn't able to hold on to near-term support and looks destined to test the July breakout levels.The weak action now has the long-term tend back in question, this group might be another  tell  on where the general market goes next.Commodity prices more broadly have also started to trend higher off the early summer lows. As shown below, the Refinitiv CRB Commodity Index has quietly rallied nearly 10The GOLD ETF breaks down once again and is back at the lower end of the trading range. Instead of challenging the old highs, GLD will be testing support.SILVER  also completely broke down this week. I've been aggressively trading the ETF taking quick gains when available while maintaining the CORE position. This weakness has me pondering adding another  LONG  trade.URANIUM  has been the bright spot recently. It rallied nicely in July and is tantalizing close to an upside breakout. My last  trade  was at a support level and I'm still hopeful the ETF can break past minor resistance and add more gains to a profitable trade. I do like the  look  of this chart pattern.The group  remains locked in a trading range between  120- 140. The sector was more stable than the rest of the market recently as the ETF is now closer to the upper band of that trading range closing at  136 on Friday.The Bitotechs  are on a roller coaster ride that has this group testing support. Higher interest rates continue to be an overhang on a group of stocks that is capital intensive.A pullback was in order and the NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 both broke initial support levels before stabilizing at secondary support. Since the July 19th interim high on the NASDAQ, we've seen a series of LOWER highs. While the entire Tech sector seems stable now, I wouldn't rule out more weaknesses ahead. The  trade  is now towards  value  and I can see that continue for a while longer. More tech stocks have broken first support and that is the first sign that more choppy sideways action is ahead.Coming into the earnings season, Semiconductors were set up for  perfection . While the reports have generally been OK, it was time for this rally to slow, and that is what has occurred. The intermediate trend is UP, but the short-term scene looks  toppy .The all-time high is about 11  away and the breakout that started this rally is  12  lower. It remains a question as to what will come first. A deeper pullback for this group would not be surprising.A stop, pause, a moment of digestion, whatever we wish to call it, this price weakness was overdue. The S P approached the  neutral  zone quickly and while there is plenty of room for further  price  normalization , I note the internals show signs of quickly approaching oversold territory, which tells me that there is more weakness underneath the surface over the last two weeks than the simple price charts are showing.Forget about the negative headlines that came across during the week, they had little to do with the price action. What we are witnessing is a good old-fashioned mean reversion in sentiment after an impressive run in stocks this year.It's safe to say we have entered a  and that means stocks that have rallied the most will at best be trading sideways for a while.

BGR: Economic Laws Make The Case For This Energy CEF,"A few days ago, we discussed the BlackRock Resources   Commodities Strategy Trust , which is a closed-end fund that invests in a combination of energy stocks, mining stocks, and other stocks that are poised to benefit from risingWe last discussed this fund in our service back in September. The fund s share price is down slightly since that time, as its share price declined from  13.14 to  12.95 per share. However, the distribution received offsets about half of that decline. The fund s performance over a longer period of time has been much more promising. We last  this fund on the public site on May 22, 2023. Since that time, the fund has significantly beaten the S P 500 Index This is partly due to the change in market conditions since that time. During the first half of this year, the headline inflation rate was falling rapidly and many market participants  and politicians  were inclined to call the Federal Reserve s fight against inflation a  victory.  As such, there was a great deal of optimism that interest rates would eventually be reduced, and we would get back to the bubble market environment in no time. However, as I , that improvement in inflation was almost entirely caused by the Federal Government flooding the economy with crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now that the Reserve is in tank-bottom condition, that is no longer an option. In the absence of this extra oil, the balance between supply and demand for crude oil is extremely tight and energy prices have been trending up since July. That reversed the optimism about the progress that has been made against inflation, causing the S P 500 Index to start declining as it now looks likely that high rates will be with us for a very long time. As energy prices have been slowly trending upward, this fund has outperformed the broader market index.As we will discuss in this article, the fundamentals for energy prices continue to remain strong, which should benefit this fund over the next few years. As such, it may be a good idea to obtain some energy sector exposure in your portfolio, and this fund offers an easy way to do it.According to the fund s , the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return. This objective makes a great deal of sense considering that the fund invests primarily in common equities. As we can see here, fully 98.53  of the fund s total assets are invested in common stocks. Its only other asset is a rather small cash positionThis is in line with the website s description of the fund s objectives and strategyAs I have explained in numerous previous articles, total return makes sense as a primary objective for any fund that invests primarily in equity securities. After all, common stocks are by their very nature total return vehicles. This is why investors purchase them with the intention of receiving an income from the dividends that they pay out as well as benefiting from the capital gains that should accompany the growth and prosperity of the issuing company. This differs from a fixed-income fund, which will generally have limited capital gains potential and deliver most of its total return in the form of direct payments to the investors.The energy industry as a whole is well known for paying out much higher yields than other sectors. After all, as of the time of writing, the Alerian MLP Index  yields 6.91 , which is actually one of the lowest yields that this index has had in many years. The iShares U.S. Energy ETF  currently yields 2.91  and the iShares Global Energy ETF  yields 4.39  as of the time of writing. Admittedly, all of these yields are less than we have seen for quite some time, but they are still better than most other sectors. For example, the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF  only yields 1.21  and the iShares U.S. Technology ETF  yields 0.37  at the current price. Thus, dividend income is likely to make up a greater proportion of the total returns for an energy fund like this one than it would for a fund that invests in a different sector.There is a very big reason for this. The energy sector in general came under a lot of fire from investors for the subpar returns that it delivered over the decade prior to the coronavirus pandemic. From January 1, 2010, until January 1, 2020, the iShares U.S. Energy ETF underperformed the S P 500 Index by a lotThis is despite the massive increase in production that U.S. shale producers delivered over the period. We can see that the big problem is that the energy sector in general never recovered from the crash in 2015 when Saudi Arabia was attempting to destroy the shale industry. This is partly due to the fact that energy prices never really recovered from that incident. This chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil over that periodInvestors were naturally upset by this poor performance compared to everything else, so the energy industry came up with a solution. Basically, many companies decided to simply pay out the majority of their free cash flows to the investors as share buybacks and dividends. They generally eschewed investing in production growth, even when energy prices skyrocketed in 2021 and 2022. This did result in some of these companies having dividend yields in excess of 10  though, so investors in these companies did fine over the years since the pandemic, even as every other sector was crashing in 2022.Unfortunately, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust s largest positions are not in those companies that sported abnormally high dividend yields during 2022 s energy price boom. Here are the largest positions in the fundHere are the dividend yields for each of these companiesAdmittedly, none of these companies have the jaw-dropping yields that we occasionally see in U.S. shale plays or midstream companies, but TotalEnergies and BP are not really too bad in terms of yield. All of them boast significantly higher yields than we see in many other sectors, however. For example, all of these companies except for Cheniere Energy have a higher yield than the S P 500 Index. By themselves though, none of these companies has a high enough yield to justify investing in the fund in the absence of capital gains. After all, if the yield was all we got, we would be better off just sitting in a 5 -yielding money market fund.Fortunately, all of these companies are positioned to see their net incomes and cash flow surge over the coming years. One of the big reasons for this can be found in the discussion that we just had about the poor performance of the energy sector since the oil price crash in 2014.As a result of that price crash, energy companies around the world tightened their belts considerably. Long-time readers may recall that I published a few articles around that time specifically pointing out that cuts to exploration and development activities would hinder growth prospects across the industry. That proved to be correct, and unfortunately, prices never recovered enough for investment to return to its previous levels. As a result, we now have a situation where the industry has underinvested in production capacity for almost a decade. However, the global demand for crude oil has not declined. The pandemic did result in a temporary blip, but total global oil consumption has been steadily increasingThis is expected to increase going forward, with most independent energy analytics firms projecting that total consumption will be somewhere between 105 to 110 million barrels per day in 2030. Due to the underinvestment in energy production over the past several years, it is unlikely that global crude oil production will actually be at that level. One of the characteristics of oil fields is that their production output declines over time. Thus, without sufficient new capacity coming online, production will go down. That is the scenario that is currently being projected to occur. Analysts at JPMorgan Commodities recently predicted that the world will have a 1.1 million barrel shortage of crude oil by 2025 and a 7.1 million barrel shortage by 2030I do not have to explain what that will do to energy prices, as the basic economic law of supply and demand makes that case for me. As we have seen over the past few months, the stocks held by this fund tend to appreciate when energy prices rise, as does the fund itself.Thus, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust appears to be very well-positioned to deliver both a very attractive yield and share price gains to its investors going forward.As mentioned earlier, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return. However, as is the case with most closed-end funds, the fund s basic business model is to maintain a relatively stable level of net assets and pay out most to all of its investment returns to investors. When we consider the total returns that are available both through capital gains and dividends, we can probably expect that this fund would have a reasonably high distribution yield.That is indeed the case, as the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust pays a monthly distribution of  0.0657 per share  .7884 per share annually , which gives it a 6.09  yield at the current price. This is not nearly as high as the yield that we can obtain from a fixed-income fund or similar, but the current yield is a direct result of the share price appreciation that the fund has benefited from over the past few months pushing down its yield. Unfortunately, the fund has not been particularly consistent with respect to the distribution that it pays outAs we can clearly see, the fund s distribution has varied quite a bit over the years. This seems likely to reduce the fund s appeal in the eyes of those investors who are seeking a safe and secure source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. This is not really the best use of this fund though, as our overall thesis here is that the fund works as a play on rising energy prices. As we can see above, the distribution cuts have generally occurred during periods in which energy prices were declining. The fund has been steadily increasing its payout over the past two years as energy prices have gone up and companies in the sector have started to give higher returns. For example, we can see here that it raised its distribution earlier this yearIt seems logical that the fund will continue to increase its distribution as our thesis plays out and higher energy prices allow the companies held in the fund s portfolio to enjoy higher valuations.As is always the case, we want to investigate how well the fund is covering its distribution. After all, we do not want the fund to be overdistributing and drawing down its asset base unnecessarily. This will not work very well in the long term, for obvious reasons.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund s most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on June 30, 2023. This is nice as it covers the first half of this year. As mentioned earlier in the article, this is a period in which the Federal Government was artificially suppressing the price of crude oil by draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As such, the price of crude oil during this period was lower than we saw over much of 2022, which naturally had an adverse impact on the performance of the companies that are held by the fund. The fund s ability to handle this situation and deliver solid returns will speak well of its overall quality of management, and of course, the better management s ability to generate returns during that environment, the better it should perform during a period of rising energy prices as we are likely to see going forward.During the six-month period, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust received  8,126,851 in dividends from the assets in its portfolio. The fund had to pay foreign withholding taxes on some of this, which reduced its total investment income to  7,731,316 over the period. The fund paid its expenses out of this amount, which left it with  5,682,231 available for shareholders. This was, unfortunately, not nearly enough to cover the  10,606,571 that the fund actually paid out in distributions over the period. That is likely to be concerning at first glance, as the fund clearly failed to fully cover its distribution out of net investment income.However, the fund has other methods through which it can obtain money to use to cover the distribution. For example, it might have had some capital gains that could be paid out. In addition, this fund occasionally writes options in an attempt to generate premium income that acts like a synthetic dividend for the stocks that it owns. Neither one of these things is included in the net investment income, but they obviously represent money coming into the fund. Fortunately, the fund did enjoy some success here as it reported net realized gains of  18,132,696 but these were offset by  28,865,010 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund s net assets declined by  18,450,086 during the period after accounting for all inflows and outflows.Despite the fact that net assets went down during the period, the fund s distribution does appear to be quite reasonably covered. One reason for this is that the fund s distribution was less than its net investment income plus net realized gains. The only reason for the decline in net assets was the net unrealized losses, but these can very easily be reversed the second the market becomes stronger. When we consider that the energy sector in general did start trending up around mid-July, it is quite possible that some of these losses are not losses anymore.Secondly, the fund s net assets are still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. Over the full-year 2022 period, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust saw its net assets increase by  84,989,114 after accounting for all inflows and outflows that it experienced over the period. Thus, the decline in net assets that the fund saw during the most recent period only partially offset that. Overall, the fund s finances seem to be in good shape, and we should not have to worry about too much here.As of October 12, 2023  the most recent date for which data is currently available , the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has a net asset value of  14.65 per share but the fund s shares only trade for  12.95 each. This gives the fund s shares a whopping 11.60  discount on net asset value at the current price. This is a very attractive discount that is relatively in line with the 11.72  discount that the shares have averaged over the past month. As I have pointed out numerous times before, anytime that a closed-end fund obtains a double-digit discount, it generally represents a good entry point unless the fund s finances are distressed. That is clearly not the case here, so the current price is more than acceptable to buy the fund s shares.In conclusion, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust is a very solid closed-end fund that is well-positioned to profit from any increase in crude oil prices. That is quite likely to happen considering that it looks highly likely that the world will suffer from a shortage of this necessary commodity over the next several years. As such, the fund may make a lot of sense right now as a way to obtain a 6.09  yield that is likely to increase going forward. The fund is having no trouble covering its distribution and it is currently trading at an incredibly attractive valuation, so there is no reason not to pick up some shares here.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

ZIM Integrated: Getting Risky But Holding The Stock Is Still Justified,"You've got to love ZIM Integrated Shipping . The company entered the U.S. stock exchange two years ago, at a timing that many companies would envy. After the COVID-19 pandemic, container shipping rates had reached enormous levels, leading the share price toToday, however, is a completely different story. As you should already have noticed by now, container shipping rates have plummeted, as a result of lagging demand relative to the increasing supply of tonnage. It is in this context that I m writing today s article about ZIM.On August 16th, ZIM  their earnings for the second quarter of 2023, showing an EBIT loss of  147 million. The company reported a total net loss figure of  213 million, resulting to a negative EPS figure of  1.79. For the same period inIn addition, container volume remained rather stagnant for the second quarter of 2023, while for the first six months of the year the company realized a slight decrease in carried container volume. At the same time, freight rates moved significantly lower, reaching  1193 per TEU, a drop of 67  compared to the same period in 2022.For the full year 2023, the company anticipates an EBIT loss of  100 to  500 million and adjusted EBITDA of  1.2 to  1.6 million. For perspective, for Q1 2023, EBIT loss was  14 million, which added to the  147 million of Q2 2023, brings us to the upper half of the EBIT loss guidance. However, clearly the outlier figure is the  14 million EBIT loss recorded in Q1 2023, as the next quarters will likely be much worse, despite the fact that, traditionally, they are the strongest ones. So, this brings us rather to the lower end of the EBIT loss guidance spectrum  closer to  500 million .During the company's Q2 2023 , I was very glad to hear that from a total of 148 vessels, the company operates 16 car carriers. The reason is that this particular segment offers some very appealing economics, due to the shortage of carriers and the abundance of shipping demand. Already, some car carrier operating companies are planning to  their fees charged to their customers, due to the high charter prices of these vessels, reaching  110k per day  for 6.5k CEU vessels .Regarding the traditional container shipping business, due to the freight rate collapse, the company is moving into larger and more modern vessels, in an attempt to exploit economies of scale and cut down on operating costs. In ZIM, they are expecting to get their hands on 38 newbuilt vessels in the next 18 months, while 47 of their current vessels will reach their charter contract expiration, during the same period. So in 1.5 years' time, the company will be operating a much more modern and cost efficient fleet, also containing LNG powered vessels.However, container supply and demand fundamentals are ruthless at this point. On a global basis, container tonnage is expected to grow during the next year as well, while GDP growth prospects aren't exactly stellar.As we can see in the table listed below, the global economy is going for a slowdown, to say the least, while expected container volume growth is anticipated to be negative. This situation is going to continue to put pressure on ZIM, as with the exception of new vessels, their average charter time remaining is 24.6 months.If it wasn't for their strong cash position, I believe ZIM would be in serious trouble right now. However, the company ended the second quarter of 2023 with total cash  of  3.2 billion. The problem is that during this quarter, the company burnt just above  1 billion. At the , ZIM had  4.25 billion in total cash and cash equivalents etc. The cash burn between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 was  353 million. As you read before, tonnage supply will outgrow shipping demand at least until the first half of 2024. So, one can realize that if the next few quarters are going to be just as bad, ZIM could potentially face a liquidity problem.It is no coincidence that their net leverage ratio increased five-fold, from 0.1x to 0.5x in just one quarter. Moreover, if this metric is calculated on a TTM basis, as newer and lower EBITDA figures are inserted into the calculation, we can expect a significant rise in net leverage ratio. For example, assuming that the company's net debt remains steady at  1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 lands at  1.4 billion  guidance middle point , we get a net leverage ratio of 1.1x. But net debt will not remain the same in my view. I believe it will rise, as the company burns cash. So the net leverage ratio is expected to be even higher.I don't know if you have realized it already, but if you haven't, I'll put it plain and simple  ZIM is not going to pay a dividend in the third quarter of 2023. Neither will it pay one in the fourth quarter of 2024 in my view. I sincerely doubt that they will pay a dividend during the first half of 2024 either. However, at this low price point I wouldn't sell my shares. Instead I would generate income by writing covered calls against these shares, while at the same time keeping an eye on the next few quarters. I have every reason to believe that the market has discounted the worst case scenario for the company, so that's why I consider ZIM as a  Hold .  This article was written for information purposes only. You should not, in any case, take the contents of this article to be an urge to buy, hold or sell securities. Always perform your own research before investing in the stock market.

Jackson Hole - The Future Of Inflation And Interest Rates,"Jerome Powell  about the past, present and future path of inflation and interest rates. Here are some highlights and general conclusions from his remarksThese were very honest and measured remarks. I thought they were well-balanced and as objective as they could be. I especially like the emphasis on the causes of inflation and the ways in which Monetary Policy is working, even if it s not working as quickly as they d like.I also especially liked the risk management approach here. We d like to think of the Fed as an omnipotent entity with perfect foresight, but the reality is that they re guessing just like the rest of us. And while that might be an uncomfortable view, it is the reality of navigating the economy and markets.We all have to make educated guesses about what s going to happen, and an important part of good risk management is understanding what go wrong, even if you don t things to go wrong.the broad conclusion from all of this is that interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer. This is a tough situation for the Fed. Inflation has come down meaningfully, but remains too high.This creates what I ve described as a bimodal distributional outcome here and it s part of what makes the Fed s job so difficult. In simple terms, the longer the Fed remains tight, the longer they grind credit markets. And that creates more and more default risk across time as firms and households have to roll old debts into new higher interest rate debt.This creates a highly asymmetric risk in credit markets where economic slowdown, defaults and deflation could eventually put significant downward pressure on markets and the economy.At the same time, the Fed needs to stay tight in order to ensure that inflation is under control. But if they stay tight for too long, they could exacerbate that credit market risk. Which will happen  It s cloudy, to be sure.This is both good and bad for markets as a whole. As I ve emphasized more recently, all of this is great for short-term investors who just want to clip a real return in T-Bills at 5.5 . But it creates a good deal of uncertainty across anything that is longer duration.Long duration corporate credit and equity are especially at risk here. Although our base case remains modest economic expansion that bimodal distribution creates a smaller, but asymmetric risk where longer duration instruments continue to generate meager risk-adjusted returns consistent with the performance of the last two years  the S P 500 is up 1  over 24 months with a standard deviation of 20   not great .An outlier credit event isn t our base view, but the current rate position makes that a meaningfully higher risk than it otherwise would be. And that warrants caution, not because we expect it to happen, but because we have to hedge that risk in case the Fed is wrong.This remains an incredibly confusing period in economic history, and describing it as  cloudy  might be an understatement. The solution to this, in our view, is to optimize certainty by establishing clear time horizons across portfolios.As our Defined Duration strategy emphasizes, investors should have a specific understanding of time within their portfolio so that these matters do not unduly influence behavior.Have a great weekend.

Jackson Hole: The Fed Faces The Ghosts Of The 1970s As Stock Market Rollercoaster Continues,"Next week, the Federal Reserve hosts its annual . Each year, roughly 120 central bankers, media members, academics, and business leaders attend to share research and escape the summer heat. Unlike its Since then, stocks have been on a rollercoaster, with the S P 500  fluctuating in a range above itsStocks have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year, though volatility slowed significantly as summer arrived. The 15  selloff in the S P 500 was soon followed by a rally in hopes of a Fed pivot. The rally soon fizzled when Powell didn't give the market what they were looking for and investors began to sell popular stocks in December for tax loss harvesting. Markets rallied again on pivot hopes, only to be pushed back down after the next Fed meeting in February. Stocks fell sharply during the short-lived spring bank crisis, while the subsequent post-bank-crisis rally seems mostly driven by sentiment and fear of missing out. Some profit-taking followed, and here we are, roughly at the same price as a year ago after 12 months of tug-of-war. However, Jackson Hole may break the stalemate.In Powell's speech last year, he alluded several times to the policy mistakes of the 1970s. Then, the Fed's lack of commitment to fighting inflation contributed in large part to allowing core inflation to rise from roughly . Inflation came in three waves then, and the Fed would raise rates to halfheartedly fight inflation, only to cut them too soon and allow inflation to roar back.Most people reading this know the story of how Arab nations imposed a  on the United States, Canada, and the UK in 1973. More than a few of you reading this likely lived through the gas shortages, 55 mph speed limits, and sky-high inflation. In 1973, oil prices skyrocketed and stock markets crashed. The S P 500 fell 48  from peak to trough. fared much worse, falling over 73  from peak to trough.Less widely known is how a series of policy mistakes that traded short-term gain for long-term gain set the stage for this. This is one reason that political pundits tend to think , while  it may be harder.Compare this with todaySo far, the Fed has steadily raised interest rates until they've reached a positive real yield. Sound  this is what is needed to bring down inflation. Now, they'll have to raise them a bit more and keep them above the rate of inflation in order to avoid a disastrous repeat of the 1970s.  from the last meeting showed that members feared upside risks to inflation, which is why most members support hiking interest rates a bit more, even with some progress on inflation. The market is skeptical,  that the Fed is done hiking and will soon begin to cut. However, the Fed said they're going to hike , so there are plenty of people  including me  who will take them at their word.The key to understanding the Summary of Economic Projections is to read between the lines. By comparing the rate of core inflation the Fed projects and the interest rate it projects, we gain an understanding of how the Fed is likely to respond to rising or falling inflation. Essentially, they're looking for a about 2  real yield on cash. That means if core inflation is 3.5 , then they're going to hike one more time and hold rates at a level of 2  above inflation. This is in sharp contrast to many traders who think that if inflation goes to 3  that the Fed will aggressively start to cut when job growth slows or reverses. That's not what the Fed is saying at all, and the difference might be enough to get traders to seriously reevaluate their bets. Under this framework, rates stay above 5  until inflation is under 3 .Why wouldn't the Fed cut rates much when inflation slows down to 3  or so  Quite simply, that's how they got burned in the 1970s, so they're going to take their time. Modeling  supports this view.I calibrated the model to run using core inflation  ignoring rising oil prices  and added an interest rate smoothing feature to account for rents starting to fall. Still, almost all of the models here are calling for more rate hikes, with most favoring an interest rate above 6 . The Fed's dot-plot represents a compromise between the more hawkish members and dovish members worried about the banking system, but a cash rate of 5.75  followed by a long hold seems like the most likely outcome here. The market isn't quite pricing this, so traders may be caught by surprise that the Fed isn't looking to bail them out. Their surprise may be compounded if stocks fall sharply in the coming months and the Fed hikes again rather than pivoting to cuts.It's crucially important that the Fed doesn't allow another 1970s-style inflation surge. It's equally important for the Fed to not cave to political pressure to print money to let Congress off the hook for out-of-control spending. There is no alternative. By the end of the 1970s, Americans' trust in the government was shattered, living standards had stagnated, and the top political priority for voters was ending inflation. People were fed up. That's why they let Fed chair Paul Volcker drop the hammer on the economy and raise rates to 20 . By taking a hard line now, the Fed can ensure we don't have to end up in that position again after multiple consecutive waves of inflation, as was the case in the 1970s.This entire article really boils down to one question. The Fed is offering a 5.5  risk-free return in cash and short-term bonds. Should you take it, and if so, for how much of your asset allocation  I'm inclined to believe the Fed here. For the past year I've said yes take the risk-free return and for a decent percentage of your portfolio. The downside is asymmetric at current stock market valuations. We'll find out more about the Fed's intentions at Jackson Hole next week.What do you think  Will the Federal Reserve repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, or have they learned their lesson  Where are you investing your money now  Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Vonovia: Updating My Short Thesis Following Q2 Results,"I'm reiterating my Strong Sell rating on Vonovia SE after reviewing the 2nd quarter results.On March 28th, 2023, I issued a  against Vonovia SE   arguing that theAfter the Q1 report, I published an  in which I elaborated on several aspects that clearly send a signal of further pain to come.Let me know quickly recap the main drivers of my bear thesisNow, I have to admit that my  sell thesis  has been a complete disaster because of the strong total return performance by Vonovia -  40  since the date of my first article  shares of VNNVF bottomed out at  17 when I published near the end of March 2023 . However, looking at the Q2 figures, I have to also admit that my conviction about Vonovia's permanent value impairment has strengthened.Essentially, it is the usual problem with shorting companies that whenever the valuations are depressed pricing in a justified decline in value, each positive announcement no matter how impactful it is can send the stock price materially higher.For example, during Q2 Vonovia announced a buyback of its outstanding bonds at a 11  discount to the nominal value. Vonovia bought back    1.0 billion. While this sounds good, if we contextualize this with the total debt burden, it explains just over 2  of the total debt. And the fact that Vonovia was able to buy back bonds at 11  discount was not a surprise at all since we could see how the public market were discounting the outstanding bonds before Q2. We could also interpret this as a confirmation that the cost of financing for Vonovia has gone up and is materially above the currently carried weighted average cost of financing.So, let me now turn to the Q2, 2023 data and walk you through my thinking on why the bear case has just become more straightforward.Given that my thesis is structural without any catalysts besides the  ECB factor , which could either destroy the Company completely or make it one of the best investments in the German market, for me it is critical to assess data in the rate of change terms. In other words, I predict a  gradual bleed  process, where quarter by quarter Vonovia marches closer to a massive equity dilution event  i.e., cost of financing over dwarfing the yield component and inflicting knock-on effects on the covenant side .This is why I will focus on the quarter-to-quarter data comparing Q1, 2023 to Q2, 2023, which is the opposite approach to how Vonovia reflects its rate of change in the Q2 financial statements  they compare H1, 2023 to H2, 2022 . If I was to look at the Q2, 2022 data and contrast it with Q2, 2023, the conclusions would be rather boring - negative performance across the board.As a result of all of this, the EPRA NTA declined from EUR 53.7 per share in Q1, 2023 to EUR 49.7 per share in Q2, 2023  or 8  of a decline .Vonovia's share price reaction upon the issuance of Q2 figures was negative 2 .The key message that I would like to extract from the Q2 figures is the structural difficulty of Vonovia to ride out of the overleveraged situation when interest rates are so high. The technical term that we can see happening now is the  debt overhang situation  when the leverage has become so high that sooner or later there will be a default due to insufficient cash generation in the context of the embedded covenants  unless there is an equity dilution event .As of YTD, Vonovia has made three sizeable divestitures  i.e., Sudewo portfolio, five notable properties in Berlin with a total of 1350 apartments, and exit from French JV  monetizing their assets and   or participation in JVs, it has introduced scrip dividends, which relaxes the pressure from dividend distributions and replaces that with share issuances, and it has used most of the received proceeds to retire some part of the outstanding bonds at a discount to the nominal. Plus, performance-wise Vonovia has done a solid job by capitalizing on the favourable supply and demand dynamics in the German residential space.With all of this in mind, we can still see deteriorating performance on the underlying cash flow level and the corresponding coverage front.And dear readers, the worst thing is that Vonovia has not yet felt tangible pressure from the higher interest rates. As of H1, 2023, the weighted average cost of debt stood at 1.6 , which is just 0.1  higher than in Q1, 2023.Looking at Vonovia's publicly traded bonds, we can see YTM levels of around 5 - 5.5 . Loan  or bank  financing terms are a bit more favourable hovering around 4 - 4.5 .If we tripled or aligned Vonovia's cost of financing level to what the Company can actually get in the market, there would be a direct breach of ICR covenant  i.e., ICR falling below 1.8x .To breach the LTV covenant it would take a 25  downward correction in asset fair values. In my opinion, this is unlikely  although the market is pricing in a more aggressive drop  due to the lack of supply of residential units in Germany.Q2, 2023 results reveal in how difficult situation Vonovia is, where aggressive deleveraging efforts in conjunction with strong like-for-like performance is not sufficient to offset the consequences from astronomical leverage.Even after bond repurchases, monetization of JVs and   or several residential unit blocks, and improved rents, the results have worsened.The most shocking thing is that this has taken place despite the average cost of financing level of Vonovia going up by only 1 basis point. In reality, considering the prevailing market terms, there are some   300 basis points to go.Granted, this will not happen overnight as Vonovia has already paid off notable portion of 2023 maturities and will likely make huge efforts to do the same thing for 2024 maturities. The current debt maturity profile is rather well-staggered. Plus, Vonovia has entered several swap agreements fixing rates on favourable terms for the next two years on some portion of the outstanding debt that was still variable before Q2, 2023.However, if the 'higher for longer' scenario really takes place, Vonovia will sooner or later face significant consequences via the breach of covenants or just considerably squeezed margins. And here the key area of concern is the ICR coverage ratio. If we assume that Vonovia will eventually land its cost of financing rate close to the current market level, the ICR would clearly fall under the stipulated  minimal  level of 1.8x.In my humble opinion, the short thesis boils down to the path that ECB will be taking over the next couple of years. If we have status quo or higher rates, it will eventually erode the current headroom in the ICR coverage or significantly squeeze the free cash flows. If rates go down, Vonovia should survive without major share issuances, and bulls would enjoy decent gains from recovery in the multiple.The other key risk, which has to be considered for bears is that this will be a slow process as the current debt maturity profile of Vonovia protects the cash flows from rapid convergence to the market level cost of financing. This coupled with relatively depressed multiple can cause serious damage for the short sellers whenever there is something positive announced  no matter how material .Finally, it is great to see that some external analysts have started to believe in the short thesis as well. A month  Vonovia to  sell  from  hold , arguing that the Company is subject to  a protracted hangover  after  a seemingly endless party of growth fuelled by ever cheaper finance . Almost the exact wording that I used in my very first short article on Vonovia four months ago.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

PPLT: Dead Money With Lots Of Potential,"I last wrote about platinum and the abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF  on  was in early December 2022. Nearby NYMEX platinum futures were at the  1,053 level, with the PPLT ETF trading at  96.24Platinum is a rare precious and industrial metal that continues to frustrate, disappoint, and infuriate investors who buy the commodity with visions of capital appreciation. With silver over  24, gold at the  1,950 level, and palladium over  1,200 per ounce, platinum below  1,000 appears to be a bargain. Sometimes, prices are low for a reason. Platinum has been a compelling investment for years, but the performance has been nothing short of awful.The dog of the precious metals sector continues to have fleas in September 2023, but even the mangiest financial commodities eventually break their bearish pattern. PPLT at below  100 and platinum under  1,000 per ounce are inexpensive, but there are no guarantees that capital appreciation is on the immediate horizon.In February 2021, nearby NYMEX platinum futures reached  1,290.60 per ounce after reaching a bottom below  600 in March 2020 as the global pandemic gripped markets across all asset classes. After doubling in less than a year, platinum could not sustain further gains.The chart highlights the bearish pattern of lower highs in the platinum futures market since the February 2021 peak.In 2021, nearby platinum futures traded in a  893.60 to  1,290.60 range. In 2022, the price extended lower, with a  804 low and a  1,154 high. Over the first eight months of 2023, platinum has traded inside the 2022 trading band, with a  884 low and a  1,129.80 high. At  968.70 per ounce on September 1, platinum was below the 2023 range s midpoint, struggling to sustain any rallies above the  1,000 level.In 2022, total platinum mine production was 190 metric tons or just over 6.1 million ounces. At  1,000 per ounce, the value was around the  6.1 billion level. The NYMEX platinum futures market had a total number of open long and short positions of 70,041 contracts on August 31. As each contract contains 50 ounces, the open interest was just over 3.5 million ounces, worth  3.5 billion at the  1,000 per ounce level.Meanwhile, in 2022, the total gold mine production was 3,100 metric tons or nearly 100 million ounces, making platinum output sixteen times rarer. At  1,960 per ounce, the value was thirty-two times higher at  196 billion. Open interest in the COMEX gold futures market was at 442,643 contracts on August 31, each containing 100 ounces. Open interest of 44.26 million ounces translates to a  86.75 billion value, nearly twenty-five times higher than platinum.Platinum is a rarer metal than gold. The platinum market s value and transactional activity make the metal far less liquid than gold. For many years, platinum s nickname was  because it was more expensive than gold. However, platinum has not commanded a premium to gold since late 2014.The monthly chart of nearby NYMEX platinum futures minus nearby COMEX gold futures shows the bearish pattern of platinum versus gold prices since the early 2008 high when the spread eclipsed a  1,180 per ounce premium for platinum. The spread fell below flat in 2011-2013 and began steadily declining in 2014, reaching an over  1,000 discount to gold in 2020. At close to the  1,000 discount for platinum on September 1, the rare metal remains near the lowest level against gold since the precious metals futures began trading in the 1970s.The platinum market has moved into a deficit where the demand exceeds annual supplies.forecasts the 2023 shortfall at 128,000 ounces, the first deficit since 2020 and a significant change from the 2022 740,000-ounce surplus.Meanwhile,, a trade association funded by the platinum mining community, projects a 983,000 ounce 2023 deficit, the most significant since 2014 after last year s 854,000 ounce surplus. Rising investment demand, robust industrial demand driven by glass expansions in China, and strong automotive demand as catalytic converters increasingly use platinum, substituting for more expensive palladium, have caused the deficit. Meanwhile, falling South African mine output because of ongoing electricity shortages and the uncertainty of Russian supplies are weighing on the supply side of platinum s fundamental equation.While the supply and demand picture look bullish, rising interest rates, economic weakness in China, and overall uncertainty about the economic landscape have not created the environment for any significant rally in the platinum market.Economic conditions have not created a bullish environment for platinum prices, but the geopolitical landscape remains an underlying bullish factor that could cause significant supply shortages and higher prices.The chart illustrates over 84  of the world s 190 metric tons of mine supplies in 2022 came from South Africa and Russia. 74  came from the leading producer, South Africa, with Russia producing 10 . The twenty metric tons of Russian production is a byproduct of nickel output in Siberia s Norilsk region. Given the overall fundamental market tightness, the 643,000 ounces from Russia could become a significant factor.Moreover, the ongoing war in Ukraine has caused a bifurcation of the world s nuclear and economic powers. Sanctions on Russia have led to a move towards de-dollarization and the potential for a BRICS currency with gold backing. The BRICS bloc includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and their allies. The BRICS bloc dominates worldwide platinum production. In 2022, China was the world s leading platinum consumer at 75.1 metric tons, or almost 40  of global mine supplies. Europe was second, consuming 48.6 metric tons, or 25.6  of global production. Meanwhile, the United States consumed 42 tons of platinum in 2022, or 22  of supplies, meaning the U.S. and Europe depend on BRICS output as they consume nearly half the mined platinum annually. The geopolitical landscape threatens those supplies.While the fundamental case remains compelling, platinum investors have struggled. Platinum s price action fifteen years ago caused many investors to take the metal off their radar. Platinum reached a record  2,308.80 high in March 2008. Seven months later, the price plunged 67  to a  761.80 low during the global financial crisis. While gold prices also fell during the period, the precious yellow metal dropped 32.9  from  1,014.60 in March 2008 to a  681 low in October 2008. Gold outperformed platinum during the price carnage as it is a much more liquid market that is not susceptible to price gaps. Investors have shunned platinum over the past decade and a half while embracing gold as an investment asset.Moreover, gold has a far longer history as a financial instrument, and central banks validated gold s role in the global financial system as they hold gold as a reserve asset, classifying the precious metal as a foreign exchange asset. While Russia may maintain some platinum inventories in reserves, few other countries have strategic stockpiles for financial reasons. Platinum may be precious, but it is primarily an industrial metal.Given the strength in gold, silver, and palladium futures markets over the past years, platinum s price weakness remains an enigma. The profitable approach has been to purchase platinum on price weakness and take profits when the metal looks like it will break out to the upside. Platinum has invariably failed on break-out attempts, but its illiquid nature could one day lead to an upside gap as selling evaporates.The most direct route for a platinum investment is the coins and bars sold by reputable physical precious metals dealers. The NYMEX futures provide an alternative as they have a physical delivery mechanism. The Aberdeen Physical Platinum ETF product  is a liquid alternative to holding platinum metal for venturing into the leveraged and margined futures arena. At  88.68 per share on September 1, PPLT had around  966 million in assets under management. PPLT trades an average of 73,035 shares daily and charges a 0.60  management fee. PPLT owns physical platinum bullion.The chart highlights PPLT s disappointing price action since its 2010 listing.Platinum remains the weak link in the precious metals sector, but every dog eventually has its day. The supply-demand deficit, BRICS production domination, and rising demand are compelling reasons to own platinum. Investing in platinum requires patience and perseverance, as it has been dead money for years.Andrew Hecht is a 35-year Wall Street veteran covering commodities and precious metals.

"Energy In, Tech Out","As you know, the tech sector is largely responsible for driving the market higher this year on a strong bounce-back in the sector's financial performance after being pummeled by the 2022 bearYet over the past few weeks there has been a rotation out of tech and into the energy sector. Indeed, over thePrior to the last three years, the energy sector was arguably the worst sector in the entire market for over a decade. Yet despite the energy sector's strong performance over the past three years - and being the direct beneficiary of Russia's conflict with Ukraine that arguably broke the global energy  and food  supply chains - the XLE is still a relatively unloved sector. I say that because today the XLE ETF makes up only 4.5  of the S P500 - roughly half of its weight in 2010 .As a result, and despite the excellent run in energy stocks over the past three years, the sector is arguably still a value  According to , the XLE ETF currently has a TTM P E of only 8.3x and yields 3.67 , both of which are very attractive as compared to the broad S P500  and a yield of .There's currently a very dynamic and relatively complex push-pull going on between the tech and energy sectors. This week, and over the past month, the momentum traders behind the energy trade have been winning. Today I will discuss the factors behind this dynamic push-pull and what investors can expect going forward.A globally traded commodity market like oil and gas is impacted by a variety of factors that can have a complex relationship with each other and on prices. My followers know, I have long considered the price of oil to be the dominant factor with respect to inflation - and we know that the rate of inflation can directly impact interest rates. We also know that U.S. interest rates can impact the value of the U.S. dollar which in turn impacts the foreign currency translation  FX  on the revenue of technology companies that generate a significant portion of sales overseas. That being the case, let's take a closer look at how these considerations impact the push-pull dynamic between oil  i.e. energy stocks  and the tech sector. I'll start with oil because it's the main determinant of inflation in my opinion, and which, as I will later explain, directly impacts the valuation of technology stocks.Despite the false narrative that the world is somehow facing a shortage of oil supply, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, as I explained in a previous Seeking Alpha article, we live in an . The U.S. shale fracking revolution has resulted in 10s of billions of bbls of  oil and gas reserves that can be easily and very profitably drilled  with a near 100  success rate  and brought to market within a couple of months over existing pipeline infrastructure. In addition, we have elephant discoveries like offshore Guyana while the oil sands of Canada have abundant bitumen reserves  a whopping  worth .As I pointed out in my recent  on the Fidelity Energy ETF , Exxon  grew its Permian and Guyana production in Q2 by a whopping . Exxon is well on its way to achieving its ultimate goal in Guyana  Deploying six FPSOs, or Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessels, by the end of 2027 in order to bring Guyana's production capacity to more than .In Q2, Chevron  grew its Permian production to  or  11  year-over-year. As the slide below from its  shows, Chevron has an inventory of more than 6,600 drilling locations in the Midland and Delaware Basins and plans to grow production to well over 1 million boe d by 2030 and then will hold it at that level for at least a decadeConocoPhillips , the No. 3 largest US O G producer, has one of the largest Permian leaseholds and had Q2 Permian production of . - that's up from  in Q2 of last year  12 .Meantime, on the natural gas front, last year the U.S. quickly ramped up natural gas production to replace cut-off Russian supply to the EU. As a result, last year the U.S. became the world's  Which, as I have pointed out, proved that shale actually still is a  short-cycle  resource - just as energy company CEO's had been marketing it to be for over a decade  that is, at least until President Biden asked them to raise production on account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and  120 bbl oil . Currently, United States domestic natural gas production is at an all-time high and so is total United States petroleum production.The point here is that despite the popular narrative that the U.S. is somehow not energy independent or that somehow President Biden would  kill the energy companies,  nothing could be further from the truth.That said, obviously shale reserves must be actually be  in order to ultimately impact supply and price. But after the  lost decade  of pitiful returns in the energy sector, when the idiotic  drill baby drill  mantra caused over-production into an already over-supplied market, the shale producers have discovered discipline and are spending  10s of billions on emphasizing stock buybacks instead of drilling - and in many cases, even over giving shareholders a fair shake on the dividend  i.e. like with Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips . The fact is, as high as U.S. oil production is today, it could be considerably higher with relatively modest increases in the cap-ex budgets of the major players.Meantime, as the chart below from  shows, Canada has nearly doubled oil production over the past 20 yearsMeantime, Saudi Arabia recently announced it would continue its previously reported  through September. Reuters quoted an unnamed source as saying Saudi's cut may be  extended, or extended and deepened.  Shortly after that announcement, Russia jumped on board by saying it would cut oil exports by  bpd in September. As a result, and combined with previous OPEC  cuts, those countries are keeping multiple millions of bpd off the global market.So,  - so that isn't the problem. In my opinion, the problem is we are still burning too much of it and, as a result, quite literally burning up the planet as well.But of course as long as oil demand is strong and can soak up the current  restrained  production, prices will be strong too. From that standpoint, U.S. consumers responded to significantly lower gasoline prices this summer to demand more gasoline as compared to last yearIn this week's , we found out thatSpeaking of the SPR, it currently has 348 million bbls, up from 347 million last week but down significantly from 470 million bbls one year ago  see . Net-net, according to  total U.S. crude oil inventory according is down significantly over the past three yearsMeantime, the EIA reported last week that global oil demand is set to expand by an estimated 2.2 million bpd to , with China - the world's No. 1 oil importer - accounting for more than 70  of that growth. And just yesterday, the U.S. and China agreed to  between the two countries  from 12 to 24 . That will result in additional jet-fuel demand in a global travel market that is already quite robust.The bottom line when it comes to global oil supply and demand  Restrained supply by U.S. shale producers and OPEC , a significant drawdown in the U.S. SPR last year to mitigate the worst impacts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and combined with a general global recovery in oil demand has led to a tightening global oil market and a higher oil price. As a result, and predictably, oil company stock prices have risen inline along with the higher price of oilLast year, the price of Brent crude skyrocketed to over  120 bbl after Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion, and its huge and negative impact on the energy and food supply chains, resulted in boosting inflation - which was already high and rising from the pandemic - even higher. In response to seemingly runaway inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to begin increasing the Fed Funds rate  see chart below . That resulted in a strengthening U.S. dollar and a wicked bear market sell-off in the tech sector due to the combination of a strong FX headwind that would reduce bottom line profits for big global tech companies, and due to expectations of lower demand due to the potential of an imminent recessionary macro environment.I know the chart below is somewhat busy, but it shows the interplay between these variables quite nicelyStarting from the left, you can see that Brent  in purple  was leading inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index  CPI  in orange - higher. Tech stocks were still doing well because the thought process at the time was that inflation was transitory because pandemic-induced supply change disruptions were finally beginning to resolve themselves after vaccines were made available. However, starting at the beginning of 2022, you can see that Brent crude  and CPI  began to rise as tension rose over Ukraine. The tech sector - represented by the XLK ETF in green - began a sell-off that only accelerated when the invasion actually took place in February and which caused Brent Crude to temporarily jump to over  130 bbl.President Biden, after being rebuffed by U.S. shale producers and supposed ally Saudi Arabia, responded by releasing significant volumes of oil from the SPR. In parallel, the EU's natural gas supply chain was totally and surprisingly quickly reconfigured away from Russian supplies, and the price of Brent began to fall. And CPI eventually followed it lower. That led investors to think the worst of inflation was over and to the big tech rally over the first six months of this year. However, on the far right of the chart above, you can see the turn higher that oil began on July 1. You also can see the beginning of a drop in tech stock shortly afterward.Last week's  came in at 0.2 , as expected. But while energy prices are down 12.5  yoy, they're rising and no doubt investors are watching it very closely. Shelter was 90  of the inflation number, and is still a serious problem. On a yoy basis, July CPI rose 3.2 . That compared with an expected 3.3  yoy rate. While that is progress, it's still above the Fed's target rate of inflation  i.e. 2 . Still, the U.S. Dollar Index  shown below  rose for the week. I consider the DXY index to be an anticipatory indicator as it typically moves in advance of expected developments. Regardless of whether that theory is right or wrong, clearly the strengthening of the index last year was a primary factor in creating an FX headwind for global tech stocks that was a primary catalyst for the bear market.For example  Note that in   the quarter ending Dec. 31  Microsoft  reported diluted GAAP EPS that was -11  yoy, but  2  in terms of constant currency. In other words, FX was a 13  headwind to MSFT's bottom line earnings primarily because the value of the U.S. dollar peaked at the end of the year  see chart above . Due to the U.S. Dollar's fall since then, MSFT's  diluted EPS faced only a 6  headwind. That being the case, if the price of crude oil rises, and the rate of inflation rises along with it  which it no doubt will , the market will start pricing in additional increases in the Fed Funds rate. That will likely cause the U.S. Dollar Index to strengthen again. That will lead, once again, to a stiffening FX headwind for the tech sector and a subsequent revaluation of their discounted future cash flows going forward.We're already seeing expectations of this scenario playing out. Broadcom  - one of my favorite technology holdings - recently broke through its 50-day moving average after an AI-fueled rally. Once through the 50-day, AVGO hit quite an air pocket on the way downI find the interplay between the global energy markets and the U.S. tech sector to be both complex and fascinating. Currently and clearly, crude oil supply demand fundamentals and various geopolitical and macroeconomic considerations favor the energy sector over the tech sector - at least in the near term. Momentum traders have obliged with an  Energy In, Tech Out  strategy.That said, my followers know that I advise them to build a well-diversified portfolio and hold it through the market's up-n-down cycles. They also know I feel it's critical to have exposure to both the energy and technology sectors, albeit for different reasons  Energy for income and a hedge against inflation, tech for excellent growth and long-term wealth accumulation.With that in mind, a title of  Energy In, Tech Out  may have been more appropriate for this article. I say that because long-term investors would make a big mistake to go overboard energy and to exit tech. Consider thisThe fact is, and despite the newly found discipline of U.S. shale companies, higher crude prices are typically met with increased supply. That said, I do expect the second half of this year to be very strong for the energy sector. But stick with the oil producers and refiners  like Phillips 66 , which is just killing it on high diesel crack spreads - see the previously referenced article on the FENY ETF for details - and not the natural gas producers. I say that because there's an abundance of natural gas, and despite growing U.S. LNG export capacity, pure-play natural gas producers are faced with growing associated nat gas volumes from Permian shale producers that are targeting oil. In addition, older shale wells simply get gassier over time - and the U.S. has thousands of older shale wells. See .Meantime, higher gasoline prices will likely motivate consumers to only accelerate the transition to EVs - of which  already are booming  which, I would note, is a boon to the semiconductor sector .On the tech side, the recent sell-off could continue for a while longer and result in giving investors who have heretofore missed much of the tech rally a second chance to get into some of the higher-quality companies. I say that becauseI've been reporting on some of these trends on Seeking Alpha. For instance, in the article , I reported that Google continues to be a FCF machine and generated  21.8 billion in FCF in Q2 and a FCF yield of 29.2  of total revenue  up a whopping 11 percentage points yoy . GOOG ended Q2 with  118 billion in cash and has a forward P E of 23.3x. False predictions that ChatGPT was somehow going to kill Google Search pushed GOOG stock down into the low  90's back in February  I added to my position . Any significant pullback in GOOG  say under  110  in the current  correction  would be a gift for investors who have yet to establish a position in the stock.The previously mentioned article on Google also cleared up the false narrative that somehow migration to the cloud is no longer a primary catalyst for the hyperscalers. That is simply not the case - AI being one big reason why. Meantime, note that widely followed tech analyst Dan Ives agrees with me that any pullback in tech stocks will likely be  So, get ready to pounce. Indeed, Broadcom already is very attractive in my opinion  It has a forward P E of only 19.7x and - after being one of the best dividend growth stocks over the past decade  if not  best  - pays out an  18.40 annual dividend good enough for a 2.2  yield. Meantime, CEO Hock Tan noted the impact of the  during the Bottom line  Let your energy stocks run. If you want to take some profits in order to reduce your exposure at the top of a cycle, you will likely get a great chance over the next few months. For tech stocks, it's just the opposite  Prepare to pick up shares at bargain prices. I'm not as upbeat on Apple  as I'm on equities like Google, Broadcom, the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF , and the Fidelity MSCI IT ETF  - all of which I expect will grow faster than Apple over the next year or two.Lastly, and to put thing into a broader perspective, I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart comparing the Energy XLE and its two biggest components  Exxon and Chevron , with the tech XLK and a few leading tech stocks and fundsAs you can clearly see, long-term investors that bought and held tech through all the market's ups-n-downs over the past decade have been very well rewarded and done much  much  better than O G related equities. Odds are that will be the case for the coming decade as well.  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up  in the 2020s decade,  setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion  a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation .After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy  in 2018 . It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream  exploration, drilling, extraction , midstream  transportation, storage, refining , and downstream  retail sales and distribution  handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company  a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco , Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the  350-400 billion range, but declined to the  200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only  178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over  275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly  400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers   32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  15-20 billion range from 2015-2019  with a notable drop to  8 billion in 2016 , a disastrous decline to a loss of  22 billion in 2020, a return to form of  22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to  55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story   45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to  14 billion in 2020, and a rise to  48 billion and  67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P E ratio of  8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P E is 12x,  15  above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P B  price to book  and P Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25  and over 50  above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P S  price to sales  is slightly discounted at  10  below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument  the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oilTo start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources  see Lazard data referenced later , i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables  i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.  is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy  at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used , renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost  the one-time payment for the devices themselves  to generate power  the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF , Reeves Utility Income Trust , DNP Select Income Fund , Vanguard Utilities Index ETF . Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle  or virtuous cycle  stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply  meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity Energy  or  LCOE , essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced  for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,   opens in Excel .This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about   aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry . As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. ,  t he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,  and  renewables are set to account for over 90  of global electricity expansion  in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99  of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change  humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union  EU  legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA , are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause  fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is  designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing   emphasis added . In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries  this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists  however, an  of the law by  t he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks   emphasis added . While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear  ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31  increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities  i.e., choose renewables , and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common  They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism  not to be confused with partisan liberalism . By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC OPEC , which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness  this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation , The Phillips 66 Company , Sempra , ONEOK, Inc. , OGE Energy Corp. , Brooge Energy Ltd , WEC Energy Group, Inc. , White Energy Company Ltd , Magellan Midstream Partners , Sunoco LP , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. , Enbridge Inc. , TC Energy Corporation , TotalEnergies SE , , Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Corporation , Valero Energy Corporation , NuStar Energy LP , Ovintiv Inc. , Cenovus Energy Inc. , ConocoPhillips Company , Eni S.p.A. , , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Ring Energy Inc. , VAALCO Energy, Inc.  Occidental Petroleum Corporation , Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.  aka Petrobras  , Pampa Energía S.A. , , Callon Petroleum Company , Imperial Petroleum Inc. , NiSource, Inc. , Devon Energy Corporation , Energy Transfer LP , Ecopetrol S.A. , Vistra Corp. , The Williams Companies, Inc. , Canadian Natural Resources Limited , Koninklijke Vopak N.V. , , InPlay Oil Corp. , Inpex Corporation , , Shell plc , , Dominion Energy, Inc. , Duke Energy Corporation , Baker Hughes Company , Enterprise Products Partners L.P. , APA Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , Warrior Met Coal, Inc. , PBF Energy Inc. , and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. , , Ørsted A S , , Iberdrola S.A. , , ReNew Energy Global plc , Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. , Ocean Power Technologies , Tesla Inc. , Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. , Brookfield Renewable , , Freyr Battery , Array Technologies, Inc. , Nano One Materials Corp. , Novonix Ltd , , LiCycle Holdings Corp , Maxeon Solar Technologies , First Solar Inc. , Azure Power Global Ltd , Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A.  aka Eletrobrás  , Acciona, S.A. , Nextracker Inc. , AmmPower Corp. , Enphase Energy, Inc. , Fluence Energy, Inc. , and Vestas Wind Systems A S , , among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the  winners  in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time  they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets  e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline petrol station infrastructure, etc.  into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams  upstream, midstream, and downstream  in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach  carbon neutrality  or  net zero carbon emissions  by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example  a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing   expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours  of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5  in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99  dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. ,   to cut natural gas production by 40  and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its   page 14  is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by  advanc ing  other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies,   emphasis added .At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings  this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that  t hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately  17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions   and  help in  reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling     emphasis added . Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that  a ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with   emphasis added . This is in addition to the  sustained investment  in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels  notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis . Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited  appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves  their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share  in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB  solar, wind, and battery storage  System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figureUltimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Toll Brothers: Slowdown Delayed Not Escaped,"Toll Brothers  strong performance this year was still under the buoyancy provided by the previous backlog while multiple factors from the perspective of its own logistics and the macro picture suggestedWe previously initiated coverage of Toll Brothers in January this year with a hold rating when it was  55.46, expecting its price to be within a range of  45 to  62. The thesis was built on the expected slowdown from its backlog and the macro environment pressure, in addition to the normalization of the housing market. The company reported strong numbers so far this year, but our previous thesis still holds, and we will explain why.Since our article was published in January this year, Toll Brothers' annual growth rates for revenue, free cash flow, and gross profits have been trending flat to lower. Although they are coming back down from historic highs, the growth is nonetheless moderating.Toll Brothers' backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to the home buyers. Just as we predicted in the previous article, the falling backlog has shown. Not only has the absolute value of the backlog dropped from  8.87 to now  7.87 billion, but the backlog-to-revenue ratio has come down from 86.32  in October last year to 73.64  in July this year. In fact, this ratio is the lowest since 2020. According to its 10k of 2022, the company expects to deliver approximately 90  of these homes within the next fiscal year. So we can assume that backlog tends to have a lagging effect on its revenue by about four quarters. The current strong performance of its revenue is still under the influence of its backlog from July to October last year. The pull on the revenue going forward that was expected from the current backlog will become lower.Toll Brothers has continued to push into the urban apartment market to explore more potential growth engines. The company formed  Toll Brothers City Living  unit to leverage its luxury brand in urban areas. Its pipeline includes most of the major cities on the east coast, south and west, except mid-west cities. It had spent in Q3  263.5 million in purchasing contracts to acquire land for apartment development.Since the company's  affordable luxury  market focuses on millennials or empty nesters, it is not surprising the apartment market is the logical choice due to its community formation appeal to the younger professional that in turn provides higher sales volume for the investment, and its cost-saving of using steel framing in the building process. These factors underpin the  affordability  that it is trying to achieve.However, the sales of the apartment building assets are not as good as expected, which has impacted the full-year joint venture land sales and other income to be  105 million, down from the  125 million expected at the start of the year. This guidance is still hinged on the sale of three stabilized apartment communities that are to be closed in Q4. Its ancillary business, which includes apartment and city living, has reported losses for the three and nine months ending on July 31 with higher expenses than revenue.Toll Brothers' cash conversion cycle is at around 438 days, which is mostly due to its faster inventory turnaround. But it is almost as good as it gets. There is very little room to improve compared with its best records in the past twenty years, while it could become prolonged to 700-800 days, the average of the past twenty years or so.To update the previous mortgage loan held for sale data, it has fallen from  193 million to  83 million, the majority of which are residential mortgage loans. On one hand, this poses fewer risks to its portfolio that is subject to higher interest rate risks, on the other hand, with its home sales rising by 18.5  YoY in the quarter ending in July, there were 50  fewer mortgage loans held for sale on its book. This is due to 18.2  fewer mortgage loans originating in the first nine months of this year, and also reflects the tougher environment brought by the higher interest rate risks for the residential market. Either the company intentionally tightened the lending standard for cautious reasons or there were less qualified borrowers. Either way, it leads to fewer sales down the road, which brings us to the macro picture.Toll Brothers' latest presentation has a slide that compares the housing starts with the number of households, concluding the industry is undersupplied. We think this is not an accurate depiction of the situation. The number of households will always increase monotonically, in the long term. Yet housing starts can be best utilized to satisfy the incremental demands, not the entire stock of households.Therefore, we fixed up the following chart to see if we can show a picture more closely resembling the dynamics. We charted a 12-month average of monthly household formation, which is defined as the incremental change of the number of households on a monthly basis, against the monthly private-owned housing starts, from 1959 till June of this year. What we found is the average of household formation for the past 12 months although strong, when paired up with the current level of housing starts, it is right in the middle of the cluster. It is neither too high nor too low. Especially with the latest number reported in June falling slightly in the negatives, there is no significant undersupply for the industry from a high-level perspective. With that said, it is not excluding local regions heating up from supply and demand dynamics, but overall, the frenzy we saw in the past two years will not return any time soon.On the other hand, the current free cash flow Toll Brothers produce is an outlier, compared with its historical norm. What it means is it cannot sustain at these levels without regressing back to the average.The current level of the owner's equivalent rent for a primary residence is unsustainable given the interest rate environment. With 5.33  Fed Fund's rate, the current rent level is almost double where it has been historically. For the inflation situation to fully come under control from the Fed's point of view, rent being one of the largest items in the CPI basket, it will budge soon. Even if it doesn't fall back down by half, a moderation or decline should be expected. This goes back to Toll Brothers' efforts in expanding in the city and apartment living. The margin growth in that market may not be taking off in the near term.Lastly, although this doesn't necessarily provide causation for stock valuation, it's nonetheless observed that the high stock price has led to the most expensive and slowest stock repurchase for the company since 2016. With almost half of what it spent in 2022,  240 million stock repurchase has only bought back 3.5 million shares so far this year, roughly one-third of the number of shares it bought back last year.We are sticking to our previous valuation and anticipate the slowdown we expected in January to come into play in Q4 or Q1 next year. The current price has risen above our bullish case by almost 14 .Toll Brothers has made higher sales this year against a tougher interest rate environment, which resulted in better cash flow and earnings so far. But we think this is mostly due to the influence of a previously higher backlog, which has fallen by more than 10  in the latest quarter. The effect of slowing down will start showing in Q4 latest Q1 next year and the macro pressure is pointing to a normalization that is merely being delayed not escaped. With its price rising above our bullish case, we think its stock is overvalued at the moment and recommend a sell.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tsakos Energy Navigation: Call Option On Management,"Tsakos Energy Navigation  is a speculative play on a potential multi-year upcycle for oil tankers. The company has been trading at  0.35x P NAV despite two quarters of strong earnings with more to come, and a record cash balanceThe tanker industry is poised for years of strong earnings ahead as the orderbook has fallen to the . Supply continues to be restricted by high prices and , with earliest delivery dates in late 2026 to early 2027. Should oil demand meet forecast expectations or scrapping of oldThis is my second article covering tanker companies, for good reason. I believe that the supply and demand set-up will lead to multiple years of strong earnings for all owners. I highly recommend you read  on Okeanis Eco Tankers  for a more comprehensive explanation on the supportive macro factors and the industry.TNP has been a mainstay of the tanker industry for decades   in fact, the company is celebrating its 30 anniversary as a public company in 2023.It owns and operates  with an average of 10 years. Besides crude tankers, it also owns a fleet of product tankers, shuttle tankers and LNG carriers.The company adopts a more conservative strategy than its peers, choosing to employ the majority of its vessels on time charters with profit sharing components than maximizing spot exposure.In , the company reported an extremely strong TCE of  41.8k d, up 112  on Q1 2022 s TCE of  19.7k d. This compares favorably against its cash breakeven levels of around  24k d on average, leading to net income of  167.9m or  5.69 share in the period. It also announced that it would be redeeming  88m of its Series D preferred shares, alongside a charter backlog of  1.6bn.That said, the shares tumbled upon the release of their Q1 2023 earnings   owing to some questionable things that management did  and is somewhat known for . Which brings me to my pointsIt would be foolish not to consider management quality when discussing TNP. After all, it has garnered somewhat of a negative reputation for not placing minority shareholders  interests at heart. This says a lot considering the shipping industry has left many with sour tastes in their mouths, so here s a quick recap of what led the stock to sell off in Q1 2023.The company inexplicably used its   subscription required to access link  to issue shares, diluting the stake of minority shareholders. This happened all while shares traded at less than half of NAV   a cardinal sin that shipping investors frowned upon. There was no compelling reason to do this, and it made investors question management as stewards of their capital.TNP disappointed with its dividends at the end of such a profitable quarter, choosing to pay out just  0.60 share across two payments. This comes up to a pitiful 3  yield, when tanker peers were issuing special dividends to reward their shareholders. While the company touts its strong dividend paying history as a plus, I believe investors were hoping for more considering its cash balance of  475m.It also pales in comparison when it comes to transparency. Other tanker companies have beefed up their investor relations departments, even getting on Twitter to engage with investors. The company does nothing of that sort and has not even made known the date of their Q2 2023 earnings release  it is the 10 of August and many tanker companies have already reported .This has led to TNP being one of the most undervalued shipping companies on a P NAV basis, coming in at roughly 0.35x against the average of 0.85x. I strongly believe that investors have made their case and management could announce a special dividend and buyback program in the upcoming earnings call. This would undoubtedly cause the stock to re-rate closer towards the peer group and is a strong near-term catalyst in my opinion.Given all that management has done  or not done , the silver lining is that they have many options to demonstrate they have learnt their lesson.The simplest, and most direct method is to issue a special dividend to make up for the last quarter. A quick calculation shows that TNP has more than sufficient free cash on hand to atone for the small dividend announced earlier this year.After accounting for all debt and capital commitments for the rest of 2023, I find that there is still  260m of cash available for distribution. That amounts to  8.60 share. While the company obviously won t and shouldn t pay out everything, there is significant cash on the balance sheet to do so.The company could also opt to fix its dividend policy to offer more transparency to shareholders. Its peers have mostly fixed dividends as a percentage of earnings and have been correspondingly rewarded with higher P NAV multiples. Alternatively, TNP could announce a buyback program and go through with it. There is nothing more accretive than repurchasing your own shares when they trade at such a low valuation.As a shareholder, I would also like to see TNP improve its investor communications. That might not be a strong near-term catalyst but should close the valuation gap somewhat going forward.I also believe that investors overlook the fact that TNP is a very profitable enterprise, with a sound chartering strategy against its breakeven levels. Regardless of how management has treated shareholders, they have been running a tight ship in their organization.It currently has 45  77  vessels with secured revenue contracts and 31 vessels  53  with spot exposure. The percentages do not add to 100  as some vessels are on time charters with profit sharing, hence some overlap. 6 out of its 8 vessels under construction also have long-term charters attached to them, significantly de-risking the purchase costs.Looking at their  and the charters they currently have, I find that the secured revenue components alone nearly cover the entire fleet breakeven. The 18 profit-sharing vessels and 14 vessels on spot charters merely need to generate  140k d for TNP to turn an operating profit. This should not be a problem in any market, let alone the upcycle we are headed towards.TNP owns a large fleet of vessels which have seen  over the last year, in part due to inflation as well as a strong rate environment. I believe that this should act as a floor for its share price.To estimate the current market value of its fleet, I used  as a guide and arrived at a rough estimate of  3.09bn for its vessels.According to my rough estimates, a fair price for TNP  would be around  61.41, giving it nearly 180  upside from today s share price of around  22 share.But we know that is unlikely to play out, so here are my share price estimates under different scenarios with room for error on the vessel values.While this represents a wide range of possible values, it also demonstrates how asymmetric the return profile is from here. A very pessimistic view of asset values declining 15  and a P NAV of 0.30x, assuming management does not reward shareholders, results in a -38  decline in share price.On the other hand, should management become more shareholder friendly, my base case calls for a re-rating of the stock to 0.6x NAV. I recognize that investors are unlikely to view TNP as favorably as they do other tanker companies, hence the slight discount to peer averages of 0.85x NAV. This scenario results in a 67  increase in share price to  36.85, which in my opinion still understates the true value of TNP s assets.Global oil and gas demand, sanctions, and the OPEC  cuts are all headwinds that TNP faces as a business. However, I think that the company s conservative chartering strategy should help it weather any downturns better than peers operating 100  on spot. While vessel values could still come down, it poses a smaller risk to TNP which is already trading at a depressed multiple compared to the other tanker companies.Management remains the biggest unknown here. Investors are reliant on management to become more shareholder friendly to unlock value. There is no way of predicting how they will react to investors  demands and I believe it is a risk that investors must contend with in this investment.TNP is simultaneously a play on the multi-year tanker upcycle and a call option on management. It is a profitable, cash generating enterprise with a sound chartering strategy and diversified fleet of vessels. It trades at  0.35x P NAV, significantly lower than peers, as management has not been the friendliest to shareholders in the past.That said, there are multiple ways management could surprise investors in the upcoming earnings call. I believe that TNP could pay off in an asymmetric manner as valuations have been depressed and asset values should act as a backstop, as long as you size your position appropriately.

Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands,"Now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin . There are many upcoming catalysts for BTC to reward investors over the next year. This article will not go into those much-repeated points. If interested, research the items in this non-exhaustive list of- Bitcoin s Halving in 2024   Halvings have historically been followed by a price surge.- BTC Spot ETF   Bullish because it creates more liquidity and demand- Institutional Adoption   Institutional adoption means more liquidity and demand as well. It also means more money used to fund the development of financial infrastructure for Bitcoin.- Regulatory Clarity in Crypto   Reduces the barriers due to regulatory uncertainty. Also increases the pace of innovation in crypto.- Mining to Subsidize Green Energy Solutions   This allows BTC to be recognized as an ESG-friendly asset.  Bitcoin always was ESG friendly, hence  toThis article will talk about the utility that Bitcoin development has been unlocking, and hence economic value rather than price action from supply and demand. Think of this as the fundamentals. Bitcoin s strong fundamentals should also be overlaid with a sentiment analysis, which will be covered first. As stated, the main takeaway is that right now is probably a great time to accumulate BTC.Critics accuse BTC of being a bubble, comparing it to the dot-com bubble or to tulips. Tulips bubble assets don t last for 14 years, nor do they keep exceeding their previously established all-time high, nor are they assets with clear use cases. In  I go deep into an undeniable use case of Bitcoin that is little mentioned.If you keep calling this a bubble or keep claiming  this is beginning of the end of Bitcoin,  your actual conclusion is that the market has been wrong for 14 straight years.Of course, there are times when the market-wide time preference shortens. Morgan Housel s  explores the rationality  not irrationality  behind bubbles. The simple answer is that investors  time preference shortens. During bubbles, the next day or week is nearly guaranteed to see a higher price. The time preference of investors collapses from a  normal  focus on a longer term to an abnormal focus on this immediate short term. Abnormal and normal are not denotations of rationality, they are simply a statement that most of the time  normally  time preference is not as short as  until tomorrow.  This is FOMO in its distilled and wholly rational form. Bursting bubbles is the opposite  as time preference lengthens, discounted cash flows become the dominant force of consideration and valuations come back down.  Sentiment shifts  is another name for describing the phenomenon of changing time preference.This understanding is also why I have chosen to subdivide my analysis by time preference, because within these fluctuations are many opportunities. And without at least acknowledging time preference, one s investment thesis is hopelessly incomplete.When we look at Bitcoin in its entire 14-year history, there are moments of collapsing time preference. But 14 years is long for a  short-term time preference while also supporting an asset that is still outperforming nearly everything else over the same time. If these magic internet coins are tulips, then by their age alone they are very special tulips indeed.The crypto bear market has dragged on for nearly two years. BTC is still down 60  from its all-time high in November 2021. A lot of seemingly bullish news has been met with short-lived spikes followed by longs taking profits. BTC has had a tough time breaking through resistance at  30,000 over the last five months.Also, BTC s  is at five-year lows, signaling an apathetic market. The choppy price action of the last few months has been driven by record-low volumes. When volumes pick up again, the actual direction of the market should be clearer.Low volumes in crypto have been making . Most crypto is speculation, so I interpret this as speculative interest slowing down for a big chunk of the industry. Comments in the linked article also suggested the same interpretation. However, it is key to separate the utility of speculation from the utility of Bitcoin. If you believe that Bitcoin has intrinsic utility, then this period of apathy in which the baby is seemingly being thrown out with the bathwater is a great time to accumulate. I am reminded of the bloodbath in REITs over this last year, when astute investors were able to scoop up good deals as the market relentlessly punished all REITs simply for being associated with commercial real estate.Likewise, BTC model free implied volatility  ie. a VIX calculation from option prices  is also at 4-year lows. It is likely at all-time lows, but the IV data on  does not go back far enough. For context, crypto prices generally rise with IV. This feature is different from equities. Such lows in both IV and trading volume should indicate that the crypto bear market is on the precipice of ending.Given historical trends, BTC is also at  lows. Below are two charts that put BTC s price on a log scale with various annotations. The  is a bit like a dynamic RSI that shows oversold and overbought regions. It also annotates the halvings.The  with the 200 Week Moving Average shows that BTC rarely stays below its 200 Week Moving Average. The points when it is touching or below this moving average have been great accumulation zones.These charts all point towards a market that is exhausted and oversold. Though not fully capitulated  one might argue capitulation was last year when BTC bottomed at around  16,000 , the sentiment has been negative and apathetic.Public attention this year has been drawn away from crypto and towards trends like AI. The investment landscape has been favoring big tech, semiconductors, and even more recently energy. Again, the logical consequence of this matches up with what we see in the charts  apathy towards BTC and crypto in general as an investment.This is why now is probably a great time to start a dollar cost average accumulation. The sentiment could continue to worsen for a while, but the backstop is the fundamental, intrinsic value of BTC. New use cases have continued to develop over the course of the BTC bear market.The  fundamentals  of something like BTC is the potential for usage and adoption. BTC aims to be money, and all money is backed by the economy which uses it  note that this is very different from saying the  country that uses it  because economies can easily be international . The reason the USD is the strongest currency is that the collective households and firms which use the USD constitute the largest economic bloc in the world. This is also why countries who try to steer their economies away from using the USD are seen as a threat to dollar hegemony.  Note that being seen as a threat is different from being an actual threat. The dollar hegemony is very strong for reasons deeply embedded in basic international economic principles. I cover those in greater detail .The more people using Bitcoin for payments, the stronger BTC s fundamentals become. This same logic does not quite apply to other cryptocurrencies, especially because many have token models which make them resemble securities. In this case, greater use of the underlying blockchain network may lead to price appreciation in the short term as a function of speculation, but the price cannot be sustained by the cash flows generated in the long term.The problem with Bitcoin usage is that it s not as clear-cut as amateur analysts think. Some think that because the blockchain is a transparent ledger, they can simply look on chain to see whether adoption is happening. This works for Ethereum, and it is arguably the only good way to objectively measure Ethereum adoption. But it doesn t work for Bitcoin.Both Ethereum and Bitcoin have started to , but they have taken completely different layer scaling approaches. To put it simply  Ethereum uses rollups, which are basically separate transparent blockchains with their own set of transactions and consensus. Thus,  on-chain  activity refers not just to the Ethereum base layer, but also to all the separate rollup blockchains linked to Ethereum. These are all transparent.Bitcoin, meanwhile, has used state channels  like the Lightning Network   as its L2 scaling solution. State channels are not separate blockchains, so they do not have the transparency that Ethereum rollups have. The basic concept of a state channel is that users can share a common on-chain state with each other and then sign updates to change this state. One example of an individual  state  would be how much BTC is owned by either person. At any point, the signed state updates  called  commitments  can be published to the blockchain, and the corresponding state will be reflected in the main chain. This enables people to do an unlimited number of transactions off-chain, by exchanging commitments with their counterparts, with the option of publishing the results of these transactions on-chain at any time.Without going into details about the tradeoffs between a state channel and a rollup solution, we can clearly see that the state channel solution is much more elusive to the casual observer because it never appears on chain. In fact, after the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021, it is impossible to tell when a new state channel for the Lightning Network is being opened or closed. Before that, it was possible to tell based on on-chain information that two users were creating a multisignature address to potentially initiate a state channel. There are a few places to look to get an idea.  is a site that reports the number of channels and how much BTC is locked in these channels. Below is a screenshot of their main dashboard. For clarity, a  Node  helps connect multiple channels so that users who do not have direct channels with each other can still pay each other through a mutual connected user  in this case the Node .The important thing to remember is that Lightning dashboards like these can never provide the complete picture the way a complete picture can be provided for Ethereum and its rollups. First, these are only the  channels that the Lightning Nodes are aware of. The Lightning Nodes being surveyed are also only the nodes that this website is aware of. Because the code is open source, entire communities can set up their own Bitcoin payments system using Lightning infrastructure and never be known by sites like 1ML. Finally, while we can see how many channels there are, there is no way to tell how many transactions are going through those channels. Each transaction is a state update signed and kept by the users of the channel, so only the users themselves really know their own transaction volume. In contrast, the exact number of transactions, accounts, value, and even the time each event occurred is always known for the Ethereum ecosystem, because one can just add together everything across all the rollups. depicts the number BTC locked into channels over time. Again, these numbers are only what is known. There is almost certainly a non-zero number of  channels with BTC that is not counted in this figure. Furthermore, since the Taproot upgrade in late 2021 and the popularization of Lightning over the last three years, the likelihood of more channels being unknown grows higher and higher.Unlike Ethereum, which has largely focused on growing smart contract functionality for on-chain trading, Bitcoin development has largely focused on the more practical use cases for the average consumer, such as payments and personal banking, and nearly always focusing on BTC as the main token. In contrast, Ethereum projects tend to release their own tokens and focus on infrastructure which can be leveraged to shuffle around many different tokens  including and often especially the token the project created  for the purpose of earning yields and conducting highly leveraged trades.Thus, the flavor of innovation is yet another major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both ecosystems have innovation, but innovative energy is consumed to achieve different objectives.The Bitcoin ecosystem does not regard a high level of programmability as paramount. When I was first learning about crypto, this caused me so much confusion and misunderstanding towards Bitcoin. It seemed that Ethereum projects were very organized and standardized. Each reputable project had its own documentation, a list of smart contract addresses, a whitepaper of how its proposed features can be implemented on-chain, a section explaining the project s token details, and so forth. Though many Ethereum projects did things very differently and in very creative ways, they all followed the same basic format of being able to somehow facilitate the exchange of tokens on-chain. Initially, I wrote this off as Bitcoin being the older ecosystem where nothing happened. But then the question of why Bitcoin never retreats from its number 1 spot on the crypto market cap ranking became more and pressing. You could say this was me reckoning why the market has been so wrongI have now come to realize that Bitcoin s innovations are happening constantly, but just not in a rigidly standardized manner because the simplicity of Bitcoin leaves so much room for different methods of innovation.One example of this is clearly the Lightning Network. Another is something like , an EVM smart contract blockchain that is  with Bitcoin, launched back in 2018. Rootstock has over 50  of Bitcoin s enormous hash rate securing it, making it the second most secure blockchain and the most secure smart contract blockchain in the world. Much more recent examples are , , and . Each one is a unique approach to Bitcoin scaling that is still in the testing phase. Each one is focused on expanding the use case of the BTC token only. To keep this short, I ll only cover Fedimint, which I think is simple enough to describe both non-technically and concisely.The basic idea of Fedimint is that communities can create their own multisignature wallets and have trusted members of the community be the  guardians  who hold the keys of the BTC in the wallet. Then, the community can mint IOUs against the BTC in the wallet and use a centralized ledger to keep track of IOU transactions, while ensuring things like privacy and full reserve backing. Each community can adjust the parameters to suit their needs. Each instance of a community multisignature wallet with its own BTC IOUs is called an individual Fedimint. The Fedimint protocol is also , so Fedimints can be set up to send BTC to other Fedimints via Lightning.It s clear that Fedimint is another variation of a state channel scaling solution. Unlike Lightning, it uses a trust-based setup. This is okay because Fedimint is intentionally designed for communities   the guardians are members of the community who are known to others and whom others already trust with other things  random examples  babysitting, being a good neighbor, dog walking, etc . Any funny business will have steep social costs.This may not seem too useful in countries with strong rule of law. Also, many in the West feel no persistent need to trust the members in their community. But Fedimint is an absolute game changer for the unbanked of the world, and many of these are the exact people who must rely on their communities.Now apply this to what has already been said about Lightning. Fedimint s transactions are all off-chain. With Taproot, we can t even know if a new Fedimint is being started. Fedimints can send stuff to each other via Lightning, another off-chain solution.These kinds of technologies will grow Bitcoin adoption. And they are invisible to the casual observer, or the junior analyst looking for on-chain activity. When crypto news platforms are talking more about Ordinals NFTs, BRC-20 tokens, and the ETF than about the development of practical use cases, you can be sure that the masses are not aware of all that is happening.Bitcoin is a global settlement layer, and everything built over it helps increase Bitcoin s use case and reach. The ecosystem holds the ultimate long-term view  slowly help people around the world gain financial autonomy, slowly let the free market do its job, slowly watch people innovate and take risks without avoidable financial insecurities, slowly have each newer generation understand these benefits, then slowly become the world s de facto money.The biggest uncertainty today is Bitcoin s public relations. On the one hand, governments are incentivized to try to hold on to their monetary monopoly. But this is much harder if more people understand Bitcoin.If Bitcoin cannot attract enough public support, then governments may be able to establish some hold over it and reaffirm their monopoly over money. Thus, the risk increases with the number of autocratic regimes  governments who do not have to listen to their citizens  and increases with the number of people who cannot think critically. The former is a falling number, but the latter is a rising number.My suspicion is that as times get worse, mainly due to the state of today s money, more people will begin to wake up and ask questions likeOh, and some of these issues are due to bad life choices   not just the fact that the monetary base has  causing the dollar to  since 1970   so I ll also includeGenerally, these questions point one towards the Austrian School, sound money, and, inevitably, Bitcoin. They might also cause one to cut back on lattes  Starbucks  might be a good short idea, I don t know .Ultimately, it s a big uncertainty how Bitcoin s public perception will emerge after this time. The regulatory landscape, at least in the U.S., seems more and more crypto friendly, and this has been especially true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was notably called out as the only crypto that was certainly not a security. Yet, many people still believe it is a ponzi scheme.Those who believe that governments will move to ban it without any regard for the preference of the people are implicitly denying the power of rule of law and constitutional freedoms. They also run the risk of denying the force of the free market, which is a very dangerous bet.The more useful question is whether people themselves will want money that cannot be debased. And this is of course a PR question. The prevailing PR campaign has been to encourage the acceptance of inflationary money and benevolent technocrats who dictate monetary policy from above, all using highly robust  methodologies, no doubt. Will Bitcoin s PR campaign   involving , , less leverage, and personal wealth secured by the mere    win any hearts and minds  Who knows.There have never been tulips like Bitcoin. I am buying these tulips with both hands because I see the strong fundamentals beneath the surface. More importantly, most other people do not see these fundamentals yet. We can confirm this because many crypto commentators don t even know where to look when it comes to evaluating Bitcoin s progress. Even more importantly, the current sentiment is too negative and apathetic to ignore. My recommendation is not for you to take my word on these points, but for you to look and find the truth yourself.I reaffirm my buy rating and would upgrade to strong buy at  20,000. If it falls below that point, I will liquidate some stocks to buy more  unless stocks also happen to be down big . The next several months should be very interesting with all the catalysts listed at the beginning of this article. 2024 looks like a wonderful year for BTC.

Thoughts From The Municipal Bond Desk (October Edition),"In our latest update on what s going on in the muni market, we ask and answer The Fed s action was widely expected. Underlying inflation cooled faster than policymakers expected, suggesting that their efforts to restrain inflation have largely been successful. But the Fed has also said it s concerned that stronger-than-expected economic growth could boost inflationary trends. On balance, this suggests to me that the Fed will remain on pause   or even end interest rate hikes   unless the data indicates otherwise. That We often see disappointing performance during September and October, when returns have historically been weaker than at other times of the year. During these months, we typically have a weak coupon payment season, and generally high net issuance, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. Now through late October may be a good time to put new money to work at a potentially lower cost basis. Alternatively, November, December, and January have tended to be good months for munis, with the January reinvestment period one of the most potentially advantageous times to be invested. I think we d all like for the government to avert a shutdown, but the odds aren t good. The last time federal government shutdown was December 21, 2018. It was a partial one, lasting 35 days. Consensus is that a brief shutdown, one lasting 30 days or less, could delay certain federal payments to municipal issuers, but would have minimal-to-no credit impact on municipal debt. That said, a more protracted shutdown would be more concerning. The silver lining for munis is that, unlike previous shutdowns, municipalities have received record amounts of federal stimulus since 2020. Billions were allocated to municipalities from the American Rescue Plan Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. This is a real-life example of why strong rainy day fund balances are so important. They just might be the thing that gets munis through a potential government shutdown.A quick look at some commonly used muni market data points.Sources  Lipper US Fund Flows, JPMorgan. YTD   year-to-date.NA3150907Municipal securities are subject to the risk that legislative or economic conditions could affect an issuer s ability to make payments of principal and or interest.Junk bonds involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer s credit quality.The value of investments and any income will fluctuate  this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations , and investors may not get back the full amount invested.The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high-quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods.All fixed income securities are subject to two types of risk  credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and  or repay the principal on its debt. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa.Municipal bonds are issued by state and local government agencies to finance public projects and services. They typically pay interest that is tax-free in their state of issuance.

4 Reasons I'm Shorting The VIX Despite Geopolitical Risks,"The unexpected attack on Israel reminds us thatBut as investors, we must look at the implications for markets, and despite the shock, I think Israel's military dominance is ultimately unshaken by these attacks. The blow was psychological and tactical, not strategic. Israel is a mighty country, and I think her military prowess gives potential regional state adversaries pause, which limits the potential for a regional conflagration. Of course, the last two significant eventsWe should all be praying for the victims and their families, and we should all be asking ourselves stark questions about the future of the Middle East. Still, we should also remember that financial volatility, while redolent of physical volatility, is not the same thing. We must remember that the market's collective wisdom shrugs off our individual emotional experiences.The Hamas attack was deadly, and it will have profound implications. However, it does not look like the type of state-versus-state implications on trade from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 will materialize. Furthermore, the history of fighting in the Arab-Israeli conflict has typically been marked by short duration rather than the type of resource-intensive stalemate that is going on in Ukraine.However, war and the deterioration of foreign relations raise prices  there's often no way around it. So, if this issue expands and intensifies, it certainly could raise inflationary pressure, so I will keep a close eye on this risk as the events' momentum becomes more apparent in the coming days and weeks. I'm assuming that despite the shock factor of the Hamas attack, the effect on markets will be broadly similar to other high-intensity periods in the Arab-Israeli Conflict during the 21st century.While the relatively low-intensity conflict between Arabs and Palestinians slowly rumbles through time, it doesn't have the same profound economic effects as when a conflict interrupts food production in one of the world's largest grain producers. So, I think as devastating and sickening as these attacks were, the ultimate effect on global commerce will be much less than Russia's Invasion of Ukraine.Indeed, the market has sent two overwhelmingly bullish messages in less than a week.Anecdotally, when markets rally on bad news, I'm typically heartily encouraged. I have found this indicative of turning points in the post-COVID markets. These two events alone make me very bullish on the disposition of the market into year-end, but there are four significant reasons why I will be shorting volatility into the end of the year.I have written extensively before on why I believe have led to the VIX being a somewhat obsolete instrument for catching volatility and why many who expect spikes of levels similar to those seen in COVID-19 and the Global Financial will likely be . This is the primary reason why many investors have been fretting about a suppressed VIX. To sum up a key conclusion of my prior workOf course, a crucial distinction must be made when talking about why the VIX has been suppressed. In my past two articles on the VIX, I mainly focused on the structural reasons why volatility was relatively more suppressed while navigating an ominous group of post-COVID-19 risks than in previous periods when the market faced similar risks.You can see this at play during the recent VIX spike on interest rate fears and volatility that appeared to peak last week. The VIX briefly got above  20, but I think it will continue to retreat into year-end, given several factors. While I am still convinced the structural and market efficiency factors contribute to a more suppressed VIX, I think many factors that will work with them to contribute to a suppressed VIX for the rest of the year are also fundamental and seasonal. Here are four reasons why I think the VIX will remain suppressed until the end of 2023.1. The soft landing thesis appears intact. The jobs market is proliferating, but these aren't high-paying jobs that drive inflationary spending. Furthermore, upward wage pressure has come down, meaning the job market strength is not exacerbating inflation. The economic strength will likely lead to strength in Q3 earnings. One positive sign is that companies are issuing guidance at the highest clip in five years, and all else being equal, more visibility means less price volatility, particularly during earnings season.We often have a unique combination of robust economic data and consumer sentiment already at recessionary levels. Recessions are usually preceded by exuberance and confidence, not the perpetual fear and anxiety that leads to more conservative and rational economic decision-making in many cases. In other words, if you cut costs in anticipation of a recession, but demand stays the same or increases, you have likely just increased your margins. This appears to be going on widely in the US economy.2. The Q3 Earnings season is upon us. When markets enter an earnings season, the focus tends to shift from macro drivers and the Fed to the earnings report of respective companies. And believe it or not, despite all the hollering and moaning from bears about term premiums, earnings estimates have ticked back up after declining in a wave of pessimistic sentiment earlier in the year. But, particularly after recent data showing better than forecast economic strength, I'm VERY optimistic about the upcoming earnings season.But there is another underappreciated factor in how earnings season affects the VIX, even if it is a highly volatile one. The VIX measures volatility at the index level. Still, during an earnings season,  at the index level as it increases at the level of individual stocks, so long as an all-correlations-go-to-one sell-off does not occur. In other words, the fact that we are entering an earnings season in itself means that the VIX should naturally be suppressed.3. Seasonal factors have flipped mainly from negative to positive. The remainder of the year tends to see gains for the stock market. Little factors like a slight bump from late tax returns should prove a countervailing force on the weakening bottom four quartiles of US consumers. Yet, the top quintile unlimited purse is somewhat of a countercyclical buoy. Furthermore, standard seasonal factors generally converge to produce good gains in the Fourth Quarter.In addition to the regular monthly seasonal strength, another minor feather in the bullish cap is that this seasonality is augmented in odd years versus even years. So, many positive seasonal factors should converge in the market's favor. There is always the possibility that abnormal events derail the seasonal trends, but historical data is better than none in most instances.4. The macroeconomic impact of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, was multiplied by two factors  The Cold War magnifying and intensifying the consequences of the conflict and the developed world's dependence on foreign-produced oil. Both of these items have changed. The world is still far more globalized now than it was then, despite recent and apparent setbacks to globalization. The first significant change is that the US economy has become far less reliant on oil and is far more efficient in its use than when the Arab-Oil Embargo roiled global markets and the US economy in particular.The other significant change is that the US is now one of the world's largest energy producers. We consume a lot of our oil, and even though the current administration has made some missteps on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, America's energy dominance means that any interruption in oil markets will affect our economy less. US Energy exports hit a record in 2022.It will also affect the global economy less. While the energy sector has been a polarizing political issue, if push came to shove and the United States faced economic ruin or dramatically increasing production, it would likely choose the latter. This is a different dynamic in the global economy than when Arab-Israeli issues badly affected prices and caused recession through energy shocks. Thus, one of the primary mechanisms through which volatility could affect markets is mitigated, and I think energy prices will ultimately be more affected by .The other reasons why I think continued VIX suppression is likely are all still intact, and I think those more secular reasons will converge with the seasonal to produce a low fear index for the remainder of the year. The most significant factor driving the suppression of the VIX is a matter of simple supply and demand. There has been a mass proliferation of more precise and even more liquid alternatives to hedge against tail risk or single-stock risks.I think you should use more precise tools that will give you more upside. For instance, the Limit Up, Limit Down  LULD  rules for individual stocks will give you more upside than the market-wide circuit-breaker rules. These rules have effectively diminished the kurtosis of the VIX or chopped off the tail colloquially.Still, despite these structural factors, there is a massive demand for VIX calls, implying that quite a few market participants disagree with my take. Many risks could get worse than markets already know about. I would include this as a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of the known risks currently stalking the market.I would also point out that my assumption of declining volatility into the end of the year largely rests upon an economic soft-landing coming to fruition. If economic activity declines rapidly or the lag effects of monetary policy cause a significant credit event, then the VIX will spike and make this article look spectacularly wrong. Nonetheless, I think this is a low-probability outcome.The reason you want to buy VIX options instead of just using put options on your SPX position is because the VIX has more convexity. The underlying is the implied volatility of the S P 500, not a security, and implied volatility can spike quickly in a way that usually outpaces asset price moves. But the post-COVID markets have been of a different character than usual.The Fed has guarded financial stability more than consensus thought possible, and the US consumer has proven remarkably resilient. Now that seasonal factors are favorable, I don't think these realities will turn around on a dime. The VIX also tends to decrease after inversion and briefly inverted on recent rate fears.Of course, the main risk of shorting the VIX is getting blown out of the water by an unknown risk. The Black Swan risks we can't know, anticipate, or sometimes even imagine will always be one of the most significant risks to shorting the VIX. People often equate it to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But in addition to seasonal factors being on your side, shorting the VIX in the wake of inversions has an excellent track record.Still, if you think about the physical limitations of this metaphorical task, it is quite doable, just like shorting the VIX. However, I think the data is mainly sending the all-clear, and survey and sentiment data show that people are in a frightful Halloween spirit. This is a perfect condition for shorting the VIX, in my estimation.They say markets climb a wall of worry and fall on a slope of hope. When the inflation report came in white hot and Hamas attacked unprecedentedly, markets sold off. But then they climbed the wall of worry and closed the day higher. While two anecdotal market occurrences don't make a trend, I think they hint at how markets will respond into year-end, aided by seasonal factors. They will climb a wall of worry, and the VIX will likely remain suppressed. I am betting the recent spike just north of  20 was a local high until the end of the year.So, let's finish on ways to implement a short VIX. There are a few options I will provide for folks with different skill levels, risk tolerances, and time horizons. I'll also tell you which contracts I've used will be using. One of the points I've made about VIX suppression involved the proliferation of more precise tools. One tool that is a pretty easy way to short the VIX is a popular short short-term VIX ETF offered by ProShares .There are a lot of risks involved with this ETF, and it won't perform like the VIX, but if you're not used to trading options, it is a good way to capitalize on a collapse of SPX Implied Volatility. It is a highly short-term instrument, and you should monitor it daily. Carefully consult the prospectus before using this tool, and really do your homework. Don't use it if you don't understand itMy preferred way of shorting the VIX is through VIX options. I think you have a lot more control here with regard to theta decay and implied volatility. As I've mentioned, the proliferation of 0DTE options has increased the agility of investors and enables you to squeeze a lot of alpha out of short periods. So, for me, I'll experiment with a trade comprising both short-term VIX options, only eight days out complimented with longer duration options whose value is more supported by time value. These guys can really pop if you catch the proverbial wind right  of course, the rapid time decay can also quickly vaporize capital.For this higher-risk leg of my trade, I purchased the . These options were very cheap, around the close at . However, this part of the position is negligible compared to the October 18th puts. The theta decay is a double-edged sword because, of course, if it goes against you, your contract will quickly go to zero. But, on the other hand, you have a very pure exposure to price movement. This can serve its purpose, but it's like flying a helicopter in a hurricane.Thus, I like to balance my ultra-risky positions with little time to expiry with a longer-dated option that is near or at the money. For this particular trade, given the recent spike in fear and negative sentiment, I will purchase the . These last traded at, respectively. I will put tight stops on my riskier positions and looser ones with more time value. This way, I will prevent a total loss of capital if the VIX moves to higher levels.

Get An 8.3% Yield From Secure High-Quality REITs: RQI,"We usually do not invest in closed-endIn fact, with the closed-end fund I'm going to present today, this is once again the case.The fund's biggest holding is Prologis . For those of you who have been following closely, my favorite industrial pick is Rexford , which is much smaller and has exposure to select geographies which have better supply and demand dynamics than the market at large.However, this isn't the topic ofThe topic of today's article is the  .So why would I consider this CEF and not anotherRQI uses leverage to invest in real estate investment trusts, or REITs. It currently has a 29.5  leverage ratio, which means that for  1 in assets, it invest  1.295 in REITs As these securities pay dividends, this increases the yield on the portfolio by 30 , minus the cost of leverage.This allows RQI to pay out a  0.08 monthly distribution, which is an 8.3  yield on its current  11.46 price.As such, it is an interesting vehicle to generate a high yield while maintaining exposure to safer low and mid-yielding REITs, as we'll see later.Leverage is a double-edged sword. On the way down, a leveraged fund will see NAV erode faster.I believe now is an interesting time to initiate exposure to RQI because of my outlook for REITs over the next 6-18 months, which I have shared in the past  I think REITs have witnessed most of the pain they were going to endure, and will soon swing back up .Analyzing a CEF is somewhat different than analyzing an equity. We start our work with the prospectus, which gives us everything we need to understand about the fund. From there we of course need to do some cursory analysis of underlying holdings, especially the larger ones, and check diversification. We compare the price to the NAV and historical discounts. Finally, we analyze distribution metrics, making sure that the distribution isn't just a return of capital. Ready to dig inRQI commits to investing at least 80  of its total assets in income-producing equity securities issued by high-quality REITs. These are REITs which show prospects for above-average revenue and earnings growth, and are identified based on criteria like earnings growth history, debt to capital ratio, and quality of management.The balance is invested in corporate bonds and preferred shares of real estate companies.This is potentially one of the most interesting parts of the equation.For it to keep working, it would need interest rates to come down within 3 years, which is the average term on its low fixed rate debt on which RQI pays 1.8 .Its average cost of financing is 2.6 .The Advisor charges a fee of 0.85  annually on the average daily managed assets of the fund. A potential conflict of interest arises since this fee is based on managed assets, which includes the fund s use of leverage. However, the Board ensures transparency and protects shareholders' interests by periodically reviewing the fund s performance and its use of leverage.It is customary for funds to present the top 10 holdings. RQI has 206 holdingsIn the case of RQI, the top 10 holdings represent 50  of the portfolio.In my opinion, it is somewhat reckless to ignore the other 50  of the portfolio, but at the same time, it is not necessary to analyze all 200 holdings.Here is the weight of the top x positions for RQI.It is quite clear that beyond the top 30 positions, no individual position adds much to the portfolio, nor deserves attention.Here are the top 30 positions.I've highlighted in bold the names which are covered by the DFT.The concentration of its top positions is quite similar to concentration within our model portfolios.It is also worth mentioning that while the DFT covers 8 of the top 30 positions, their weight within the fund represents no more than 20  of total assets.This is actually quite good, as it suggests that adding RQI would actually add diversification to our real estate exposure rather than creating leveraged redundancy.It is also interesting to note that they own MPW, demonstrating that they are as able as we are to make mistakes.Furthermore, the risk section of the prospectus was quite good in summarizing the different risks of various real estate industries.Here's a short summary belowThe sheer variety of industries within REITs and their own idiosyncratic risks and opportunities shows why it is silly for the media to lump all real estate together when making assessments.While all REITs have in common that they are spread businesses on the cost of capital, and therefore impacted by higher interest rates, the micro of each industry is just as important.With RQI you get their management's preferences of being overweight or underweight certain industries.Let's now look at how good a job they've done in the past.Below are the key current details concerning price and NAVThe 5.6  discount is greater than the one-year average, and looking at the chart below, it is clear that it is a discount which is within a standard range for RQI, but at the higher end. Historically, the price has been at a slight discount, but as REITs have increased, it has converged with NAV.This creates an extra 5  share price increase in upcoming years.Since inception in 2002, NAV has grown at a 9.16  CAGR, beating its blended benchmark and the S P 500 .The share price has somewhat lagged, but this is mostly a function of the NAV and share price disconnecting somewhat.What is clear is that RQI, through over two decades, has performed extremely well, as these returns are net of management's fees.Finally, what we want to make sure of, is that the distributions aren't frequently returns of capital.Short stints of capital returns have to be endured with CEFs when performance is below expectations, but we do not want them to be the norm.Since 2010, only 3 months saw a return of capital from the distributions, in the 4th quarter of 2020.This is encouraging.It means that RQI is able to engineer its 8.3  yield through investing in very high quality REITs, which yield a lot less, thanks to an astute inclusion of leverage, preffereds, and bonds.I've included the top 10 positions in a watchlist, and as you can see, none of them are very high yielding REITs.Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund seems to be a very well managed CEF.If, like me, you are bullish on REITs, the extra leverage offers a great opportunity if REITs soar over the next 24 months, as I expect them to do.We are setting a buy for Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund below  13.7, which ensures a yield above 7 , and a sell above  18, which was the previous high and would be a good time to review the position.The first thing you want to do is hit the orange  follow  button, so we can let you know when we write more dividend related articles.Our model portfolios are ahead of the market, and our community of nearly 900 members is always discussing latest developments in dividend stocks.PS   The summer sale deep discount ends in a few daysRobert   Sam Kovac are a father   son team specializing in building diversifed dividend portfolios.

Melexis NV (MLXSF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Melexis NV  Q3 2023 Results Conference Call October 25, 2023 4 30 AM ETMarc Biron - Chief Executive OfficerKaren Van Griensven - Chief Financial OfficerMarc Hesselink - INGRobert Sanders - Deutsche BankFrancois-Xavier Bouvignies - UBSJanardan Menon - JefferiesRuben Devos - Kepler CheuvreuxGuy Sips - KBC SecuritiesHello, and welcome to the Melexis Q3 2023 Results Call. My name is Natalie, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note that this call is being recorded.  Operator InstructionsI will now hand you over to your host, Marc Biron to begin today's conference. Thank you.Thank you. Dear audience, thank you for joining the Melexis Earnings Call regarding the third quarter of 2023.As always, I will start with the business update, after which, our CFO, Karen Van Griensven, will comment on the financials. We will answer your questions afterwards.Sales in the third quarter of '23 came out with an increase of 5  compared to the previous quarter. During the third quarter, we observed that the order behavior of customers is coming back to a more historical pattern, converging into a normalized order book.For the last quarter of the year, we expect limited growth because of the usual end of year inventory adjustments.The best-performing product during Q3 were our motor drivers, our magnetic sensor and our pressure sensor product, a trend clearly driven by electrification and the need for more comfort and more safety.The embedded motor drivers benefit from the gradual decarbonization of the car because they contribute to extend the range of the car. They are extensively used in thermal management application in cabin and also in the powertrain.The other outperforming products are used in application increasing theThe size of the product, as well as itsThe high safety level and the unique magnetic operation of the magnetic sensor are the main reason for the high demand of this magnetic sensor, especially in the e-braking system.We also had a very important success in Q3 with our temperature sensor because of renewed business in smart watches and also new business in smartphone. The contactless temperature measurement and the very high accuracy of the device creates a lot of attractiveness for the Melexis temperature product family.In the third quarter, we also launched in the market new products. For example, the new current sensors, which is a perfect fit for the EV battery management, and also for the power distribution system.We have also launched 2 ultra-low power all effect switch, which are ideal for IOT, industrial and white goods applications.Before I give the floor to Karen for the financials, I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14th of November. We will be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium, where we will present our strategy, our long-term financial targets as well as the product and application that will fuel our growth in the future.Thank you. Karen, I'll give you the floor.Thank you, Mark. So welcome, everybody. So as mentioned already, we came out with  248.6 million in the third quarter. So 13  increase versus a year ago and 5  versus the previous quarter, with a 3  negative impact of the euro-U.S. dollar versus a year ago, and no impact of the dollar versus the previous quarter.The gross result was  114.5 million or 46.1  of sales, an increase of 16  compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 3  compared to the previous quarter.R D expenses were at 10.7  of sales, G A was at 4.8  of sales, and selling was at 2  of sales.The operating result was  71.1 million or 28.6  of sales, which is an increase of 16  compared to the same quarter of last year, and an increase of 5  compared to the previous quarter.The net result was  56.8 million or  1.41 per share, an increase of 16 , compared to  48.8 million or  1.21 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and an increase of 9  compared to the previous quarter.If we look them ahead, so Melexis expects sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 in the range of  247 million to  251 million. So for the full year, Melexis expects sales to increase around 15 , a gross profit margin above 45 , and an operating margin above 27 , which was previously around 27 . And all of this taking into account a euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.05 for the remainder of the year.So operator, I would like to now open the Q A session. So please go ahead.Operator Instructions  Your first question goes to Marc Hesselink from ING.Yes. Maybe the first question is on supply and demand. You shared that number in the past, that value, that how much bigger the demand is versus supply. Can you maybe share that again  And also, how you expect supply to ramp up over the course of 2024And my second question is on pricing. We've seen -- most of your business is on long-term agreements, but maybe you've also seen some price pressure in the business that not on long-term agreements. So maybe, can you talk around that and how you see that maybe impacting long-term agreements over the more longer termYes. On the first question about supply and demand, I think what we mentioned during the previous quarter is still valid. I think for a large part of the business, there is a better balance between supply and demand, but we still have some pockets of business or some pocket of products that are still under allocation or under stress.Yes, I want also to mention perhaps that it -- given the lead time, which is, let's say, 9 months before -- between the order of the wafers and the delivery to customers. Yes, it's not because we don't have supply constraint at Melexis level, then the customer is not yet -- not in constraint anymore because there is this delay. I mean, we need time to move the product from the supply chain to the customer.In terms of pricing, your second question. As you mentioned, indeed, yes, part of the business is protected by LTA, the long-term agreement that has been defined for '23, '24 and '25. And -- but it's also, as I mentioned, let's say, for the supply chain and also for the order behavior, which is coming back to normal. But there is also, let's say, kind of usual price discussion that is coming back also from part of the business. But I would say yes, we were well prepared in the past for such a discussion. And we are preparing the same way for the discussion of today, then I would say we are confident because we know how to deal it because we have dealt with this kind of discussion in the past.Maybe the second part of the first question, the supply increases for 2024Sorry, I forget it, yes. Yes, we have together with our suppliers, we are working to increase the supply. And I think, you have realized that the supply is increasing, let's say, quarter after quarter. And for the part of business, which is still under constraint, the supply will continue to increase gradually in 2024.Your next question comes from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank.You sound pretty bullish on your TPMS opportunity. Can you just talk a bit about what your market share goals are, where your share is today  And how your solution compares to the likes of Infineon, NXP,  Schrader , et cetera  And I have a follow-up.Yes. I think you mentioned in your question the competitor, and I confirm those are the competitor. Yes, I would say it's not that we are really bullish in the answer. This is just the fact, let's say, we have some application ramping up at some customers. And this is the result of the ramping up.I mean, we have the TPMS. It's the second generation of TPMS. And we have this product, let's say, available, this version since this 3, 4 years, and now it is ramping up at a different customer.Got it. And in Ambient Lighting, you didn't mention that as being strong. Is there some digestion in Ambient Lighting  And are you still supply constrained in Ambient LightingYes. I think, indeed, we did not mention it because it did not grow a lot, let's say, in Q3 versus Q2, but it's supply constrained.And are you losing share because you are supply constrained, and others are like Elmos or not  Or you don't recognize that statementYes, we still have much more harder than what we can supply.Okay. So when you say pockets of the business under stress, it's still quite a large part of your business that is still supply constrainedI think -- no. From a percentage-wise, it's not a lot. But indeed, it's correct that the  indiscernible  in the Ambient Lighting is part of them, yes.Got it. And just last question, just on the destocking. We've seen some other companies like eBlocks see quite major destocking because their lead times normalized. Have you seen the destocking effect or what you call normalization in the backlog, mainly in the products where lead times are kind of back to normal  Or is it just -- do you think customers have over ordered in the past and are now prepared to kind of normalize their inventoryNo, I think it's a bit -- it's a global across the different product portfolio.Do you have another question  Just to make sure we are still online.Can you hear meYes.HelloYes, we hear you.Okay. I don't know. I didn't hear anybody calling for me, but I'm online. I was trying because of the quiet line. So it's Francois Bouvignies from UBS.So I have two quick ones. So in your remarks, Marc, you talked about challenging geopolitical environment and softer electric, softer EV demand. You also talked about orders, normalization.Now the question is, when you look at your numbers in terms of revenue growth, it's actually growing still mid-teens, I mean, this quarter and next quarter. So when you talk about the orders and softer EV demand, does it mean that we will see that at a later stage because it doesn't seem that we see anything right now  Your demand is still fairly strong. Your revenue is very strong. When you say that, is it already impacting your revenuesSo in other words, what you're seeing on the order behavior and EV demand, is it something that we should forecast to impact a bit at a later stage, let's say, 2024  Is it fair to see that wayWe will not comment about '24 because usually, we always give this comment.No. Yes, I'm not asking for quantification guidance. I'm just talking about the mechanical around it because if you said that there is 9 months lead times between your order and your shipments, if you see the orders changing right now, it wouldn't mean, based on what you said, that we will see the impact 9 months later. You see what I meanYes. No, I think you could see it. The comment you could see them in the fact that, yes, we could have been, I think, better in Q3 and also in Q4 with all the headwind that you mentioned. I think there is, for sure, yes, some geopolitic challenge.As I mentioned, and I think it's public that the EV growth -- is still growing a lot, but let's say, slower than anticipated. I think in the -- it's clear, for example, in Belgium that OD has postponed, let's say, the release of the EV production in Brussels. It's also clear that Tesla is reducing their price in order to keep the demand as high as possible. And I think all of this may create the fact that we could have had a better Q3 and a better Q4 with all those headwinds. But at the end, we are still growing.Okay. So you're already seeing that this quarter or next quarter. Can you quantify at all  Or I mean, any help around that  What would have been without this slowdown, the growth rate, for exampleNo, it's difficult to say. It's difficult to say.Okay. The second question is on China. So we know China has been pushing hard on the semiconductor side of things in many different areas. One thing that is very difficult is on the magnetic sensor side. I mean, do you see any local Chinese competitors developing some solutionAnd maybe if you can tell us your exposure to the Chinese local market, that would be great as well. Yes, that's kind of the China situation, local competition, if you see that ramping up and the size of local China, pleaseYes. But first, in general, there are indeed or there is indeed competition in China, but it's not only in China. I mean, we have competition everywhere. It's correct that the competition is a bit magnified in China, but it's not that we don't know how to deal with competition. We have competition in Europe. We have competition in the U.S. And also in China, and as you mentioned, I confirm that the competition in China is probably magnified.But as usual, our answer to the competition is innovation. I mean we have -- we launch between 15 and 20 new products every year, which are always innovative products. And yes, the strategy of Melexis is to avoid, let's say, the price battle and focus on the innovation, which is also the case in China.And to answer your initial question about competition. Yes, we see, I would say, more and more competitor in China also for magnetic. But those are, let's say, basic products and there are, thanks to our innovation, we can bring more value to the customers, also with our magnetic product. But it's correct that the simple products are under competition in China, but it's not our core business, let's say. Our strategy is to bring to link innovation.Very clear. And the size of local China as a percentage of revenues, can you help us quantify itOverall, for Melexis, it s 25 .We'll take our next question from Janardan Menon at Jefferies.My first question is on gross margins. Your gross margin has been running quite strong right now, and you've guided for more than 45 . But to get to the 45  to 46  range would imply a gross margin decline quarter-on-quarter.So I'm just wondering, is your guidance conservative for the full year at 45  plus  Or I mean, what I'm saying is could you have guided even at this 45-plus mean also 46 plus  Or is there any specific gross margin headwind that we should expect into Q4  Or any reason for gross margins to decline into Q4Well, in general, in this year, gross margin is certainly in the first quarter because of inventory effect is actually artificially high. So we know it will come down, short or midterm to more normalized levels. What it will be in Q4 is difficult to predict exactly. But the general trend will be that it will be down from the levels that we see today because of the inventory effect that will gradually fade out. So, yes.Understood. And given that you referred to some inventory normalization correction, et cetera, would -- should we also expect any kind of effect from -- on the utilization at your testing facilities in the next 1 or 2 quartersWell, the machine is running quite stable for the moment. I don't expect major impact from that for the time being.Okay. And then just going on to your comment in your opening remarks, on you're seeing some normal end of the inventory adjustments into Q4. Is that more in the channel  Is that at your sort of direct customers  And what is the level of confidence that, that is only going to be a Q4 phenomenon  And it is truly just an end-of-year seasonal situation and it will not continue into the first half of next yearYes. It's what we see, those adjustments, and in the channel, and in our customer on our Tier 1. I would say, in the channel for the distributor, we see that the inventory is stable, even decreasing a bit. For our customers, we see that the inventory is growing and now stabilizing, but it has grown during the previous months and quarters. And we see indeed that they are adjusting their inventory towards the end of the year. And this is why we really see the effect on those 2 inventories.Understood. And just last question for me. On the -- in the last couple of years, you've always said that you are deprioritizing adjacent markets because the demand from automotive is so strong that you can't fulfill automotive demand, and you are sort of giving higher priority to automotive.Given that, that situation may be changing a little bit, which is automotive chips are coming out of shortage in most cases or in many cases, and you did get this pickup in adjacent markets in Q3. Can we expect that if the automotive side does weaken more than you expect, let's say, in the next 6 months or so, will you be able to cover that slack by shipping more into adjacent markets  Or what I'm trying to say, is adjacent demand strong enough based on your new design wins like the smartphone win, et cetera, to compensate for that weakness right now based on your current visibilityIt s difficult to answer because yes, we don t know   the weakness that you mentioned, we don t know what is the level of the weakness. But it s correct that the capacity being increased and indeed some adjustment that we   in the inventory, that we see. It s correct that then we can give more volume to the adjacent.And for sure, it s a goal of Melexis to balance one with the other, that we have indeed   we are working now indeed to move some capacity towards adjacent. And we see that, yes, in some application, the adjacent application. We see some traction of those applications.You mentioned the temperature sensors, but we see it in also other domain.We'll now move on to our next question from Ruben Devos at Kepler Cheuvreux.I've got just 1 following up on the temperature sensor, which you just mentioned. I believe this will be included in the Pixel 8 Pro smartphones.Could you talk a bit more about the prospect that this could potentially be included in other high-end smartphones as well in your view  And given the expected volumes of the Google Pixel smartphones, it appears like this could be somewhat of a meaningful contributor to your sales. Could you talk a bit about how material this could be for youYes. The Google smartphone is -- I mean, it's not, let's say, the most popular smartphone and how much more popular smartphone. It's also on the high-end version of the phone. Then, yes, I think it's a good success for Melexis because we have proved to the market that we have a product which fits the smartphone requirement.In terms of volume, it is not fantastic. I mean it's for sure, good volume. And for sure, we welcome those volumes, but it's -- I repeat, those are not as popular phone as other phone. But for us, it's really important that we have proved to the market that we can make it, and achieve this fully compatible with the expectation.Okay. And then just more generally, I was wondering like, if you think about maybe the sales, new car sales these days of, let's say, 15  for petro-electric vehicles and 85  other. How would you think about your split in automotive with your share of salesIt's difficult to answer because we have many products that are agnostic to the split between ICE and battery cars. We have let's say, 50  of the product is agnostic to this. And then the other 50  is indeed split between battery and ICE.I don't know, Karen, if you know the split, but I don't know exactly how we could mention the split.Between the ICE and battery. Yes, well, the majority is indeed agnostic. And yes, we go more and more to an equal split in what is specific. And gradually EV has taken the overhand, so it's a gradual process. But it's the minority of our business that is -- so all in all, we are not very sensitive to the move -- to the speed of the move to EV or ICE in general.Yes. I can add that from a design win perspective, it is clear that the very vast majority of the design win are for either the agnostic or the battery powertrain. But yes, there is very, very limited number of design wins for ICE because clearly, the OEM focused their development on the electric cars, and they don't develop a new application or almost no new application for the ICE.Okay. And if I just can come back on the temperature sensor very quickly. You mentioned, it's not -- they don't really have high market share, Google within the overall smartphone market.But do you see like -- do you see there's any possibility of you also making inroads into selling to other handset manufacturers  You've had this win. It's a niche feature so far. But do you see more opportunity hereI think we are working on different opportunities in the smartphone, but also in other wearables. And we believe indeed that this temperature sensors can add value on those wearable. But for the time being, from the smartphone perspective, except for Google, I mean, I don t have anything to mention.We'll move on to our next question from Guy Sips of KBC Securities.Can you update us on the situation in the Malaysian factory. So the -- is it still -- are you still working on a  70 million investment, and that the new building is expected to be completed by the end of this year  Are you speeding it up and trying to get it finished earlier  What's the situation over thereWe are still on plan. And that means that production will be ready by year-end. So we'll move early next year into the production facility.The office building will be finalized in Q1. So that will be still part of the investment in -- for next year, but the majority will be done by the year-end, as was planned in the beginning of the year.And it's still the  70 million in the next 5 years that is expectedThe overall investment, yes, that's in that range of which half is more or less the facility.That's good news in general, I think, that we managed to have a speedy execution in Malaysia.And in return, we ll get more capacity.Operator Instructions  There are no further questions, so I'll hand it back to Mr. Marc to complete this conference. Thank you.Thank you. To close the conference, I would like to thank you for the questions. I m looking forward to discuss again in February.But before that, I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14 of November. And again, we d be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium, and to listen to our long-term strategy, long-term financial targets. Also, we d like to present the product and the application that will grow our future. And of course, we could have   take the opportunity, let s say, to discuss during the break or during the lunch on more informal way. Thank you.This concludes this call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-25T16:18:02.000-04:00
A-Mark Precious Metals: Unexpected Way To Bet On Gold,"The gold prices at the decade's end will exceed 4000  oz. To benefit from the gold bull run, the market offers multiple instruments. We can choose between bullion and gold ETFs or jump into the rabbit hole and buy mining shares. A-Mark PreciousA-Mark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry. The company has a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity. The company's revenue and gross profit margins have consistently risen for the last eight years. A-Mark's managers and directors are significant shareholders.I give A-Mark a strong buy rating because it offers excellent business at a steep discount supported by macro tailwinds.We live in exciting times. Uncertainty arises in geopolitics and the macroeconomy. Precious metals love such an environment. They benefit from the disorder  as Taleb would call them, they are antifragile. The gold price has been rising since the beginning of the century. It reached twice peak levels in 2011 and 2022 and, in the meantime, moves in a wide range.The fundamentals are lined up to fuel another leg of the gold bull market. The economic metrics, such as growing M2 aggregate and rising debt to GDP, drive the long-term demand. On the other hand, the supply is constrained by a lack of CAPEX and the approaching . New Tier 1 deposits have not been discovered and developed for the last decade. My scenario is initially for the gold price to reach the   2200 - 2500 range in the next 24 months. However, by the decade's end, we might see the gold priced beyond 4000  oz.The demand for precious metals is forecasted to grow by 9.1 CAGR till 2029. The chart below from  illustrates the growth specifics.In all segments, the demand will increase at a similar rate. Globally, the market is concentrated in North America and Europe. The newcomers as MENA and LATAM states still lag behind the Far East and the Western world. However, at a fast rate, they compensate for the delay. The chart below from  shows ETF gold holding by regionThe progress made by Asia and Europe in the last 17 years is apparent. Another overlooked process illustrating the rising gold demand is the COMEX deliveries. They have been rising steadily over the previous five years. The chart below shows the trendThe consistency is impressive. The 12-month average has been significantly higher than in the past two decades. For the last several years, the Central Banks across the globe have also been active participants in precious metal markets. They have increased their gold reserves with regular purchases. Many European Central Banks  to be repatriated from Fed's custody to their vaults.A-Mark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry. The image below from the last corporate  shows the company operationsA-Mark has a few revenue streamsA-Mark sells wholesale goods to merchants and institutional customers. Historically, wholesale segment margins averaged over 2 , compared to less than 1 . Due to the enormous supply and demand variations, predicting margins from quarter to quarter is challenging.What I like about A-Mark is its expansion in precious metals retail sales. The everyday investors has started to realize the importance of owning gold and silver. The pandemic was the catalytic event. All bullion dealers were short of inventories. A-Mark made acquisitions, thus reaching a more extensive customer base. JM Bullion, the largest precious metals retailer in the US, is included in its portfolio, and Silver Gold Bull is one of the largest in Canada.Cyber Metals is a platform developed by A-Mark and JMB. The quote below from the company's announcement briefly explains Cyber Metals.In my opinion, the app will significantly improve A-Mark's customer reach. It will attract Gen Z customers who are tech-savvy. Long-term Cyber Metals might turn into another established revenue stream for A-Mark.The directors and managers own company shares. The image below from  illustrates the large shareholdersInvesting means trusting the company's managers. No skin in the game says a lot to me. A-Mark is an excellent example of high ownership among managers and directors.A-Mark has strong financials. The table below shows the company's liquidity and solvency metrics. The data is from the company's .The numbers are good enough for me. A- Mark is not overloaded with debt and has enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations. The image below shows the company's balance sheetA few things I like about that business model  The first is the domination of liquid assets. The company owns   645 million in inventories  ex-restricted inventories . They could easily be liquidated without steep discounts hurting the company's solvency. Intangibles and goodwill constitute 10  of A-Mark's assets. Both are difficult to quantify  hence, our NAV estimate could be far off. It is nice to see such prudent levels in service-based business.On the liabilities side, the company does not hold long-term debt. It uses product financing agreements and revolving credit lines to fund its operations. Both provide flexibility and could be withdrawn when needed.The revenues have been rising for the last three years. The SG A expenses came up, too, due to inflation pressures. The company earnings are still below the levels of 2021 due to the increased expenses.The last numbers are not an exception. The company has managed to grow its yearly revenues for eight years. The chart below shows the company's line since its IPO in 2014.It is impressive to see the growing revenues have been translated into higher margins and EPS. As discussed above, efficient acquisitions were a primary driver, expanding the company's ability to cross and upsell its products.The table above illustrates company profitability metrics. The data is from the  Q2, 2023. The margins are very low in the precious metals trading industry. A-Mark management has done a great job gradually increasing the gross profit margin from 0.4  in 2015 to 3.5  in 2023. Net income per employee has improved too for the same period. Those numbers are a substantial achievement in a challenging environment for precious metals prices.A-Mark traditionally distributes dividends. The image below shows dividend metricsIt maintains a low payout ratio, which is a positive sign. That means the company can maintain its dividend policy without adversely affecting its liquidity. Another benefit is quarterly distribution and dividend growth.At this point, I will calculate the intrinsic value of A-Mark. For this purpose, I use a 2 Stage Discounted Free Cash Flow Model by Professor Damodaran. For equation inputs, I use his  and Seeking Alpha.Assumptions and inputsThe above parameters are inputs in the following steps1. Calculate Levered Beta with the formula below2. Calculate the discount rate  discount rate as the cost of equity  using the resulting value for leveraged beta. The formula I use is3. Stage 1  I calculate the present value of discounted free cash flows for ten years using 2024 and 2025 FCF estimates from . I assume the FCF will grow at a stable rate of 2.2 .4. Stage 2  Calculate the Terminal Value of the free cash flows over ten years at stable growth into perpetuity, g, and the resulting discount rate. Then, calculate the present value of the Terminal Value5. Sum the final results of stage 1 and stage 2. Their sum is called the Total Equity Value  TEV6. Divide the TEV by the total number of company-issued shares. The result is the intrinsic value of the acacia, which I compare against the current market price.For A-Mark, I get the following resultsLevered Beta   1.2Discount Rate   8.2Total Equity Value     1,196,000,000Total shares outstanding   23,000,000Intrinsic value per share     52.0Current market price     35.80  as of Sept 07, 2023To value A-Mark is difficult because its competitors are not public companies. I will weigh A-Mark against its peers from Specialized Finance  Acacia Research  ACDG  and SWK Holdings   and mid-size gold miners  Hecla Mining Company  and Coeur Mining . The latter have an asset-heavy business model and carry a lot of risk not inherent for A-Mark. While specialized finance companies might have clean balance sheets, they differ widely in business models.Ratios with sales in the denominator are useless for valuing AMRK because precious metals services have single-digit gross margins, unlike specialized financiers or gold miners. I use P B and P E in that case, despite their drawbacks. The latter is the most unreliable of all the metrics. Too often, the earnings are subject to accounting gimmicks. The book value, especially for A-Mark, could be estimated with a high degree of certainty because the company holds precious metals, cash, and derivatives with exposure to precious metals in its balance sheet.A-Mark is undervalued compared to financiers and miners based on all P E ratios while using P B, the company is overvalued. In conclusion, the company offers a 30  margin of safety based on DCF calculations - a rare occurrence for such a high-quality business.A-Mark carries the following risks  economic, liquidity, credit, and operational risk. The financial risk is related to interest rates and rising bond yields. The chart below shows the correlation between gold prices and 10-year US Treasury real yields  inverted .Both variables are inversely correlated. The gold is down when the yields are up, and vice versa. But that is a too simplistic explanation. We subtract the inflation from the nominal rates to obtain the actual rates. The current decade will be dominated by structural inflation. ZIRP will remain in the past, and the correlation between the rates and gold prices will become more insignificant.As seen on the chart for the first time since 2019, we have positive real yields. During that period, gold has been moving in a large consolidation. It broke unsuccessfully twice the resistance at 2000   per ounce during the pandemic in 2020 and April 20222.A-Mark is exposed to liquidity and credit risk because it is involved in precious metals landing and funds its operations with revolving credit lines. The liquidity risk is the inability of the borrower to cover its debt obligations on time. A-Mark is highly liquid, thus significantly reducing the liquidity risk.The credit risk is the company's counterparties' inability to pay its debts. A-Mark has a portfolio of loans valued at  100 million on 30 June 2023. The table below shows the loan structureThe company has sufficient buffer because the collateral for bullion is 75 , and for numismatics, it is 65  Loan to Value  LTV . On the other hand, A-Mark's borrowers are exposed to lower default risk.Considering the diverse operations included in the A-Mark portfolio, the operational risk is a factor we cannot ignore. Unfortunately, we can quantify and mitigate its impact.

Looking Towards Rate Cuts In 2024,"The technology sector led a rebound in the major market averages yesterday, but there was not a lot of participation from the remaining sectors, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index closed modestly lower. There were no economic reports to trade on, which is whyWhen a soft landing for the US economy can be confirmed by Fed officials, which I think occurs during the first half of 2024, we should start to see a normalization of short-term rate policy. That means moving from the currently restrictive stance to one that is neutral, meaning rates are neither restrictive nor stimulative. While this may be a highly subjective number, Chairman Powell has suggested that it approximately 3.5 . The soft landing will come into view onceBased on Fed funds futures, the consensus of investors is expecting the first rate cut at next year s May meeting. That would lower the target rate from a range of 5.25-5.5  to 5.00-5.25 . I think rate cuts will start sooner than that, because I see the core rate of inflation falling faster than the consensus.Shelter costs have been putting more upward pressure on core inflation than any other category and accounted for 90  of the CPI increase in the month of July. This is because it takes a full 12 months for new rental rates to work their way through the annualized number, which stands at approximately 8 . As the chart below clearly shows, when the newest rental rates are factored into the annualized number, we should see a precipitous fall in shelter inflation by May of next year. The market will anticipate the rate cuts to come, based on this disinflationary development, and the bull market should continue to broaden and mature between now and then as a result.The inflation hawks are saber rattling about rising energy prices today, which they assert will force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, if not continue to tighten monetary policy. First, the Fed s focus is on the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices. Both are subject to dramatic price swings which the Fed has little control over. The movement in the price of oil over the short to intermediate term has more to do with the speculative activities of futures traders than real world supply and demand. Therefore, it is futile to try and manage it with monetary policy. Second, rising energy prices is a form of tighter monetary policy on consumption, which self resolves over time.As this bull market broadens and strengthens, and sentiment gradually improves, I will become more keenly focused on what can go wrong rather than what is already going right. There is a big difference between a pause to refresh  3-5 , a correction  10  or more , and a bear market  20  or more . The first is an opportunity. The second is a more painful opportunity that requires more defensive action. The last necessitates a shift to wealth preservation. This still feels like a pause that has yet to complete itself. If the facts change, then so will my outlook.Lots of services offer investment ideas, but few offer a comprehensive top-down investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense.

Strong EV Sales Growth Forced Exxon Mobil To Enter The Lithium Business,"After a strong year in 2022, , and the United States is arguably the fastest-growing market in the world.That new market reality has apparently left an impression on some of theAt the end of July, news broke that  to supply lithium to some of the world s largest EV manufacturers, such as  ,   and  .This news follows another report that , with the intent of potentially mining and processing lithium in that region. While still in the early stages, the facility could pump out as much as 100,000 tons of processed lithium annually.This part of Arkansas is viewed as strategically important because it falls within the SmackoverIf Exxon successfully launches a new U.S.-based lithium operation, that would significantly boost domestic supplies of this key global resource. Lithium has been critically undersupplied in recent years, as EV manufacturing has expanded rapidly around the world.Currently, the world s largest producers of lithium include Australia, Chile, China, Argentina and Brazil.As part of the company s Q2 earnings call, CEO of Exxon Darren Woods said that  brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and, in fact, in some of our upstream operations.Exxon hasn t yet said if it would develop the Arkansas facility on its own, or potentially partner with another company that has specific expertise in lithium mining processing.Exxon s aspiration to be a major player in the global lithium market is clearly growing by the day especially if the longtime oil giant is already talking to EV manufacturers about future supply deals.And Exxon isn t hurting for cash. The company booked roughly  7 billion in profits during Q2 2023, and has a long history of putting extra capital to work.On July 13, Exxon acquired   for  4.9 billion. Denbury specializes in carbon capture, utilization and storage  CCS  as well as enhanced oil recovery. Last year, Exxon also acquired a 50  stake in Biojet AS, which is a Norwegian biofuel company.Earlier this year, the  reported that   of  , a large American fracker in the Permian Basin. However, based on the recent Denbury acquisition, the PXD deal may have temporarily been moved to the back burner.Based on Exxon s new foray into the lithium market, it s entirely possible the company may elect to acquire a lithium miner processor at some point in the future, as well.With a market capitalization of roughly  440 billion,  and can certainly  pay to play  in the lithium sector, if it so chooses.Exxon has likely been exploring strategic alternatives in the lithium sector for some time, but may have gotten more serious in 2023 due to the recent correction in lithium prices.Considering the company s long history of success, the leadership at Exxon is keenly aware that it s preferable to buy low and sell high, as opposed to vice versa.Lithium prices along with the prices of many other global commodities spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, but have dropped sharply since October of last year.From August 2021 to October 2022, lithium prices rallied from roughly  15,000 ton all the way to  85,000 ton. However, from October of last year through today, lithium prices have corrected by about 55 , and are currently trading around  35,000 ton.The recent drop has been attributed to several factors, including the recent slowdown in the Chinese economy, as well as increased global supplies of this key resource.China is currently the largest market for global EV sales and boasts the world s largest domestic fleet of EVs, with over half of the world s electric vehicles currently domiciled in the Middle Kingdom.China s economy had been expanding after the country scrapped most of its COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2022. But the economy in China has sputtered in recent weeks, as manufacturing activity in the country has steadily weakened.In addition to a weakening Chinese economy, lithium prices have also been fighting against rising global supplies of this key material. Lithium production was extremely limited just a few years ago, but global capacity has expanded significantly in the last two years.New supplies are coming online in China this year, and in the next couple of years, some big mines in North America and South America are expected to come online.For the time being, declining lithium prices have certainly helped make EVs more affordable, which may be a key reason sales of EVs continue to rise in 2023.In June of this year,  that new EVs were selling for about 20  less than they were 12 months ago, on average. And some of that decline was undoubtedly linked to falling lithium prices., the supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market will continue to drive prices for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Moreover, the prevailing price of lithium will continue to heavily influence how much it costs to build an EV.To track and trade the lithium sector, readers can add the following tickers to their watchlistsEditor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Next Big Short - Junk Bonds,"Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates - as interest rates increase bond prices fall. Thus, a bet on higher interest rates can be executed by shorting bonds, or bond ETFs.But whatThe basic formula for bond yields is as followsNominal yields   Real yields   Inflation Expectations   Credit Risk   Liquidity premium   Maturity premiumTreasury Bonds, issued by the US Government, are considered to be Risk-free, meaning the Credit risk is essentially 0. Further, Treasury Bonds have been the most liquid asset globally, thus Liquidity premium is also 0.Thus, Treasury Bond yields are affected only by 1  Real rates, and 2  Inflation expectations  relative to other bonds with the same maturity .The nominal yield on a 10-year Treasury Bond has increased over the last 6 months from around 3.3  to 4.49 , as the chart below shows. What caused the increase in the nominal yieldThe increase in the nominal yield on the 10-Year Treasury Bond has been primarily driven by the increase in the real interest rate. As the chart below shows, the real rate, as estimated by the yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security  TIPS  has almost doubled over the last 6 months, increasing from just above 1  to 2.07 .Inflation expectations, estimated as the Breakeven Inflation have been relatively stable over the last 6 months in a 2.3-2.4  range.Thus, it's the real yield that is pushing the nominal yield higher. What is causing the increase in real yieldsThe real yields respond to the supply and demand for Treasury Bonds, and can also be used as a monetary policy by the Fed. Specifically, the Fed can buy Treasury Bonds via QE to stimulate the economy by making real yields negative. The Fed can also remove the monetary policy stimulus by selling Treasury Bonds via QT, which can push the real yields higher.Recently, the Fed has been implementing the QT, which can explain the rise in real yields from -1  to  2  over last year.However, it was the Bank of Japan monetary policy tweak in July to allow long term rates to reach 1  that triggered the recent rise in the Treasury real rates, given the expectations that Japanese investors would start selling US Treasury Bonds. Note, the Japanese investors are the largest holders of US Treasuries.Further, the US Government is running an unsustainable fiscal deficit, which has been increasing the supply of Treasuries - at the time when the demand is weakening. The July Treasury auctions were weak, which added to the price pressure and lifted the real yields.Given the rising US Treasury nominal yields, the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  has dropped by 14  over the last 6 months.In fact, during this period many investors revealed their short bets on US Treasury Bonds, for example the .But what about Corporate Bonds, especially the Junk bonds  Based on the valuation formula above, the nominal Junk bonds yields are also pricing the Credit risk or the risk premium, in addition to the real yields and inflation expectations.Stinkingly, as TLT dropped by 14  over the last 6 months, the iShares iBoxx   High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  remained essentially flat, falling by only -0.05 .How to explain the relative overperformance of HYG over TLT over the last 6 months, as the chart below showsObviously, the recent episode of rising real rates did not increase credit risk for junk bonds. But more importantly, the increase in real yields did not affect the junk bonds, which actually means that the credit risk premium actually decreased over the last 6 months.Did we witness a flight to safety to Junk Bonds over the last 6 monthsIn fact, the interest rate spread between the BBB rated bond yields  one notch above the junk  and the 10-Year Treasury Bond yields has been narrowing, from 2.3  to current 1.66 , which is the lowest level since 2007.The recent overperformance of Junk bonds HYG over Treasury Bonds TLT is likely an inefficiency - and HYG is likely to fall sharply over the next 12 months, in absolute terms, and relative to TLT.First, the increase in real interest rates is increasing the probability of a recession, given that a rise in real yields is a monetary policy tightening tool - designed to slow the demand by reducing investment - and thus cause a recession to tame inflation. The Fed has not indicated a timetable to stop the QT.Second, the increase in nominal yields increases the probability of a credit crunch as the higher yields meet the wave of the corporate bond refinancing needs in 2024 and beyond. This is directly related to the unfolding Commercial Real Estate crisis, which is likely to be the next shoe to drop.Thus, Credit Risk is likely to sharply spike over the near term, as the higher real yields trigger a recession, and the likely wave of corporate defaults. Thus, HYG is a prime short at these levels, and given the recent overperformance.Note, according to Seeking Alpha, HYG has 47  short interest, which means that it is already a heavily shorted ETF - the big short on Junk bonds is already in place, but it has not worked yet.The soft-landing narrative is possibly continuing to support the Junk bond prices, and keeping the credit spreads tight. Thus, the Junk Bond short might need a trigger that invalidates the soft-landing narrative, a data point that confirms a recessionary scenario.What's in HYGHYG is well diversified ETF with 1207 junk bond holdings. These are the top 10 junk bonds in HYG, totaling just above 4 .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,"We are pleased to provide you with the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund s , the  Fund  report for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the first nine months of the calendar year, the Fund generated a return of  2.15   after fees  versus -4.12   before fees  for the Fund s most relevant benchmark, the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed Index.The primary contributors to performance during the quarter included certain U.S.-based real estate-related businesses  FNF Group and U-Haul Holding Company  and international real estate operating companies  Wharf Holdings and Berkeley Group . Notwithstanding, these gains were more than offset by detractors during the quarter, which primarily included the Fund s investments in areas that are perceived to be more  economically sensitive  such as real estate services  CBRE Group and JLL  and homebuilding  Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton despite these businesses possessing super-strong balance sheets and prospects to gain significant market share over time.Even though the Fund has outperformed its most relevant benchmark more recently, Fund Management maintains the view that the strategy s long-term results are the most relevant scorecard. To that end, the Fund has generated an annualized return of  7.93   after fees  since its inception more than twenty-five years ago. As a result, this performance indicates that an initial investment of  100,000 in the Fund would have a market value in excess of  675,000  assuming distributions had been reinvested , or more than the same  100,000 would be worth had it been placed into a passive mutual fund tracking the Fund s aforementioned benchmark  as well as the S P 500  over the same time period. Further perspective on the key drivers of this performance are included herein, along with more details on the Fund s additions to Sun Communities Inc. and Big Yellow plc, and overall portfolio positioning.At the end of July, the Office of Debt Management at the Department of the  U.S.  Treasury provided its to the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee  TBAC . Within the presentation, TBAC was provided with an overview of various items, including the Treasury s recent financial results, certain forecasts, and recommendations on financing. Most notably though, the Office of Debt Management revised certain figures from the previous quarter and projected that the Treasury s current annual deficit  which is amongst the largest on record as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product  would largely be maintained for the next decade. In addition, TBAC received the recommendation that the Treasury fund these shortfalls by increasing its issuance of longer-dated U.S. Treasury Notes. Alongside these revelations, the capital markets recalibrated their supply-and-demand expectations for Treasuries, leading to longer-dated U.S. Notes  i.e., 10-Year and 30-Year  selling off by nearly 20  in price in the weeks after, with long-dated Treasury yields increasing by more than 1.00  and reaching their highest levels in more than 15 years. Such moves are rare, let alone when  inflationary pressures  were reported to have moderated during the same time period as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price  CPI  Index.In actuality, this shift represented a reset in  real rates , which is the difference between the nominal yields for U.S. Treasuries and overall inflationary expectations. It is also a development that has reverberated throughout the broader capital markets as the 10-Year U.S. Treasury is considered to be the benchmark rate for debt markets globally and  the most important asset in the world  according to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. As a result, yields for other fixedincome securities factored in the adjustment in  real rates  during the quarter, impacting the prices for most  interest-rate sensitive  investments globally, including listed real estate.In terms of the impact on commercial real estate markets, this adjustment in  real rates  will undoubtedly lead to more elevated costs of capital and reduced property values in the near-term which will be particularly troubling for real estate enterprises with significant amounts of debt or meaningful near-term maturities. On the other hand, these developments seem to offer certain silver linings for distinct pockets of the commercial real estate industry, including  i  well-capitalized market participants with limited debt maturities as well as excess capital to deploy as investment opportunities arise,  ii  investors in listed real estate as the impact of higher discount rates has seemingly been factored into security prices and now offers a historically attractive basis when measured on most fundamental valuation metrics, and  iii  owners of strategic real estate assets as more restrictive lending terms will likely lead to a lack of new construction, serving to further tension the supply-and-demand picture, which could result in outsized rent growth in certain instances over the medium-term.This final point is worth expanding on as the return potential of income-producing real estate with  pricing power  is often misperceived in a higher interest rate environment, in our opinion. For instance, if one were to hypothetically purchasea portfolio of single-family rental properties at a 6.00  nominal cap rate  i.e., the  initial yield  and the income stream were to increase by 4.00  per year, on average, over a 5-year holding period, then one would realize a return of approximately 10.00  provided the  exit  cap rate  i.e., the yield at the end of the investment period  remained at the same level even after taking out an additional 15  expense for management fees and maintenance costs along the way. In fact, the portfolio would provide a return in excess of 5-Year U.S. treasuries  4.75  provided the  exit  cap rate remained below 7.90  in the scenario outlined above, thus allowing for nearly a 2.00  increase in cap rates over the holding period.Put otherwise, income-producing real estate can provide an attractive  real return  even in a higher interest rate environment provided it has  pricing power  and modest levels of  cap ex and  corporate overhead . It is for these reasons, among others, that the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund has concentrated its  income-producing  real estate investments into very well-capitalized enterprises with similar characteristics and distinct supply-and-demand drivers  e.g., emerging self-storage platforms, industrial real estate portfolios with  below-market  rents, premier mixed-use destinations, and niche residential rental businesses . It is also the framework for the Fund s additions to Sun Communities Inc. and Big Yellow plc during the quarter.Founded in the mid 1970 s, Sun Communities Inc.  Sun Communities  or  Sun  is the largest single owner of Manufactured Housing  MH  and Recreational Vehicle  RV  communities in North America, with more than 500 properties comprised of nearly 150,000 leasable sites, and a particular focus on the Sunbelt and Midwest regions of the U.S. The company is also the largest owner of marinas in the U.S. with 135 locations and nearly 50,000 slips, as well as investments in the MH and RV space internationally, primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary Park Holidays in the U.K. and 10  stake in separately-listed Ingenia Communities in Australia  also held in the Fund .As outlined in greater detail within the Fund s   these niche property types principally lease land sites  and power access  to MH and RV owners and have historically enjoyed steady demand, restricted supply, and limited maintenance costs. As a result, Sun Communities has proven capable of keeping occupancy rates above 95.0  over the past 10 years, on average, and has increased revenues  on a per-site basis  by more than 6.0  per year during that same time period, also on average most of which has dropped to the  bottom line  given the limited reinvestment required. Consequently, Sun has been amongst the leaders in the REIT industry in terms of cash flowgrowth and hardly ever  gets cheap  per se.That said, Sun s common stock has underperformed more recently. In our opinion, this not only stems from a more recent increase in borrowing and insurance costs, but is also due to the overhang of Sun s rapid acquisition activity. Historically a very focused company, Sun has increased its exposure to international markets, as well as more volatile revenue streams relative to its traditional MH and RV businesses through a series of investments in recent years. Therefore, the company s shares now trade at a sizable discount to its closest peer, as well as a conservative estimate of Net-Asset Value  NAV , in our view.It is therefore not inconceivable that Sun s aligned control group gets  back to basics  and refocuses the company on the core MH and RV communities in the period ahead. In the meantime, the Fund owns Sun common stock at prices that imply a cap rate in excess of 6.00 nearly the highest initial yield in more than a decade despite management indicating at an industry conference that they expect rental rate growth of 4-8  across the company s key segments at the same time that manufacturing wages  a key factor in MH rents  seem to be accelerating at an even more rapid clip.Founded in 1988, Big Yellow  Big Yellow  is a U.K.-based REIT that owns and operates a portfolio of 108 self-storage facilities spanning 6.3 million square feet of total space, which is primarily concentrated in London and the Southeast region of the U.K. The company is also very well-capitalized with a loan-tovalue ratio of approximately 15 , a fixed-charge coverage of nearly 6.0 times, and modest capital commitments.Fund Management remains fond of the self-storage business as this property type tends to provide remarkably steady cash flows once leased up, while at the same time requiring minimal ongoing capital expenditures. Further, should a tenant not pay rent, the items in storage can be sold off and the space can be subsequently re-leased. Self-storage is also one of the few property types that have legitimate scale advantages as companies that control platforms can operate much more efficiently than independent owners due to various operating synergies and also significantly lower customer acquisition costs  when viewed on a per unit basis  given the transition to online procurement in recent years.Notwithstanding, the primary drawback for self-storage facilities is that it is considered to be amongst the easiest property types to build  alongside industrial . However, Big Yellow has a unique position as the leading owner in a region with significantly less competition than its U.S. peers, as well as more restricted building codes in its core markets  i.e., there is estimated to be less than two square feet of self-storage space per capita in the U.K. relative to more than nine square feet in the U.S. . Moreover, due to the vast majority of its portfolio having been acquired or developed within the past decade, its occupancy rates have yet to reach stabilization providing a unique opportunity to match the utilization of its more established U.S. peers  i.e., Big Yellow s portfolio-wide vacancy rate was reported to be more than 19  in its most recent financials relative to approximately 6  for the established US self-storage REITs .When considering the fundamental backdrop  e.g., expanding awareness, demand from small business, population growth, et al , it seems as if Big Yellow has the potential to increase its portfolio occupancy rates towards 90.0  over time which would likely allow the company to match the 7.0  increase in revenues it has posted, on average, over the last 10 years. Industry followers would also likely point out that such a development would also have a disproportionate impact on the underlying cash flows given the  fixed-cost  nature of selfstorage facilities  i.e., operating margins for its recently integrated facilities are less than 60  relative to margins for its more stabilized facilities of 74 .Meanwhile, Big Yellow common stock trades at prices which imply an approximate 7.30  cap rate on the existing portfolio with only a slight uplift to the book valueof its development pipeline. In Fund Management s opinion, this price seems very modest relative to a reasonable estimate of Net-Asset Value, as well as significantly in excess of the 5.00  estimated cap rate that Nuveen recently agreed to acquire Self Storage Group ASA  a Nordic self-storage platform  for despite that entity having substantial ground leases relative to 99  of Big Yellow s locations now being controlled under  fee-simple  arrangements.Outside of these additions, the Fund s other activity was modest in nature and included a slight addition to Savills plc, as well as reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes  Lennar Corp., D.R. Horton, Prologis, Segro, Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier . The Fund also extended out its hedge relating to its Hong Kong Dollar exposure during the period.After factoring in this activity, the Fund had approximately 43  of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the U.S. and U.K. residential markets  wherethere remain supply deficits after years of under-building. In conjunction with near record-low inventory levels, there also remains significant demand for new product at affordable price points  both for-sale and for-rent . Therefore, these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multi-year recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities, particularly as mortgage rate volatility subsides. At the end of the quarter, these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding  Lennar Group and DR Horton , timberland ownership Aand management  Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier , planned development  Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings , niche rental platforms  AMH, Grainger plc, Ingenia Communities, and Sun Communities , as well as other ancillary businesses  Lowe s and Trinity Place Holdings .The Fund also had 31  of its capital invested in Commercial Real Estate enterprises that are involved with very-select segments of the property markets. At the current time, these holdings are primarily focused on companies seemingly capitalizing on secular trends, including structural changes driving more demand for industrial properties, self-storage facilities, and last-mile fulfillment  Prologis, U-Haul, Segro plc, First Industrial, InvenTrust, Big Yellow, and National Storage  as well as the further densification and improvements taking place in select urban corridors  CK Asset Holdings and Wharf Holdings . In Fund Management s view, each of these enterprises is very well-capitalized, their securities trade at discounts to private-market values, and they seem capable of providing compelling  real returns  in the face of higher interest rates primarily by increasing rents, undertaking development activities, and by making opportunistic acquisitions.An additional 23  of the Fund s capital is invested in Real Estate Services. These real estate-related businesses are generally less capital-intensive than direct property ownership and consequently have offered much higher returns on capital over the course of a cycle provided they have favorable positioning within their respective segments. At the present time, these holdings include franchises involved with brokerage and property management  CBRE Group, Savills plc, and JLL , investment management  Brookfield Corp. and Brookfield Asset Management , as well as mortgage and title insurance  FNF Group and the GSEs .The remaining 3  of the Fund s capital is in Cash, Debt   Options. These holdings include U.S.-dollar based cash and equivalents, short-term Treasuries, hedges relating to certain foreign currency exposures  Hong Kong Dollar , and an investment in the Senior Unsecured Notes of Five Point Holdings. The Fund s allocations across these various business types are outlined in the chart below, along with the exposure by geography  North America, Europe, and sia-Pacific . In addition, the discount to Net-Asset Value  NAV  for the Fund s holdings, when viewed in the aggregate, expanded to approximately 26.1  at the end of the quarter by Fund Management s estimates, and the holdings remain very wellcapitalized  in Fund Management s view  with an average loan-to-value ratio of 16  at the present time.During the quarter, the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund celebrated its 25th year of operations. As a result, the strategy now has one of the most established track records in real estate securities and has remained unique relative to other Real Estate Mutual Funds during that time span, in our view, byAlthough these core tenets of the Real Estate Value strategy have remained unchanged since its 1998 inception, the process by which it is implemented has been enhanced over the years on three key fronts. One, the strategy expanded its opportunity set by pursuing value investments in select international markets, which have been additive to returns for nearly two decades now. Two, the Fund has remained concentrated but more prudently than early on with stricter portfolio construction guidelines relating to position size, geographic exposure, and property type allocations. And three, the day-to-day management of the Fund has transitioned to a team-based effort, which utilizes a well-defined and repeatable process, making it more durable over the long-term  our primary focus .The results of this evolution have been satisfactory. To wit, the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund had generated an  8.15  annualized return at its twenty-five-year mark, exceeding its primary index as well as the S P 500 Index over that extended period of time. The results also support Third Avenue s long-held view that an actively managed fund with a sound strategy, robust process, and aligned portfolio management team has strong prospects to outperform relevant benchmarks over the long-term, on average, and most of the time.Notwithstanding, Fund Management believes in  continuous improvement , including using its experience to draw upon  lessons learned  with the goal of further enhancing the process and potential results in the years ahead. With that being the case, Fund Management recently revisited some of the largest contributors and detractors to performance over the years and found three indistinguishable themes on each side of the ledger. In terms of types of investments that have detracted from performance since the Fund s inception, the primary allocations have includedConversely, the allocations that could be characterized as the key drivers of performance over the past 25 years primarily includeWhile such investments haven t represented all of the contributors  or detractors , one should expect the Fund to eschew those that could be characterized by the former, while concentrating more capital around the latter when the price-to-value proposition is appropriate. Coincidentally now seems to be one of those moments and frankly very similar to when the Fund was launched in 1998 in a number of respects with  i  the S P Index trading at above-average earnings multiples,  ii  Real Estate securities seemingly out-of-favor, and  iii  10-Year U.S. Treasuries yielding around 5.00 . Similar to then, it also seems to be an opportune time to own  real assets  at modest valuations with prudent leverage, and to the extent the next few years of performance mirror those first few years of the strategy, it may prove to be a rewarding time to be invested in the Fund. However, Fund Management would be disappointed if the results were not even better given the  lessons learned  along the way.We thank you for your continued support and look forward to writing to you again at year-end.

U.S. Oil & Gas Is A Good Bet - Jennifer Warren,"Listen below or on the go via  or .Energy expert  on why U.S. oil and gas looks like a safe bet  1 30  recent industry M A, sensible consolidation and correcting false narrative  12 40 .  Hello, Michael Hopkins with Seeking Alpha, with Jennifer Warren from Concept Elemental.You just had a trip up to Montana, and you presented a keynote about energy and geopolitics at the University of Montana and the World Affairs Council. Maybe talk a little bit about that and what were some of the takeaways Yeah, so this was a conference, it was hosted by the Central and Southwest Asian Studies Center. And that part of the world is connected to, Russia, China, the Middle East, Europe by definition. So, it's in the middle of so many regions that are in the news, so to speak, of late.And so it was very timely to be there. And there were absolutely foremost experts on the Middle East and the region. And so that was really educational. And I talked about energy and geopolitics, largely from the point of view of having  all the shale booms and busts and what it means in terms of geopolitics. And then it was also notable that at this time, what's happening, there's a lot of obviously geopolitical conflict right now, which is really, really ramping up markets.One takeaway from my presentation was just that U.S. oil and gas production is kind of looking like a bit of a safe harbor in some respects, it's a positive and I think that message came through.And also just the idea that physics is also driving this energy transition a lot, a lot more than people would like to think, but it's kind of the truth. And that was, sort of also my other takeaway from the conference.And just that energy production globally is really of net benefit to societies. It's a source of economic development, and it's a positive story. It's a good news story at a time when there's a lot of really tough challenges and hopefully, these conflicts can end cause there's going to be economies to rebuild and energy is going to be at the core of this as well. That's kind of some of my high level takeaways from the conference. So, before that you attended an economics conference with leaders from around the globe and the Fed, any highlights to share from that Yeah, sure. So, yeah, it was a pretty intense, you know, 7 days. This conference, it was the National Association of Business Economists. And it was a gathering of economists from around the world and economists from all the major universities, and Bloomberg was there, and top economists. Actually, I sat next to one of the former top Chief Economists of the EIA, which is our energy watchdog. And there was somebody from the Embassy of Australia.And yeah, it was really pretty amazing. And, you know, a few Fed presidents, as well as one fed Board of Governors presentation that I found, I was really struck by his presentation. The message that he delivered was just that, we're doing all this, we're trying to smooth this economy out, and they're having to do it with interest rate increases that have had to happen for all kinds of reasons that we know and we won't go into.But the whole idea is shared prosperity. Again, that same message that this is the endgame of it all, you know, and it's a really complex task to get there.And, you know, it's a tough job they have, and I know they're under constant criticism and scrutiny and analysis and I get it completely. You know, I used to do the same and I still watch quite a bit. The other thing that was, oh, and kind of one of the takeaways was just that, you know, this continued restrictive policy stance, but at the same time really trying to monitor current developments.Of course there's backwards looking data and I know that there was kind of a criticism about their approach I read today by a leading thinker, you know that they're too backward looking, they need to be more forward looking and all that. But honestly, you know, from sitting there with them and listening to what they're looking at, too, they're about as forward-looking as anyone could be, you know. I mean, who has the crystal ball, right  So, I mean, so that was sort of my takeaway.I would say I left that feeling confident, you know, confident in the leadership. And then the other thing, as I sat in on two panels, one was on this, you know, supply chains and all this idea of reindustrialization, things that you and I have been talking about, we talked about it at the end of 2022, my after the Fed work.And then we talked about it at the beginning, the first quarter in videos and articles on supply chains and chips and all this change that's happening. And it's also, of course, driving a lot in tech, as we know. But with the supply chains, one quick takeaway is just that there are these changing trading blocks happening that we're starting to see.And we see this with investment, even like Intel , investing in Germany and what is it, Taiwan Manufacturing , you know, the chip maker, you know, here in, in Arizona, you know, just all of it is happening and it's going to take time.And then the other thing is, this is just one of my thoughts, even though there are these sort of shifts in trading blocks, we're still trading with China, not much less. It's just happening through other proxies.So, it's a still very interdependent globalized context. And I think that's really apparent when you see even what's happening with the conflict going on in the Middle East. No matter how you skin that cat, we're interconnected and our markets are interconnected and everyone's invested in everyone else, that sort of thing. And there are all these legacy relationships.And yeah, there's some shifts and some new relationships. And some of it we're seeing in energy with our energy trade, even with LNG and all that, and so it's just, t's going to be something to continue to watch. This is not going to move fast, no matter what we hear, announcements and things like that.It's just going to take   it's all going to take time to see what shakes ultimately. But I can say that the North American trading block is quite robust and it's positive. I even heard that from some economists' comments and that's all, it's kind of obvious. If you look at it through the energy lens, it's absolutely obvious.And we've been talking about that. You know, I've been talking about that since the last quarter of last year, just this really national treasure that we have.But now I want to talk about, so this is just looking at oil futures. And I was looking at this from a one month view. October 5th to 7th, you see oil prices go up like 4 . They stay up, they come down, because we're not sure what's happening, they go back up. And now, as you can see, they're ratcheted, they've come up and, everything's been kind of dragged down by what's happening.Oil  have come down a little bit, S P as well. And some of that's driven by just the idea that, you know, all this conflict, all this volatility, all this uncertainty could start dinging global demand. And that remains to be seen, jury s out.This is just showing what's going on with oil supply, which is also a big driver of, and we can't see the tightness. Hang on, let me just try to do this a little bit smaller, maybe in a different view.Tightness is a big driver. And now something I would say too is just that with this tightness between supply and demand that starts changing a little bit after the first, because you know it takes a while for oil production to catch up, right  And prices are higher, so there is some incentive to produce as well. But it's just sort of looking a bit tight for a little bit, and then we'll see how that all shakes out.And also geopolitics are going to have something to do with this. One thing I would say is, these other countries that are kind of involved in a lot of the geopolitical conflicts at the moment are also energy producers. So I think there's that to also consider.This summer, we have had the hottest, most summer load demand ever. And it was like 80, 85 megawatts. And remember I'd been talking about the grid and the stress of the grid. But I can also say with Texas, you know, it's a grand experiment in energy, trying to become energy efficient.Like I said, we're well diversified with our energy mix. We have a lot of renewables. We have the transmission problems that everybody has. And I've discussed that in that kind of Texas million dollar mile story. We have the connectivity issues that everybody has.So, what it all means is, in spite of the IRA legislation, it's all still going to move slow. But there are a lot of new ideas happening. I actually listened to an energy conference on Friday and there's some really innovative things happening in Texas and that's a story for another day.And this is just speaking to the yield issue, you know with the Fed and one thing I will say too, I know there's been this focus about the term premium, and what that's just really about is the addition to long-term yields that is not just attributed to interest rate rises.And sort of what they were talking about at the economist conference was that   of the long-term yield, one half of it right now is comprised of this term premium. And that has to do with actors and behavior expectations.And something that is driving that, it is thought, is our national debt. The idea that with interest rates being higher and then the national debt going up, it's going to get more expensive to fund that. And that's a headwind, that can crowd out investment, it can do all sorts of things. So, if anything, the idea of fiscal restraint is ever more important.And then this is something else from the Economist Conference.  has a lot of debt that is not apparent and is not, you know, just discussed. And that by 2025, this debt, this hidden debt could be 5x as large as what is recognized by officially recognized counterparts. So that is something and we're in the same boat.There's been this movement towards oil and gas as an investment, just because everything that's going on , which started last year is kind of a recipe for these hard assets. Oil prices have been up, it's just kind of like a safe harbor in some respects.U.S. oil exports reached a high in the first half of 2023. And we're just going to continue to export oil. And that's a positive thing that we're on the global stage with our oil and gas production.In 2023, natural gas production per well, they've just become more efficient. And that is partly why we see natural gas prices on the lower side, just production is up because we're producing roughly 13 million barrels a day of oil. And with that, as we've discussed, comes a lot of associated gas in the Permian. And there's a lot of oil production in the .There's gas production everywhere, Haynesville and Appalachia, and a lot of this is also going for LNG exports. So, it's just showing though that the producers are getting more efficient with production compared to years past. In the past, you've written  about Pioneer , the Permian, and now there's the Exxon  . The general , what color do you have about thisWhat does this mean for the market for investors when they're looking at these deals Yes, so, you know, we talked about this consolidation happening, you know, potential happening in the industry at the end of last year. You know, in our -- after the  we had   there are slides on this - we talked about, you know, the cash on the balance sheets of large oil and gas firms. And that deals were getting bigger, going to be, and by default, they are bigger. So, we kind of nailed that back then.And it's playing out because also I think, we've had to figure out where are oil prices going to be  What's the narrative  You know, is it this green transition, or is it oil and gas, what is happening in betweenReally, right now with returns, and with what's happening around the world, this consolidation makes even more sense. And then as oil prices are up, again, what are you going to do with that cash  Are you just going to return it all to the shareholder, or are you going to invest for tomorrowWell, they've decided to invest for tomorrow. And the idea that, you know, okay, some are saying, oh, this just means oil and gas is around a lot longer. Well, that's true. And that was always true. You know, if you just look at the numbers, the demand, how much primary energy demand is met by fossil fuel usage.And the affordability and all the things we have talked about in the past. And of course, absolutely, you know, this is also a way actually to produce these resources more cleanly when you have scale, when you have efficiency, you know, so I don't think that speaks to it being done, you know, with less decarbonization in mind, not at all. That's a false narrative.And so, I would just say that the idea that Exxon and Chevron  are now making these major, let's just call it  60 billion acquisitions respectively, because that's what they are. Pioneer was 60 and Hess is just a notch under  60 billion.It just speaks to the assets that make sense for those two players, you know, Exxon has a certain culture, certain operations, the Permian is a big deal for them. This completes that part of their portfolio and their intentions, their goal, their stated goals that they've had for a long time anyway. So this kind of just fits right into that.And then with , because they're a little bit different, they have a little bit different strategic outlook. And one thing that's been noted is the Guyana assets were a big deal for them. And that's absolutely true. And also they're going to be in, you know, the basins there in the Rockies a little bit more with some of the assets they bought.So I just think it speaks to these large  working with their competencies, and so I think from an investment point of view is just a positive, I have, Exxon, Pioneer, I don't have much CVX, I have it represented in other ways. I'd always wished I had CVX. Dang it. I was just doing other things, but I do have some Hess , so that's good.So I just think it's the ideas, what we've talked about, even at the beginning of the year, remember I was talking about scale, efficiency, consolidation, all these things. And it makes sense in this environment where inflation is higher. You've got to get those costs down. And this is one way to do it. So, I think it makes a lot of sense.And the other thing I'll note is just that, you know, we've talked about this U.S. majors versus European majors point of view. I think investors in the market are voting with their feet, and with their pocketbooks. And so that is my big, big takeaway. And geopolitics supports it. Long-term economic growth and development supports it. So, do we see more deals coming down the pipeline then Probably. I imagine it's going to be happening all in the underbrush.Everything that has happened in the last year on the geopolitical front, which absolutely intersects with energy, I think it really speaks to the environment that we're in and the outlook ahead. And that, just the , it's a good bet, rightIt's a positive development. And it makes sense that there's consolidation because we are going to produce more efficiently in the future hydrocarbons, we are going to produce them more cleanly. And in fact, in these tie-ups, I think it's going to actually bode well for innovation in the future as well. So, I think it's a positive all around. Exports, I mean, this is becoming like an important story, it sounds like, or it's already an important story, but does this become the story then for energy markets, not only through the end of the year, but maybe 2024 as well Yeah, I think it's a part of the story, right  It's not the whole story. It's an important part of the story in looking at specific companies.You know, what are they able to export that has a decent growth trajectory ahead  And we know energy is positive, right  It's needed, but okay, well, will there be more shifts to energy trade routes  I mean, we've already had a huge shift once, what happened with Russia invading Ukraine. We know that Europe, stopped using, has been weaning off Russian pipeline gas, there's still LNG floating around, you know, but we have been exporting a lot more.I think the projection is, and I think we talked about this a couple of videos ago, just that I think we were exporting like   in the summers like 13 BCF a day, and it's projected in the next number of years to go up to maybe 30. So that's growth, that's consistent growth. It's a projection. It's a scenario.Same with natural gas liquids, ethane, propane, you know, all that. Crude, yes. But, there's a lot of different players in that space, right  And in different assets. So, there's a lot of nuance to the various firms as to who can do what, you know, not everybody can do it. So that's one thing.And so, I'd say be nuanced about it. It is a theme, you know, but you better understand your numbers and how things are moving around.Look at the production, look at who different players like  and the Permian, really great Permian player, you know. Who's solid, who's got solid production, that's got room to run in the future, that kind of thing as wellI mean, think about AI. I mean, oh, you know, when we had the  you know, right before Memorial Day, everyone was like, huh, AI, every tech company involved is going to  from AI. Woo, let's watch the  go way up. And it did, but now it's coming back down to earth, like, okay, who can really leverage enterprise AI  What aspect of AIEveryone's hitched their wagon to the marketing idea of AI, but certain firms can pull it off better than others. You know, it's the same thinking, same in energy, same . Again, I appreciate the time. Very insightful. I'm looking forward to what happens next.

SoFi Is Digging A Wider Moat,"A common refrain I still hear from people who do not think SoFi  is a good investment is that there is significant competition and that SoFi does not have a moat. If a business doesn't have a moat, itWith the rare exception of heavy patent protection, a moat takes time to dig and fill with water. Moats aren't just bestowed by the investing gods, they are built through exceptional execution. What determines whether SoFi will be  just a bank  or the  winner take most in the fintech space  is their execution.This leads to one of the core tenants of my examination of a company's moat. While the size of the moat is very important, sometimes what is more important is whether the moat is expanding or contracting. Is the business executing in such a way that their competitive advantages are expanding relative to their peers  Are they carving out a defensible niche and creating differentiated products that lead to better outcomes  Is there an inherent network effect being created or a superior brand being built  Those are hard questions to answer directly, but the results invariably show up in the numbers.SoFi CEO Anthony Noto is fond of saying that when he joined in 2018 that everyone was talking about being an all-in-one financial app, but that SoFi is the only company who has actually done it. However, up to this point, SoFi's moat has been mostly theoretical. They say a one-stop shop should allow for a better experience and cross selling. They argue that it will increase user engagement and drive greater lifetime value from their members. Essentially, it should make SoFi's results differentiated from their competitors. The data are showing that to be the case. The moat is expanding.SoFi has a focus on getting new members to move their direct deposit to SoFi. That is because the bank where you send your direct deposit is almost always your primary bank, and your primary bank is where you keep most of your money. Here is what was said on the earnings call about deposit growthBig deal, SoFi is getting a lot of deposits because it's offering a high APY on their savings account  4.5  at the time of writing , right  Ally  currently gives 4.25 , LendingClub  clocks in at 4.5 , Discover  is at 4.3 . SoFi and LendingClub are equal now, but LendingClub actually had higher APY than SoFi for the entirety of 2Q23. If it all came down to APY, LendingClub should have been the biggest winner, and all the others should have also seen significant deposit growth. Credit to Vadim Kotlarov for this graphic.Every neobank has seen deposit growth over the past year as they've been taking customers away from incumbent banks by offering higher APYs than the likes of JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , and Citigroup . However, peak deposit growth for most neobanks was 4Q22 and they've all seen a steep drop in growth thereafter. There is one exception. SoFi's deposit growth has continued to accelerate. LendingClub even saw deposits shrink in the last quarter despite offering higher rates that SoFi the entire quarter.When I see a definitive trend reversal like that across an entire industry with one outlier who bucks that trend, I take note. Especially when on the face of it there is no reason for it. It isn't like SoFi gave higher APY or even higher signup bonuses during these last two quarters than before. They didn't increase marketing spend, as we'll see in a second, they just outperformed the competition because of something innate about the product. This is a testament to the fact that their product is differentiating itself in other, less obvious ways. This is what a moat looks like.SoFi is paying less in customer acquisition costs  CAC  than they have in well over a year while simultaneously adding more members than they ever have before. As CEO Anthony Noto's described it in the earnings callI love that he said that this trend is continuing into Q3 as well. One quarter of lower CAC and high member adds is not definitive proof that they truly have turned a corner. However, the increase in brand awareness they highlighted in the earnings call also provides data that supports this trend. If CAC can stay low as quarterly new members climb, it would be another piece of evidence that the moat is growing.Last November I wrote that  , the two other fintech companies who operate primarily in the fintech lending space. All three of them, at the moment, rely on personal loans as their main source of revenue and income. They all compete for borrowers and selling loans to the same debt investors. I'll provide a little more nuance into the different business models below, but I think the performance of these three companies since that article proves my analysis at the time was prescient. The differentiation of SoFi from its competitors is only getting more obvious over time.All three of these fintech businesses have to deal with a supply and demand issues on two fronts. On one front, they are offering to lend money to those who want a personal loan. These potential customers may be trying to refinance high variable rate credit card debt into lower fixed rate personal loans, renovating their house, financing solar panels, or any other reason. I'll refer to this as borrower demand, and it is extremely strong right now. People are looking at their credit card statements, feeling the pain, and seeking to refinance that variable rate debt into a lower fixed rate.On the other side of the equation are debt investors. These are banks and asset managers such as hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, etc. These are the entities that buy loans from companies like SoFi, LendingClub, and Upstart. All three of these companies sell loans to these debt investors, and depend on them for liquidity and, to an extent, their revenue and profits. I'll refer to this as investor demand, and right now it is weak. As a result of the banking crisis, most banks are actively looking to offload assets like personal loans to decrease their risk profiles and increase liquidity. Bank demand for personal loans is very low and in fact they are selling loans. This results in excess supply of assets at the moment. Asset managers are happy to step in, but the increase in supply means that they can be very picky about the pricing and the quality of the loans they are purchasing. The result is that investor demand is very weak right now.I like to give context for my analysis, so let's briefly review the similarities and differences between SoFi, LendingClub, and UpstartUpstart's target market is near prime and subprime candidates whom Upstart believes are higher quality borrowers than their FICO score would indicate. They do not disclose the average FICO score of the loans they fund or refer to their partners. Upstart, for the most part, tries not to hold loans on the balance sheet. They use their machine learning algorithm to determine credit worthiness and approve or deny the loan at a given APR. The majority of their revenue comes from fees they charge up front for finding and approving the loan. They let someone else hold the loan, collect interest, and take the default risk.Upstart has two cohorts of buyers of their loans, partner banks and the asset managers mentioned above. Partner banks can use Upstart as the de facto credit check service for their own customers and also can house loans that Upstart approves through its platform. They grew originations like crazy during the zero interest rate policy  ZIRP  days. However, Upstart immediately ran into issues as soon as rates started to increase. Origination growth was only positive 1Q22 because Upstart stepped in and used their balance sheet to fund loans. While they have continued to use their balance sheet, it hasn't been enough and demand to buy their loans has completely collapsed. Originations plummeted for 4 straight quarters before seeing a slight uptick in 2Q23.LendingClub targets near-prime, prime, and prime plus customers who are serial users of credit. For loans they hold on their own balance sheet, as of 4Q22, the average FICO score was 729 and the average income was  116,000. The entire servicing portfolio, which includes loans they've sold to others, had an average FICO of 717 and average income of  113,000 at that same time. They stopped disclosing those numbers in 2023.LendingClub also has two cohorts for the loans they originate. The first is themselves. LendingClub is a bank and takes a portion of their loans and puts them in their  Loans Held for Investment   HFI  portfolio. These are loans that LendingClub intends to hold on their books through maturity. The remaining loans are sold on what they refer to as their marketplace, which is comprised of the same type of debt investors referred to above. So they have a pretty steady rate at which they add loans to their own HFI portfolio as the existing loans are paid off, and then a variable amount of loans they sell on top of that. The amount of variable loans they sell fluctuates, but right now it is limited by investor demand from their marketplace.In their , LendingClub warned that the marketplace demand might soften as rates rise. CEO Scott Sanborn explained,  For certain investors, their funding costs will move based on the forward curve, meaning where the fed is expected to go. These investors are seeking more yield to cover their increased costs.  Investor costs move with where people  rates to go, so their costs went up faster than the actual funds rates. LendingClub's loan pricing, by their own admission, lags the Fed Funds rate hikes by at least a few months. Investors were getting squeezed with higher costs now but the loans they were buying did not yet have higher interest rates to offset those costs.This is exactly what happened. During 3Q22, marketplace originations dropped 15  from  2.82B to  2.39B, correspondingly dropping their revenue from those loans from  213.8M to  181.2M. This drop in marketplace originations has continued every quarter for the past year. Part of the reason for the marketplace drop is because they keep the highest quality prime and prime plus loans their HFI portfolio and sell the lower quality prime and near prime loans to investors.Now let's move on to SoFi. SoFi employs a slightly different model to Upstart and LendingClub. Rather than have two separate cohorts for their loans, SoFi holds all originated loans on their own balance sheet for a period of time before selling them on to debt investors. They previously guided for 6-7 months holding period, but right now they've been holding them much longer because of the weakness in investor demand. In this way, SoFi's balance sheet acts more like a shock absorber, giving them liquidity and optionality. SoFi can absorb or release loans as needed. As CEO Anthony Noto put it previouslyRight now, the opportunity lies in gobbling up market share of their core target demographic - high-earning, high-quality customers not well served by the current banking system. As Upstart and LendingClub are slowing originations, SoFi has continued to increase them. In 1Q22, SoFi was only originating less than 2 3 the volume of personal loans as LendingClub and less than half the volume of Upstart. Now they are originating a little under double LendingClub and more than triple Upstart.SoFi's borrowers are also the most affluent and highest quality of the three companies. Their personal loan borrowers have an average FICO of 745 and an average income of  164,000. Furthermore, SoFi has actually been front-running the fed's interest rate hikes. They raised the APR they charge their borrowers faster than the Fed hiked rates and faster than their competitors. They could do this because of the the strong demand caused by their network effects. Raising rates faster than competitors and simultaneously increasing originations is a differentiated result. Their key underwriting variable is cash flow, because they want to make sure that borrowers have excess monthly cash flow to cover their loan payment.All three of these companies have a ton of borrower demand at the moment, so that does not explain the discrepancy in originations. SoFi is proving their lending moat is expanding in three ways  superior availability of funding, choosing resilient customers, and better underwriting.LC underwent origination growth in 2021 and 2022 after receiving their bank charter in December 2020. However, their marketplace originations have tanked in 2022 and 2023 because of rising rates and tightening credit as described above. They do not leave room on the balance sheet to absorb any fluctuations in investor demand, so marketplace originations boom and bust in real time with fluctuations in investor demand.Upstart has virtually no control over their funding sources, so they are almost completely dependent on the whims of the economic environment. LC has been able to maintain some stability in originations because they hold a portion in the bank to maturity and can replace those as they hit their term. When demand from banks and asset managers for new loans dries up, Upstart gets hit the hardest. They have had to give preferential pricing and take on extra risk to supplement volumes in hard times. It is not a durable business through a full market cycle. Upstart the most cyclical of the three businesses.SoFi got their bank charter in 1Q22. They have had significantly more flexibility to add loans to their balance sheet throughout 2022 and 2023 because they are the funding source. It's part of the plan to be vertically integrated across the entire business and own the whole process.SoFi's business model to hold loans on the balance sheet for a variable amount of time and then selling them when the economics make sense appears to have given them the most flexibility to combat the economic turmoil caused by the rapidly rising rate environment. It even compares favorably to LC's business model even though both have bank charters. The timing of the bank charter was also fortuitous, no doubt about it, and has allowed them to continue scaling because they had plenty of room on the balance sheet to hold their own loans. However, I would argue that the business model is still superior because of the extra flexibility it gives them. Business model and execution are part of SoFi's expanding moat.SoFi's decision to only loan to affluent and high quality borrowers is a part of the business model that makes them resilient. SoFi could easily have loosened credit standards in the easy money ZIRP days. They did not. Instead, they deliberately built a robust business model that can grow through an entire cycle. LC and Upstart leaned into lending to lower quality borrowers during the ZIRP days to boost growth, but as investor demand pulled back, they have been forced to move up the value chain to higher quality borrowers.SoFi was already focused on a higher quality pool of borrowers and has not seen their potential clientele shrink in the same way. In fact, SoFi's all-in-one platform has attracted record members. This has allowed them to grow originations more than 6x from  614M in 4Q20 to  3.7B in the most recent quarter without compromising on credit quality.SoFi chose an antifragile business model and it has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth through the significant headwinds that all three businesses have faced in the last year and a half. That means they are now far and away the market share leader in the fintech personal lending space, and even more so in their credit box. This gives them an advantage to maintain that position moving forward. When the credit cycle turns and demand returns, they will be in position to ramp originations to maintain their place as the leader, selling loans as required at a profit to facilitate the increasing volumes.SoFi's credit outcomes are demonstrably better. The first reason for this dovetails with their resilient clientele. Higher quality borrowers hold up better in adverse economic conditions. Deliberately targeting that cohort of borrowers was a choice that is now paying dividends for the business.Upstart publishes what they refer to as their Upstart Macro Index or UMI. It gives a value that predicts how many of their borrowers will default on their loans relative to historical norms. If default rates are normal, UMI is 1. If loans are overperforming because of the macro environment  e.g. the government gave out a bunch of stimulus checks , UMI is less than 1. If loans are underperforming  e.g. stimulus stops and inflation is at 40 year highs , the UMI is above 1. UMI has literally never been higher than it is today. Upstart's borrowers are defaulting 70  more often than normal.SoFi outperforming Upstart is to be expected as affluent customers are more resilient. That does not explain how SoFi is seeing lower defaults than before the pandemic. LC's borrowers are ostensibly in the same credit box at SoFi, yet LC borrowers defaults crossed over prepandemic levels in 1Q23. SoFi just reiterated again in their 2Q23 earnings call that their credit outcomes are  better than they were before the pandemic. Not only that but their default rates actually  between 1Q23 and 2Q23.I do not know of a single lender of any type - bank, fintech, or otherwise - who can make that same claim. SoFi's underwriting is best in class and leads to better credit outcomes. This is what a moat looks like. When SoFi's balance sheet does eventually fill, it stands to reason that their superior credit outcomes and higher rates charged on their loans should allow them to find buyers for their loans easier than competitors. This is a claim that cannot yet be proven with data, but we can track in the coming quarters. LC did mention in their earnings call that the one bright spot for investor demand is for their seasoned prime personal loans. That just so happens to be exactly the type of loans SoFi has in abundance.Exceptional companies differentiate themselves in the hard times. The data supports the argument that SoFi really is building a business that is better than its peers. SoFi has a robust business model built on a more resilient client base. They utilize superior underwriting. They are continuing to accelerate deposit growth. Essentially, they offer an all-in-one platform that is taking market share for banking and lending. That has led to better outcomes in hard times. I think the evidence makes those statements undeniably true. When the headwinds slow, differentiated results will continue to separate them from competitors. The moat is getting deeper and wider every quarter.

Okeanis Eco Tankers: Riding The Upcoming Crude Tanker Bonanza,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome ZY Capital as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Okeanis Eco Tankers   OSLO OET  is a young crude tanker owner among more established, bellwether names such as Euronav  and Frontline . It owns the most attractive fleet and is appropriately leveraged to capture the multi-year upcycle in charter rates as suggested by the almost non-existent orderbook. With consistent outperformance against benchmark rates, a fantastic dividend policy and significant management ownership, I believe OET is poised to outperform in the upcoming crude tanker bonanza.Crude tanker owners, and this should hold true for most of shipping, are atAnd this is exactly the cyclicality of shipping - owners are flush with cash at the height of the boom, ordering more ships which lead to oversupply and poor rates, incentivising scrapping which tightens supply and causes rates to skyrocket.Crude tankers are used to carry crude oil and dirty petroleum products, and are classified by their sizes. VLCCs  2 million barrels  are the largest of them all, followed by Suezmaxes  1 million  barrels  and Aframaxes  600,000 barrels . Larger vessels usually have better unit economics while smaller vessels have the flexibility to enter any port  canal due to the small draft.Tankers are usually chartered out for some form of  day rate , of which there are two A simple analogy would be that a time charter is like renting a car, whereas a spot charter is like taking a cab. As you can probably guess, time charters are more stable and more accurately reflect long-term outlook rather than short-term sentiment.It is also important to note that different owners have different percentage of their fleet on time versus spot charters, which can skew accounting revenue comparisons as spot charter rates include voyage-related expenses. Therefore, it is common to see these companies publish their time charter equivalent  TCE  earnings, which is essentially gross charter revenues net of any voyage-related expenses incurred.The  governs the major routes and publishes the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index which can be used to gauge how average rates have moved daily. Some major routes are also scrutinized traders, such as the TD3C which is a VLCC route between the Middle East and China, but that is a topic mostly for traders and charterers.Okeanis Eco Tankers was listed back in 2018 with some vessels under construction that have all been delivered since.Today, the company owns 6 Suezmaxes and 8 VLCCs, all of which are eco-designed and scrubber-equipped. It has a market capitalization of about US 750 million with an equivalent amount of long-term debt.In , the company reported  70.8k fleetwide TCE and  74.4 million in EBITDA. EPS was  1.60 and the company announced its decision to pay out the  1.60 in its entirety as a dividend, equivalent to an annualized yield of 28 .Ask anyone and they will probably tell you about the extreme cyclicality in shipping, like I've mentioned in the industry overview section above. The shipping industry collectively is not known for making the best capital allocation decisions, often overordering and directly contributing to the next crash in rates. See the  immediately after the exceptional year they had in 2021 for a recent example.Therefore, the supply of vessels is something shipping investors scrutinize to identify any long-term opportunities in the industry. One very important indicator is the orderbook as a   of the existing fleet which is the new supply entering the market. As it stands, the , a level we have not seen for decades, and it is getting everyone riled up.Of course, owners with excess cash can still place orders for new ships - these are necessary capital expenditures to maintain and grow their fleets. However, ordering has slowed down significantly for the following reasons., due to the sharp increase in raw material and labour costs. A VLCC that cost  90 million in just 2018 now costs over  130 million in today's market for a 50  increase. Even the most irresponsible owners would run the numbers and find that the assumptions required to justify such a purchase to be challenging.Shipping is usually a leveraged business  to the tune of 60-70  LTVs  and the interest rate environment has made ordering unsavoury. Financing costs comprise a significant cost of operating a ship - higher interest rates would further jack up the breakeven costs when combined with the high purchase price., with some 2 3s of shipyards shuttered in the aftermath of the poor market in the early 2010s. Whatever capacity is left has been taken up by the orders of large and complex ships like LNG LPG carriers as well as containerships. There are  through to 2026 hence owners are less willing to build new ships but rather purchase existing ones to bolster fleet capacity.Environmental regulations pose great uncertainty in shipping. With talks of getting to , the shipping industry has been experimenting with alternative fuels like ammonia and LNG but . Ships are multi-decade investments and owners are hesitant to place orders for newbuilds that become uncompetitive before their lifetime.All these external conditions pose headwinds for new ordering, and it is reflected in the orderbook. I am personally more inclined to trust these reasons over self-imposed restrictions by shipowners who are a fickle bunch.Scrapping refers to the retirement of vessels for their steel value at scrapyards. This is typically done when the vessel approaches the end of their useful life or when prevailing rates make it uneconomic to continue operating such vessels. This is the other side of the tanker supply picture.Vessels lose value rapidly as they age, a function of the competitive market as well as regulations requiring expensive special surveys to verify their seaworthiness every few years.In a regular market, scrapping occurs happens at the 20-year mark. Steel prices have also risen in recent years, with  if they head to the breakers today.However, scrapping activity has been muted recently due to the strong rate environment. Older vessels have the unsavoury  but profitable  option of carrying sanctioned oil from countries like Iran and Russia, also known as the , giving owners an alternative to continue operating their vessels.This market has reduced scrapping and 32  of the current tanker fleet is aged 16 years or more. With such an old fleet in operation, it just takes a small nudge for owners to start selling their tankers for scrap should the shadow trade demand fade.While supply is the dominant force in the tanker trade, I think that demand for oil transportation should also hold up in the near-term. This comes in the form of ton-miles which means that both volumes and distances can drive up demand for tankers.The concept of peak oil is unavoidable when deciding to invest in owners of tankers. I do not profess to be a specialist in this area and choose to defer to official forecasts of oil demand. The IEA has  by another 2  to  102mmbd and we are on track to reach those forecasts. That said, I don't believe the tanker market is reliant on any significant demand side tailwinds for us to enter another boom.This year, OPEC  has  which puts pressure on volumes transported. With Brent oil trading safely in excess of  80 bbl, I think that this should push OPEC  towards restoring production - otherwise they'd have sacrificed their oil revenues to the benefit of other producers.Another reason to be optimistic is the overall realization that exploration   production activity has to continue. Shell, BP and other oil majors have reversed their stances on fossil fuels and have allocated significant capex in this area. Offshore exploration is making a comeback especially around the Atlantic where most incremental supply is expected to come from. This is overall bullish for crude tankers because Atlantic barrels have to travel further to additional refinery capacity in the Far East, .So why OET compared to the other tanker owners  I have repeated the fact that  are young, eco-designed and scrubber-fitted  i.e., the most environmentally friendly . I dislike it when product attributes are rattled off without further explanation, so let me show you why this fleet is desirable.Young vessels have an edge as they are typically more seaworthy and hence cost less to insure. The benchmark age is around 15 years old, after which it becomes significantly less competitive when competing for charters. Every charter is a miniature market where charterers get to select the most appropriate vessel to carry their cargo, and age is often an important criterion to minimize the risk of loss of cargo at sea.OET's fleet profile is shown in the chart above. Any vessels that fall on the right of the red line are less competitive and positioned for scrapping, while vessels between the yellow and red lines will reach the 15 year old mark in the next 3 years. As you can see, OET's vessels are very young and should remain very attractive to charterers in the near to medium term.Eco-designed refers to vessels that are built around the early 2010s, specifically designed to be hydrodynamic. Design variations can range from bow shape to the type of engine and can result in  10 tons of fuel savings daily. This means thousands in fuel savings everyday - nothing to scoff at when we consider entire fleets operating all year round. allow owners to burn cheaper   HSFO  compared to the more expensive   VLSFO  as mandated by IMO. Owners had to make the decision to retrofit their vessels for  2-3 million with scrubbers to benefit from fuel cost savings. While the VLSFO-HSFO spread has come down to  100 ton, this was historically a very profitable decision with spreads exceeding  200 ton. OET opted to retrofit its whole fleet with scrubbers a few years ago and that has more than paid off the investment. Therefore, this acts as an additional layer of optionality for OET to capture the spread going forward.As you can see, having a young and decked out fleet like OET gives it an edge when competing for charters. Fuel savings  in both cost and volume  should also translate to premiums above the benchmark rates.Besides, OET's management has proven to be shrewd owners capable of repositioning their vessels opportunistically to capture better spot rates for their vessels. Each route is a mini-market which can see over underperformance versus the benchmark BDTI and you want owners who have the foresight to capture this premium. OET has consistently reported TCEs higher than its peers in the crude tanker segment.OET's management is aligned with investors as the  in the company. It has also stated that with minimal capex requirements, unattractive newbuild economics, its goal is to return as much cash to investors in the form of dividends. I believe this as they recently paid out 100  EPS in Q1 2023 for an annualized yield of almost 28 . This is actual cash returned to you, as a shareholder, rather than questionable choices like investing in new ships at cycle-high prices.As OET has positioned its fleet to be 100  on spot, the biggest risk is a catastrophic event that reduces crude oil transportation demand, which would see spot rates crater. While the global economy continues to flirt with recessionary indicators, I believe that short of another pandemic  knock on wood , risks are skewed to the upside. The biggest recessions have seen just minor dips in oil demand, while vessel supply is set to tighten even more.While the OPEC  cuts act as a near-term headwind, I do not see this having an outsized impact. Oil prices have been trending higher, and they will soon have to turn on the taps again  otherwise what was the point of all those cuts . There is also the medium-term view that incremental supply in the Atlantic will replace OPEC  barrels and further drive ton-mile demand for tankers.Another concern is the potential easing of Russian sanctions, which was a major driver of 2022's outstanding charter rates. I believe that OET is not fundamentally reliant on Russian sanctions because Russian ports cannot accommodate the larger vessel classes in OET's fleet. Sanctions have lifted Aframax charter rates to near all-time highs and I would also steer clear of owners reliant on the sanction situation.I value each of OET's tankers using a DCF of their earnings and add net interest-bearing debt to find its valuation on a P NAV basis. Key assumptions in my DCF valuation are in the table belowI arrived at a NAV share of NOK 285 which means that OET is trading at roughly 0.85x NAV at today's share price of NOK 253.5. I believe this is a good entry point for investors who want exposure to the upcoming crude tanker market, with an attractive fleet as well as sensible management that is creating shareholder value.I have also estimated P NAVs for OET's peers in the crude tanker space - as you can see, the stock trades in line with the industry average and below the more prominent names like Frontline, Euronav and DHT Holdings . This valuation gap does not reflect the true quality of OET's business. Management is arguably comparable to the bigger names, while its fleet is unrivalled on any metric, and this translates to outperformance in the charter rates it can command.I fully expect P NAVs to rise across the board and for the valuation gap between OET and the US-listed names to close as more investors pay attention to the crude tanker segment. Therefore, I think that OET deserves to trade at 1.0x P NAV or about NOK 285 per share.I believe that the supply and demand set-up in the crude tanker space is the best we've seen in decades, and we are at the cusp of another great cycle. OET, hands down, owns the most attractive fleet for exposure to the crude tanker market. With young vessels trading on spot, minimal capital requirements and a friendly shareholder policy, this means that you can count on significant dividends and capital appreciation in the next 2-3 years.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Early in , Liberty completed the buyback of all these shares, so SLB no longer has an equity interest in Liberty. However, under the terms of their 2020 Master Transaction Agreement SLB will not  engage in any business or enterprise that is competitive with OneStim within onshore United States and Canada  without the prior written consent of Liberty until after December 31, 2024.With no remaining equity interest in Liberty, SLB cannot nominate new members to Liberty s board  however, its previous nominees,  are expected to remain on Liberty's board until their terms are complete or until Liberty s Nominating and Governance Committee requests they resign.SLB s  derived 78  from international operations and 22  from North America.

This continues the Biden administration s pattern of imposing limits on US drilling.A factor likely to exacerbate US oil price moves is Biden administration sales of  barrels of oil of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a significant reduction. At full capacity, the US SPR holds just over  barrels, or about a month s worth of US oil consumption at 20 million barrels per day  MMBPD  of consumption.It is worth noting US' own oil production is now about 13 MMBPD, up from as little as 5 MMBPD in 2005 due to the increase from onshore US shale production in areas like the Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford.The October 10, 2023, Brent NYMEX oil futures price  for December 2023 delivery  was  87.72 barrel.

In its 2Q23 investor call, SLB's chief financial officer, Stephane Biguet, said the company had committed to return  2 billion to shareholders in 2023 between dividends and buybacks. At the current dividend rate, this would be about  1.4 billion in dividends and  600 million in buybacks.Book value per share is  13.09, less than a quarter of the current market value per share.Mean analyst rating is a 2.1, or  buy,  from 37 analysts, with at least one analyst calling the stock fairly valued.However, the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA is 13.8, above the level of 10.0 or less that would suggest a bargain.SLB s 3Q23 earnings call will be October 20, 2023.SLB s major medium-term exposure is to changes in oil and natural gas prices and thus changes in worldwide drilling budgets.As an international operator, it has political risk in every country in which it operates, including the US.SLB s dividend yield alone, excluding share repurchases or stock price appreciation, is not competitive with rates near or above 5  for 2-year Treasuries.Although the company has a share buyback program as well as a modest dividend, it is not recommended to dividend investors. Other companies are more generous.The company has a very good governance score, but the stock is not a bargain near its 52-week high, a ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA of 13.8, and a forward price earnings ratio of 16.0-19.7.However, SLB s stock has seen good appreciation. It has steadily paid down debt. Its growth prospects are exciting, particularly as large capital expenditures shift from North America onshore to international offshore, SLB s forte.And now, given the growing recognition of the  importance of hydrocarbons in the energy mix, I recommend SLB to growth investors interested in globally diversified, large-scale oilfield services.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

EOG Resources: One Of The Best Oil Stocks To Outperform The Market,"This morning, I was just working my way through some articles and charts I had saved.One of them is last week's Wall Street Journal update with the title This article featured a chart that perfectly confirms what I've communicated for roughly three years  energy shareholders are in an increasingly good spot.Below, we're looking at the effect of oil companies deciding to focus on shareholder distributions instead of accelerating production growth.Related to this, another  mentioned that the oil sector's decisions on cash utilization in the coming years have far-reaching implications for U.S. drivers and energy investors.As the chart above shows, in the past year, oil executives prioritized boosting stock prices through shareholder rewards rather than investing in new drilling.However, as rising fuel costs contribute to significant inflation, President Biden has called on oil companies to increase capacity, leading some to redirect investments toward expansion.While oil production is rising, production is still below pre-pandemic levels.On top of that, U.S. shale is losing momentum. So far, the Permian is the only basin expected to boost production until it might see peak production in 4Q24 - as I discussed in this   among many others .According to  on August 14  emphasis addedThis brings me to , a stock I've been bullish on for a while. Almost three months ago, I wrote an  titled . Since then, EOG shares have increased 14.4 , beating the market by roughly 13 points.I believe that EOG is poised to reach new all-time highs soon, boosted by the oil bull case. The company also continues to confirm the bull case, as it has deep reserves, efficient production, a healthy balance sheet, and dedication to letting shareholders benefit from this through consistent dividend growth and special dividends.In this article, we'll discuss all of this and more.So, let's get to itIn light of oil price developments, I believe in buying high-quality oil companies with deep reserves and efficient operations.While buying distressed players is certainly an option, I am looking for well-established companies that do not have major M A risks in an environment of high Tier 1 depletion risks. It's why I own Canadian Natural Resources , which has more than 30 years' worth of inventory.It's also why I like EOG.EOG has more than 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. This year, the company is expected to produce 986 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Roughly half of this consists of oil. This gives the company roughly 11 years of high-quality reserves without any new discoveries. That's a solid number, setting it apart from a lot of peers.I also want companies with efficient operations, not companies that will become efficient eventually. Companies with efficient operations tend to be able to generate positive free cash flow even at subdued oil prices.At elevated prices, these companies turn into cash cows.Companies that have healthy balance sheets on top of everything else tend to let shareholders benefit by distributing almost all of their free cash flow, which is great for shareholders.While opinions differ, I prefer companies that use special dividends to get rid of cash. Special dividends keep companies flexible and allow investors to benefit from direct cash flows instead of indirect distributions through buybacks.Headquartered in Houston, Texas, EOG has major operations in the United States and Trinidad and Tobago.In the U.S., EOG is actively investing in five premium basins, a record number for the company. The investments are focused on high-return projects that contribute to lower breakeven costs and higher margins.In the second quarter earnings call, EOG explained that its assets in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo, and South Texas Dorado plays are all delivering positive results.Well productivity and cost performance across the portfolio are meeting or exceeding expectations.Furthermore, continuous investment, development, and innovation are driving consistent execution. Technology and innovation efforts are also lowering well costs and exploration and development costs, contributing to overall cost reduction and emissions reduction goals.For example, oil production saw a 3  year-on-year increase, and total production grew by 5 . Notably, despite the industry's inflation, per unit cash operating costs remained stable compared to the prior-year quarter.Over the past 12 months, the Return on Capital Employed was at an impressive 29 , considering an average WTI oil price of  81 and a Henry Hub natural gas price of approximately  5.Also, using the data below, we see that the company's ROCE is twice as high as it was back in 2014, using the same oil price  slightly higher natural gas prices . This shows that advanced operations have resulted in significant benefits.With regard to my oil comments in the introduction, EOG is as upbeat as I am.During its earnings call, the company made clear that it anticipates continued performance gains supported by strong market fundamentals.For North American natural gas, recent price increases are attributed to reduced drilling and increased demand from power generation and LNG exports.This trend is expected to lead to a balanced supply and demand environment toward the end of the year and into 2024.Hence, the company maintains a positive outlook on the long-term natural gas story, driven by LNG project approvals and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast.The company used the 2Q23 earnings call to announce its intention to return  3.1 billion  4  of its market cap  to shareholders in 2023, representing about 67  of the estimated 2023 cash flow, based on a  75 oil price.This commitment exceeded the target minimum return of 60 .EOG's regular dividend, the cornerstone of its value proposition, currently accounts for the majority of the  3.1 billion cash return to shareholders for the year.The company emphasized its sustainable and growing regular dividend, which has never been cut or suspended, as its first priority for returning cash. The current regular dividend yield is 2.5 .EOG also employed special dividends and share buybacks to provide additional returns to shareholders based on market conditions. These special dividends are visible in the chart below.In the first half of 2023, the company had already deployed over  600 million for opportunistic share repurchases during periods of increased market volatility.Bear in mind that repurchases are opportunistic. In other words, if EOG's shares were to reach highly unfavorable levels, management would likely use special dividends to distribute cash.The company has an A- credit rating, which is one of the best ratings in the industry.If oil prices remain elevated, I do not rule out high single-digit percentage dividend payments.Furthermore, thanks to its efficient operations, deep reserves, healthy balance sheet, and commitment to distributing more than 60  of its free cash flow, EOG shares are doing very well.Over the past three years, EOG shares have returned 251 , outperforming their exploration   production peers, the energy ETF , and the S P 500.Given my view on oil and gas, I expect EOG to keep outperforming its peers and the market.The only reason why I do not own EOG is that I already own multiple oil stocks that account for roughly 20  of my portfolio. If I were to diversify further, EOG would make the cut.In this article, I delved into the dynamic landscape of the energy sector, highlighting the strategic shift of oil companies towards prioritizing shareholder distributions over rapid production growth.EOG, with its extensive reserves, operational efficiency, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends, is one of the best ways to play the bullish oil case.The company's commitment to prioritizing shareholder value has yielded impressive returns, outperforming peers, energy ETFs, and the broader market.As oil dynamics evolve, EOG's prudent approach could likely sustain its outperformance, making it one of my top plays in the industry.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

U.S. Real Estate Sector Fall 2023 Report: Four Quadrant Perspectives,"The apartment sector is starting to feel the effects of both capital market and economic headwinds. Demand has wavered but remains largely positive. However, it has not been strong enough to offset record levels of new apartment deliveries. Capital and liquidity constraints are also negatively affecting both pricing and transaction activity within the sector.Although the apartment sector remains among the favored asset classes for commercial real estate investors, it has not been immune to capital market disruptions and a deceleration in space market fundamentals. Year-over-year, sales volumes have declined by 67  through August. Although the sector continues to benefit from liquidity through government sponsored enterprises  GSEs , potential apartment buyers are still deterred by the rising cost of leverage, particularly at a time when private valuations are challenged.Elevated levels of supply brought to the market over the past two years are beginning to put pressure on rent growth, as demand struggles to keep up with the wave of construction deliveries. Traditionally high-growth markets that have seen over-supply, most notably in the Sunbelt, have seen a significant slow-down in rental rate growth, with some markets turning negative year-over-year. More mature markets in the Midwest and Northeast are leading the country, with growth down only slightly over 2022.Upward pressure in cap rates, IRRs, and exit caps has continued to filter through apartment valuations in the back half of 2023. Data through the middle of 2023 shows that the sector has seen values written down by 8.9  relative to their peak in Q2 of 2022, according to the NCREIF National Property Index  NPI . Slower economic growth projections through the end of 2023 and into 2024 could challenge valuation further, particularly in a higher interest rate environment.The positive news for the sector is that higher required yields, higher cost of debt capital, and reduced availability of construction debt have begun to put downward pressure on supply pipelines. Permits for multifamily units a good indicator of future supply  have declined by 18  through August on a year-over-year basis. Once the current supply is absorbed over the coming years, landlords should have a period with significantly reduced deliveries and increased pricing power.Apartment loans remain mostly attractive to lenders today, given overall still healthy property market fundamentals, but pressure from increasing interest rates has strained valuations, debt service coverage ratios, and other underwriting metrics in recent months. Reduced investment sales activity resulting from capital markets challenges, a reduction in refinancing requests, and tighter underwriting jointly led to a -51  reduction in multifamily lending volume during the first two quarters of 2023 compared to the prior year according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Nonetheless, broad-based lender interest in apartments paired with competitive pricing and enhanced liquidity GSEs continue to make multifamily lending rates the lowest of all property sectors. Insurance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are routinely offering rates near 6  for 55  to 65  loan-to-value  LTV  senior apartment loans secured by average to above-average quality apartments.Apartment REITs have slightly outperformed the REIT index year-to-date in 2023, with coastal focused REITs leading the way. Increasing numbers of new deliveries and slowing cross-state migration have pressured Sunbelt-focused companies, with negative market rent growth reported in some recent updates.On the other hand, limited new supply, continued return to office recovery, and the lack of recession impacts  following higher profile layoffs in the technology sector  have supported the positive, albeit decelerated, fundamentals reported by the coastal REITs. These trends are expected to continue into 2024 and potentially beyond until elevated supply in the Sunbelt is better absorbed. Following modest year-to-date returns, apartment REITs continue to trade near a 15  discount to NAV, which is slightly larger than the average for other sectors.The GSEs continue to be a dominant lender in the multifamily space with  150 billion of approved lending capacity. Combined agency issuance has been constrained by low transaction volumes. While much smaller in scale, multifamily exposure in conduit and single-asset single-borrower  SASB  CMBS is significant at roughly  55 billion outstanding. Loan performance has remained very strong in fixed rate, as the conduit multifamily delinquency rate is at 1.0 , its lowest level in 15 years. Similarly, the agency delinquency rate is only 0.2 .Some weakness is emerging in floating rate SASB loans underwritten at tight debt yields when interest rates were extremely low. Rising rates have resulted in large increases in debt service burdens, cooling prospects for net operating income  NOI  growth, and valuation challenges that have resulted in the SASB multifamily delinquency rate rising to 3.0 . Overall, multifamily remains an in-favor sector within CMBS given historical NOI growth, slowing construction starts, poor single-family affordability, and consumeroriented credit exposure.The hotel sector remains in good shape following its recovery from the pandemic. Occupancy rates are within equilibrium ranges and RevPAR growth on a 12-month trailing basis has continued to show solid improvement. There are emerging signs, however, that the sector is beginning to show signs of slowing. The pace of demand and RevPAR improvements on a 3-month trailing basis have both begun to slow. Declines in both business travel and consumer sentiment will likely dim the outlook for income growth as economic uncertainty and a slower-thananticipated return to office will continue to provide headwinds for the sector.On a positive note, supply-side pressure remains in check and is expected to remain muted. High borrowing costs and a lack of ample funding will conspire to keep development pipelines in check. This should help the sector remain on an even keel despite the growing concern of a recession in the next 12months.Although RevPAR has grown in 2023, its rate of growth has decelerated while hotels face increasing prices for labor, insurance, and other expenses. Consequently, lender appetite for hotel loans has also waned in 2023, with the volume of hotel loans originating during the first half of 2023 down by 20  compared to the first half of 2022 based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Debt funds remain a primary source of capital for hotel financings.Lodging REITs underperformed other property sectors year-to-date due to weaker demand from leisure travelers, partially offset by an acceleration in business and urban hotel demand. Throughout the summer, luxury resorts and leisure destinations saw weaker demand as many travelers chose to vacation abroad, particularly in Europe. This led to lower nightly rates in markets that previously benefited from pentup demand throughout the pandemic. The recovery in corporate travel accelerated with urban hotels narrowing their underperformance relative to leisure properties, driven by increases in group demand. Corporate transient travel remains weaker than expected at this time due to still sluggish return-tooffice trends.Throughout earnings season, lodging REITs delivered underwhelming results as revenue per available room  RevPAR  was negatively impacted by decelerating leisure demand while higher operating expenses  particularly wages resulted in weaker-than-expected profitability. RevPAR in recent months has grown in the 1  to 3  range compared with 2022, which is a meaningful slowdown in growth since the start of the year, reflecting tougher RevPAR comparisons. Lodging REITs are trading at 15  to 20  discounts to NAV estimates, a larger magnitude than what is seen across most other REIT sectors, reflecting the uncertainty that a potential recession may have on both consumer and business travel demand.Despite a slowdown in demand from post-COVID highs, hotel operations have continued to show solid performance with loan performance following suit. The conduit hotel delinquency rate peaked near 20  in July of 2020 and now stands at 4.8 , just 1  higher than the overall conduit delinquency rate. Leisure travel initially spurred a strong recovery in vacation destination markets with business travel recovering in turn. Smith Travel Research reports that RevPAR for the 28 days ending September 15, 2023, is up 10  relative to the same pre-COVID period in 2019. Hotel operators have grown RevPAR by raising average daily rates, while occupancies are lower than four years ago which is especially prevalent in higher-end categories. RevPAR growth appears to be leveling out yearover-year as consumers have mostly burned through excess savings.CMBS issuances in 2020-2021 included very little hotel exposure due to underwriting challenges and investor skepticism. As fundamentals have improved, hotel loan contributions have grown and now stand at 10  of total conduit and over 26  of SASB collateral issued year-to-date, showing that capital is available for better-positioned properties. While the recent macro trends have been supportive, hotel performance is highly correlated to economic growth and would be negatively impacted by recession, warranting a conservative approach to underwriting and a forward-looking credit assessment.The industrial sector remains in good condition, but headwinds to both market fundamentals and investment performance continue to mount. Demand has slowed in 2023, reverting to its pre-pandemic norms, while high levels of new supply have already begun to push vacancy rates upward. Longer term, higher interest rates and more restrictive debt capital will slow the pace of new supply helping steady thesector.Industrial market fundamentals are beginning to moderate, with positive but slowing net absorption, which is more in line with pre-pandemic norms. Year-over-year rent growth is still healthy at 7.7  as of mid-year 2023 but has normalized from a peak of 11.5  a year ago. The national vacancy rate has risen for the fourth consecutive quarter, which will cause rent growth to moderate further into 2024.Industrial occupiers are exercising caution as fears that the current high-interest rate environment will trigger a recession. Weaker retail sales figures and reports of consumers trading down have also forced third-party logistics as well as e-commerce and brick and mortar retailers to rethink their near-term strategies. Consequently, they have pulled back on growing inventories that they had accumulated during 2021 and into 2022.Despite solid fundamentals and income growth, the industrial sector has not been immune to capital market headwinds. High interest rates and restrictive debt capital are putting further downward pressure on valuations, largely due to the still low nominal cap rates, discount rates, and exit cap rates prevalent within the sector. As a result, transaction volume has continued to decline, posting a total of  46.9 billion through the first eight months of 2023, down 53  from last year s pace.Lenders continue to view industrial along with multifamily as a preferred property sector, although the volume of available industrial loans has also suffered because of changing capital market conditions and lower investment sales activity. The volume of industrial loans made during the first half of 2023 declined by 65  versus the same period in 2022 according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Many lenders  relative under-exposure to the property sector, concerns regarding some other property types  particularly office , and reasonably robust industrial demand forecasts have fueled lender appetite for debt secured by core industrial properties. Lenders today frequently offer industrial loan interest rates very near the levels offered for prime multifamily properties, with LTVs commonly up to 60 . Lenders also require less structure  e.g., escrows and letters of credit  for potential future re-tenanting costs at industrial properties than for loans secured by most other property types.Industrial REITs have outperformed the broader REIT index year-to-date. Fundamentals for the sector remain generally healthy but conditions have normalized relative to recent years. Rent growth has moderated with REITs generally expecting 5  to 10  growth for the year in most markets. Southern California has been the most topical market in recent months, as conditions are decelerating faster than elsewhere, causing several REITs to slightly dial back overall rent growth expectations for the year. Key drivers include West Coast port issues and rent fatigue which have dampened demand, especially for larger formatwarehouses.Despite modestly lower rent growth, REITs have beaten earnings expectations and raised guidance for the full year, driven by stronger leasing spreads, lower credit loss, and acquisitions. The outlook for next year is also positive as the supply and demand picture improves thanks to the sharp drop-off in development starts since late 2022. Supported by sizeable, embedded mark-to-market opportunities, the industrial sector is well-positioned to deliver above-average earnings growth in the intermediate term. The industrial sector is trading at a mid-to-high single-digit discount to consensus NAV, which is in line with other REITs.Industrial loans currently carry the lowest delinquency rate within the CMBS universe and continue to be viewed positively, especially relative to office, retail, and hotel exposures. This view is supported by the current economic outlook, space market fundamentals, and availability of capital. The CMBS SASB market provided over  35 billion of floating rate debt to industrial owners from 2020-2022, offering an efficient source of financing for very large portfoliodeals.More recently, the significant increase in floating rates has made these financings relatively unattractive to borrowers, and the pace of SASB industrial issuance has fallen dramatically. One dynamic to watch is the potential for borrowers to refinance existing floating rate loans into new fixed rate loans, given the inverted yield curve and recent tightening in SASB creditspreads.In the conduit space, year-to-date industrial allocations within issuances have grown to three times the historical average, a positive for diversification. Conduit CMBS industrial loans are generally smaller than the large SASB deals and in some instances, exhibit exposure to tertiary locations, less functional layouts, and non-investment grade tenancy  often via sale and lease backs . Because of this, underwriting metrics for conduit industrial loans have typically been more conservative than SASB industrial loans. Overall, historically strong NOI growth, relatively durable cash flows, and positive investor sentiment should benefit the space.The office sector remains vexed by subpar workplace attendance and still weakening market fundamentals. Net absorption continues to decline, and the national vacancy rate is as high as it has been since the early 1990s, when the sector faced a supply overhang due to excess new development. Capital markets have ground to a halt, and lending is scant due to uncertainty in the sector and exposure risk on the part of banks and life companies.Office remains the most challenged property sector today. Headwinds are stemming from both capital and space markets. Fundamentals have eroded further throughout 2023, with nearly every market across the country experiencing negative net absorption and rising vacancy rates. The sector could face additional challenges from slower economic growth that would undermine office-using job growth, which up to this point has been unflagging.Despite stricter return to work policies, office attendance has been stubbornly flat. Physical office occupancy across the top 10 U.S. cities remains well below pre-COVID levels and has not increased materially since reaching a post-pandemic peak in January of approximately 50 , where it still stands as of mid-September. In-office attendance remains highest in sunbelt metros such as Austin and Houston, which are seeing attendance in the 60  range, while San Jose and San Francisco are in the low 40  range.Progress within capital markets remains negligible. Investors are continuing to require higher yields while debt capital remains difficult to find in the best of situations. In many cases, traditional bank and life company lenders are focused on addressing upcoming maturities within their current portfolios, severely limiting the availability of new office financing and forcing some sellers to provide financing to clear office trades. Consequently, transaction volume is down 68  in 2023 on a year-to-date basis through August.Few lenders are willing to finance office properties today, even on the most conservative basis, due to weak property market fundamentals and existing portfolio exposures. Some CMBS conduits will finance office properties that feature a combination of favorable tenancy, longer remaining weighted average lease terms, strong physical utilization of space, healthy rent collection experience, and conformance with emerging design preferences. However, even then capital is quite limited. Certain debt funds have expressed a willingness to provide loans for office properties, although their required yields are typically greater than the properties  existing economics willsupport.Most office financing today involves existing lenders refinancing their own debt or sellers  sometimes banks  providing seller financing in connection with a disposition. The volume of office loans made during the first half of 2023 was down 69  compared with the same period in the prior year, based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, with very few truly new office loans made.Office REITs have had a rollercoaster year but continue to underperform other REIT sectors. The group started the year strong on hopes of peaking interest rates, sold off sharply after the banking turmoil in March, and then rallied following a highprofile office sale in New York City  that featured attractive assumable financing  combined with growing market optimism for a soft landing. Stock market gyrations have been largely detached from fundamentals, which have remained weak throughout the year.Leasing continues to be well below historical levels and REITs have seen occupancy deteriorate steadily. While tenant demand remains muted, the biggest issue for the sector continues to be the availability and cost of debt funding. REITs have been able to refinance maturing debt, but rates are materially higher which has put significant pressure on earnings and has resulted in several dividend cuts. Office REITs trade at a 20  to 30  discount to consensus NAV, reflecting the challenging outlook.Office exposure is facing intense scrutiny as the sector continues to face secular headwinds. Conduit CMBS has historically averaged approximately 30  office exposure, however issuers have responded by limiting office exposure to approximately 20  in recently issued securitizations. Delinquency rates remained remarkably stable throughout the pandemic but have trended up this year from 1.9  to 3.4  for fixed rate conduit transactions. Long term leases, diversified rent rolls, and high underwritten debt service coverage ratios  DSCRs  help to significantly mitigate term default risk. However, refinance risk is elevated given NOI pressure, constrained capital markets, and higher interest rates.Floating rate SASB loans are much more exposed to near-term default risk given the significant increase in short rates and corresponding drop in DSCRs, which has led to several high-profile defaults and pushed the SASB office delinquency rate to 5.8 . Given the difficult refinance environment, CMBS servicers are working with borrowers by providing loan extensions in exchange for fresh equity contributions, cash flow sweeps, and other lender friendly requirements. This approach seeks to improve bondholder outcomes, although it does create timing uncertainty, which is adding to pricing concessions. Recently constructed class A office is performing quite well, exhibiting positive net absorption and significantly higher market rents. Importantly, nearly 50  of conduit CMBS office exposure is considered class A, a fact that is not reflected in highly elevated market risk premiums. Investors that can approach office exposure with a more discerning viewpoint are positioned to benefit from current pricing levels over the longer term.The retail sector, by most accounts, continues to outperform. Consumers have been resolute and market fundamentals are improving, unlike most other sectors at this stage in the real estate cycle. A strong job market and continued income growth have provided momentum, but there are signs that consumers may be starting to waver, which is a concern for larger shopping centers. Grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers will continue to outperform in the current environment but may come under some pressure with the specter of recession in the next 12 months.Retail market fundamentals have remained resilient thus far in 2023, with steady demand, limited store closures, and minimal new supply. The national vacancy rate has fallen to 4.2  and rent growth on a trailing 12-month basis is 3.2  year-to-date, according to CoStar. Fundamentals to date have been supported by strong hiring and wage growth, and a concomitant drawdown in pandemic stimulus-fueledspending.While retail has not been immune to capital market headwinds over the past 12 months, it has outperformed other property sectors on a relative basis according to the NFI-ODCE index. The strong relative outperformance reflects not only solid fundamentals but also the higher nominal valuation metrics coming into this period of repricing. Retail sales volume through August declined by 53  relative to the same period last year, which reflects decreased investor appetite for commercial real estate driven by higher interest rates, as well as a potential slowdown in consumer spending.Investor demand continues to favor well-located, grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers, reflecting strength of the operating fundamentals for that retail format and the perceived resilience of non-discretionary consumer spending in a weakening macroeconomic environment.The outlook for private equity retail remains murky. Despite strong operating fundamentals today, consumer resolve appears to be weakening. High inflation and retailer reports of consumers trading down suggest that spending trends are starting to moderate. This is a key area of concern, particularly across discretionary retail formats such as malls, power centers, and high street properties.Some traditional lenders have shown growing interest in neighborhood and community shopping centers with strong tenancy. Major grocers, creditworthy discounters, and creditworthy home improvement stores with significant remaining lease terms may find receptive lenders, although interest rates for even the highest quality retail properties remain perhaps 10 basis points greater than debt for similarly leveraged multifamily and industrial properties.Debt for high street properties, power centers, and lifestyle centers remains difficult to procure even at more modest leverage levels, and significant loan structure  e.g., escrows and amortization  is often required. Debt for regional malls remains unavailable for all but the very best assets with top operators. Lenders continue to focus heavily on tenant creditworthiness, tenant sales history, remaining weighted-average lease terms, and sponsor quality, with widely disparate loan terms offered.Shopping center REITs have underperformed the broader REIT sector year-to-date, while the performance of mall REITs has been roughly in line. Fundamentals for the retail sector remain healthy, with open-air shopping center REIT portfolios at record occupancy rates and improved pricing power. A modest pick-up in bankruptcy activity, particularly in the shopping center sector, has been worked through successfully. REITs have already made good progress backfilling vacancies, often at 10  to 30  higher rents, which compensates for the downtime and capex associated with re-leasing.The near-term outlook for the sector remains positive as retailer demand for space continues to be strong while there is limited supply on the horizon. However, the impact of a potential deterioration of retail sales due to a weaker economy, softer job market, depleted excess savings, and the resumption of student loan payments remains to be seen. This uncertainty is reflected in valuations with retail REITs trading at discounts of roughly 15  compared with consensus NAVs, a modestly wider discount than is available in other property types.Retail s image has recovered significantly from the pandemic era, fueled by a resilient consumer base, the spending drawdown in excess savings, and a robust jobs market. Store closures have slowed dramatically over the past two years, and the entertainmentoriented transformation of malls has gotten back on track post-COVID. In conjunction with conduit transaction office exposures falling in 2023, retail exposure has increased back towards historical averages at approximately 27 . Interestingly, once out-of-favor malls have grown to 13  of conduit issuance year-to-date relative to 3  in 2022, supported by generally positive sales trends along with conservative underwriting metrics of  2.0x DSCR and sub-50  LTV on average.Maturity stress from loans originated in 2012 and 2013 is still weighing on the conduit retail delinquency rate, which stands at 6.6 . CMBS servicers continue working with retail operators as loans approach maturity by providing loan extensions on performing properties, typically in exchange for fresh equity contributions. This approach seeks to maximize bondholder outcomes by keeping strong operators in place, while avoiding near-term foreclosure at a time when valuations are depressed. That said, note sales have recently been utilized by servicers as a more expeditious resolution strategy. Similar to the hotel sector, retail has benefited from the recent upside in economic activity. However, the health of the consumer and a potential pullback in spending need to be closely monitored for turning points.Homeownership is out of reach for an increasing number of Americans as mortgage rates reached 23-year highs in September and a lack of for-sale inventory persists. The combination of a strong labor market and tight for-sale inventories have bolstered home prices and will likely continue to do so in the coming quarters. Without significant relief in mortgage interest rates, the for-sale inventory is likely to stay low as locked-in owners are discouraged from listing. These factors should support future rent growth for single-family rentals as the gap between rent and ownership costs nears record levels.Consequently, tenant demand for scattered-site single-family rentals and build-for-rent remains strong, with fundamentals supported by demographics, limited supply, and challenged affordability, particularly in the for-purchase market. Capital markets have to-date been supported by growing institutional interest in the space, though upward pressure on cap rates remains evident in the singlefamily rental sector aswell.The decline in bank lending activity has had a large impact on the single-family rental debt market. Developers and institutional investors who own non-stabilized properties now often must seek debt fund capital for their financing needs, which greatly increases their cost of funds. For stabilized singlefamily rental properties, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain the dominant lenders in the market.The single-family rental sector meaningfully outperformed the REIT index thus far in 2023 as it continues to benefit from favorable affordability relative to the single-family-for-purchase market. Higher mortgage rates rising cost of homeownership, tight supply, and accelerating demographic growth are supporting single-family rental landlords  high occupancy, strong pricing power, and low turnover.Recent operational updates from the REITs have been positive and highlighted continued strength in fundamentals, particularly relative to multifamily. Additionally, prior concerns regarding property taxes and other expense items are viewed as manageable and are now better understood. Single-family rental REITs are trading at high-single-digit discounts to consensus NAV estimates, in line with the index.Demand within the sector remains white hot with the North American market experiencing a 32.9  increase in commissioned megawatt hours  MWH  on a year-over-year basis, according to datacenterHawk. Demand in Northern Virginia and Phoenix alone accounted for over half of all data center net absorption over the past 12 months, with the Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City markets also seeing year-over-year growth in excess of 25 . The largest demand drivers include the continuing growth of the cloud and the recent fervor around artificial intelligence , as users begin to deploy space for the training and use of the latest AI models.On the supply side of the market, concerns and uncertainty continue to cloud the outlook. The vacancy rate is now 3.34  and much of that space continues to be in small blocks under 5 MW, leaving little space for larger deployments, which tenants are looking for in the market today. Pricing and rental growth continue to remain strong, driven by the supply and demand fundamentals. Capital markets continue to be challenged by interest rate volatility.Private debt capital remains available for data center properties with long-term leases to investment grade tenants. The very large loan sizes associated with the property sector means that borrowers typically need to work with investment banks to arrange that financing. Funding terms and pricing are quite lenderfriendly today.Data center REITs have outperformed the broader index year-to-date, driven by an optimism that AI will provide significant tailwinds for the sector. Fundamentally, demand and supply in many key markets continue to look more favorable, which has provided an uplift to both rents and pricing. This is evidenced in REIT financial results for in-place portfolios as well as new leasing.Thematically, the stocks have particularly benefited from the positive market narrative around AI brought to the spotlight by impressive financial updates since May, and are further reinforced by positive channel checks indicating incremental data center capacity requirements. From a valuation perspective, data center REITs valuation multiples have been expanding year-to-date with the property type trading at premiums to NAVs and relative to other property types.Tenant demand is robust and leasing for the 20232024 school year outperformed expectations for both occupancy and rate. Tenant demand and rent increases may now be positioned to outperform traditional apartments over the near-term horizon.Despite strong fundamental performance, the student housing sector has not been immune to capital market headwinds. Higher interest rates and borrowing costs have forced many investors to the sidelines. Transaction volume through August totaled just  2.5 billion, representing a decline of 86  over the same period in 2022. We anticipate the same headwinds affecting other sectors to continue to affect capital flows toward the sector until investors have more clarity on the direction of interest rates.Life sciences has seen both capital market and space market fundamentals pull back in 2023. Venture capital funding, a key source of growth for life sciences companies, has become much scarcer during the year. As a result, tenant demand has moderated considerably for lab space, even in top life sciences markets like Boston and San Francisco.The lack of available debt capital has also impacted the sector s performance. Lender appetite for life science construction has especially slowed in 2023, putting many planned projects on hold due to economics that no longer pencil.Long term, fundamentals are likely to be most resilient in the education-centric key life sciences clusters of Boston-Cambridge, the Bay Area, the Raleigh-Durham Research Triangle, the Baltimore-D.C. corridor, and San Diego. We continue to believe that life sciences will remain a favorable sector with investors.Increased supply of life sciences space paired with slowing demand has reduced lender appetite for the sector over the past year. Certain insurance companies and CMBS lenders continue to pursue life sciences property financing on a conservative basis but are focusing heavily on weighted average remaining lease terms and business plans for the properties. Mortgage capital has clearly become scarcer for the property sector.Life sciences focused REITs underperformed broader index year-to-date, primarily due to supply concerns in many key markets. The amount of space under construction, in planning, or available in the sublease market has caused consternation, particularly as leasing activity and NOI growth have softened relative to last year.A slower demand environment appears at least partially impacted by incremental concerns surrounding the underlying tenant funding backdrop, as venture capital funds have been more sluggish in capital deployment and tenant IPO activity has also remained light. Additionally, as it relates to valuations, REITs with high life sciences exposure have seen meaningful contraction in valuation multiples and the respective stocks are trading at meaningful discountsto NAV.Life sciences properties represent a bright spot in the CMBS office landscape and have risen in prevalence, especially in the SASB market. Investors are currently requiring elevated risk premiums to compensate for anticipated office stress.

Standard Lithium: A North American Lithium Play Still Far Out From First Revenues,"Investing in lithium has been on many investors' minds in the last few years as the necessity of it in the transition to renewables and EV vehicles is great. Lithium batteries have long been aBut there is a lack of revenues from the company as it is still in its early stages of operations. There has been solid progress on the back of the South West Arkansas lithium project commencing drilling programs. What has investors interested in SLI is the fact that they seem to have some ofThere is a notable and widespread effort to secure rare earth minerals supplies of China, particularly in Western countries. As industries increasingly shift towards renewable energy sources and the production of electric vehicles  EVs , the demand for various critical materials, including lithium, has surged. However, China still holds a dominant position in the lithium market, which poses a significant concern for Western countries due to the risk of overreliance on a single source.The transition towards renewable energy and EV has driven a substantial increase in the demand for lithium, a crucial component for battery production. With the EV growing at a rapid pace, the demand for lithium is expected to continue its upward trajectory, potentially leading to supply constraints and subsequent upswings in the commodity's price.In recent years, we have witnessed periodic fluctuations in the commodity price due to shifts in supply and demand dynamics. As the demand for EVs and renewable energy technologies continues to outpace initial expectations, the pressure on the lithium supply chain intensifies. This upward pressure on the commodity price may create challenges for industries reliant on lithium, as higher input costs could impact profitability and supply chain stability.Diversifying the sources of rare earth minerals, including lithium, has emerged as a strategic imperative for Western countries. Efforts to explore and develop sources of these critical materials are gaining momentum as a means to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly China. Furthermore, investing in recycling technologies and sustainable mining practices could play a pivotal role in mitigating supply constraints and alleviating the potential impact of future commodity price fluctuations.SLI has not yet disclosed the specific capital expenditure required for the construction of the commercial lithium plant or the resources allocated to support the Direct Lithium Extraction  DLE  technology. As such, there remains uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of this ambitious initiative. In light of this, it is reasonable to consider that the company might opt to raise additional capital through stock dilution to fund this critical project.Stock dilution, while a viable funding option, comes with its own set of considerations. It involves issuing new shares to raise capital, which in turn dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. As a result, the increased number of outstanding shares could potentially impact earnings per share and lead to a temporary downward pressure on the stock price.Where I think a lot of the priority for investors should be is the financial state of the business. Maintaining a strict capital allocation program is key here to properly execute the business plan and not risk having to significantly dilute shares to raise capital.The company has a broad set of projects that they manage and are developing. The total operating income for 2022 was a negative  30.5 million and the TTM has been improved to a negative  24 million instead. Looking at the cash position that SLI has right now it's sitting at  67 million as of the . This is creating a pretty scary situation I think as the operating income indicates that SLI has around 2 - 3 years left of funds only. So securing more capital from investors will be a key priority. A failure in doing so will likely send the stock price down.The hopes for SLI seem quite great given the market cap of  800 million without actually having generated any revenues yet. What I think is supporting the valuation is the fact that lithium prices are likely to grow substantially over the coming years and what SLI might be able to produce today will likely be far higher in 2030 for example. That is also creating a difficult situation for analysts as assessing the true value of SLI is very difficult. I tend to lean on a more risk-cautious side and don t want to overextend myself and make this company out to be a strong buy. Until we see profitability I wouldn't be an investor. It's an approach I bring with me to all investment opportunities and SLI is no different. But for the more risk-tolerant investor in 20 years SLI if they have successfully executed their plans will have likely produced a fantastic ROI.Investing into lithium has been a very hot topic and lithium battery makers have been getting a lot of hype as a result. Sometimes going with the more established companies is better or the miners produce the raw materials. Here investors are seeing SLI as such an opportunity.The market cap sits very high at  800 million without any revenue being generated yet. This is creating a pretty situation where investing based on fundamentals is impossible. SLI is a speculative investment I think and one that I would rather rate as a hold than buy for now.

Ciena: Path To Recovery But Undervalued By The Market,"Ciena Corporation  is a prominent global provider of networking solutions and services. Specializing in high-capacity network equipment, software, and services, CIEN plays a pivotal role in enabling high-speed data and communications networks for telecommunications providers, enterprises, data centers, and government agenciesCIEN's exceptional performance can be attributed to several pivotal factors. This includes the successful conversion of a substantial backlog stemming from supply constraints. Furthermore, CIEN's diverse revenue streams, spanning various sectors, underscored its broad market appeal.During recent discussions, CIEN emphasized the enduring demand for bandwidth fueled by transformative technologies, positioning the company to seize expanding market opportunities. Notably, CIEN's strong fundamentals stand out when compared to its peers, making it undervalued in comparison. Based on these considerations, I recommend a buy rating for CIEN.Since 2020, CIEN's revenue growth has been stagnant. The company encountered challenges mainly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted global supply chains and impacted customer demand. Furthermore, these supply chain disruptions affected the delivery of products. The competitive dynamics of the networking and telecommunications industry also played a role, with CIEN manoeuvring through this landscape. The company's 6-year revenue CAGR is approximately 4 . Regarding gross margins, CIEN has demonstrated stability, maintaining an average of approximately 44 . This consistency indicates that the company has been able to effectively manage its costs relative to its revenue over the period in question. Maintaining a consistent gross margin is a testament to CIEN's operational efficiency and effective cost management strategies.In its recent quarterly results, CIEN announced a robust revenue of  billion, reflecting a 23  year-over-year growth. This surge can be attributed to Ciena's substantial backlog from prior periods, a result of supply constraints. As the company converted this backlog into revenue, it also led to notable market share gains. The underlying demand drivers for their business continued to be strong, and there was a progressive alignment between supply and demand.Furthermore, CIEN's revenue streams, diversified across cloud providers, service providers, and non-telco entities, indicate a broad market appeal. The significant growth in direct cloud provider revenue of 39  and the diversification strategy reduce the company's dependency on any single segment, ensuring multiple avenues for growth. This adaptability and ability to tap into various market segments are crucial for navigating future market shifts and uncertainties.During the earnings call, CIEN emphasized the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth, driven by technological advancements such as 5G, cloud computing, and AI. This trend is not a fleeting one  it's expected to continue, positioning CIEN to further capitalize on this demand in the coming years. The ever-increasing need for bandwidth, combined with the broader technological trends, suggests a growing market for CIEN's solutions. As industries continue to digitize and rely more on cloud and AI solutions, this demand is set to rise, offering CIEN a vast landscape of opportunities.Strategically, CIEN's expansion with a major U.S. Tier 1 customer is poised to be a key driver of future revenue growth. Tier 1 customers are pivotal for businesses as they contribute substantial revenue, as evidenced by one that nearly reached the 10  threshold.This partnership, combined with the company's forward-thinking approach to sustainability, enhances its brand image and appeal. As the global emphasis on sustainability and environmental responsibility grows, CIEN's commitments in this area can serve as a significant advantage, ensuring compliance with future environmental regulations and appealing to eco-conscious partners and customers. Overall, CIEN s performance, combined with the insights from the earnings call, paints a promising picture of its outlook. The company seems well-positioned to capitalize on future market opportunities, driven by consistent bandwidth demand, strategic partnerships, and a diversified customer base.Based on my DCF model, I forecast CIEN's fair value to be  48.02. This valuation is underpinned by the company's impressive recent quarterly performance, which has benefited from the alleviation of supply constraints. Furthermore, the escalating demand for bandwidth, propelled by technological innovations, bodes well for future revenue growth, especially as industries increasingly transition to digital platforms and lean heavily on cloud and AI solutions. Additionally, CIEN's strategic partnership with a prominent Tier 1 service provider further solidifies its outlook for revenue expansion.Among the peers considered in this comparison are F5  and Extreme Networks . These peers exhibit a median forward P E multiple of 13.4x, along with a median expected revenue growth rate of approximately 10  for the next twelve months  NTM  and a Debt-to-Equity  D E  ratio of 119 .Now, shifting our focus to CIEN, its forward P E also stands at 13.4x. Furthermore, CIEN boasts an NTM revenue growth rate of   9  and maintains a D E ratio of 54 . While CIEN's NTM revenue growth rate aligns with the peer s median, it notably features a lower D E ratio. This leads me to believe that its forward P E multiple appears undervalued, and I expect its valuation to trend towards the peer s higher end of 14.6x. Using the 14.6x P E, the implied upside is 14 . Therefore, I recommend a buy rating for CIEN.One potential downside risk is that the current robust revenue growth, fueled by increasing demand and the alleviation of supply chain constraints, may prove to be short-lived and not indicative of a sustainable long-term competitive advantage, as CIEN believes. Another downside risk could be that the expansion with a major Tier 1 service provider may not yield as much market share or revenue as anticipated.In conclusion, CIEN's recent quarterly results reflect its strength in various aspects. The significant backlog resulting from supply constraints has contributed to its robust performance. Additionally, the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth, driven by technological advancements, positions CIEN well for the future. As industries increasingly embrace digitalization and rely on cloud and AI solutions, this demand is expected to continue rising.CIEN's diversified revenue streams reduce its reliance on any single segment, ensuring multiple growth opportunities. The strategic expansion with a major service provider not only strengthens its position for future revenue growth but further establishes its position to become a market leader.Moreover, the undervaluation of CIEN's valuation, which suggests an expected trend toward the peer s higher end, supports a buy rating for CIEN. These combined factors create a favourable outlook for the company's future prospects.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

TORM: The Company Has Strong Financials And Market Outlook For H2 2023,"Figure 1   TRMD s leverage conditionTo support the company s capability of higher growth and shareholder returns, it is worth noting that TORM has reached its highest free cash flow in recent years. The company s cash from operations surged to circa  820 million in TTM versus  502 million at the end of 2022, which aligned with  393 million of capital spending resulting in approximately  427 million of free cash flow. This improvement demonstrates the management s capability of generating stable distributions even in times of higher commodity prices  see Figure 2 . Moreover, TORM is going to pay a dividend payment of  1.5 per share, and based on their 82,500,000 outstanding shares, it will lead to approximately  124 million of distribution payment, which is easily self-funded by their free cash flow.Figure 2   TRMD s free cash flow  in millionsNotwithstanding a healthy financial position, the company expects to generate lower earnings at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter. In other words, by mid-August, they covered 74  of the third quarter at  30,534 per day, which shows lower rates than the second quarter  as a result of refinery maintenance, product stock draws and slightly lower demand for products.  However , we expect the markets to recover, and we expect a stronger fourth quarter.  The Figure 3 -After analyzing TORM s cash and leverage conditions, we realize that the company is in a healthy position to perform well even in periods of volatile commodity prices. Albeit the management declined their EBITDA generation  from  750-1,100 million for the end of 2023 due to the current fleet size, including published acquisitions and divestments of vessels, their stock valuation is still undervalued. As Figure 4 demonstrates, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. It is worth mentioning that during the last five years, the company s net debt level grew by 4.7  on average. However, as they have generated a good amount of free cash flow in the first half of 2023, their net debt level might decrease more if the management decided to direct the free cash flow to pay back its net debt.Figure 4   TRMD stock valuationIt is crucial to note that a high portion of TORM s revenue is from its product tanker fleet. As a result, even small volatility in supply and demand in this market and their impact on freight rates may significantly affect the company s cash flows and operations. Moreover, TRMD employs the majority of its vessels on spot voyage charters on short-term charters. As a result, it generates a significant portion of its revenues from the spot market. Therefore, the company needs to receive profitable spot charters, while the spot market is too volatile. Therefore, a sudden decrease in spot charter rates may adversely affect the company s profitability and ability to meet its obligations.OPEC  announcement regarding production cuts and its impact on higher commodity and refined products prices caused TORM stock price decline in the previous months. However, TORM s strong financial condition and stability protect the company from the volatility of commodity prices to a great extent. In addition, Europe s lower stockpile from their average levels and higher seasonality demand will bring upside to the product tanker market in the second half of 2023. Ultimately, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. When all is said and done, I believe that TORM stock is still a valuable investment decision.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Federal Reserve likely has more work to do, Dallas Fed's Lorie Logan says","The significantly lower inflation in recent months is encouraging. But lower inflation isn t necessarily low-enough inflation,  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday in a speech..That means that Federal Reserve officials have to ask whether its current policy rateWhile the headline monthly inflation rate has been at  2.5  in the past couple of months, other measures that strip out volatile food and energy prices, show a higher level. The average core inflation rate over the past three months was 2.9  and the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation rate was 2.8  during that period.  These numbers indicate it is too soon to confidently say inflation will trend to 2  in a timely way,  Logan said.Similar to the moderating inflation, labor market conditions also show signs of a better balance in supply and demand. Still, the U.S. economy is adding, on average,  150K jobs per month, exceeding the number of workers entering the labor force.If stronger economic activity continues, it could lead to a resurgence in inflation,  Logan said. At the same time, she urged policymakers to proceed with caution.Tighter financial conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC. And there are risks to doing both too little and too much,  she said. Strong July economic data could be a blip.The Federal Open Market Committee skipped a rate increase in July,  and another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month.  But the Fed will be on watch to see if inflation resurges and use its tools as needed.The FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand, and we must not hesitate to use it as necessary. But we must also gather the necessary information to use our tools well,  she said.",57,2023-09-07T19:01:49.000-04:00
Microchip Technology: Business To Bite The Bullet For Weak H2 2024,"I am recommending a hold rating for Microchip Technology , as I expect the near-term  2H24  quarters to be very weak performing. The weak performance will certainly impact share price sentiment, especially if the downcycle impact isEmbedded control solutions, such as microcontrollers and memory products, are among MCHP's many specialties. After merging with Microsemi in 2018, MCHP was able to significantly increase its product offerings and market share. Because of this merger, MCHP's revenue jumped from around  3.4 billion before the merger to  8.4 billion in FY23, aMCHP saw a 17  increase in revenue in , totaling  2.29 billion. The company also reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 68.4  and non-GAAP EPS of  1.64. By division, MCHP's sales increased by 24  in the MCU sector to  1.31 billion, by 20  in the Analog sector to  695 million, and by -13  in the Others sector to  281 million.Based on my outlook on the business, I believe the business is at best fair valued in the near term. I am modeling a very generous assumption for FY24  flattish growth , giving MCHP the benefit that the bulk of normalization impact will come in 2H24. Suppose 2H24 negative decline nets off the positive 1H24 growth, I believe the stock is worth  75 at 13x forward PE. MCHP is currently trading at 13x forward PE, which I expect to remain at this level as the market should already be expecting a decline in the near term  management is effectively communicating to the investing community . However, I would note that the stock could see further downside if the normalization impact is a lot larger than what I expected  this is hard to quantify .MCHP is returning to a more typical supply and demand environment after several quarters of a robust backlog for microcontrollers, which served as a cushion during a period of slowing macroeconomic conditions. This means that deliveries will closely mirror consumer needs. Since shipments are currently adjusting to the lower demand in the market, I am pessimistic about the near future. In addition, many of MCHP's clients across different application sectors are sitting on unusually high stockpiles  refer to . As a result of all of these factors working together, I see MCHP in a situation where cyclical demand is low, customer inventory levels are high and is going to comp against an exceptionally successful period in the past few quarters. Also, with such strong and fast growth over the past few quarters, there is reason to believe that the downturn will be more severe than normal. If events play out as I expect, it could have a negative impact on investor sentiment in the second half of 2024.My belief above can be well inferred and seen in the 1Q24 results. In early June, management noticed a gradual decline in performance due to weaker-than-anticipated growth in China, the automotive and industrial sectors, and Europe. In line with their comments, management has provided forward guidance of a 1  sequential decline for 2Q24 and an even larger than seasonal sequential decline for 3Q24. Further confirmation of near-term weakness can be seen from the  that management attended. Note that the date of the conference is September 6, which means management already has 2 months' worth of data for 2Q24. At the conference, management restated their previous comments about the gloomy short-term demand outlook, pointing to the continuing slowdown in China and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. They also mentioned how customers still wanted to be pushed back, bookings were slow, and lead times were becoming more typical. Notably, management also reaffirmed that the December quarter is predicted to see a larger drop in revenue than is typical for the period. With this much information in the bag, I believe it is wise to avoid this incoming freight train and wait for a better time before investing.If you're one of the many investors betting on MCHP's ability to raise prices to compensate for a drop in volume, you might like to know that the company has been doing just that for the past few years. Management indicated at the tech conference that future prices may remain relatively unchanged. However, there are many knobs that management can turn, so I anticipate a smaller decline in earnings than revenue. Employee bonuses, which have been on an upward trend, were cited as a potential source of savings if the economic climate were to worsen.I think it is inevitable that revenue and earnings will fall from here. The potential upside risk is that the entire economy goes into a massive bull run for whatever reason, thereby driving up underlying demand. This would certainly push out the downcycle, leading to positive stock price momentum in the near term.In conclusion, I recommend a hold rating for MCHP due to my pessimistic outlook for its near-term performance in the second half of 2024. The company, which specializes in embedded control solutions, experienced a significant revenue increase after its merger with Microsemi in 2018 but is now facing challenges as it transitions to a more typical supply and demand environment. With lower demand in the market and many of MCHP's clients holding high levels of inventory, the company is likely to encounter a more severe downturn compared to typical cycles. Management's guidance and comments confirm this outlook.While there is a potential upside risk if the overall economy experiences a significant upturn, driving increased demand, I advise potential investors to stay on the sidelines for now and wait for more information on the depth of the downturn before considering investment.

"Pioneer Natural Resources: Gushing Cash, Selling Put Options Optimal","Pioneer Natural Resources  has been on a tear lately.Up more than 34  since mid-March, the mid-sized Oil   Gas production company has surged in price on the back of two impressive earnings reports, in addition to a resurgent underlying oil marketWhile we like the company and believe that management has done a good job steering the ship, the stock has gotten more expensive relative to itself historically, as well as against market peers.That's why, at the present moment, we think that selling put options on PXD stock is the most optimal way to trade this company.Selling puts allows investors to generate immediate income and have lower-volatility exposure to the stock, while retaining the opportunity to scoop up shares if they dip in price too precipitously.Today, we'll take a deeper look intoLet's dive in.As always, let's begin with the company's Financial Results.As we just mentioned, PXD recently reported a few solid quarters of earnings.Revenue fell earlier this year as 2022's hot oil market has cooled, but the company has continued to crank out estimate-beating EPS for the last several quartersIn Q1, PXD produced  5.21 in EPS vs. an estimate of  4.98.In Q2, they beat again, with reporting EPS of 4.49  25 cents above estimates.Interestingly, this performance came at a time of broader market uncertainty.In short, PXD outperformed in what was ostensibly a poor market for oil and its derivatives  here's what PXD management themselves about their end market opportunity for the first half of 2023While the company has outperformed expectations, which is a sign of solid management, cash conversion, and drilling efficiency, the company hasn't been immune to the slowdown.Zooming out, nominally, PXD's TTM revenue has fallen, and Q2 YoY revenue was down more than 33 . This dip has impacted cash flow, causing a noticeable dip in TTM FCF profitabilityWhile the outperformance is nice, there's only so many levers an oil company can pull when the market is fighting you.Time for some good news.Since PXD's last report, oil has picked back up in price, on the back of increased demand and continued supply snarls from the Ukraine Russia situation.Since the end of June, the liquid commodity has rallied more than 37Record demand and supply issues have led to , which bodes well for producers.Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration had the following to sayThis ongoing supply, demand, and inventory situation has led to a surge in oil stocks across the board, PXD included, as the outlook of  higher for longer  should lead to continued opportunities, especially for larger, competent drillersHowever, this has caused us some concern around the valuation.Nominally, many would call PXD 'cheap'. The company trades at 2.6x Revenue, 11x free cash flow, and sports net margins in the mid 20 'sHowever, as you can see from the graph above, PXD has gotten more expensive as of late. The company's sales multiple has expanded above the midpoint of the linear regression, and FCF is beginning to look uncompetitive with other oil peers, especially on the crucial FCF multipleTrading at 5.5x CF, the company is no longer a value gem  it's in the middle of the pack.This is something that Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system agrees with, as PXD is currently rated a 'D'Thus, when taken together, it's clear that PXD is a well-run company with significant opportunities ahead of it, as oil continues to rally and business conditions improve. However, the stock isn't a compelling value, and the dividend, at 2.06 , is quite low.What's the best way to trade itIn our view, the best way to take advantage of PXD is by using the stock as a solid underlying platform for selling put options.In case you're unaware, when you sell a put option, you're agreeing to buy the stock at a given price  the strike price , if the stock price finishes under the strike price.In return for the obligation of doing so, you earn a cash premium.Think of it like selling insurance on a stock - the stock goes up, you keep the cash. The stock goes sideways, you keep the cash. The stock goes down precipitously, you get to buy up shares at a significantly lower breakeven point vs. today's market.This solves our income dilemma, and our valuation dilemma, as a lower entry point would likely lead to a more attractive margin of safety.As a result, we like the December 15th,  215 strike put optionsThey're currently trading at  4.40, which represents a cash-on-cash return of 2.09 , or 9.6  annualized.With a 78  probability of worthlessness by option expiry, they seem like a great win-win way to play the stock.As always, there are some risks associated with a trade like this - chief among them the fact that the company is expected to report earnings on November 7th.This is before our option expires, and even if the stock does end up beating expectations, you never know how the market will  to those numbers.This risk profile is no different than simply owning the shares outright, but it's important to mention that put sellers, in some cases, may be forced to buy PXD stock above market depending on how the next 74 days go.All in all, we like the outlook for PXD, but we're not in love with the company's capital return policies or the mixed expensive valuation.Thus, we think selling put options is the best win-win to play the stock - either a solid cash premium earned, or a much better entry point into this medium term winner.If you enjoyed this article, be sure to share it with a friend who may also appreciate it.Cheers   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy Teladoc: AI Will Likely Spur Healthcare Deflation,"The first step in my investment process is to identify secular trends.

The four largest economies, the United States, European Union, China and Japan areAnother secular trend, Artificial Intelligence, is the likely cure for rising healthcare costs. In testing AI diagnostic platforms, we are seeing AI significantly outperform doctors in diagnosis and prescribing treatment plans. Integrating AI with traditional medicine, will be the key to getting AI's full benefits. stands to be a leader in utilizing AI in bringing down healthcare costs. Its expansive data and reach, combined with AI, will make it aTeladoc shares are my top pick for best AI investment of the next year in general and in healthcare specifically. It is vital that Teladoc, and others, succeed in bringing deflation to the healthcare system. I think they will.There are three core problems in healthcare that are driving up prices.Healthcare inflation has outpaced the general consumer price index in the past four decades since the healthcare system was shifted away from non-profits in the 1980s.According to a  review of CPI data, Even if we had more non-profits, it still would not change the equation much. We need a solution that supersedes the more egregious supply and demand imbalances that are only getting worse. In addition, organizations need room to lower prices while roughly maintaining profits, i.e. higher margins.Implementation of AI could be a large part of the solutions. generative AI has the potential, and likelihood, of unleashing the next wave of productivity. I have described this to various professionals seeking input that the easiest way to think of AI is as a super assistant.Consider what it will be like in virtually any industry having ready answers and much of the grunt work done for you. Bankers can underwrite faster, writers can edit faster, doctors can diagnose faster and with greater accuracy.According to McKinsey, AI could reduce annual healthcare costs by a quarter trillion dollars per year imminently. I think over time that number becomes dramatically bigger with implementation and improvements to the process.Consider that the U.S. Federal Deficit sits at about  1.4 trillion right now. If AI can help reduce that, it will be incorporated over time.Here I will note that the train has already left the station. About two years ago, my then 93 year-old grandmother was rehabbing a broken hip. While still in the hospital, her rehabilitative nurse's  a traveling nurse  other core job was to incorporate AI into the processes at a large local hospital network.AI is coming to healthcare.Maybe the biggest benefit of AI for healthcare will be taking various data, such as symptoms, health history, genetics, diet, etc... and making the diagnosis and treatment plan process less time consuming. This will help with the labor shortage and potentially help hold the line on what is an out of control wage structure in nursing that has developed over the past decade.Here's an example, There are more uses of course from scheduling to information management to treatment coordination across different disciplines for folks treating multiple issues. This is exactly what medical systems and providers need to bring total spend down while maintaining margins high enough to support their profits.McKinsey goes on to suggest that the quarter trillion in imminent savings, with better adoption, could unlock nearly a trillion in savings per annum eventually. As Boomers retire and go on Medicare, not only will savings spurred by AI be helpful, it will be necessary to prevent the destruction of an already overburdened and too expensive system.There's no shortage of articles detailing the many ways that AI can assist in healthcare and help bring costs down dramatically. I invite you to search and read before being incredulous in the comments section that we can see healthcare deflation soon.Another angle that almost no one is considering for healthcare is the current litigation risk that doctors face.In today's society, litigation risk is so higher, that doctors are pushed to make the most minimalistic diagnosis and least intrusive treatment plan possible. So, it is not always that doctors don't have a good idea of what to do, but rather, they take the path least risky for themselves and their hospitals.If the use of AI becomes a standard in healthcare, it can be used to mitigate litigation risks. This is a massive upgrade to the efficiency of the healthcare system just on diagnosing and prescribing in fewer steps.Ultimately, the various ways that AI helps create deflation in healthcare will benefit both consumers and providers.Over the past decade, we have seen all of the major tech companies push into healthcare. It was big news when Amazon  then led by Jeff Bezos formed a coalition to find solutions for healthcare. Today, it is all of the big tech players.Teladoc and Microsoft Corporation  have been partners since Covid. They recently expanded their  even more. So much so, that I will make my first comment on the stock since the opening paragraphs. I think Teladoc is a potential takeover target for Microsoft if the government allows it. Either way, the integrations in their systems are very supportive for Teladoc.What McKinsey talked about above is the next step in Teladoc's use of Microsoft technology. The new collaboration will see Microsoft's Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services and the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience integrated into Teladoc's systems.Teladoc expects a significant reduction in administrative work for doctors, nurses and systems. This is a margin expander for Teladoc. It is also an attraction for more hospitals, especially those not in large networks, to incorporate Teladoc.Already Teladoc does work for half of the Fortune 500, I can see their platform incorporating many more Russell 300 companies who look to manage their healthcare expenses.Consider what happens when Teladoc has doctors start using AI across the board versus just at a handful of top hospitals and nurses have such clear treatment plans that their work becomes more efficient. That's another driver for margins and sales.I think the most important financial numbers are the revenue and EBITDA jumps of the past yearThat's a big jump. Remember, Teladoc serves about half of the Fortune 500 companies, so they are no start up.While the company has had impressive growth, investors have been unhappy with profits. Well, that's been changing fast. Much like Zuckerberg's  year of efficiency  at  Meta Platforms, Inc. , Teladoc is improving margins, a shade over 70  in Q2. AI is a part of that and it's just getting started.I would also point to the international opportunity for Teladoc, which I think will be bigger than U.S. revenues at some point.That's 28  year-over-year international growth versus about 8  in the U.S. At that pace Teladoc would have a billion dollars in revenues internationally in a decade. Presuming U.S. growth slows somewhat, U.S. revenues will be about a billion in a decade as well. That's a spicey AI meatball at 70  or even 60  marginsThere will certainly be competition for Teladoc. The one that got the most attention recently was Amazon. At this point though, Amazon is far behind and deploying a system that is more direct to consumer.Amazon is not racing to get into hospitals right now. I am sure that will change at some point, but Teladoc has a significant head start.I also see Amazon as a bigger player in attracting small companies initially. In particular very small companies that use the Amazon platform for sales. That's where they have inroads already. In addition, I'm sure there's some type of  urgent care benefit  for Prime Members coming that might be tied into Amazon Pharmacy. Simply put, different animal than Teladoc.The cap on Teladoc's growth seems to be pretty far into the future at this point. We will see what the largest healthcare networks do. I suspect many will contract Teladoc and Microsoft for tech support while deploying private labeled systems as building from scratch is no easy chore when cost is considered. We'll see.I have shown simple charts in recent articles to get folks more comfortable with technical analysis. The easiest short cut is to use RSI over longer time frames to find oversold and overbought conditions to ramp up research and decision making  investors R D .Here's Teladoc on a monthly chartWhat you can see is that the stock has  round tripped  back to 5-year lows. You can also sort of see that monthly RSI is oversold. Here's a close upYou can see that recently RSI has just started to turn up from absolute oversold. if you believe in the fundamental story, then it is clearly in buy the dips territory.Let's switch over the weekly chart which measures at the end of each week instead of each month.The first thing that should jump out at you is the long basing period for TDOC. That's a sign of an impending rise if the business continues to do well.Next is that weekly RSI is on a pullback, which has to do with a generally weak market this month, but also the Amazon news, that I don't think really matters, but that retail chasers did.Next, look left. Way on the far left is the volume weighted interest. There is a lot of interest in this stock down at these price levels. Check your favorite 13F source and you'll see bigger buyers drifting in.Teladoc is set up for a big gain at some point. There's very little resistance for a price jump to climb well over  100 per share in the next few years. Big resistance first appears around  130 per share, again, look left.While there will be competition for AI applications in healthcare, Teladoc's first mover advantage and scale give it an edge. In addition, having Microsoft at its back, plus the ability to incorporate other technology as needed, I believe gives Teladoc a margin of safety from these price levels.Members are also selling cash-secured puts at different expiration dates and strike prices. By selling puts I am essentially setting limit prices below today's price and collecting premium. The premiums so far have been far above most dividend stocks.

Inflation Is Rapidly Receding - Except For Energy Prices,"The two major inflation indicators released last week were a bit  hotter  than expected, but that was mostly due to energy price increases. On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced that the Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 0.6  in August and 3.7  in the past 12 months, butVolatile food prices doubled August s 0.3  overall gains at 0.6 , but energy prices surged 5.6  and gasoline prices rose by double digits,  10.5 . The good news is that owners  equivalent rent rose only 0.3 , and 7.3  in the past 12 months, so it appears that shelter costs are finally moderating somewhat.Since higher energy prices are the major reason the CPI rose in August, I do not expect the Fed to raise rates at its forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  next week.On Thursday, the Labor Department announced that the Producer Price Index  PPI  rose 0.7  in August, substantially higher than the analysts  consensus estimate of 0.4 , but in the past 12 months, the PPI has risen just 1.6 , well below the Fed s 2  target rate.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI rose 0.2  in August and 2.2  in the past 12 months. Wholesale gasoline prices surged a whopping 20  in August, and overall wholesale energy prices rose by 10.5 . Meanwhile, wholesale food prices declined 0.5 .The other good news was that wholesale service costs only rose 0.2  in August, down from 0.5  in July.One other major report came out on Thursday, when the Commerce Department announced that Retail Sales rose 0.6  in August, which was much better than the economists  consensus estimate of a 0.1  increase.Excluding gas station sales, however, retail sales rose only 0.2 , so retail sales were also warped by rising energy prices. Also, July s strong retail sales gain was revised down to a 0.5  gain  from 0.7 .After the retail sales report and inflation indicators came out, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter GDP estimate to a  4.9  annual pace, down from its previous estimate of a  5.6  annual pace.The other big news last week was that the UAW agreed to strike last Friday, which could push the jobless rate above 4  for September. The UAW lowered its demand for a 40  pay increase over the next few years to 36 , but that remains too high for the Big 3.UAW President Shawn Fain repeated his mantra that  record profits mean record contracts.  The UAW has never gone on strike with all of the Big 3, so the real winner in this fight could be Mexico, which will now likely generate more vehicle production.In theory, a short strike   say two weeks or so   could help the Big 3 tighten their inventories and stop the excessive discounting of their massive inventories.At the end of August, Stellantis   Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep  had a 74-day inventory of vehicles, Ford  had a 64-day supply and GM  had a 50-day supply.  The industry average is 38 days.Meanwhile, the UAW is prepared to expand its strike locations, depending on how the bargaining progresses. UAW President Fain said,  This strategy will keep the companies guessing. It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining. And if we need to go all out, we will. Everything is on the table.  But any long strike would mostly help Mexico.On Friday, President Biden called on the Big 3 to share more of their profits with the UAW. Specifically, he said,  Auto companies have seen record profits, including in the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of UAW workers. Those record profits have not been shared fairly, in my view, with those workers.It will be interesting to see how the Big 3 respond, since they are not making money on their EVs, which the Biden Administration is mandating they make. Something has to give, so I suspect the Biden Administration just threw a big wrench into the UAW negotiations.s Editorial Board issued a scathing weekend opinion piece titled,  A UAW Strike Made in Washington,  subtitled   The underlying cause of the auto walkout is the Biden Administration s forced electric-vehicle transition.In addition to Mexico profiting from this strike, since it is making the Ford Mach-e and Chevrolet Equinox EVs, Tesla  is also a winner in the EV wars.The painful truth is that until the Big 3 can make money on EVs, the UAW is losing leverage. Since the Biden Administration is forcing the Big 3 to make unprofitable EVs, the UAW strike may be long and painful for all parties.Compounding the problem of the mandated EV production   becoming a massive glut   the had an interesting article entitled  The EV car crash is a warning for Europe s industrial transition.Essentially, this FT article discussed how the Munich Motor Show was dominated by Chinese brands, which offered double the EV models they offered in 2021.FT also discussed how China is selling quality EVs and is ahead of its European rivals, so as the EV transition continues, European manufacturers risk being left behind.There is no doubt that Chinese EVs have a big price advantage and will continue to capture market share, especially for low-priced EVs. I should also add that Tesla is exporting many of its Model 3 EVs, made in Shanghai with LFP batteries, to China to continue to capture market share.In the wake of the G20 meeting, there is also talk that Saudi Arabia wants to push crude oil prices up to  100 per barrel. Right now, global supply and demand are very fragile and any disruption, such as a Russian pipeline break or a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, could disrupt crude oil production and send crude oil prices up to  100. I should add that Arab light crude came close  100 per barrel last week.After Germany s August wind power auction only offered to develop 1.4 gigawatts of electricity, down from 1.6 gigawatts at its July auction, Britain failed to attract any bids on its latest offshore wind auction.Naturally, this is a massive setback for countries like Britain and Germany, which are striving to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Britain s Ed Miliband, commonly referred to ad Labor s  shadow climate secretary,  said that failing to secure any new offshore wind generating capacity is an  energy security disaster.The fact of the matter is that bidding on offshore wind projects remains weak, since the economics of wind energy are erratic, especially if there is a winter cold snap that damages wind turbines.It appears that the  green police  were not happy with the recent G20 meeting in India, since the  said that G20 leaders were  missing in action  on a timeline for ending fossil fuel use.The G20 nations account for about 80  of the world s greenhouse gas emissions. They did agree on a goal to triple renewable energy sources by 2030, but as Britain and Germany s wind auctions demonstrated, there is no reliable economic model to boost wind production, so the G20 may might not be able to meet such goals.Other technologies will certainly be feasible in future decades, such as satellites with massive solar sails that will be able to transmit solar energy from space, but we might also have to still use fossil fuels by then. Confused  We all are, since the planet, climate and space are all complex systems.China s industrial production rose 4.5  in August and was clearly boosted by higher vehicle production for export markets. The other surprising news from China was that retail sales rose 4.6  in August and were apparently aided by the summer travel season.Although some economic reports are not always reliable from China, economists were not questioning the data on industrial production and retail sales.The big news from the G20 was that Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, privately signaled that Italy is planning to exit the  Belt   Road  Initiative with China, which is a global infrastructure pact.Due to the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping missed the G20, there were plenty of rumblings that China is disengaging with the world. President Joe Biden said that China will not be invading Taiwan any time soon, since President Xi Jinping has to solve his domestic problems, like high youth unemployment.Inflation in the eurozone has dropped dramatically from a peak of 10.6  last year to 5.3  in August, but last Thursday, the European Central Bank  ECB  signaled that its continuing fight against inflation is more important than stimulating economic growth, since it raised its key interest rate 0.25  to 4 , the highest level in the 25-year history of the common European currency.Food and energy inflation in the eurozone are much more acute than in the U.S., but there is little their central banks can do to combat food and energy inflation, so I think the ECB may have made a mistake with its latest rate increase.The economies of Italy and Germany are based largely on exports, and due to China s recent economic woes, they are contracting this quarter and will likely drag the entire eurozone into a recession.This euro rate increase will make that outcome more likely, so Europe is sinking into a recession while China seems to be avoiding a recession, although you can never know how far Beijing can kick that can down the road..All content above represents the opinion of Louis Navellier of Navellier   Associates, Inc.

EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,"ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc.  is a closed-end fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations, master limited partnerships, and other energy infrastructure companies. This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus, we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield. This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most income-focused investors.As regular readers will likely recall, we last discussed this fund in mid-September, although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members. The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17, 2023. That was well before energy prices started to tick up in mid-July, so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests. We can actually see this by looking at the fund's performance, which has been substantially better than the broader S P 500 Index  since that article was publishedThe difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the S P 500 Index, which provides a boost to its overall investment return. When we consider this distribution, investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 12.26  over the past five months, compared to 3.60  for investors in the S P 500 Index. That is a pretty significant difference in results. Fortunately, there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward, although perhaps not quite that strong.There have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article. Most importantly, the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss. Therefore, let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an income-focused portfolio today.According to the fund's , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return. This makes sense because this is a common equity fund, which is immediately apparent in the fact that 98.06  of the fund's assets are invested in common equityAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle. After all, investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of time.In the case of midstream companies and partnerships, a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends. We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index , which primarily tracks midstream partnerships. Here are the comparison figures for the past yearAs we can see, the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 11.93 , but investors in the fund actually realized a 21.31  gain on their investment. This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments. In many years, the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this. As such, we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciation.As regular readers are no doubt well aware, I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years. These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site. As such, most readers should be familiar with the largest positions in the fund. Here they areI have discussed all of these companies except for Western Midstream Partners  and Plains GP Holdings  over the years. However, Plains GP Holdings is simply the general partner and manager of Plains All American Pipeline , which I have discussed quite often. As such, it should be quite familiar to most readers. Indeed, all of these companies should be reasonably familiar. That is nice because I should not have to point out that many of these are among the best companies in the industry.There is almost certainly one major change to this list that has occurred within the past few weeks, however. That is Magellan Midstream Partners, which recently completed a pending merger with ONEOK  and is no longer an independent company. As such, it is quite likely that ONEOK has probably replaced Magellan Midstream Partners since the end of August  the date that the fund last publicly updated its holdings . That is by no means certain, however, and it is possible that the fund sold off the ONEOK shares that it received in the merger in favor of something else. At the moment, we do not know exactly what the tenth company is among the fund's largest positions. This fund has an annual turnover of 60.00 , so it does a fair amount of trading, and it is certainly possible that it sold off the ONEOK shares.In a few recent articles, I have pointed out that there are signs that the American economy may be starting to slow down. For example, we are starting to see consumers beginning to get tired of their post-pandemic spending spree and cutting back. Citibank  that consumer spending on credit cards fell 11  in September, which represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop and the largest so far. When we consider that this period included the  back to school  season  typically a fairly large event for retail spending  was weaker than normal this year and prices have certainly not declined, this is a very clear sign that one of the last bastions of economic strength has crumbled. Fortunately, the companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are highly unlikely to be affected by economic weakness. This is due to the business model that these companies employ, which I discussed in a previous articleThis business model works so well to protect these companies against economic problems that even the COVID-19 lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 had no impact on most of their cash flows. While we did see several of these companies reduce their distributions in response to that event, that was simply because the capital markets did not want to touch anything related to the oil and gas industry. These companies simply cut their distributions in order to pay off their debt and become self-financing. As I have pointed out in many previous articles though, their cash flow was almost completely unaffected. It seems likely that the same would be the case in another economic downturn, such as what might be coming. As we will see in a moment, energy prices could increase going forward, which would put further pressure on consumers.As we already saw, the cash flows of the midstream companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are not significantly impacted by energy prices. If they were, then these companies would not have handled the COVID-19 lockdowns as well as they did. However, their equity prices do still correlate with oil prices to a certain degree. It is not a perfect correlation, but we can still see one in this chartThis chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against the Alerian MLP Index in orange and the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund in blue over the past twelve months. We can see that crude oil prices are much more volatile, but for the most part increases in crude oil prices caused the price of both the fund and the index to increase and vice versa. Thus, the fundamentals of energy prices are still relevant to our discussion of this fund as an investment.Fortunately, the fundamentals of crude oil right now are very positive primarily because energy companies in aggregate have been underinvesting in productive capacity since 2015. There are several reasons for that, including various parties in the market refusing to provide energy prices, investor aversion towards fossil fuels, government incentives meant to promote renewable energy, and various other things. As a result of this underinvestment, crude oil production is not likely to be as high as it would have been had suitable amounts of capital been invested. This poses a problem because most sources right now expect that crude oil demand will not drop off nearly as rapidly as environmental activists and politicians believe. The truth is that renewable technology is nowhere near where we need it to be in order for it to work as a suitable replacement for hydrocarbons.As a result, the production of crude oil is likely to be lower than demand over the coming years. JPMorgan Chase recently predicted that the global demand for crude oil will be 1.1 million barrels above the production level by 2025 and 7.1 million barrels above the production level by 2030The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recently made similar statements. The organization's  stated that the energy industry needs to invest approximately  14 trillion into upstream, midstream, and downstream capacity by 2045 in order to avoid a catastrophic energy shortage. That is, to put it mildly, highly unlikely to happen considering that many politicians and activists are trying to curtail investment into productive capacity.There may be some readers who point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is simply talking up its own book with its statements about a mid-term shortage of oil. That is certainly possible, but private companies such as JPMorgan and Moody's are saying the exact same thing. Thus, it is something that we can probably take seriously.The laws of supply and demand imply that a shortage of crude oil would have the effect of raising crude oil prices. As we have already seen, there appears to be a correlation between the price performance of midstream companies, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund, and crude oil. Thus, there is reason to believe that this situation will have a positive effect on the share price of this fund over the mid-to-long term.As mentioned earlier in this article, the primary objective of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is to provide its investors with a high level of total return. In order to accomplish this, the fund invests primarily in midstream companies and partnerships. These are companies that deliver a significant percentage of their total return in the form of direct payments to the shareholders. As a result, they tend to have high yields. For example, the Alerian MLP Index yields 8.13  at the current price. The ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund collects these distributions and pays them out to its own shareholders along with any capital gains that it manages to realize. As such, we can assume that this fund would have a fairly high distribution yield itself.That is certainly the case as the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund currently pays a quarterly distribution of  0.65 per share  2.60 per share annually , which gives it an 8.60  yield at the current price. This is a very reasonable yield for a fund like this and it is sufficiently high to appeal to any income-focused investor. Unfortunately, the fund has not been especially consistent with respect to its distribution over the years. As we can see here, it has had to make a few large cuts over its lifetime, although it has generally been boosting its distribution since 2020The fact that the fund has not obtained a perfect track record with its distribution could be something of a turn-off to investors who are seeking a safe and consistent source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. However, as I explained earlier in this article, several midstream companies cut their distributions in 2020 despite their cash flow remaining stable. In addition, companies in the industry saw their equity prices collapse. These two factors reduced the amount of money coming into the fund and forced it to take substantial unrealized losses. Thus, it makes sense that the fund had to cut in response to these events. Fortunately, we can see that it has been increasing its distribution now that the sector has largely recovered.Naturally, though, anyone who purchases the fund today will receive the current distribution at the current yield and will not be adversely affected by the distribution cuts that the fund was forced to impose in the past. As such, the biggest concern for investors today is how well the fund can sustain its current distribution. Let us investigate this.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund's most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on May 31, 2023. This is a newer report than the one that we had the last time that we discussed this fund, which is quite nice to see. After all, during the first half of this year, crude oil prices were generally much lower than they were in either 2022 or recently. This weighed somewhat on midstream stocks and likely made it much more difficult for the fund to earn capital gains than it experienced in 2022. This report will thus show us how the fund performed in such an environment, and seeing how a management team handles a challenging environment is a very important part of determining its overall skill. After all, anybody can make money in a raging bull market.During the six-month period, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund received  23,247,909 in dividends and distributions along with  178,049 from the money market funds storing its cash. The fund reported no interest during the period. One characteristic of midstream partnerships is that their distributions are not considered to be income to the fund, so the fund only had a total investment income of  4,936,584 during the period. This was not enough to cover the fund's expenses, and it ended up reporting a net investment loss of  5,316,691 over the course of six months. Obviously, that was nowhere near enough to pay any distribution, but the fund still handed out  13,682,401 to its shareholders. At first glance, this is almost certainly going to be very concerning.However, the fund does have other methods through which it can obtain the money that it needs to cover the distribution. For example, the fund received  18,787,159 in distributions from master limited partnerships during the period. That money was not considered to be income for tax purposes, but it still represents money coming into the fund. The fund also might have been able to get some capital gains that can be paid out. Unfortunately, it was not successful at this task as it only reported net realized gains of  8,290,562 but this was more than offset by  42,384,338 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund's assets declined by  56,823,422 after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period. Thus, it failed to cover its distributions overall, which is worrying. However, the fund's net assets were still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. In short, the fund made enough money over the course of 2022 to cover all of its distributions for that year and make up the difference for the first half of 2023. Thus, the distribution is probably reasonably safe right now, especially considering that the past few months have given it the possibility of having more gains.As of October 6, 2023  the most recent date for which data is available as of the time of writing , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has a net asset value of  34.97 per share but the shares only trade for  31.17 each. As such, the fund's shares are currently trading at a 10.87  discount on net asset value. This is a very large discount, although it is nowhere near as attractive as the 12.91  discount that the shares have had on average over the past month. As such, it might be possible to obtain a better price by waiting a bit. However, realistically a double-digit discount is generally a reasonable price to pay for any fund, so the current price is probably acceptable if you want to own some shares.In conclusion, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is a reasonable way to play the midstream exposure without having to worry about the tax problems that can come along with owning master limited partnerships. This fund is structured as a corporation, so it handles all the tax issues on the fund level. The fund has delivered a respectable performance over the past several months, as it has beaten the S P 500 Index, and it seems likely that it will continue to do so due to the strong mid-term fundamentals for energy. The valuation is also reasonable right now. The biggest problem here is that the fund failed to cover its distribution during the first half of the year, but due to the very strong performance that it delivered in 2022, it is not straining to maintain the distribution. Overall, this fund might be worth considering for a portfolio today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

AGG And TLT: Real Yields Near ATH Reveal The Opportunity,"I believe there are numerous reasons to own long-term US Treasury bonds such as  and . While I will concentrate primarily on these three  Firstly, historical evidence is fairly plain and provides a straightforward perspective on whatThere are several crucial reasons why I chose the AGG and TLT for further analysis. As you can see in the table below, these are predominantly long-term bonds whose real yields have settled near their highest levels in the past 10 to 15 years, indicating my attraction to such a selection. AGG has a weighted average maturity of 8.52 years, an effective duration of 6.13 years, and a positive convexity of 0.65, according to .Due to the extremely long duration of TLT, every rate increase would be especially vulnerable. In spite of the fact that the weighted average yield to maturity is 25.21 years, the effective duration is 16.89 years and the convexity is positive at 3.8. Due to the positive convexity, a further increase in interest rates would be less painful than gains, providing the advantage to the long position based on a risk-reward approach.While I was once  on TLT  down -7  from the previous analysis, based on total return , I must confess that I was a little bit premature, despite being correct about inflation. However, the narrative of being long TLT was too speculative because I did not believe the Fed could raise as much as it did at the time. However, that is precisely what transpired, but we will investigate the most significant contributors to nominal yield to identify potential opportunities.You can see the contribution of nominal US30Y below, as well as the 30Y TIPS yield  real yield  and 30Y breakeven rates  market expectations for the annualized inflation rate for 30 years . As can be seen, real yields were the driving force in recent months, while inflation expectations remained relatively stable. Real yields are nearly at all-time highs, reflecting the greatest investment opportunity in years. Inflation expectations for 30 years are approximately 2.29 percent, which is above the long-term inflation target of about 2 percent.Considering 20-year and 10-year real yields, it appears that we are close to 2008 and 2009 levels. Currently, rates are pricing the  higher for longer  theme. Nevertheless, the Mr. market is always subject to change, as real yields have been extremely volatile. Despite the risks involved, I believe it presents a wonderful opportunity from this perspective.Taking into account the upcoming round of inflationary pressures, the Fed may decide to raise rates again. Here are the possible driversAlso as a result of these narratives, the  GDP model now predicts that the annualized GDP for the third quarter will increase by 5.8 .These factors are also responsible for the rapid growth of real yields. The latest   S P  from last week's Wednesday may indicate that the service sector is beginning to be less resilient than anticipated, along with the composite index as a whole. After the release of the data, real yields fell considerably across the curve, with 20-year real yields falling from a local high of 2.04  to 1.88 . Very impressive change in just a few days. However, the overall result differs from the ISM PMI, indicating a much more negative outlook.The charts below from JPMorgan illustrate the most evident behavior of US10Y before and after the Fed Pause. However, it is always an estimate as to when the last rate hike will occur, so we must take into account current market expectations. Although not always accurate and subject to drastic change, it is the most objective indicator of what Mr. Market believes. If not, we could perform our own projections. In the following chapter, we will also examine current market pricing and provide my insights on it.The graph below depicts the behavior of 10-year US yields following a  Fed pause  during non-recessionary tightening cycles. The majority of dates indicate that long-term yields tend to decline. The exception is cycle Dec 1966.When delving deeper, it can be somewhat different when examining the cycles that the recession followed. After a few days of the  Fed pause,  yields tended to decline in five of seven cases, but in the majority of cases, yields recovered. On the other hand, due to rising risks and instability, market behavior was fundamental and conventional. Currently, or let's say since 2008, the monetary  normal  is nowhere to be found due to QE and balance sheet expansion. Now, central banks are attempting normalization, but its success will be determined in the future. Assuming a soft landing, the risk-reward profile of owning long-term bonds supports the optimistic narrative.The  average  development of long-duration bonds since 1981 from JPMorgan  via  in the last seven cycles indicates that long-duration bonds are clearly advantageous, based on history and the event of the most recent fed hike. In my opinion, we may take one more hike and then be finished, or we may not even see that. According to J.P. Morgan's calculations, a bond with a duration of 15 years or more has an average move in the next 23 months following the last Fed rate increase accumulated a 36  gain. And even short-term bonds performed admirably. TLT and AGG are excellent matches for this.Perhaps you are wondering why I am so confident in my opinion. As FFR is higher than YoY Core Inflation, I believe the Fed has tightened enough. While FFR may be in place for some time, I am confident that it will be sufficient to tame inflation. Most of the time, when FFR exceeded Core inflation, it was sufficient to pacify it. However, it is crucial not to reduce interest rates as quickly as policymakers did in the 1970s.These assumptions simply lead me to believe that the Fed is likely finished with rate adjustments. On the other hand, there are risks associated with a robust economy and solid expenditure, or there are leading indicators indicating that services are becoming less resilient and manufacturing is continuing to decline. Inflation is below 0.2  m m for the second consecutive month, which is below the 10-year monthly average and annualized below 2 , thus below the Fed's inflation objective. Yes, as I mentioned, there are dangers to the upside, but a number of leading indicators point to a greater risk to the downside. Nevertheless, an indicator of economic activity and food suggest inflation could rebound.While there are upside inflation risks, which were extensively discussed at the most recent  meeting and Jackson Hole, I prefer to concentrate on market rate measurement by Fed Funds Futures. Simply stated, market participants anticipate rates in December 2023 to be close to 5.43 and in December 2024 to be close to 4.48, implying a probability that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points under 40 . The spread between specified futures reflects the market's expectation of a 100 basis point  bps  rate cuts from peak rates through the end of December 2024. Obviously, these expectations alter over time and in response to events, such as last week's Jackson Hole.Nonetheless, if this pattern of rate cuts materializes, it could be a strong positive driver for bonds with maturities of 7 years or more and reduce real yields. Assuming that the fight against inflation could be effective, real yields and inflation expectations could be positive drivers for lowering nominal and real yields. Fed Funds Futures rate expectations imply peak rates in December and November, giving us a slightly less than 40  chance of a 25 basis point rate increase at one of the next two meetings.While I have provided clear evidence of how the market behaved in analogous situations, there is no assurance of the market's future behavior. I see limited upside risks in real-yields rising by an additional 30-50 basis points or more  from local yield highs , which could be close to all-time highs. In my opinion, the likelihood of record-breaking real yields is extremely unlikely, though not entirely impossible. However, real yields premiums could spike if enormous fiscal debt issuance and almost out-of-control spending occurred, which could increase inflation expectations and exacerbate the supply-and-demand imbalance.If demand is insufficient, continued fiscal emissions could lead to an increase in nominal yields if they continue. As a result of the Fed's quantitative easing  QT , it may be more difficult for the market to curb such massive emissions. I believe mitigating factors exist. However, such yields are ideal for asset managers and also attractive for retail investors. Imagine the following long-term yields  4.24 percent for 10 years, 4.55 percent for 20 years, and 4.33 percent for 30 years. These are the levels that investors and many analysts believed would never be reached again. Levels last seen in 2009. Nonetheless, this threat persists. From a timing perspective I believe, there could be a little bit spark up by 10-20 bps from current yields, which could pull down the AGG and TLT down. This could be solid opportunity.Powell attempted to be as hawkish as possible, but the market was not surprised. Fed Chairman confessed that the Fed is  for additional tightening if necessary, until it is evident that the inflation target is being metThere is also a significant  that must be addressedPowell has just disclosed that the still-expanding and resilient economy, as indicated by the robust labor market and robust economic expansion, could threaten the efforts of central bankers. Primarily due to the constrained labor market, because, in my opinion, a tight labor market solely creates wage pressures, which drives the price of services. Powell is aware of this inflationary pressure, which is why the FOMC always seeks to soften the labor market, especially in times such as the present.However, the most recent data from this week - JOLTs Job Openings in the US economy  non-farm  - showed a significant decline, totalling 8.827 million compared to expectations totalling 9.465 million. Nonetheless, the trend remains considerably above pre-pandemic levels, confirming that the labor market remains tight. Nonetheless, it is softening rapidly.The Fed's decision to halt tightening could be precipitated by a labor market that is easing but remains tight, a manufacturing sector that is continuing to weaken, and a service sector that is starting to weaken. Thus, whether or not we see one more increase is less significant for this strategy than the emergence of global and downside risks.Regarding the economy's resilience in relation to higher bond yields, I have one suggestion. Despite the fact that the Atlanta Fed GDP model released a very strong piece of forward-looking GDP for Q3, I'm becoming more cautious as the most recent Flash PMI reveals weaker service numbers, following many months of resilience. The monetary policy delayed effect began to materialize.However, I believe that long-term bonds have an extremely favourable risk-reward ratio, which is influenced by duration and convexity. From a risk perspective, it is much more advantageous to initiate fairly severe DCA at this point. This also correlated with historical evidence, but even historical evidence is never a guarantee of future returns. Before investing, do your own due diligence. Feel free to review my  of the technology sector from July, which is ahead of September, the most negative month from a seasonality perspective, or my most recent ideas,  that are significantly undervalued with excellent growth prospects and with high margin of safety  from my point of view .

"Jackson Hole Symposium Takeaway: Further Rate Increases, If Appropriate","Ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium, the S P 500  rallied from around 4,333 last week. Markets not only wanted to buy the dip for the month but also were willing to gamble on a dovish Federal Reserve. A dovish FedSince the Bureau of Labor Statistics posted strong job data, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s conclusion pointed to that of hawkishness. Powell   We will need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We will keep at it until the job is done.Investors who saw their stock holdings lose value in 2022 will have last year s symposium fresh on their minds. Interest rates increased by 300 basis points sinceAssets soared in March when the Fed stepped in to prevent a bank crisis contagion with Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. Investors will notice a correlation between the asset increase and the stock markets continuing their uptrend.More recently, however, markets continued to trade higher through mid-July despite the Fed reducing its securities holding. Powell recognized that the impact of the asset reduction and rate hikes takes time to show up in the economy. The stock market s recent weakness, which began in late July, mirrors Powell s comment. Powell said,  the wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.Powell commented on the strong gross domestic product growth in Q2 2023. He said that the economy might not be cooling as expected, citing the housing sector showing renewed strength. Rising interest rates discourage mortgage holders on their existing properties from selling their homes. The elevated rates will limit home supplies and reduce real estate transaction volumes.Once the Fed pivots, it may encourage consumers to buy a home. This would support the Fed s case to raise rates again. In , Powell cited that high inflation starting before 2022 was  a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply.  It continues to unwind demand and supply distortions and implement monetary policy tightening to slow the said aggregate demand. Unfortunately, this is a long process. Despite the more favorable recent readings, the Fed will continue a rate-tightening bias.Rental costs remain high. Powell recognized that lease turnover is slow, so rent inflation measurements take time to show up. The Fed will watch the market rent data closely. It will look for signals of upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.Powell welcomed the lower monthly core inflation readings for June and July. Still, he saw that as only the beginning of what the Fed needs to have confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its goal.Powell is unsure that lower core PCE inflation will continue. The central bank will need to work down the elevated 12-month core inflation. Until then, the economy did not return to price stability.Tighter monetary policy and resolving supply and demand dislocations helped bring core goods inflation down. The Fed s actions worked especially well for durable goods, such as motor vehicles. During the pandemic, fiscal transfers and low interest rates boosted the demand for vehicles. After the pandemic ended, output and inventory increased and demand fell. Most importantly, interest rates increased the cost of vehicle financing. As a result, the Fed successfully achieved a sharp decline in motor vehicle inflation.In time, inflation should decline for other goods. This is nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. As a result, it will call for a restrictive monetary policy. Powell and the Fed will achieve sustained progress in lowering core goods inflation by keeping interest rates higher for longer than investors think.Non-housing services, which include health care, food services, transportation, and accommodations, accounted for more than half of the core PCE index. Although the 12-month inflation moved sideways, Powell is encouraged that its inflation in three and six-month measures declined. This category is less sensitive to interest rates. In addition, those services are labor intensive. It will take time for the Fed s restrictive monetary policy to resolve the inflationary pressure stemming from the imbalance between supply and demand.To achieve inflation rates at 2 , Powell expects a period of below-trend economic growth. Readers may track the tighter financial conditions by watching the 2-year treasury yield , which is up 250 basis points since last year s symposium. Tighter bank lending standards are also slowing loan growth. He cited evidence of below-trend growth from slower industry production. Additionally, spending on residential investments fell in each of the past five quarters.Powell again emphasized the economy may not be cooling as the Fed expected. GDP figures are above expectations as well as above its longer-run trend. Consumer spending is robust. Anyone invested in retail stocks like DICK S Sporting Goods , Macy s , Foot Locker , or Nike  might disagree. But when the consumer is shifting its spending, profits fall for some firms and rise for others.Powell said that wage growth across several measures showed a slowdown. Yet the Fed needs nominal wage growth slowing at a rate similar to that of its 2  inflation target.Readers should be cautioned that the slower wage growth may not last. UPS  workers . Full-time workers will get an average of  49 an hour. Hollywood writers are still on strike while United Airlines  pilots received up to 40.2  in .Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve s ultimate 2  inflation target. It will stay on its restrictive monetary policy until that time. Even though rates are firmly above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, rates will not fall. This should keep putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.The Fed does not have a certainty in the neutral rate of interest. It is a warning for investors that they should ignore mainstream opinions on the rate. Instead, look at the economic data every month. That includes the inflation and jobs reports.Please  me for coverage on deeply-discounted stocks.

Valero Energy: Some Weaknesses Expected For The Remainder Of 2023,"San Antonio-based   released its second-quarter 2023 results on July 27, 2023. This article  my article published on June 15, 2023. I have followed VLO on Seeking Alpha since December 2017.Valero EnergyValero's assets are extensive and located mainly in North America.The U.S. refiner reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of  a significant decrease from  11.36 per share in the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the results beat analysts' expectations again.Total revenues decreased from  51,641 million last year's quarter to , over the consensus estimate.VLO increased its refinery throughput volumes slightly this quarter to The Port Arthur Coker project, which started in early April, positively contributed to Valero's production this quarter, operating well and at full capacity. The new coker has increased the refinery's throughput capacity and enhanced its ability to process incremental volumes of heavy crude and residual feedstocks.Refining Profit margins were  per barrel from  30.01 per barrel last year.

We are entering a period of consolidation after a tremendous bullish run.The crucial issue at stake here is the extreme volatility of the refining sector, which requires a particular trading investing strategy.Oil and gas prices have corrected significantly YoY, with Brent down 15.3  and NG nearly 72 .On August 15, 2023, Bank of America  the refining sector to neutral, including VLO, MPC, PSX, and The analyst sees  risks that margins are peaking on transitory issues, leaving an unfavorable balance of risk at the same time as seasonal trends pressure margins in coming months,  which I agree with.As always, the biggest uncertainty for refiners is the   which will depend on the magnitude of any global economic slowdown and the pace of its recovery over the next few years.However, the long-term outlook remains solid, with global liquid demand recovering by 2025.Thus, trading short-term LIFO and profiting from those wild fluctuations attached to this cyclical industry is needed.I recommend using  of your short-term position while keeping a core long-term stake for a much higher target or enjoying steady dividends.VLO pays a dividend yield of , which is relatively high and safe.VLO is now down  on a one-year basis, underperforming Phillips 66 and Marathon significantly.

Net Cash from operating activities was  in the second quarter of 2023 versus  5.85 billion last year.The Better-than-expected quarterly earnings were primarily due to improved renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total sales costs.

Gold Market Commentary: Q4 Turbulence Ahead,"The gold price oscillated between US 1,900 and US 1,950 for most of September until a sharp dip on the 27th took the price to US 1,871 finish and a 3.7  m m loss. A strong US dollar during the month led to more modest m m drops in EUR, JPY and GBP .Our gold model GRAM suggests that gold s downdraft was largely the result of higher opportunity costs, as the US 10-year yield gained almost 50bps during the month. US dollar strength, with a 2.5  rise in the DXY index also contributed. On a weekly frequency  not shown here , our GRAM model suggests that opportunity cost was insufficiently strong to explain the late-month price drop. In our view the following factors were at play  an overreaction to strong US Capital and Durable Goods data released on 27th September A large drop in the China domestic gold price premium. And we can t rule out technical triggering of limit orders as gold broke through US 1,900 and saw its 50-day moving average cross the 200-day moving average   sometimes viewed as a trend change signal .Global gold ETFs saw further outflows in September to the tune of US 3bn -59t , balanced between North American and European funds, while COMEX gold futures managed money net longs shed US 4bn 70t .Gold price and return in different periods across key currenciesYields, led by US Treasuries, are on the march. The US 10-year TIPS yield, historically closely linked to gold, has breached 2.3  for the first time in 15 years. This is territory that, combined with a rising US dollar, has previously proven to be challenging for gold .While August s run-up in yields was probably driven as much by supply and demand as fundamentals, monetary policy is likely back in the driving seat and has been steadfastly hawkish over the past few weeks  Figure 1 .But gold is not the only casualty of soaring bond yields. Higher yields are depressing the equity risk premium and with rosy earnings growth forecasts  it is a set-up reminiscent of late 2007. Yields are also further constricting financial conditions, which on some measures are also similar to 2007 . This in turn could exacerbate recession risk over the next 6-12 months.Higher yields are also likely reflective of inflation volatility. The inflation trend may be down, but is likely to be bumpy. In the US there are some things to watchHigh inflation is painful but so is . It is both an economic concern and, historically, troublesome for equities.Gold is likely to face some choppiness over the next few weeks as rising real yields, a firmer US dollar and a buoyant economy batter some sectors of investment demand. But longer-term concerns and continued central bank buying should, in our view, ensure that this turbulence doesn t establish a more material downtrend.As such, this could present potential gold buying opportunities for some investors. Historically, gold has tended to mean revert in instances when the market  futures positioning  becomes excessively short.Editor's Note  The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",26,2023-08-26T10:42:22.000-04:00

I'm going to lead off today with an overview of the macro environment, summarize our operating performance for the quarter, and provide an update and some color on our strategy for navigating through these uncertain economic times. Ross will cover the transaction markets and Glenn will close with our financial metrics and updated guidance.Despite the headwinds of high interest rates, some high profile tenant bankruptcies, shaky debt and equity markets, and the on-again, off-again predictions of an impending recession, underlying shopping center sector fundamentals remain robust. More importantly, our portfolio continues to produce strong operating results, as we have been able to nearly overcome, from an FFO perspective, over  0.06 of non-cash accounting related headwinds relative to last year.In an environment marked by virtually no new supply, strong demand from new, recurring, traditional, and non-traditional anchor and small shop tenants, along with the resilient consumer, we continue to produce strong operating results. Indeed, our third quarter results were stronger than anticipated, enabling us to raise our outlook for same site NOI, while raising the bottom end of our FFO guidance for the remainder of the year.A few more third quarter highlights. We signed 457 leases totaling 2.1 million square feet during the third quarter. Our small shop occupancy reached an all-time high of 91.1  as demand for our portfolio continues. Our strong positive leasing spread was 34.9  for new leases and 8.8  for renewal and options reflects the pricing power of our high quality portfolio. Of note, our combined spread of 13.4  is the highest in six years.As anticipated, our anchor occupancy dipped 50 basis points, quarter-over-quarter to 97.2  due to the recapture of the remaining Bed Bath   Beyond boxes. We released seen Bed Bath boxes this quarter at a positive spread of 54 . Our remaining 12 Bed Bath boxes are all in negotiation and continue to benefit from the favorable supply and demand dynamic for well-located retail. Our overall occupancy is off only 30 basis points to 95.5 , notwithstanding the headwinds described.We are encouraged by the continued push by tenants to secure the right real estate with the right landlord. This continued strong demand is perhaps best evidenced by our signed, but not open spread, which actually widened out this quarter to 320 basis points, representing about  52.2 million of rent that is not yet cash flowing. It is these operating dynamics in our own portfolio that continue to build our team's enthusiasm for the pending RPT transaction. While we remain excited about our portfolio, the headwinds I noted earlier cannot be ignored. As a result of the dramatic rise in the 10-year treasury due to persistent inflation in all likelihood, we will remain in a higher-per-longer interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.To mitigate balance sheet uncertainty and maintain a stance of de-risking our exposure to market forces, we do not  Technical Difficulty  continue to prioritize generating free cash flow. We are laser focused on expediting store openings and rent commencing dates, while reducing expenses that are not income producing. Free cash flow growth will allow us to be self-funding and help produce strong organic internal NOI growth as we move ahead.In summary, we continue to build a company, team, and portfolio that is resilient and able to drive growth in challenging times. We believe we are well positioned to execute and take advantage of the additional opportunities that will inevitably arise as we continue to work to optimize shareholder value. RossThank you, Conor, and good morning all. It was a busy quarter for Kimco on all fronts, including the transaction side of the business. While the macro backdrop continues to be volatile, the dislocation that has begun to emerge clearly benefits well-capitalized owners and operators. Those with the scale and liquidity to not only weather challenging times, but take advantage of them. With rates continuing to rise and financing more difficult to obtain, creativity and utilizing unique advantages is how to win in this environment.To that point in August, we capitalized on an opportunity to acquire a dominant grocery anchored lifestyle center in one of our top markets. Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center is a 500,000 square foot trophy asset in Washington DC Metro with all the attributes we look for in a property, starting with the best-in-class grocer, in this case Wegmans, with exceptional sales. The market also has excellent demographics with over 115,000 annual household incomes and over 110,000 people in a three mile radius that also pulls from a trade area that stretches upwards of 40 miles, due to the tenancy and regional location.The property will allow us to layer in our platform to create additional value and cash flow growth, both from upgrading specific tenants and rental levels over time. Additionally, the asset includes over 50 acres of land, providing us with the optionality to densify with mixed use in the future. Historically, this is an asset that every institutional owner would be chasing and would likely have a premium cap rate attached to it due to all the positive attributes.However, with financing tight and for a large deal size, Kimco stood out with its ability to close all cash on the  172.5 million purchase price, which allowed us to negotiate a cap rate north of 7  for our newest Signature Series asset.During the quarter, we also announced the merger with RPT Realty. This is another clear example of utilizing our platform to negotiate a highly favorable cap rate for a well-regarded portfolio of primarily grocery-anchored centers. Similar to the timing on the Weingarten transaction, we view this as another unique window during which the competition is limited and we can take advantage. As it relates to structured investments, there has been a noticeable uptick in discussions and potential opportunities in the past 30 days to 60 days.Admittedly, we expected these conversations to ramp up earlier in the year, but it seems to be happening at a more significant pace as of late. Conversations are taking place with operators facing debt maturities, groups looking for capital to transact on unique one-off opportunities, as well as institutional investors facing redemptions that are looking at recaps. We're being very selective in where we participate, so we expect this part of our business to grow as we move forward.All in all, we are excited about the activity during the quarter and our ability to utilize our position and sector-leading liquidity to remain active when others are sidelined. We will continue to be extremely judicious with our capital, but be ready to move opportunistically.And now off to Glenn for the financial highlights of the quarter.Thanks Ross and good morning. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our high quality operating portfolio, highlighted by robust leasing spreads and positive same-site NOI growth. Importantly, our strong liquidity position and leverage metrics position us to effectively handle the macroeconomic headwinds resulting from stubborn inflation and the higher interest rate environment.Now for some details on our third quarter results. FFO was  248.6 million, or  0.40 per diluted share, as compared to last year's third quarter results of  254.5 million, or  0.41 per diluted share. Our third quarter results produced an increase in pro rata NOI of  3.3 million. The key components of the increase were higher consolidated minimum rent of  12.6 million offset by lower LTA income and straight-line rent of  4.7 million.In addition, bad debt expense was higher by  2.8 million as the current period had a more normalized credit loss level, compared to last year, which benefited from  600,000 of credit loss income due to reversals of reserves. Overall, credit loss was at 71 basis points as a percent of revenues for the nine months at the favorable end of our 75 basis point to 125 basis point credit loss guidance assumption.Pro rata interest expense was also higher by  10 million comprised of  8 million from the consolidated portfolio and  2 million from our joint ventures. This was due to lower fair market value amortization resulting from the early repayment of Weingarten bonds in the third quarter of last year and higher interest rates on the floating rate debt in our joint ventures. Also included in FFO for the third quarter 2023 are  3.8 million of costs incurred in connection with the announced RPT merger and a net benefit of  4.8 million associated with the final liquidation of the Weingarten pension plan.Moving to the operating portfolio, leasing activity remained brisk throughout the quarter as Conor mentioned. Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.6  for the third quarter. And if we excluded the impact of prior period collections it would have increased to 3.1 . The primary drivers of the same-site NOI growth are higher minimum rents contributing 290 basis points and other rental revenues adding 40 basis points. These increases were offset by a more normalized level of credit loss impacting same-site NOI growth by 90 basis points. Overall, these results demonstrated the continued strength of our well-located portfolio and brings our year-to-date same-site NOI growth to 2 .Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with consolidated net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times. On a look through basis, including prorata JV debt and perpetual preferred stock outstanding, net debt to EBITDA was 5.9 times, the same as last quarter and 0.4 times better than a year ago. Our liquidity position remains very strong at over  2.4 billion at quarter end. This was comprised of more than  400 million in cash and full availability of our  2 billion revolving credit facility.In addition, we have our remaining Albertsons shares which have a value of over  320 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued a new  500 million long 10-year unsecured bond which is scheduled to mature in 2034 at a fixed coupon of 6.4 . As we are all aware, interest rates have risen dramatically over the past year and further rate increases are not off the table. As such, we felt it was prudent to address our upcoming 2024 unsecured bond maturities which come due in the first quarter of next year. Tending the maturity, we have invested the proceeds in high-quality instruments to mitigate a large portion of the dilution.Now for our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Conor noted earlier, we began the year facing a non-cash headwind of  0.06 per share totaling  36 million, compared to 2022, stemming from the anticipated lower fair market value amortization from the early repayment of the Weingarten bond and the normalization of credit loss. In addition, we reduced our 2023 lease termination income assumption by  10 million or  0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter.As a result of the strong performance from the operating portfolio, we have clawed most of this back. Our ability to overcome these headwinds speaks to the stability and strength of our operating portfolio. Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are again tightening our 2023 FFO per share guidance range to  1.56 to  1.57 from the previous range of  1.55 to  1.57. This includes improving our full-year credit loss assumption to a range of 75 basis points to 100 basis points from the previous range of 75 basis points to 125 basis points and increasing our same-site NOI assumption to 1.75  to 2.25  from the previous level of 1  to 2 .In addition, based on our full year expectations, our board has elected to increase the fourth quarter common dividend to  0.24 per share, representing an increase of 4.3 . As a reminder, we received a  194 million special dividend from Albertsons earlier this year, which is considered ordinary income for tax purposes, but not included in FFO. We continue to evaluate the amount of special dividend needed to satisfy our redistribution requirements.The Board is expected to declare the amount of special dividend in November and we expect to pay it by year-end. Looking ahead, we plan to provide our 2024 outlook when we report our fourth quarter results. We anticipate it will be inclusive of the RPT merger being completed early in the year.And with that, we are ready to take your questions.Before we begin Q A, one additional item of note, today's call will be focused on Kimco s third quarter earnings results and outlook as a standalone company. Today's discussion may also contain forward-looking statements about the company's pending merger with RPT, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of RPT shareholders. As such, our responses around this pending transaction are limited. The information that is already publicly available, including the transaction announcement, the S4 and the merger agreement, which can all be found in the investor relations section of our website.With that, now we can begin the Q A.We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator Instructions  The first question today comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You purchased an asset in the quarter, you sold assets in the quarter, you're presumably in the market for selling some of the RPT assets for when you acquire the company. Can you kind of provide an update of the transaction market with a particular emphasis on how things have changed since the 10-year rate increased  Thanks.Sure, happy to address that. So, yes, you're right, we had a very active quarter, as I mentioned. We were very excited about the acquisition of Stonebridge Center. It's going to be a long-term hold where we can create some significant value. The dispositions on the Kimco side were fairly limited. There's one transaction which I would note that we sold out of one of our joint ventures, a grocery anchored shopping center in Southern California at a very low cap rate and the low-5s, which I think showcases still the strength of the market and that there is significant capital, particularly for core grocery centers.That being said, we're being I think very cautious in this market in terms of the fourth quarter and our expectations. There's essentially nothing in the pipeline on the acquisition side between now and year-end and on the disposition they continue to be limited to a couple of select land parcels and a few smaller joint venture assets that we're exploring.So I would tell you that the market is still active, although transaction volumes are down plus or minus 70  year-to-date. There is still is capital that is being put to work. Just recently there were transactions that very aggressive sub-6 cap rates in Southern California aside from the one I mentioned that we sold as well as in Miami. We've seen grocery anchored-centers as well as power centers in Chicago and other parts of the Midwest that are trading in the 6s and the 7s and in some cases low-8s. The financing is still available albeit at higher rates than what we've seen in the last 12-months or so which is obvious given where the rate environment has gone, but LTVs can still be obtained from private owners or investors in the 50  to 60  range. So there's still activity out there. We're encouraged by what we see in the fundamentals of the business, as we've talked about. And we believe that we can selectively execute it at the appropriate time.The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Please go ahead.Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just hoping to pack up on the back of Michael's question with regards to targeted RPT dispositions, presumably that would be focused in the lower growth Midwest markets. Just how committed are you to trying to prune that part of the portfolio, if at all  And how should we think about cap rate spreads or differences between, kind of, typical primary gateway markets versus more secondary, maybe Midwest or rest Belt type marketsSure, we are going to save the specifics of the RPT strategy for once we close the merger. That being said, I would tell you that there is still activity out there, as I mentioned. We've seen transactions in the Midwest, as well as in the Sun Belt and other parts of the country. So investors are still looking at all parts of the country and all formats of retail. There's a significant amount of capital that is currently sidelined that is waiting for the appropriate opportunities and frankly for more supply to hit the market as it's been a pretty stable and static amount of supply that's been introduced.So we'll be very selective. We're going through the integration process, the pre-merger integration process right now. So we're formulating our strategy, but we're very encouraged by the direction of the RPT portfolio and what we're seeing. And as we get to the merger and beyond it, we'll be much more specific about the strategy and plan there.The next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Great. Good morning. I guess just to push on that a little bit, just given the year-to-date stock performance, the market is clearly not appreciating the opportunities or the market is too concerned over the risks on these opportunities and it sounds exciting you're seeing more opportunities to come. I guess is there anything else you can share today to alleviate maybe some of these concerns that, you know, Kimco is executing the right strategy to be opportunistic.Jeff I'm happy to take that one so I think when you see in our results and that the numbers speak for themselves clearly we are very focused on executing our strategy and having that result in strong operating results, strong FFO, we raised our dividend, we raised our guidance, we raised our same-site NOI guidance, the all-time high occupancy for small shops is reflected there, six-year high on leasing spreads. So we believe we're executing and we're showcasing it and letting the numbers speak for themselves.Clearly we're in an opportune time, you know, with the dislocation in the financing market, we try and be, you know, opportunistic. And I think that's what Kimco is known for. And so obviously it's a show me story and we believe we've executed in the past and we know we're only as good as our last deal and so we're going to make sure that we continue to put up the numbers that speak for themselves. And when you look -- and I know we've been very vocal about the health of our industry, but when you look at the supply and demand side of the shopping center sector, with the demand, the store openings of what we track over 6,900 new store openings for this year, the supply of 0.5  of existing stock of new construction, which is the lowest amongst all commercial real estate categories, and the vacancy levels for the whole entire open air sector.Depending if you look at Cushman and Wakefield or CBRE, it's the lowest sense of ever been tracking. So between 16-years at Cushman, 18 years at CBRE, this is the lowest vacancy rate the country has ever experienced. And so we're in a good spot. We see that opportunity. We think that the RPT transaction is exactly that. It's a high quality portfolio with all the wind at its back. So we can crystallize the GNA synergies very quickly. And what gets us most excited, obviously, is the OpEx margin that we can believe we can execute on quickly and bring it up to a Kimco level and block and tackle and showcase what the platform can do.Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead.Hey, guys. Just maybe coming at things from another angle on RPT here. Just the 10-years up called 70 bps since you guys announced the transaction, you guys just did the debt deal at  6.4   ph , you have to refinance the under  80 million. Could you just talk about, given where rates are, where they could go, what the optimal mix of cash versus new debt could look like to take that debt out, and maybe how the accretion math has moved since the deal was announced just given the higher financing costs.Yes, hi, Craig, it's Glenn. Again, rates obviously have moved a little bit, but we do have a full mix and we have a fair amount of optionality. We have cash, obviously, that is on our balance sheet. We also have our Albertsons investment that we would expect to be able to monetize in the beginning part of the year. So between that, our access to capital, the revolver, we feel pretty comfortable with taking, you know, refinancing the debt at prices relatively close to where we targeted. Rates are up a little bit, but I think from a full standpoint, we still expect the transaction to be FFO-accretive in the first year.We have, again, the revolver is fully available. We're sitting with the significant amount of cash on the balance sheet, and Albertsons I think those give us the flexibility to take down what we need to do.The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.Hey there. Good morning. I will not ask a question on RPT, I wanted to ask about leasing spreads. My question for you is on leasing spreads, the Bed Bath spread in particular, which were stronger I think than many of us expected. So maybe can you shed some more color here  Are you perhaps offering a bit more TIs  Are you cutting up boxes  And maybe some color on how the conversations are going to backfill the remaining boxes and expectations for spreads on those  Thanks.Yes, appreciate the question. I think it sort of dovetails part of what Conor mentioned about the supply demand and the demand factors that are very much in our favor right now with no new development supply. It's really the existing inventory. And so, similar message to what we've communicated previously is a lot of these retailers are looking for opportunities to grow their store count. They have to hit their growth projections over the next several years and so they've always seen the Bed Bath inventory as one of those clear opportunities.So in terms of the commitment they've made, you have multiple players at the table looking for a similar space that actually helps you push rent northward, which helps drive the spread. When you look at the cost side, the costs have been pretty much in line. All of these have been single tenant backfills, so we aren't splitting boxes yet. When you look at the balance of the 12, we still have a handful of those that are going to be occupied most likely by single tenant users. There may be a couple in there that we anticipate splitting, but that was to be expected from the very beginning and we still see very healthy spread margins as well for those remaining boxes. So again, all looks fairly comparable right now.The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe a follow-up to the Bed Bath sort of comment earlier. I guess how much -- how should we think about the downtime with those boxes  I mean, I'm trying to figure out, you know, the downtime and how long it'll take to get kind of the rent back online with new tenants as we think about growth for next year, you know. So, you know, on the one side you have the headwinds from higher interest rates, net interest expense, but on the other side I'm just trying to understand how much of a sort of a pick-up from rents you'll get sort of as a tailwind for next year  Thanks.Yes, sure, absolutely. So we have 14 boxes that were executed three of which were assigned those 14 boxes are accounted for currently in our snow pipeline, which you spend a 320 basis points,  52 million in total. For some perspective on timing, we do actually have our first two Bed Bath boxes that were backfilled starting to flow this quarter, and so that was under a 12-month window. Obviously, timing will vary box-to-box on what needs to be done. The balance of that is baked into our snow pipeline, of which we anticipate seeing about 50  to 60  of that flow through the course of 2024.The nice part, too, about the releasing of the Bed Bath boxes is, again, there have been individual tenants taking the whole boxes, which usually compresses the buildout time and the rent commencement date. So that's what we're already starting to see some flow this year.The next question comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Thanks. Good morning. With respect to your push for higher annual escalators, are you finding there's any incremental pushback or would you expect to be able to continue to push upward to the near-termYes it's market driven obviously you know we'd say the Sun Belt markets have been you know areas of opportunity where we can push further north on the increases, but it's really a case-by-case conversation with all the retailers. Obviously, everything's in negotiation, so there's a lot of discussion on the table, but we felt we have been confident in our abilities to push it northward, and right now it seems to be holding pretty well. With the small shop occupancy at 91.1, obviously matching our all-time high, again, that supply-demand balance is still working very much in our favor.Okay, thanks.The next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, sticking with the lack of supply and strong tenant demand, I guess thinking about how you guys are having conversations and discussions with your acre tenants. So, traditionally, the acre tenants are able to drive leasing terms on deals. But now that the availability is dwindling. How is Kimco able to regain leverage in those discussions and maybe curtail some tenant-friendly termsSure. Yes, I mean, outside of the economics, you're looking at, you know, co-tenancy provisions, exclusive provisions, all of which you can start to rebalance, loosen up, create more flexibility for us. Obviously, repositioning and redeveloping our centers has been a core principle of ours, so having that flexibility to do so. I also think we continue to grow into a data-driven market where you have a better sense of the impacts and you see tendencies or understandings change. Former principles about the impact of fitness long ago was sort of dispelled by the reality that people go to the gym, and then they actually go and shop elsewhere afterwards. And so retailers have come to appreciate that.So I think today, more than ever, it's very much a partnership, looking to build the best community for the shopper and the customer. And our retailer partnerships are very, very strong. And they're willing to explore new opportunities that work for both sides.The only thing I would add is I think you're seeing retailers become more flexible with store footprint, which again opens up a lot more opportunities. The days of sort of having their prototype and that's it, it seemed to be in the past. And so that may not be a lease term specific item, but it is an optionality that creates more demand for spaces that might be more tweener sized. And that's what you're seeing with some of the Bed Bath opportunities.The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.Thanks, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. You know, I'm a little bit surprised that you know in some ways on the reaction from the market on your increasing scale at a time when the fundamentals of the shopping center industry are probably the best we've ever seen. But maybe if you could put into context some of the -- your historical occupancy and leverage ratios. And in particular maybe highlight also maybe if you can talk about what your shop occupancy is at record levels already, but are there big regional differences and how much more can you push thatMaybe comparing, for example, your New York or Long Island shop occupancy versus your national, obviously there are market differences here, but highlight to the market a little bit on what the upside potential, additional upside potential is here in terms of occupancy. And also, obviously, as that snow pipeline comes online, what that would do to your already, I believe, record low leverage ratiosSure. Happy to start, Floris, and we can pass the mic around, but you're spot-on. We're obviously encouraged by the supply and demand dynamic that we're experiencing in our portfolio. We're using a lot of data analytics to understand that there's virtually no new supply on the horizon and that we feel like our portfolio is well positioned for growth as the signed, but not open pipeline continues to build, as you saw expand further this quarter, which indicates future NOI growth.And we're trying to maintain a portfolio and strategy that allows us to grow regardless of the environment that we're facing. And so keeping leverage levels at all-time lows for us is important. You saw us be proactive and really sort of push out any near-term maturities with our recent bond offering. We continue to think that the small shop occupancy is going to be a bright spot for us as we've just reached all-time highs and we're continuing to think there's more to push there.The demand drivers are multiple, and they're more, as I mentioned earlier, there's traditional and there's non-traditional. And you continue to see the use cases for shopping centers evolve, because it's all about value and convenience. And almost everything you can think of benefits from value and convenience. And so that's why the shopping center continues to evolve to be, I think, the place of choice for whether it's a service use, whether it's a medical use, whether it's a pure retail use, you name it, it continues to evolve as the spot where people want to start businesses.And that's why I think it gives us a lot of encouragement, as well as the fact that we have all of this underutilized parking that we think has future outside in the long-term. So we always want to think long-term. We entitled over 800 units this quarter alone in the portfolio. We continue to think that the shopping center will evolve to include multiple uses, primarily multifamily for us. But we position the portfolio for long-term growth. We've been on a roller coaster of retail.As you know, there's been retail apocalypse. There's been the COVID pandemic. There's been all things we've faced in terms of challenges. And we feel right now we're in a really good spot, hopefully be the bright spot of commercial real estate, because Kimco is well positioned, I think, to be opportunistic and showcase that when times when people are nervous, if you have the capability to execute, you should be able to make generational deals. And we feel like that's what we're intending to do at Kimco going forward and into the future.The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.Hey, good morning. I'm just curious how you're thinking about spending on acquisitions versus redevelopments at this point, where you see the bigger opportunity  Given the size of and growing size of the portfolio, whether or not you expect to see some increase in the redevelopment opportunities or whether the accretion yields there due to the cost or whatever it might be are just not worth the squeezeSure, I'm happy to address that. Cost of capital is paramount in doing deals that are accretive to that cost of capital. It is something that we discuss and evaluate as a collective committee on a daily basis. To your point, acquisitions in this environment, at least one-off sort of third party acquisitions will be very challenging for us in the near-term as cap rates have not moved nearly at the same speed that interest rates and our cost of capital have moved.The bright spot is that redevelopments, particularly sort of the bread and butter retail redevelopments within our portfolio, continue at very high clips, double-digits on average. So that is an investment opportunity that we will continue to pursue and activate across our portfolio. And to your point, as the portfolio continues to grow, those opportunities grow alongside it. So we do believe that leasing and redevelopment -- retail redevelopment will continue to exceed our cost of capital and be where we put a significant amount of our available cash flow. And then we'll be opportunistic with the structured investment program, which also has double-digit returns requirements for us to proceed. And we'll prioritize each and every opportunity with that thought process in mind.The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. I got a question on where do share repurchase has been into the capital allocation, I guess the matrix  I think you have about  224 million left in your authorization. How are these -- how does that compare to a structured investments and other opportunities you haveI think it's a similar conversation. I think every investment opportunity that we look at is judged based upon our cost of capital and what is accreted to that. I think that we talked a little bit about our leverage being at the lowest levels historically that it's ever been, which gives us a lot more optionality to consider anything that's on the table. So we'll look at every single investment opportunity, acquisition, leasing, redevelopment, structure investment, stock buybacks, whatever the case may be, and prioritize it based upon, you know, through that lens. So that's where we sit and that's how we consider it.The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning everyone. Conor, you talked about small shop occupancy as a bright spot. Could you talk about what types of tenants you're seeing that interest from, like local versus national, what industry  And also the timing, I feel like we hear that macro uncertainty is lengthening the time it takes to sign leases and other property types. So I'm wondering if you're seeing that at all in your property typeSure, from a small shop perspective, I think it's definitely a bright spot. When you look at the uses, you know, restaurants, specialty foods, like those types of users still dominate sort of the percentages of new leases that we signed this quarter. And then when you go past that, it's really sort of the health and wellness and beauty category. That continues to evolve. You used to be dominated by sort of the old bus of the world. Now we're seeing Sephora and a number of others continue to evolve to have open air shopping centers as a key component to their growth strategies.You know, when you look at the services category, that continues to evolve. We always have had hair and nail salons as a key component of the shopping center sector. But when you add in all the medical uses that continue to evolve and want to be closer to the consumer and come out of the hospital, I think that continues to evolve as well. And then you're seeing sort of these franchise-driven concepts that continue to be the growth driver.The mom-and-pop retailer today very different than it was even five years ago. And a lot of what's being -- what's going on is they're buying these franchises with a proven business model, and that's how they're starting the business. And I think when you look at the franchises that we're doing deals with, you can actually improve the credit profile there, again, the corporate guarantee on it.And so as we evolve our leasing strategy, and we talked about the increases that we're getting on small shops, continuing to improve the growth of the portfolio, all these things are adding up, obviously, to an enhanced growth profile.The next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird. Please go ahead.Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. I kind of wanted to dig into the structured investment conversation. You guys have mentioned that the conversations around those have been picking up lately. Can you guys provide us some more details about the return criteria on those and what we can expect that book to grow toSure. Yes, the conversations are picking up and we do anticipate there's going to be more optionality with that program as we enter 2024, continuing with the theme of cost of capital. As our hurdle rates increase, the quotes that we're providing to potential borrowers of our capital have increased as well. So what was previously 8  to 9  with some back-end participation potentially is now double-digit as a starting point.So the blended average of our structure right now in terms of the rates that we're obtaining in the current position are in the mid to high-9s. And we expect that anything going forward will certainly start in the double-digits. But we think that will ramp up. We have just under  200 million outstanding on the book right now within the program. So we'll continue to be mindful of that, but we think that there's room to run there.The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Hi. You reduced your credit loss outlook as you're trending at the low-end. Given the record low supply environment you're operating in and your improved portfolio quality in terms of better credit tenants, do you think it's premature to say credit loss will be a step function lower in the coming yearsAgain, we're happy with the improvement that we've seen. I think you've seen credit loss coming back to more normalized level similar to what we saw pre-pandemic. It's a little early to put it into the guidance for next year. But as a run rate, if we're in that 75, 100 basis point range, I think you're back to pretty normalized levels.The next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Yes, hi. Going back to the structured investment opportunities, are they all tied to real estate  Or are you evaluating some operator opportunities as wellYes. I mean the core program is looking at operating real estate in our core markets with strong demographics, the tenancy that we're looking for, high-quality sponsors, and as we've talked about in the past, having that right of first offer, a right of first refusal is a critical component of that program.Now that being said, we do have our Plus business that has been active historically. And as there are retailers that are real estate rich that have capital needs, we believe that we're typically 1 of their, if not their first phone call. So those conversations will continue and where we can be opportunistic and helpful with retailers that have a significant amount of owned real estate, we'll always look at those opportunities as well.The next question comes from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please go ahead.Good morning. Price of interest rates, of course, has been unprecedented and introduces the question of how will retail our balance sheet and look after a company starts facing that maturity. So when you think about the future, how do you feel about potential tenant fallout  Do you think it will be -- or that it's reasonable perhaps to think about above average tenant failure given everything that is happening with interest ratesIt's a good question, Paulina. I think when you look at the rate environment and how it impacts all industries, really the retailers that have near-term debt maturities are going to be facing higher interest expense and the refinancing, just like other industry. I would say that  Technical Difficulty  for Kimco has never been smaller when you look at the retailers that we continue to track from a credit perspective.And when you think about the supply and demand dynamics that I talked about earlier, we feel very comfortable with the credit loss reserve that we have today. Obviously, we just improved that this quarter and continue to be proactive on showcasing spaces that are not available today, but may be available in a year or two or even five years  time. And that's what we're doing right now is we're showcasing not our current vacancies. We're showcasing what may be available in the near-term or in the long-term to line up the best-in-class tenants.Because of the lack of supply, retailers are engaged in that knowing that it's going to be hard to fill their promised pipelines of net new store openings in the current environment. So they have to align with folks like Kimco to try and fill that and see where they can add where they wanted to fix to build their needs.The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead.Thanks. Good morning. To follow-up on that last question. Just given the rise in the cost of capital for your tenants, do you see that eventually weighing on their expansion plans  And second question, your active mixed-use developments, the yields went up pretty noticeably. Just curious what drove that.Yes. Kevin, great for questions. So with the first one, we maintain a very close dialogue with our big retail partners, and they're looking through, I think, the short term impacts and continuing to try to grab market share where they can appreciate in that, that inventory is limited. And if they don't get it today, there might not be new inventory available tomorrow.That said, every retailer has a different capital strategy, and that probably evolves most likely as ours evolves as well. So something that we stay very, very close to them. But as I can say right now, it doesn't seem to be slowing the pace of growth the majority of those retailers. And as it relates to the mixed-use pipeline, yes, I appreciate the question. So what you see there is you see four projects, three of which are ground leases and the fourth one being Colter which is the 1 that we identified as our preferred equity structure. That was the first of its kind that we're doing.So this quarter, we felt it was appropriate to actually show what the real returns are related to the Kimco invested capital and the preferred returns related to those projects. Obviously, that yields a higher or accretive growth profile than if you're just to invest all the capital yourself. So that's what it's reflecting, that's the change.The only thing I would add on the retailer demand side, in, and what we're seeing is because of the rate environment because of the construction costs a lot of these tenants that used to do ground-up development and then sell those assets as sale leasebacks are now looking for second generation space versus the ground-up development side. And so they're looking at how do they absorb existing inventory versus net new development, because of that lack of financing availability. And so that should drive more demand to the existing spaces, as well as that first-generation ground up development has really dried up.Thank you.The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks for the second shot here. Just a couple of questions. One, just on -- going back to the RPT merger where we started. So what are you guys assuming in terms of the debt that needs to be refinanced. So that's part one. And then part two, if you could just give us an update on the Rite Aid exposure and what you're seeing or expecting there for the space that they've deemed that they're going to get back in one form or another.So in terms of the debt to be refinanced for RPT, if you look at the balance sheet at 9 30, they're sitting with bank debt, both revolver debt and term loan debt of about  350 million and then they have about  511 million of private placement notes. So that's the magnitude of what we're looking at and then obviously, there'll be merger plus that go into that. So it's around  900 million in total. And as I mentioned, we have a variety of options about how to fund that from our Albertsons investment, cash on the balance sheet, aligned, obviously, access to the capital markets and other things.Yes. And as it relates to the Rite Aid exposure, right now, we know that three of our leases have been rejected in day one. That's about 5 basis points of occupancy right now. So a de minimis impact, there are another two that we expect to close this quarter. So in total, that's about 8 basis points of total occupancy on the impact. And right now, we have good activity in terms of hitting our retailer list and box size is appropriate for a lot of the mid-box users, and so the larger, sort of, small shop operators as well. So we're very encouraged by the activity. We have one that has drive-through locations. So again, there's good attributes, good components here that we feel pretty confident we can backfill those quickly.Thank you very much.The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. Again I had originally tied to just sneak in a second one, but then we didn't get to it. So here I am. And maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ki Bin's question. But so we hear that macro uncertainty is lengthening the time it takes to sign leases in like office and industrial, so I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing this at all, like how have your tenant sense of urgency on signing leases evolved over the course of the year  And like have they changed  Or have you, I guess, avoided thatYes. It really -- it hasn't changed. Not anything related to the macro environment. We're tied for negotiating certain deal points that may add some time, but that's normal course of business. If anything, people are looking to get leases signed quickly so they can get open sooner and they can start booking that growth within their portfolio. So there's been no real material change in terms of time of execution.Okay, thanks.Next question comes from Libby Bakken with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hi. This is Libby Bakken. Yes, just a follow-up. So -- do you think you could clarify the bridge or the walk from 3Q FFO to 4Q just based on the guide, it looks like it implies like a  0.01 to  0.02 step down into the fourth quarter. So just curious on what's driving that.Yes. Again, we have a couple of onetime things that are in the third quarter. As we mentioned, there's some of this impact from the Wingard pension plan that was liquidated during the quarter. And there's a few other onetime things. But again, we feel very comfortable with the guidance range and we're at the upper end of the range that we set out for the year. Again, coming back, we made up a lot of headwind that we had going into the year, driving towards that high end of the range today. So that's really the driver.There was a big one-time item as Glenn mentioned, the pension income we recognized was about  8.7 million. That's what's in that other income line. You back that out, you're back to a more normalized level.Got it. Thanks.The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I saw the lease summary that landlord worked first square foot went up to close to  8 in the quarter. I'm assuming that's related to the Bed-Bath Beyond lease, but I wanted to confirm that and maybe talk about TIs and landing work trends going forwardYes, sure. So there's a couple of components. Let's start with the first and new leases side. So the new lease side, is slightly higher, driven by primarily three deals. If you left those deals out, the total work for TI and landlord work would go from 51 down to 40 which is at the lower end of a more normalized rate. The returns on the deals were in excess of 20-plus percent. So very accretive and the mark-to-market on those is between 80  and 116 .So very, very accretive deals. But again, back those out, you get down to the  40 range. In terms of the overall, where you include new leases, renewals and options, it is elevated because of the weight of the number of new leases executed and we'd also did  24 anchor deals that quarter -- this last quarter. First, the number of renewals and options, if you see those are a little bit lighter.So obviously, when you blend it together, the weighted component of the new deals grow that number up a little bit. But from a cost standpoint, as you can see, the renewals and options are pretty much in line as well. So that's just the nuance difference between this quarter and prior quarters.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.We just appreciate everybody that participated on the call. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you so much.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",1,2023-10-05T12:54:44.000-04:00
NexGen Energy: Moderately Optimistic Scenario Already Playing Out,"I like Uranium and the nuclear industry as an investment. I believe it's the only way the world can have its cake and eat it too  Increase the standard of living while sticking to emissions targets . In my first The price of the Uranium remains unchanged or even drops to US 30 -  40 lb. for several years. At a low production cost of less than US  20 lb., the company was still going to outperform other companies' operational mines. This would make the investment long-term as the stock price slowly ticks push the price of Uranium. Since the price of Uranium stocks is closely correlated to the price of Uranium, we start seeing NXE tick higher much before production. There is also a possibility that bigger rivals find the valuation attractive enough to make an acquisition offer that would greatly benefit existing shareholders.An extension of the moderately optimistic case. Driven by supply and demand, the price of the Uranium can get speculative, which may provide a massive boost to underlying Uranium mining stocks. Commodity stocks have undergone speculative frenzies before. Since NexGen has the largest development stage deposit in the world, it may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a speculative environment.Presently, we are already seeing the  play out before our eyes and this write-up will serve as an update to our thesis.The stock is up 46  since the original thesis was published towards the end of last year. The industry as a whole has been on quite a tear this year. What could be remarkable though is the fact that the stock has outperformed both the ETF  that has Uranium miners as holdings and the financial entity dedicated to the acquisition of physical uranium Probably, this would come as no surprise if you  that NexGen is in possession of the world's highest-grade Uranium deposits. The region of their deposits  Saskatchewan  is also recognized as Canada's top-rated mining jurisdiction along with an international ranking as the third most attractive mining investment and policy jurisdictions.Presently, the company estimates that its Rook I Project is the largest development stage uranium project with the lowest capital intensity compared to peers. The large low-cost and low-capex project mean that the market recognizes how far this company can go when its mines are fully operational and how well the Uranium prices can propel the company.It is interesting to see how much prices have moved up since our first coverage. The spot price was approximately  45 lb. and is close to  60 lb. now, an increase of 30 - 35 . This is still significantly less than the time we saw Uranium prices in the last bull cycle. Spot price  a high of  136 in 2007 and prices have fallen far since then. But the market recognizes that if this rally were to sustain as the company ramps into production, we could be looking at a cash cow by the end of this decade. Earlier still, this company could become an attractive prospect for an acquisition.The company estimates at  75 lb.  average contracting price during last contracting cycle  average annual EBITDA during the first five years of annual production would be  2.5B and at the highest point of  150 lb. average annual EBITDA would be at  5.18B. This is when our scenario would move from a Moderately optimistic case to a Highly optimistic one. It could seem that it is too far-fetched to expect this move at this point in time. But the setup looks to have a really good foundation. Below is a short list of  unexpected  news that we have seen recently that makes the case for demand shooting up and supply coming up short.1. Finland has  regular electricity output at Europe s largest nuclear reactor. Finland's commitment to nuclear energy, alongside hydro and wind power, is a crucial component of the country's journey toward carbon neutrality. This strategy has not only supported Finland's resilience to potential energy supply disruptions but also contributed to its environmental goals.2. Despite  anti-nuclear sentiment following the Fukushima disaster, Japan is gradually restarting its nuclear reactors. Currently, one-third of Japan's operable reactors have resumed operations, and approvals are in progress for an additional 16 reactors, with one set to restart this month.3. Demand is not only expected to grow through the bulk of new reactors coming mainly from China and India but also by  the operating lifetimes of existing plants. Canada, France, Russia, etc. are allowing existing plants to operate for up to 60 years, and in the USA, for 80 years. The latest report from WNA has said that demand for uranium in nuclear reactors is expected to climb by 28  by 2030.4. Utilities  on track to sign contracts for more uranium in 2023 than in any year since 20121. A  in Niger, which generates about 4  of the world s uranium, has added to the upward pressure on Uranium prices.2. Cameco, the second largest Uranium miner announced lower full-year forecasts for production due to challenges at its Cigar Lake mine and Key Lake mill in Canada. The company has said it might buy uranium from the market if needed to help meet obligations to customers3. War in Russia has blocked off critical export routes for the supply mined in Kazakhstan which is the world's largest supplier of Uranium. One of Cameco's main sources of outside supply is Kazakhstan and delays have hindered the alternative route for exports.It has to be stressed that this company is development stage pre-revenue and as such the play is on the movement in Uranium prices. Any correction or drop in the prices of Uranium would accordingly be reflected or even be magnified in the price of the stock.The fallback or the base case scenario is even if the short-term to medium-term thesis fails on the Uranium prices, the long-term case for the company becoming one of the biggest Uranium commodity players in the world should still hold  But an investor would have to wait until the end of this decade for this to play out fullyFor faster realization of profits, it would be prudent to trim the position as we go further into the Uranium price rally. Most commodities undergo a period of boom and bust and this time would be no different. It seems that we are on the cusp of the boom of another cycle, the catalysts for both supply and demand seem to be supported for now. This may continue to be supported till we see prices high enough to be able to aid the miners' plans to source additional supply.For now, I am holding on to my full investment and may even add to my existing position till I reach my maximum threshold for a single position. I will post another update to this thesis when I decide to cut down on my position and take profits.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

UGL: A Strong Buy Signal In Gold Deserves Some Leverage,"Our buy signal in gold last  is still in force. The mild price correction over the last 30 days seems to be ending and we expect a strong uptrend to begin. In fact, it may have already started.WeThe best indicators to forecast gold are not economic or those that forecast physical supply and demand, but those based on the buying and selling activity of certain investors, plus surveys that measure investor expectations for gold.To begin, let's first look at the two indicators that measure buying activity of gold and gold EFTs, and the one indicator that measuresThen we'll look at buying activity in UGL itself, which is the gold ETF we're recommending, to see if it confirms this bullish outlook.This indicator, which goes back to 2006, is unique to the Sentiment King. It's made by combining the investment activity of two trader types - gold asset managers and gold producers. The information comes from the  Commitment of Traders  data.The green arrow on the right points to the strong buy signal that occurred last year, and it's the main reason was remain bullish long term. We'll probably remain positive on the long-term upward trend of gold until this curve moves into the red zone.One of the reasons we continue to recommend GLD and now, with this article, UGL for those aggressive investors who want to use leverage on an expected move in gold, is the high  puts to calls  ratio in GLD.Options traders are notoriously wrong with their investment activity and a high puts to calls ratio is the classic indicator that reflects this. The  puts to calls  ratio is not only useful in determining the direction of the stock market, but other investments as well.The chart above shows the puts to calls ratio for GLD and we've indicated high ratios of the past with dashed arrows. You can see the correlation.Last month had the highest ratio in the last four and a half years. To us this is very bullish for gold and is one major reason we recommend UGL for those aggressive gold investors who want leverage.The third chart is the Sentiment King ranking of the Hulbert gold survey, which calculates the ratio of bullish to bearish opinions of gold newsletter writers.It's important to notice the black arrow on the right, which points to last year's green zone price low. It occurred when our ranking of bearish sentiment by newsletter writers was also in the green zone, which represents a buy signal. This was strong additional confirmation of the buy signal from our commitment of trader data shown in the previous chart.As you can see, our current ranking of the survey is just above the zero line at -2.3. We're not worried about a top in gold until both indicators move into their respective red zones, and neither is close to that at this time. This gives us confidence that higher gold prices lie ahead. We recommend buying now and on any dips in price over the next few weeks.The chart below graphs the net asset value of the ProShares 2X gold ETF - UGL. This is the leverage gold ETF we recommend. It attempts to achieve a return equal to 2X the return of the Bloomberg Gold Subindex. The NAV is charted using a semi log scale to show the relative size of the various price moves.We expect a significant move in gold that will push the price of UGL to a minimum price target of  83 or a high target of  98. This is a low end gain of 41  to a high gain of 66 . Investor buying activity in UGL, shown below, supports this overall positive outlook.This chart plots average daily buying in UGL as a percentage of assets. The scale is inverted, which means low levels of buying at the top of the chart, and high levels of buying at the lower end.History shows that investors in UGL are not good at predicting the direction of gold. They buy more UGL when gold is high and ready to decline, and less UGL when gold is at a low, ready to move higher.We've drawn five arrows that point to low buying levels in UGL. It's easy to see that all five occurred at price lows, right before higher prices in UGL.The last arrow on the right indicates the current low level of buying. This is added confirmation to us that gold prices, and the price of UGL, are going to move higher.As with all leveraged investments, there are added risks and expenses. These risks and expenses both limit the returns and make it hard for managers to achieve their investment objectives. This is true of UGL.In our opinion the largest expense factor at this time are high, short term rates, which raise margin costs and increase time premiums on futures and options. Because of this we don't believe UGL is a good investment longer than six to nine months. As a gold investment, it should only be used when indicators favor a strong price increase like we think they do now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Camtek: A Cyclical Play At A Great Price Point,"Revenues and margins for Camtek Ltd.  have improved immensely over the last few years and 2022 become a very busy year for the company as the top line landed at  321 million. CAMT seems to remain on aThese cyclical investments are often associated with trying to timeAs we know, CAMT in the semiconductor industry as a developer and manufacturer of inspection and metrology equipment for advanced interconnect packaging and memory and image sensors among other niche segments in the broader semiconductor industry. The company has some systems called Eagle-i system that primarily focus on delivering 2D inspection and metrology capability for companies in the sector.The company has experienced strong demand following the surge of semiconductors and the introduction of more advanced AI programs. Now almost any company you come across seems to be looking into how to introduce some of the capabilities of the semiconductor industry into their own or how AI could further enhance operational performance.With a leading position in the market, I think that CAMT offers one of the best opportunities to gain strong exposure to the industry, without perhaps the same amount of cyclicality and volatility added. Many companies in the industry are expected to post a significant YoY decline in 2023, whilst CAMT seems to be holding up rather well. That speaks volumes about the type of business you are getting into right here in my opinion.Looking at the last from CAMT, it seems that they managed to come out ahead of their expectations as revenues landed at  73 million in total. As for the coming quarter, the projections are that revenues will post a slight quarterly growth and come in at  77 - 79 million. A beat here I think would further solidify the higher valuation that CAMT is receiving right now. The p s, for example, is at 6.7 right now but as demand rebounds I think that it will be more justified, as we know, the market is forward-looking.The CEO Rafi Amit made some comments on the stronger demand the company is experiencing and this is especially reassuring to see as the stronger flow of orders is a good indicator of better times ahead. Expectations are also that 2024 will be a record year for the company, both in terms of revenues and earnings. As for what the market is expecting of CAMT, it seems that an EPS of  2.17 is expected. My opinion on the projections heavily relies on demand continuing strongly for the second half of 2023, and CAMT being able to build a strong backlog of orders going into 2024. I think a failure in doing so could perhaps result in earnings coming in just in line with projections  but a major beat would send the share price up even higher, in my view.The semiconductor market finds itself amidst a substantial correction cycle, driven by a marked decline in demand across a spectrum of devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics. This pronounced downturn in demand has sent reverberations through the industry, prompting a recalibration of strategies and expectations. The market has shown itself to be a cyclical one driven by companies wanting to stock up inventory levels and capitalize on coming . That usually means that demand for semiconductors could be a good indicator for customers to companies like CAMT projecting they will have a surge in demand.Notably, the high-end memory has borne the brunt of this correction, with prices experiencing a pronounced descent of nearly 50  over the past year. This swift and substantial price adjustment reflects the intricate balance between supply and demand dynamics that govern this intricate market. These price adjustments are something that needs to be watched by companies like CAMT. If the company can display a strong resilience in margins, then potentially a higher valuation may be suitable, which seems to be the case for CAMT right now.An equally significant facet of this recalibration revolves around the supply chain intricacies associated with key components, particularly for the production of phones, personal computers, and data center chips. The ebbs and flows in demand have led to a renewed equilibrium in lead times within the supply chain, marking a return to more conventional and manageable production timelines. Since the COVID pandemic, however, the supply chain issues have eased up significantly and high shipping costs seem to be a thing of the past. I don t think this will play out to be a challenge for CAMT in the medium term.CAMT has proven itself very capable of growing quickly in the semiconductor industry and building out a broader customer base. The company has maintained margins very well and even if 2023 doesn't offer a YoY growth that maybe a lot of investors would have wanted, the fact that CAMT is barely posting a decrease when many other companies and peers are doing significantly lower revenues and earnings speaks a lot about what you get with an investment in CAMT.I like the price point right now even after the run-up it has had and paying a slight premium to the sector is often necessary when you want to get into a company. In the long run, I believe CAMT will be a winner and I want to be along for the ride. Rating CAMT a buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Taylor Wimpey: Analysis Of The U.K. Housing Market,"Our current investment thesis isTaylor Wimpey  is a UK-based residential property developer and homebuilder. With a rich history dating back to 1880, theTW's share price has lost value in the decade, primarily due to the decline since 2021, with strong distributions offsetting this. TW's dividend payments are a reflection of its cash-earning potential and business model.Presented above is TW's financial performance in the last decade.TW has achieved healthy revenue growth in the last 10 years, with a CAGR of 6  despite the recent decline. During this period, TW has consistently achieved good growth YoY, reflecting the quality of its business model.TW's business model revolves around the acquisition of land, planning, and development of residential properties. The company sells these properties to homebuyers, both private and affordable housing. TW's revenue is primarily generated through the sale of completed residential units.For this reason, the identification and acquisition of land for residential development is critical. This involves assessing potential sites, obtaining planning permissions, and managing the legal and regulatory aspects of land acquisition. Within the UK, there are strict planning rules in place to protect heritage sites, areas of nature, and other culturally important locations. Overarchingly, however, the dynamics of the UK housing market  which we will discuss later  means the UK Government is highly encouraging of Homebuilding.TW designs and constructs a wide range of homes, including apartments, townhouses, and detached houses. This allows the business to reach a broad range of consumers, maximizing its selling potential and reducing exposure to any single segment.TW has a long-standing presence in the UK property market, which gives it brand recognition and customer trust. Based on its size, it is only rivaled by a small number of other firms, most of whom have a similar reputation.TW emphasizes high-quality construction and energy-efficient features to meet modern living standards. The company , although lags behind some of its similarly sized peers. There has been an undertone of criticism for UK builders, primarily because they have been unable to match the quality of those pre-70s. A quick google search will have you convinced a property built in 1900 is superior in quality today than a new build  and they are likely correct . This said, new builds are improving following this criticism, and offer consumers convenience, a smooth buying process, a long warranty, and are ready to live in.The company operates across various regions in the UK, strategically selecting locations with high demand and growth potential for residential properties. This approach supports a reduction in exposure to any single region, allowing reducing the risk of a decline in demand or inability to sell homes. Unlike many of its peers, however, the business also builds in Spain  Tourist hotspots for Brits , marginally softening its reliance on the UK.The company aims to secure a significant portion of its sales before construction is completed, which provides more predictable revenue streams and reduces financial risks. For this reason, the business is somewhat  hedged  against downturns, as its costs are already covered by past earnings.The UK, similar to most of the Western world, has seen a rapid increase in inflation during 2021-2022, followed by a steady increase in interest rates to combat this. While the US has brought inflation down to below 5 , the UK and much of Europe have been less successful, primarily due to a greater reliance on importing Energy and Food.Our expectation is for the current trend to continue, with inflation slowly declining MoM, but requiring further rate hikes to ensure this decline is sustainable. We are now expecting rates to peak at 5.5-6  in 2024, before beginning a decline quicker decline from there.The impact on the housing market is substantial and we are already seeing the effects. UK house prices have declined at the .Tighter lending conditions during periods of high interest rates will limit the availability of mortgages for potential buyers. Further, high inflation and interest rates are reducing consumers' purchasing power, making it more challenging for potential homebuyers to be in a position to afford an acquisition.This is a major issue for TW, with projects currently under construction facing a softening of demand. This will encourage greater negotiation by those seeking to purchase, forcing TW to accept a reduced amount.As the following illustrates, UK housing affordability has declined over time  increase in affordability ratio , with a significant bump during the GFC, and likely another which we are currently experiencing. This will act to price more consumers out of the housing market and into the rental industry.This begs the question of what the wider impact will be in the coming years. Consumers are facing an unprecedented deterioration of their finances, with no clear route to reprieve. Many individuals will see a permanent decline in financial standing, essentially pricing them out of a new build purchase and setting them back years. UK Consumer Confidence illustrates this, currently at pandemic low levels.During times of high inflation, the costs of raw materials, labor, and other inputs for construction can increase significantly. TW faces challenges in managing rising construction costs in the medium term, likely impacting profit margins unless the increased costs can be passed on to buyers through higher property prices. This is usually what occurs during periods of inflation, however, the degree to which consumers are struggling means prices are unlikely to offset this.The UK housing industry is unique in that it has performed modesty well for centuries. Most recently, the industry bounced back well from the GFC, especially impressive given the rapid rise it experienced  fueled by foreign money . Countries like Italy and Spain are still struggling with house prices over a decade later.This inherent strength in the housing market is a reflection of two key factors. Firstly, and most simply, the UK is an incredibly attractive place to invest. Foreigners have been buying up properties, businesses, and anything they can get their hands on, with the promise of healthy returns and economic legal safety. With Brexit, this has certainly softened but remains the case.Secondly, the UK has a demand and supply imbalance. The UK is smaller than New Zealand in size  km2  while having a population of over 67 million  NZ has 5m . This naturally means the demand for housing is high, exacerbated by an aspirational culture of home ownership.Given these two factors, we believe the housing industry is inherently safe. The current conditions are highly concerning, and will likely take an extended period to correct. This said, we are not bearish on the UK housing industry as the fundamentals are not going away.TW faces competition from other UK-based residential property developers  which are listed later in this report . This somewhat restricts the earnings potential of the cohort, as they compete for land and development opportunities.TW'S margins have been incredibly consistent over the historical period, and impressively so in the LTM, owing to the factor mentioned previously. TW will only invest in locations that are neutral or accretive for the wider business and competition means it is unlikely to materially outperform this  and thus see margin appreciation over time .There is scope for technological development making the build process significantly quicker and cheaper, but it remains unclear when this will be possible at a mass market level.We expect margins to contract in the near term, as inflationary cost pressures and a lack of demand force the business to conceding in negotiations.The key takeaways from the H1 results areThese results are in line with our expectations. We forecast the business to end the year down  20 - 27 , owing to the likelihood of a larger decline in H2 following further rate hikes in the UK.TW's balance sheet remains robust, with a ND EBITDA ratio of  0.8 x and a sufficiently large cash position to fund operations in the coming year assuming no sales.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 5 years.Analysts are forecasting a  24  decline in FY23, followed by a 10  growth rate into FY27F. Margins are expected to materially decline, with a permanently lower level subsequently.We broadly agree with these forecasts, although we believe MSD growth into FY27 is more reasonable.Presented above is a comparison of TW to a cohort of its directly comparable peers, namely Persimmon , Barratt Developments , Bellway , Vistry , Berkeley , and Redrow .Margins are relatively standardized across the peer group, with no material difference between the group. The movement in FCF is volatile, reflecting differing approaches to current conditions  TW has continued to invest in inventory .Forecast growth suggests a strong weakness with TW, owing to its significant scale and core demographic. Declining earnings is the biggest obstacle currently, and TW is overly exposed.TW is currently trading at 5x LTM EBITDA and 7x NTM EBITDA.On an LTM basis, TW looks incredibly attractive. The stock is trading at a discount while being positioned well relative to the group and has a good portfolio of land.This view changes on a NTM basis. Given the decline the company is facing, the risk is that it quickly becomes overvalued. At a 4  discount to its peer group, but more importantly, facing a large decline in sales with an uncertain impact on margins, it is difficult to suggest there is upside at the current share price.The UK housing market is a modest investment choice in our view, particularly over an extended period of time. TW, among a cohort of a few leading developers, provides investors the ability to gain exposure to this industry.We expect a difficult period in the coming 12-18 months and TW is highly exposed. We see sales declining further and margins tightening.The performance beyond this should be good, however, to invest today feels premature.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Nike: Leading The Athletic Market With A Resilient DTC Strategy,"NIKE, Inc.  is the global leader in the athletic market, boasting diversification across product categories, geographical regions, and distribution channels. The company stands out with a compelling direct-to-consumer  DTC  strategy in the branded industry. A key aspect of this strategy is aNKE's  for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024To rebalance supply and demand, NKE is carefully managing sales into the retail channel and restricting inventory access to ensure a healthy marketplace. Notably, end-channel sales remain above NKE's expectations for a slightly increased revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Regarding the direct-to-consumer market in North America, the liquidation activity from the previous year, especially in the apparel segment, is now being compared, resulting in a net positive impact on merchandise margins. Sales growth, however, is under pressure as lower-quality transactions are avoided. While debates around the bull and bear case may persist until there is greater clarity on wholesale recovery and macroeconomic conditions. Nike continues to maintain a dominant position as a footwear brand, both in North America and globally, and its inventory has been adjusted to align with faster-growing sales, while the wholesale destocking is expected to conclude by the end of the year.In the upcoming second quarter, Nike foresees a slight increase in reported revenues. The company projects a gross profit margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to strategic pricing, better handling of markdowns, and reduced ocean freight costs. However, this gain will be partially offset by higher product input costs and around 50 basis points of adverse foreign exchange effects. The management also expects selling, general, and administrative expenses to rise in the mid-to-high single digits.Looking at the full year, Nike has reiterated its outlook, anticipating revenues to increase in the mid-single digits. The management projects a gross profit margin increase of 140-160 basis points, which includes roughly 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. SG A expenses are expected to slightly outpace revenues, particularly at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range. It's worth noting that the company anticipates only a  modest  improvement in markdowns for the rest of the year, suggesting there may be room for better-than-expected performance in this area.With 15  of its sales coming from China, Nike is in a good position to benefit from a rollback in COVID-19 restrictions in the region. The reopening may help growth continue to accelerate into 2024. The sales in China appear poised to keep surging as the country benefits from consumers returning to normal activities, going outside, and playing sports again. Currency-neutral revenue in China jumped 25  in fiscal 4Q ended May 31, but could accelerate significantly in the near term as demand ramps up and Nike launches hyper-local products, such as its Chinese New Year and Year of the Rabbit packs. Faster revenue growth may also benefit overall margins in my view, since China typically boasts the highest profitability, while inventories are relatively manageable. Nike has the  footwear market share in China and is No. 2 in apparel. In 4Q, 15  of Nike Brand sales came from China.Moreover, the contribution of China's sports industry to GDP could rise this year as more residents resume outdoor activities after the end of Beijing's Covid Zero policy. This would come after the contribution to GDP dipped to  in 2020 from 2019's 1.14  and remained at 1.07  in 2021. Covid disrupted many sports-related businesses and activities, which resulted in an 8  fall in the manufacturing of athletic goods. Widespread virus outbreaks across mainland China likely also limited the rise in purchases of sporting goods last year. This might have offset sports-related sales gains driven by the Beijing Winter Olympics.I believe Nike's dominance in sports can continue to foster brand success, given its sponsorship of some highest-ranked teams and players at key sporting events. During NCAA basketball's  March Madness  this year, Nike and its Jordan label sponsored 40 out of 68 . The brand also outfitted 13 of the 32 teams in the 2022 Men's World Cup soccer tournament, with two of them making it to the final four. Nike also has 13 of the 32 teams in the 2023 Women's World Cup, with seven of those ranked in the top 10, continuing to keep the brand in the spotlight. Nike also sponsors tennis players Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, ranked No. 2 in women's, and No.1- ranked men's player Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, which helps the brand's status for key tennis events like the just-completed Wimbledon and the upcoming US Open.Nike is actively working to reduce its inventories, which may lead to continued margin pressure due to increased discounts. Nike has already managed to bring down its previously high inventory levels, with growth remaining flat at the end of fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Nike has integrated personalized product recommendations into its e-commerce app to boost the sell-through of available inventory. Nike is trading at 26x forward PE, which is in line with the company's historical three-year average but represents a premium compared to global peers, which typically have lower P E ratios ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. The premium reflects the high-quality nature of Nike's business, its leading position in the appealing athletic category, margin-enhancing strategies  despite recent margin challenges , and a robust balance sheet. I believe that Nike continues to be a top-tier company with strong market positioning in both apparel and footwear, further bolstered by its strong digital capabilities. Moreover, Nike's deep connection with customers sets it apart from competitors, especially as consumers increasingly prefer brands that offer a unique experience in both physical stores and online. Hence, I remain bullish on the stock and assign a buy rating to the company.I see the biggest risk to a NKE recovery to be the weakening macro backdrop and potential for recession. Even in such a backdrop, I continue to see NKE as a relative brand and market share winner. While NKE would not be immune to a weaker demand backdrop, I believe a strong balance sheet, highly sought after products driving brand equity, and company-specific operational initiatives could still drive margin expansion from current levels. Moreover, competition has risen due to the industry's shift toward performance-oriented products, which has lowered barriers for new entrants, which may threaten the company's market share.Nike, Inc. is an established player in the global athletic market and is well-positioned for growth. The reopening in China is expected to drive continued sales growth as consumers return to normal activities, engage in outdoor sports, and drive demand for Nike products. Additionally, Nike's sponsorship of top teams and players in key sporting events further enhances its brand's success and visibility in the sports world. The company's direct-to-consumer strategy in the branded industry is particularly impressive. This strategy places a strong emphasis on the DTC channel, primarily through Nike Direct and strategic partnerships with marketplaces. The loyal customer base acquired during the pandemic is expected to make a positive impact on the company's profitability. Hence, I am bullish on the company and assign a buy rating to the stock.

Generac: 5 Key Takeaways From Analyst Day,"held its  conference on September 27th, and shares rose 5  on the affirmation of 2023 guidance and long-term targets that were higher than initially estimated and appear reasonable as inventories normalize and supplyManagement remains confident in long-term secular megatrends accelerating the value homeowners place on energy security. GNRC continues growing its portfolio of backup power and home energy control products.Generac presents a compelling investment proposition against the backdrop of a global shift towards energy resilience and self-sufficiency. The escalating adoption of solar plus storage solutions and the heightened interest in backup power, especially amidst a spate of weather-induced disruptions and grid instabilities, align well with the company's strategic direction. Generac's robust distribution network and strong brand recognition further solidify its potential for sustained growth and value addition in the coming years.During the conference, management reiterated its FY 2023 guidance and expects revenue of  4.02B to  4.11B and adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.5  to 16.5 , translating to an EBITDA of  623M to  678M. The Commercial   Industrial  C I  segment is expected to grow in the mid-teens, while the residential segment is expected to decline in the mid-twenties.This past year has posed significant challenges for GNRC as the imbalance between supply and demand drew investors' apprehension. The concerns largely stemmed from supply-side bottlenecks exacerbated by climate-induced severe weather, inadequate infrastructure investments, and regulatory penalties for carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the demand for Generac's solutions remains fueled by broader electrification trends, next-generation infrastructure initiatives, and the growing concept of home as a sanctuary.Management reasserting 2023 guidance is a subtle positive, alleviating investor fears over potential guidance downgrades. Amidst a backdrop of supply-side obstacles, this reiteration underscores Generac's strategic positioning to leverage the ongoing demand drivers, shedding a promising light on its ability to navigate the current market adversities. As Generac continues to adapt to the evolving market dynamics, its investment narrative encompasses a blend of challenges and opportunities lying ahead.GNRC expects to grow total revenues by 12  to 14  annually through 2026 and targets margins returning to its long-term average of 37.5  to 38.5  gross margin and 21.5  to 22.5  EBITDA margins in 2026, relative to 34  to 34.5  and 15.5  to 16.5  in 2023 guidance. The implied FY26 EBITDA doubling over FY23 guidance is predominately attributed to improving product mix, operating leverage, positive price dynamics, and less dilution from the energy technology segment.While GNRC looks for growth to tilt towards 2025-2026, expectations of a weaker consumer in 2024 are offset through  300mm of channel under-shipment during 2023, which should benefit residential growth regardless of end-demand next year.However, amidst the positive outlook across various segments, a pivotal assumption underpinning the 2026 targets is the increase in the energy technology mix to 21  from 12  in FY23. This ambitious stride may cause investor skepticism once more clarity is achieved regarding the recent execution challenges within that business segment.The current market penetration of 6  in residential Home Standby  HSB  underscores a significant growth opportunity. GNRC estimates the penetration will reach 7.8  by 2026, with each additional percentage point of penetration equating to a  3bn end-market revenue opportunity. This represents a unique opportunity to drive growth in a category with secular tailwinds by harnessing the power of full-funnel marketing and distribution development.In-home consultations are up four times from 2019 levels, close rates have rebounded off 1Q22 lows, and awareness data pointing to record Generac brand recognition underpins management's confidence in medium-term double-digit HSB growth.A notable demographic insight is that 65  of Generac's existing customer base comprises individuals over 60. This demographic implies a significant underrepresentation among new home buyers in millennials. It also indicates a potential growth tailwind as a new, energy-conscious generation transitions into homeownership.GNRC's energy technology segment has yet to meet external and internal expectations. The segment has refocused on a quality first product portfolio rebuild. Over the past year, management has focused on building a capable team, adding engineers, and increasing product testing standards to avoid product underperformance before being sold.While 2024 targets include executing 2023's groundwork, a return to strong growth and profitability is not expected until 2025 and 2026. Investor sentiment toward this business must be tampered and understand that 2023 is a reset year, with a meaningful step-up in 2024.The long-term outlook for this segment remains encouraging, with Generac aiming for a revenue of  700 million next year and breakeven profitability by 2026. The enhanced product slate encompasses residential offerings like an EV charger, solar inverter, and a next-gen storage system home energy controller. Meanwhile, the C I segment focuses on stationary and mobile storage beyond standby generators, connectivity, and grid services.The C I segment continues to experience secular tailwinds, prompting GNRC to build a 4th US facility in Beaver Dam, WI, with completion expected in early 2025. Within the US, C I customers seek more complex, full-service solutions to support grid-services opportunities, pushing demand for GNRC's beyond standby offerings.Telecommunications providers and data center operators emerge as pivotal customers underpinning growth plans, given their extensive capacity buildouts through the end of the decade and high energy reliability standards.The international outlook within the C I segment remains strong as accelerating Electric Vehicle  EV  penetration and a growing renewables mix forcing grid intermittency challenges and grid services incentives all buoy demand expectations. Notably, the C I segment constituted nearly 75  of GNRC's international product mix in 2022, attesting to its global significance.GNRC is currently trading at the lower end of its 52-week range, offering a potentially attractive valuation relative to its 2024-2025 earnings. The upbeat sentiment following investor day adds an appeal of a return to normalcy. However, a hold is recommended until tangible improvements in operational and financial efficiencies manifest, affirming the ambitious goal of doubling EBITDA by 2026 is more than just a lofty projection. The trajectory of the Residential, C I, and Energy Technology segments, both in the US and internationally, will be instrumental in translating Generac's strategic blueprints into tangible financial milestones, warranting close investor scrutiny.

BlackRock Is The Next Compounder You Should Own,"In the vast universe of equity markets, there's a unique type of stock that stands above all the others  Compounders. These rare entities are characterized by their ability to consistently compound returns at higher-than-average rates, providing investors with attractive long-term appreciation.One such opportunity presenting itself right now is BlackRock . This powerhouse has demonstrated the resilience and growth characteristics that all compounders share, backed by impressive supply and demand dynamics for its shares.Today, we'll take a look at what makes a compounder in our view, why BlackRock fits squarely into this category of companies, and why now is a great time to get involved in the stock.So, what exactly defines a compounder  As we just alluded to, compounders are companies that have unique characteristics that make them potentially great long-term investments.In our view, at its core, a compounder is a company that consistently increases its revenue and free cash flow while simultaneously reducing its share count. This potent combination creates a wealth-building engine for investors.Remember, for capital appreciation to occur, buyers and sellers in the market to agree that an asset's value has increased vs. the year before - this doesn't happen automatically.Instead, demand for shares needs to be stimulated, and the supply of shares needs to be shrinking.What drives demand for shares  More profits and an increasing scope of the business.What drives shrinking supply  Companies buying back shares.Take UnitedHealth Group , for instance. Over the past decade, UnitedHealth has displayed the quintessential traits of a compounder.Its TTM revenue has consistently grown, from  147 billion in 2015 to an astounding  348 billion in 2023, a testament to its strong market position and business strategy. In parallel, its free cash flow has increased from  8 billion to nearly  38 billion during the same periodMeanwhile, UNH's outstanding share count has steadily decreased due to its share buyback program, from 991 million shares in 2015 to around 940 million in 2023. This isn't as aggressive as some other buyback programs, but share count has still dropped by 5  in that time nonetheless.As a result, the company has seen a dramatic increase in share price, with a total return over that time of nearly 400Companies with the inverse characteristics  no demand growth and an increasing supply, struggle to hold onto gains. Verizon , a company like this, has seen essentially zero total returns over the same period of timeShifting our lens to BlackRock, the compounder qualities are readily apparent. Over the past seven years, BlackRock's TTM revenue has steadily grown from  11.4 billion to an impressive  18 billion, reflecting a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of  7Simultaneously, its TTM net income has soared from  3.1 billion to  5.1 billion, reflecting a compound growth rate of more than 7It's true that net income is been a bit 'lumpier' due to a transaction in 2018, but remove that and the overall trend is unmistakable.This is doubly as impressive given the ability for the company to keep its net margins stable around 29   again, remove the transaction in 2018That said, the magic of compounders lies not only in expanding financial results  and an increasing demand for shares , but also in a shrinking share count.During the same period as discussed above, BlackRock has diligently bought back shares, reducing the outstanding count from 168 million to 150 millionWhile this reduction only adds up to a  10  decrease in outstanding shares, this action, coupled with strong financial growth, enhances the value of remaining shares, thus benefiting long-term investors.Plus, the consistency of the reduction in supply is heartening.All of this seems well and good, but with a clear understanding of Company X's compounder characteristics, the question arises  Why nowIn short, because the current valuation presents an attractive looking entry point, and management is forecasting continued growth.At the moment, the stock currently trades at a 27x multiple of free cash flow, a bit lower than its five-year average of  30x. Similarly, its price-to-revenue ratio sits at an attractive 5.7x, compared to its historical range as pictured belowWhile some may view these multiples as elevated for a financial company  as Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating System does , we believe that a better comparison would be a company like Visa . Visa has similarly stellar operations, and trades within a similar range.Additionally, buyers at this point are getting the stock below the 5-year linear regression, within the lower band of standard deviation. Sure, buying BlackRock at 20x FCF would be ideal, but the opportunity may not present itself.In addition to the decent price, results have also begun to swing back around in favor of the bulls.While the company has done well in almost all market environments, late 2021 into 2022 was a rough spot for the company. Revenue was reduced somewhat, and net income dropped for the first time, organically, in a long timeThankfully, results are beginning to turn around, and management has begun to strike a more bullish tone. On the most recent earnings call, CFO Martin Small had the following to sayCEO Larry fink continuedThis growth in assets looks like its translating to a bottom in financial results, and potentially a bottom in the stock price.It's hard to pick out many risks for BlackRock, given the scale of its offerings and the ingrained nature of its business into the world economy.There are two potential ways we think the narrative around BlackRock could change meaningfully.First, if burdensome financial regulations come out that constrain BlackRock in some way, that could negatively impact the stock. We see an incredibly powerful moat around BlackRock's business, and thus one of the only entities capable of piercing it would be the U.S. Federal Government.Additionally, the company is making a big bet on its  Aladdin  software. Aladdin runs a considerable amount of the company's processes, and a cyber-attack could present a serious risk to BlackRock and its reputation going forward. If clients begin to perceive weakness in security of info or funds, we expect the stock will behave poorly.Overall though, BlackRock is a company with an incredibly small number of risk vectors.In conclusion, the investment thesis for BlackRock is compelling and straightforward.As a proven compounder, it has consistently demonstrated robust financial growth and efficient capital allocation. Its track record of increasing revenue and net income, coupled with a consistently decreasing share count, underscores its commitment to delivering shareholder value.Despite the recent bumps, BlackRock's strong fundamentals remain intact.Now, more than ever, represents an opportune moment for savvy investors to tap into this undervalued gem, poised to continue along its trajectory.

"Klabin: Q3 Earnings, Resilience In The Face Of Industry Challenges","The Brazilian pulp and paper giant Klabin  recently published its third-quarter results. Although these results were not outstanding, they indicate a positive sequential improvement.As I  in my initial article about the company, Klabin has recentlyDespite reporting a weak net profit, Klabin's third quarter showed promising results in its paper unit, with a recovery in packaging sales. Moreover, there are expectations of improved pulp prices in the future, although this business division had a weak performance in the current quarter.The lack of more significant revenue growth for Klabin should not necessarilyTherefore, I believe that, despite not reporting an outstanding quarter, Klabin has maintained stable numbers without a significant decline, which is a positive outcome. Furthermore, the company remains well-positioned to continue distributing substantial dividends over the coming years.Klabin  its third-quarter figures, reporting an EBITDA of R 1.352 billion. This represents a modest quarterly increase of 0.6  but a year-over-year decline of 41 . Adverse exchange rate variations impacted the financial results as the reduction in biological assets resulted in a net profit of R 258 million, marking a quarterly drop of 73.4  and an annual drop of 87.4 .On the other hand, the company's revenues showed marginal growth, reported at R 4.4 billion, a 2.5  increase quarter-over-quarter, although still 19.8  below the same period last year.The positive surprise came from the pulp business, where increased volumes  up 27.4  compared to the previous quarter  and lower costs  down 3.6  compared to the last quarter  were observed.An additional significant point to note is the increase in net debt, which rose to R 20.9 billion, compared to R 19.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This led to a higher leverage ratio of 3.2 times the net debt EBITDA, compared to 2.6 times in the second quarter of 2023. This represents a reversal of the company's recent deleveraging efforts following the completion of the Puma II project. However, it's worth noting that the Puma II project is expected to enhance the company's profitability over the next few years.Klabin's consolidated return, measured by the return on invested capital  ROIC  metric, was 13.8  in June 2023, marking a 5.5 percentage point decline compared to last year. Klabin attributes this retraction to the reduced operating cash flow and the capital increase employed.Breaking down the company's results by segment, here are the following key highlightsPulp volumes saw a strong performance, with a reported volume of 425k. Sales of Short Fiber reached 315kt, marking a 29.0  increase quarter-on-quarter and a 6.6  rise year-on-year. Long Fiber   Fluff also reached 111kt, recording a further 23  increase quarter-on-quarter but a slight 4.2  decline year-on-year.According to the company, the increase in volume was mainly attributed to improved demand in Asia and greater efficiency at the Puma I unit following scheduled maintenance stoppages.Despite the weak dynamics in Kraftliner, the third-quarter volume reached 102kt, reflecting a 4.4  increase in the quarter but a substantial 27.7  year-on-year decline. This suggests a short-term sequential improvement, primarily driven by the ramp-up of MP28. MP28 is commencing containerboard production, with plans for a small conversion of cardboard boxes soon.However, in the face of a more challenging international environment, the price situation for Kraftliner is expected to remain relatively weak. The increase in US exports disrupts the international supply and demand balance, resulting in realized product prices of R 3,400 t. This represents a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 14.8  and a year-on-year decline of 35.2 .Paperboard experienced a lower volume primarily due to the 11-day scheduled maintenance stoppage at Monte Alegre. However, this decline was partially offset by the commencement of the MP28 ramp-up, resulting in a sales volume of 165kt. This reflects a modest drop of 2.5  in the quarter and a decrease of 9.2  over the year.Corrugated boards, on the other hand, entered a more favorable seasonal period but still faced challenges in passing on price increases. There was an uptick in volume in the year's second half in preparation for the holiday season. Corrugated sales reached 226kt, marking a 4.6  quarterly increase. Given the frequent corrections in prices due to inflation and Brazilian GDP growth, corrugated paper prices retracted to R 5,850 t. This represents a 1.1  decrease quarter-on-quarter and a 1.8  increase year-over-year.I remain skeptical that the third quarter marked a turning point for Klabin, indicating a return to significant operational growth.While the overall results in 3Q23 were not as dire as they could have been, I anticipate that Q4 could still present challenges, particularly for the paper and packaging division. However, there are prospects for improvement in the pulp segment. Additionally, higher pulp prices in China offset ongoing cost inflation and the marginal recovery of pulp and kraftliner prices in Europe. Hence, the potential for a full-scale recovery seems limited due to the persistent oversupply resulting from recent capacity expansions in pulp, kraftliner, and paperboard.Although pulp prices have  some recent recovery, with two price increases implemented for the Chinese market, the current price level is likely unsustainable. I do not foresee a sustained upward trend in the commodity's price. It's worth noting that if selling prices increase, the company can maintain or even enhance its profit margins, benefiting shareholders.Klabin has announced the approval of the distribution of interest on shareholders' equity  JCP  in the total amount of R 319 million to shareholders, equivalent to  0.11 per share.This practice, specific to the Brazilian tax system and corporate finance, involves companies paying interest to their shareholders on the equity invested in the company. It has distinct tax implications in Brazil. Unlike dividends, JCP is accounted for as an  expense  for companies, reducing taxable net income.Considering that one analyst estimates Klabin's EPS for 2023 at  1.66, this represents a 56  increase. To achieve this, the company must report a net profit of  1,316.4 million in 2023, which I believe is still feasible. Therefore, considering Klabin's expected payout for 2023 of 54.1 , this would result in a dividend per share of  0.13. Since the company pays quarterly dividends, Klabin's dividend yield would be approximately 5.8 , with an annual payout of  0.52.Assuming a more conservative return on investment  ROI  of 5 , with Klabin's current share price at  8.90, this would indicate a fair value of  13.60, representing an upside of 52.8  in my assessment. This is close to the levels seen in 2021 and early 2022, during a solid upside in the kraft pulp cycle.While some investors may find Klabin's quarter uneventful and lacking revenue and profit growth surprises, I view it differently. Given the persistently challenging sector conditions characterized by low pulp prices, the results were not disappointing and can be considered positive.The key highlights include the paper and packaging volume growth despite scheduled paperboard maintenance. Additionally, the substantial volume of pulp sales is noteworthy, driven by operational improvements following the stoppage at Puma I in the previous quarter.However, there are less favorable aspects to consider. Kraftliner continues to face pricing challenges due to international factors. EBITDA did not exhibit significant quarterly growth, with paper sales declining while pulp sales increased. Furthermore, the bottom line was weak, partly due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations impacting the financial result.Nevertheless, the company is expected to continue distributing substantial dividends in the upcoming quarters, and we will likely see a yield of between 5  and 6 . Considering the current valuation is heavily discounted, I reaffirm my bullish outlook on Klabin following the Q3 earnings release.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Alpha Metallurgical Resources: Set To Double If Met Coal Prices Remain Stable,"In my opinion, Alpha Metallurgical Resources  presents a buy opportunity, particularly for investors interested in a complex yet potentially lucrative play in the commodities arena. The company is well-positioned in the metallurgical coal sector, which is poisedAlpha Metallurgical Resources is a mining company specializing in the production and sale of met and thermal coal, primarily operating in Virginia and West Virginia. What a lot of investors fail to realise is that over 95  of AMR's shipments consist of metallurgical coal, meaning that the company is not subject to the secular downtrend which is seen in the demand for thermal coal.In my opinion, the investment case for metallurgical coal is often misunderstood, overshadowed by the broader narrative surrounding the decline of coal as an energy source. While it's true that thermal coal faces challenges from renewable energy and environmental regulations, metallurgical coal operates in a different market with unique dynamics. It commands a higher price due to its specialized role in steel production, a sector that sees increased demand as countries develop and modernize their infrastructure. This price premium can offer potentially higher returns for investors. Additionally, the global push for infrastructure growth further boosts the demand for metallurgical coal, making it a potentially lucrative investment. Unlike thermal coal, which is increasingly being replaced by renewable energy sources, there are fewer substitutes for metallurgical coal in steel production. This lends it a level of market stability that thermal coal lacks. I believe that when these factors are considered collectively, metallurgical coal emerges as a more attractive and misunderstood investment opportunity compared to thermal coal.In my opinion, the future outlook for metallurgical coal is promising, particularly when considering global steel demand trends. According to forecasts, global steel demand is expected to grow at a rate of  through 2024. Even more compelling is the projection for India, where steel demand is anticipated to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate  CAGR  of 4.4  up to 2050. These figures indicate not only a sustained but also a growing need for steel, and by extension, metallurgical coal. Such growth trajectories in steel demand, especially in emerging markets like India, bolster the investment case for metallurgical coal.While the future demand prospects on met coal are positive, I believe investors must remember that the cyclical nature of metallurgical coal demand makes it particularly susceptible to economic downturns and sector-specific crises, such as China's housing troubles. Given that China is one of the world's largest consumers of steel, a housing crisis there would likely result in a significant reduction in construction activities. This, in turn, would diminish the demand for steel and, consequently, met coal. Similarly, a global recession would generally lead to a decrease in manufacturing and construction, further affecting met coal demand. If a macroeconomic downturn was to occur, this would almost certainly lower the average met coal selling price, therefore causing significant pressure on AMR's margins and free cash flow.In my opinion, Alpha Metallurgical Resources is strategically positioned as the USA's largest and most diverse supplier of metallurgical coal, a fact underscored by its commanding 21  share of the nation's total metallurgical coal production as of 2022. This dominant stance is further amplified by AMR's well-thought-out shipment mix, which is balanced between 30  domestic and 70  international markets. India, a burgeoning market for steel, has been a cornerstone in AMR's export strategy, accounting for about 33  of its export sales over the past five years. This aligns exceptionally well with India's projected growth in steel demand. Beyond India, AMR has wisely diversified its customer base by supplying to other international markets, thereby reducing its dependency on any single market. I believe this diversified approach significantly bolsters AMR's resilience and growth prospects in the metallurgical coal sector.In my view, Alpha Metallurgical Resources is well-positioned to capitalize on operational leverage, especially given its leading role in the U.S. metallurgical coal market. The company's scale allows it to optimize operations and minimize per-unit costs effectively. This advantage is evident in AMR's 2023 guidance, where the average selling price per ton for its met coal segment is projected to be  178.42. In contrast, the production cost per ton is expected to be around  109.00, based on the midpoint of their 2023 guidance. This significant margin between selling price and production cost exemplifies how operational leverage can amplify profitability. As long as the average selling price for met coal remain close to current level, the company is poised to produce significant free cash flow.In my opinion, one of the most compelling aspects of Alpha Metallurgical Resources is its ability to manage operating expenses effectively while scaling revenues. In 2018, the company reported revenues of  with operating expenses at  139.34 million. Fast forward to 2022, and AMR's revenue more than doubled to  4,092.99 million. Total operating expenses only saw a modest increase to  218.98 million. This demonstrates that as revenues have grown, AMR has been able to keep its operating expenses relatively stable, thereby leveraging operational efficiencies to boost profitability. This is a strong indicator of effective cost management and operational excellence.As with any commodity, the price action is driven by the fundamental principles of supply and demand, and metallurgical coal is no exception to this rule. We have already discussed the demand side of met coal as it relates to steel demand. However, on the supply side, in general met coal producers have decreased growth capital expenditure, therefore constraining supply of met coal, thus enabling and in my opinion sustaining higher than normal met coal prices. I believe this supply side constraint to be driven by stricter environmental regulations and a tougher borrowing environment that have made it less favourable for met coal businesses to reinvest back into their own business for growth, hence restricting supply of met coal. We can see that despite AMR's significant free cash flow generation over the past year, the management team has opted to keep capital expenditures relatively in line with prior years which should aid in keeping met coal selling prices well above the production costs.As of the most recent quarter, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of . The company's total debt stands at  2.87 million, a modest amount that reflects the managements conservative approach to leverage. We can see that AMR's management team are proactive in paying down debt as seen below. We can see that since 2020, AMR's debt was reduced from  551.70 million down to effectively zero as of today. This approach to handling debt significantly reduces risk and protects the business should it enter some sort of major economic downturn.Since Q1 2022, Alpha Metallurgical Resources has been actively engaged in share buybacks, reducing its shares outstanding from 19.17 million to 16.25 million as of Q2 2023 based on the average annual shares outstanding. This represents a significant decrease of approximately 15.2 . As of July 31, 2023, the number of common stock shares outstanding was approximately 13.7 million. Furthermore, the company still has  350 million left on its current share repurchase program, indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. Interestingly, AMR has announced that its dividend program will cease at the end of 2023. While this may initially seem counterintuitive, it actually signals that the management team views the business as undervalued by the market. By reallocating capital that would have been used for dividends towards additional share buybacks, the company aims to capitalize on this perceived undervaluation. The management team has expressed intentions to continue allocating capital to buybacks until the market recognizes the real value of AMR. In my opinion, this strategy reflects a proactive approach to capital allocation and demonstrates confidence in the company's intrinsic value. Based on a 2.5  annual shipment growth over the next 3 years and an annual decrease in average selling price per ton of 5  per year, the 2025 expected gross profit is  1,125 million. Once accounting for other expenses as seen below, it is expected that in this scenario that free cash flow will be  594 million,  569 million and  542 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. If the free cash flow is then used to repurchase shares, the 2025 share count should be around 8.5 million. When implementing the current price to free cash flow of 5 on 2025 free cash flow, this gives an end of 2025 share price of  340.86 and a CAGR of 26 .It should be noted that valuing a business that relies on commodity pricing is inherently challenging and the above valuation assumes that the average price of met coal stays around current levels over the next few years. Should we enter a recession in the next 12 months, it is likely that met coal prices will fall dramatically, hence likely so will AMR's share price.I believe that Alpha Metallurgical Resources offers a nuanced but compelling investment opportunity. The company stands to benefit from promising long-term demand prospects in the metallurgical coal market, which aligns well with global infrastructure growth. However, it's crucial to consider that AMR is not immune to economic downturns, given the cyclical nature of met coal. Operationally, I think AMR's effective use of leverage is a key strength, generating significant free cash flow. This is further supported by a constrained supply environment that could sustain high met coal prices. The company's aggressive share buyback strategy also speaks volumes about management's confidence in its undervalued stock. If met coal prices maintain their current levels, I believe AMR stock has the potential to double by the end of 2025, offering a lucrative opportunity for investors.

TC Energy: Growth Business Strategy And Attractive 7.5% Dividend Yield Make Stock Appealing,"TC Energy  is a prominent energy infrastructure company operating in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. TC Energy's main financial drivers are related to its extensive infrastructure assets and commercial agreements. The company has comprehensive operations in natural gas andAfter the downturn of 2020 and other supply constraints like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, everyone realized that all forms of energy are required to make countries capable of meeting energy demand. As I explained in my previous , TC Energy's separated assets and infrastructures in a wide range of energy platforms make it prominent. In minutiae, the company has facilities for transporting natural gas fromIt is worth noting that an unforeseen incident in the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline caused the management to drop their operations at reduced pressure in late July.  The cause of the failure is currently unknown, but based on initial observations of the failed pipe, environmental cracking is the suspected cause.  Based on the  report. Although the company returned to service the adjacent parts of the pipeline system that were not impacted by the incident directly, we may see this impact on the company's third-quarter operation results. The reduced pressure at the Columbia Gas Transmission caused TRP stock price to drop by 13  however, it is not a concern as the infrastructure and operations will be fixed soon.As you may all know, after global events last year and the energy constraints, the management  to separate into two businesses to keep the strength of each balance sheet and take advantage of tax incentives for higher growth opportunities. Through this spin-off, TC Energy moved toward a more regulated business model related to renewables. For instance, approximately 75  of TRP's comparable EBITDA will be from nuclear and firming resources by the end of 2030, which are highly regulated.The spin-off brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96  of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and long-term contracts, which will diminish its risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent. As a result, the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7  comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026. On the other hand, the management plans to sustain their capital spending at a minimum range and thus expects ample free cash flow in the coming years. With the mentioned free cash flow, their shareholder returns and leverage conditions are expected to improve.As Figure 1 demonstrates, TRP's operating cash flow increased by 17  to approximately  5.5 billion in TTM versus  4.7 billion at the end of 2022. Although the high amount of capital expenditures of  5.5 billion in TTM led to  476 million of free cash outflow, the company is expected to generate more cash flow from operations due to their spin-off, thereby generating higher free cash flow in the future. In the second quarter of 2023, TC Energy paid CAD 0.96 dividend cash, which based on their 1,029,000,000 outstanding shares, accounts for CAD 987.8 million or approximately  1.28 billion of dividend payment. The company's cash from operation was enough to cover their dividend payment. It is worth noting that capital spending usually is paid by debt and equity financing in the companies in this industry.Figure 1 - TRP's cash structure  in millionsTC Energy provides a 7.45  dividend yield, which is an attractive element of the company. Also, as Figure 2 illustrates, their yield has been on a growing path during the last ten years. In addition, as the management asserted, their liquids business expects to grow its dividend by 2-3  yearly by 2026. Furthermore, TRP's PE ratio of 49x shows a considerable plunge year-to-date, which is another sign that the stock is cheap now and is likely to recover. As a result, currently, TC Energy's financials offer both capital appreciation and increasing dividend yield, while the stock is lower than its historical records.Figure 2Analyzing the company's capital structure indicates that TC Energy could improve its cash balance to the same level as before the 2020 outbreak and reach more than  1.2 billion of cash generation in TTM. In addition, their net debt level increased to over  45 billion in TTM, which shows the company's higher-than-expected costs from projects like the Coastal GasLink pipeline.Regarding the company's deleveraging, it is good to hear that the management has made deleveraging a priority and thus took their first step of selling 40  of interest in their Columbia Pipelines to GIP in the recent quarter. With this transaction, the management targets to improve their leverage condition considerably and reach a leverage ratio of 4.75x. As they mentionedIt is worth mentioning that the management made more efforts for deleveraging, including filing the sale of its stake in its Nova Gas Transmission System  NGTL  in Western Canada in .  The NGTL system connects the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which produces most of the natural gas in western Canada, to domestic and export markets.  This selling would assist them in declining their debt levels and incline their capability of providing shareholder returns.Figure 3 - TRP's capital structure  in millionsDespite TC Energy's solid financials and sustainable dividend yield, the company is not secure from risks related to temperatures and the impact of climate change on both their services demand and their infrastructures. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the company is pursuing a highly regulated business model, as a result, Governments policies and regulations related to decarbonization and energy transition may affect energy supply and demand and TRP's operations and cash flows. Moreover, TC Energy is growing its investments and increasing its capital spending on several projects. If the management cannot pursue their deleveraging process, they may face hardship in generating revenue and shareholder distributions.TC Energy has a prominent position to meet energy demand in the future. TRP is a leading midstream company that has the largest natural gas networks in the North America. Furthermore, the spin-off brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96  of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and long-term contracts, which will diminish their risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent. Also, the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7  comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026, which brings 3-5  annual growth for their dividend. When all was said and done, the company's year-to-date PE ratio is very low, which shows that the stock price is very cheap now and will recover. Looking ahead, I believe that the management's growth business strategy coupled with attractive 7.5  dividend yield make the stock still appealing for investment.As always, thank you for reading, and I appreciate your comments.

PubMatic: Small Company In A Highly Competitive Market,"PubMatic  is a company that went public in 2020, capitalizing on the strong appetite for risk in the market at the time. However, since its IPO, the share price has declined by 50 , primarily due to the overvaluation atDespite operating in a market poised for  in the coming years and achieving solid returns with Net Income margins of 12 , I believe the company faces a challenging task in maintaining or gaining market share. This is especially true given that some of its key competitors include industry giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta.In this article, we will delve into the composition of the digital advertising ecosystem, provide a valuation of PubMatic, and outlinePubMatic is a company that operates in the digital advertising technology industry. It provides a platform that enables publishers to automate and optimize the management of their digital advertising inventory. This includes tools for programmatic advertising, real-time bidding, and other solutions to help publishers maximize their advertising revenue.At the heart of Digital Marketing are , which serve as the bridge between supply and demand, acting as the meeting point for  and . For instance, when brands like Coca-Cola or Nike  the Advertisers  want to conduct digital advertising - that is, to occupy digital spaces with images and videos of their products - they must purchase ad space from Publishers. In our example, this Publisher would be a digital newspaper like The Wall Street Journal. These ad spaces in the newspapers are obtained through the aforementioned Ad Exchanges. However, it's important to note that Ad Exchanges don't directly sell ad spaces to Advertisers  rather, they auction them. As a result, if Advertisers want to secure ad placements in these newspapers, they must compete with each other to place the highest bid.These  charge a commission for each closed exchange operation, and some examples include Google's AdX, OpenX, and Xandr. Essentially, this is the technology where the auction and sale of impressions, also known as 'inventory,' take place. This inventory can come in various formats, including display, video, ads in apps like Facebook and Instagram, and other types of digital advertising that we are all familiar with.The ad spaces offered by the  contain valuable information for the , such as the type of device where they will appear, the time of day, the location of the ad, the geographical location of the user, website information, and more. Now, while Advertisers could manually evaluate each auction one by one, as you can imagine, this would be very labor-intensive and resource-intensive. This is why there are tools called s  Demand-Side Platforms  that automate the process of evaluating the conditions proposed by the Publishers. They use algorithms to search and aggregate rates from different networks into a single platform and determine the optimal price to offer in the auction. Some well-known DSPs include The Trade Desk, Meta DSP, or Amazon DSP.Just as Advertisers use DSPs to evaluate multiple rates offered in Ad Exchanges like Google Ads and OpenX, Publishers like The Wall Street Journal have tools called s  Supply-Side Platforms  to connect with multiple Ad Exchanges instead of offering their inventory on just one platform. This strategy allows them to generate greater competition for their ad space, potentially leading to higher selling prices. SSPs help Publishers manage and optimize their ad inventory by providing tools to control and analyze the performance of their digital advertising. And . However, it's worth noting that there are enormous competitors in this space, such as Google, Amazon, and even Verizon, as can be seen in this  of SSPs used by US publishers.This complicates the task of gaining market share, given that Google and Amazon have almost complete vertical integration within the ecosystem. They function as DSPs, SSPs, Ad Exchanges, and even Publishers when digital ads are intended for platforms like Google Search or Amazon. Consequently, it may be more straightforward for clients to collaborate with these industry giants, renowned for their excellent reputation, rather than taking the risk of trying PubMatic's services.In the last 5 years, the company's revenues have experienced extraordinary annual growth of 28 , while maintaining high profitability, with the FCF margin averaging around 15 . However, in FY2022, it reached 20 .One positive aspect contributing to the company's cost control is its ownership of its own servers. Several years ago, the management team recognized that, to become a serious player in the industry, they should build their own servers rather than opting for the traditional approach taken by many technology companies, which is to outsource to Amazon AWS. This strategic decision has allowed them to maintain a relatively stable cost base and has been a key driver of operating leverage.In addition, the company has consistently maintained returns on its capital employed at around 15 . This suggests that a significant portion of profits can be reinvested into the company, as each investment generates a more than satisfactory return. The fact that the company is achieving substantial returns on its investments is particularly significant, given that it is allocating a significant amount of CapEx to the continued construction of its own data centers, as we will explore later.Since 2020, at least 10  of revenues has been allocated to CapEx, as mentioned earlier. This investment is primarily directed toward constructing their own data centers and gaining better control over their costs. As the company continues to scale and establish more data centers, it is likely that this CapEx spending will decrease, potentially impacting the Free Cash Flow Margin as it expands.Something I consider negative is that PubMatic faces the typical silent killer of technology companies  Stock-Based Compensation  SBC . In recent years, SBC has accounted for more than 20  of Free Cash Flow. This is a substantial amount, and I would prefer to deduct it from Free Cash Flow since it doesn't represent an actual cash inflow. SBC primarily serves as a means to attract talent without the need for cash payments.If PubMatic were to cease issuing shares as part of employee compensation, it could result in either the loss of employees or the necessity to pay them with cash. Neither of these scenarios seems positive, so it's common for SBC levels to be maintained in the medium and long term. By subtracting SBC from Free Cash Flow, the margin would be around 12 , which is quite a distance from the 20  seen in FY2022.For the valuation, I will perform a Reverse DCF analysis to determine the implied growth rate in the current share price based on FY2022 data. Here are the relevant figuresUsing this data and the stated assumptions, achieving a 15  compound annual growth rate on the current share price would require Free Cash Flow to grow by 15  annually. This growth rate appears quite realistic and could be realized through a combination of revenue growth and an expansion in the FCF margin, as discussed in the Key Ratios section.  The digital advertising technology space is highly competitive, featuring numerous established players and startups. As we've observed, Google, Amazon, and Meta are dominant figures across a significant portion of the ecosystem. Consequently, this intense competition can result in pricing pressures and diminished profit margins. Furthermore, the industry has been witnessing a trend toward consolidation, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones. PubMatic may face the risk of being acquired by a larger competitor or ceding market share to companies with greater resources. Rapid advancements in technology, including changes in ad formats, tracking regulations  such as GDPR and CCPA , and shifts in consumer behavior like the use of ad-blockers, can impact PubMatic's ability to provide effective advertising solutions. For instance, the Apple IDFA and Cookies issue emerged unexpectedly and temporarily disrupted the digital advertising industry. This is a highly dynamic industry that, as history has shown  with traditional advertising , can render businesses obsolete in a matter of just a few years. Economic downturns can result in reduced advertising budgets, directly impacting PubMatic's revenues as advertisers scale back their spending. In fact, we have already observed this trend over the last few quarters, with YoY growth slowing to less than 1  since Q4 2022.While PubMatic's role within the digital advertising ecosystem appears attractive, I find it challenging for PubMatic to emerge as the 'winning horse' when competing against giants like Google and Amazon. The fact that it ranked as the fourth most used SSP in 2021 is a positive sign. Additionally, the digital advertising market is expected to grow by around 13  in the coming years, which should provide tailwinds for the company. However, I remain uncertain about how PubMatic will sustain relevance in an industry where differentiation relies on easily replicable technology, especially when it is not even the largest competitor.Therefore, despite the current valuation not being unfavorable, I have chosen to assign it a  rating. I believe that there are better options available in the current market, some of which may be equally or even more affordable, particularly outside of the United States.

The 10-Year Treasury Rate May Be Heading Over 5%,"The 10-Year Treasury rate has exploded higher in recent weeks and may still have much further to climb. The yield moved above its October highs on Aug. 21, rising to 4.34 , its highest in a decade, and could reach 5  over the next severalSeveral factors are currently driving higher rates at the long end of the curve. One is the massive debt that the US government plans to issue. Another reason is that rates in Japan are rising after the Bank of Japan decided to increase the ceiling on its 10-year note to 1  from 50 bps. Japan's accommodative monetary policy has acted as an anchor helping to keep rates globally planted lower. Finally, growth in the US has been much more robust than expected, despite all of the rate hikes, and that could be a sign that the economy is just running atIf you look at the 10-year rate from a purely technical standpoint, it could be heading to around 5.05  on a conservative basis or 5.65  when viewing it more aggressively. The pattern formed over the last several months appears to be a bull flag, a continuation pattern of the previous move higher.But also from a fundamental perspective, since 1961, the US 10-year typically trades above the core PCE y y inflation rate. There have only been a few occasions the 10-year rate fell below the core PCE rate in 1974 and 1975. The other time was a fractional move below in 2011 and 2012, and 2016. The current period since 2020 has not only seen the 10-year rate trade below core PCE by the most significant amount but the most extended length of time. How high the 10-year rate needs to rise from here will primarily depend on the path of core inflation and how quickly it continues to come down.Additionally, over 10-year Treasury rates tend to trade with the velocity of money, just a simple ratio of nominal GDP divided by the money supply. In this case, the broadest measure of the velocity of money, or the velocity of MZM, has tended to have the strongest relationship with the 10-year Treasury rate. Now, MZM is no longer calculated as of the end of 2020. But since the year 2000, the velocity of M2, for the most part, followed the path of the velocity of MZM, and what the velocity of M2 shows us is the pace at which money passes through the economy is rising, something it hasn't done in many years.In its simplest form, the supply of M2 is shrinking while nominal GDP growth is rising, which tells us that the velocity of M2 or money, in general, is increasing  therefore, rates are rising. As long as we remain in a period where the velocity of M2 is pushing higher, it seems likely that momentum in Treasury rates will continue to go higher.One reason the M2 money supply is falling is that Bank deposits are falling  M2 money supply bank deposits track each other closely over time, suggesting that the recent turn higher in the M2 money supply isn't likely to last and may flatten out or turn lower from here again. As long as the economy remains solid and nominal growth continues to outpace growth in M2, then it seems probable that the velocity of M2 will increase again in the third quarter. The bond market may be anticipating that velocity increase, so rates are rising to accommodate that.While, in this case, the velocity of money doesn't tell us exactly where rates should be, it tells us that the dollars are circulating through the economy quickly, and there's great demand for goods and services. But with the money supply shrinking at the moment, it's creating a scenario of rising prices, which suggests that inflation will likely be sticking around until the money supply and economic growth come back into balance.The Fed is trying to deal with the demand side of the equation by raising rates and slowing economic growth. But given the size of nominal GDP growth, the US economy may require the creation of more money supply at this point to bring supply and demand back into balance.The recent 10-year rise may have to do with more structural changes to the economy and may reflect a market accepting that rates may be permanently higher for longer due to higher economic growth rates and slower growth in the money supply. This is likely to have broad impacts on valuations across many asset classes, including lower valuation for stocks, unless earnings growth rates can compensate for the higher risk-free rate of return. helps readers cut through all the noise delivering stock ideas and market updates, and looking for opportunities.We use a repeated and detailed process of watching the fundamental trends, technical charts, and options trading data.

URA ETF: A Gateway To The Uranium Industry,"Global X Uranium  is an ETF that tracks uranium equities. Here I describe the reasons to be bullish on uranium, the key element in the generation of nuclear energy.My analysis focuses onOn this occasion, I haven't focused my discussion on the supply-demand balance question facing uranium, but you can see this neatly described below in graphic form.Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear reactors, and utilities require uranium to meet the  that is expected to build into the middle of this decade, highlighted above.Without furtherI believe that nuclear energy has a crucial role to play in complementing green energy sources as we transition towards a more sustainable future. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are undoubtedly vital, they do have limitations, such as intermittency and energy storage challenges. Nuclear power offers a compelling solution by providing a steady, low-carbon source of electricity.I'll repeat this for emphasis. Nuclear power can replace our use of fossil fuels because it has four criteria.If you notice in the above 4 criteria, I could have said the same thing about fossil fuels. But nuclear energy brings one more important characteristic to the table, it's a low-carbon source. This makes nuclear power an essential ally in our battle against climate change. By integrating nuclear energy into the energy supply sources, we can make substantial strides in reducing our carbon footprint while ensuring a consistent power supply.Furthermore, nuclear power provides base load electricity generation, contributing to grid stability. While renewables rely on weather conditions, nuclear reactors can operate continuously, delivering a reliable source of electricity day and night. This reliability is crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring a consistent power supply, even when renewable sources face fluctuations in generation.What's more, above we see Siemens Energy's  share price, one of the biggest manufacturers of wind turbines.Wind turbines, despite their potential for generating renewable energy, often face economic challenges that hinder their viability for a complete energy transition. Yes, I've singled out Siemens, but you may read around, that the impact is broad across both onshore and offshore wind turbines. On top of that, putting aside the high upfront costs, maintaining wind turbines can be prohibitively high.However, I believe one of the biggest problems facing both solar and wind turbines is its struggle with electrical grid integration. This is something that I believe is missing from the discussion at a high level.Everyone is focusing on renewable energy's lack of reliability to consistently produce energy, but too few are considering the substantial amount of energy storage solutions required to make the system viable.Also, nuclear energy enhances energy security by . What I'm describing here is incorporating nuclear power into our energy mix, can bolster our energy resilience, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.Global X Uranium is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to companies involved in the uranium mining industry. By investing in this ETF, investors can gain exposure to the uranium industry without directly owning the underlying stocks of individual companies. The upside here is obvious, it's a case of diversification that helps spread the risk while offering the potential growth of the nuclear energy sector.As you can see above, nearly a quarter of this ETF is made up of Cameco . Consequently, if Cameco continues to perform strongly, this ETF will also perform strongly.It depends on one's view of uranium. Recall, that many of the companies in the EFT, outside Cameco and Kazatomprom  the world's biggest uranium producer  are not in production at this point. This means they have no revenues  or profits . Investors are buying into the future prospects of uranium.I've alluded to this above. Now to make it more explicit. Cameco is a great business. But they hedge their production to uranium prices, see below.There are some ladders built into Cameco's long-term contracts, but for the most part, Personally, I've sought to invest in Uranium Energy Corporation , as that business is fully unhedged. But as you know, that implies substantial volatility. Something you will not get with URA.I'm bullish on Global X Uranium  URA . The rationale behind my optimism centers on nuclear energy's pivotal role as a complementary source of green energy. While renewables like solar and wind are crucial, they face limitations like intermittency and storage challenges.Investing in Global X Uranium allows exposure to the uranium mining industry without directly owning individual company stocks. This ETF's diversification spreads risk while capitalizing on the potential growth of the nuclear energy sector. It's important to note that a significant portion of this ETF is tied to Cameco, which can positively impact URA's performance if Cameco continues to perform well. However, one drawback of investing in Global X Uranium is that it may not benefit significantly from surging uranium prices due to its hedging. For those seeking less hedged exposure, businesses like Uranium Energy Corporation  UEC  might be worth considering, although they will come with greater volatility than URA. It very much depends on one's risk appetite and tolerance.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

"Heartland Express Looks Undervalued, But The Trucking Cycle Has Struggled To Find A Bottom In 2023","One of the challenges of investing in cyclical companies is that no two cycles are ever the same and that creates a lot of modeling challenges. In the truckload  or TL  part of the trucking industry, for instance, capacity has been slower toThis makes sense - smaller carriers went into this downturn with more cash in the bank after the boom, so could withstand lower rates for longer, and inventories were inflated by companies needing to keep higher inventories on hand to offset supply chain risk   but it has nevertheless complicated modeling and led to a lot of disappointment this year. In particular, both shipping volumes and pricing have been weaker than I expected and what looked like a 2H 23 recovery is nowSince ,  shares have lost a little less than 10  of their value. That s not too bad relative to other TL carriers   is down 13 ,   is down over 10 , and   is down 15 , while   is down about 2 , but I wasn t recommending Heartland as an early-stage trucking recovery play on the basis of smaller losses  though the stock did work modestly for about four months . At this point I do think Heartland remains undervalued and I think the trucking cycle is bottoming out, but thus far lights at the end of the tunnel have been additional oncoming trains, so I understand investors wanting to stay away until there s real evidence of an upturn.Every trucking cycle is different and every trucking cycle is the same.What I mean by that is that boom times drive strong increases in rates and small capacity providers push into the market to get their piece of the pie. Eventually the economy freight demand cools, that balance of capacity supply and demand shifts to excess and prices start falling. Those falling prices pinch established carriers like Heartland and Knight-Swift, but they re even more damaging to small carriers and eventually that capacity is forced out of the market. Then the economy freight demand recovers, there s insufficient capacity to meet that new demand and we do it all over again.This cycle has followed that basic pattern, but with some important twists. The pandemic hammered capacity, with reduced demand idling drivers and many older owner operators deciding to leave the business. At the same time, the post-pandemic period saw a surge in business activity and shipping demand, leading to a big swing in rates and demand for capacity  which, in turn, drove demand for truck brokerage services from companies like  , Knight-Swift,  , et al .The net effect of all of this is that shipping demand was far higher than normal, capacity came in to meet it, and rates were quite healthy. That generated substantial cash for smaller operators, and that cash is part of the reason why this downturn has been stretched out. Dry van spot rates are down about 16  year-over-year as of early October, and while the rate declines seen in 2023 would normally be enough to push a lot of capacity out of the market  rates have been below cash operating costs for small operators for some time , those operators have been able to rely upon and draw down that cash built up during the boom.The bottom line for Heartland is pretty simple. Freight demand has fallen off considerably in 2023, due in part to a significant inventory destocking cycle, and with too much capacity in the market  and larger carriers reluctant to let go of drivers , prices and profitability have crumbled.There have been some signs of a bottom here of late. The big inventory correction cycle seems to be petering out, and there is some evidence that this year s peak season may be stronger as demand still hasn t fallen off too bad. Capacity has started to leave the market  but is still too high  and prices seem to be bumping along at low levels.A big part of the Heartland story for 2023-2025 was  and still is  the synergy opportunities from integrating the large Smith and CFI acquisitions  both of which closed in 2022 . Neither of these carriers operate as efficiently as Heartland, and driving costs out of these businesses and bringing them in line with core Heartland efficiency  management has targeted low-80 s for operating ratios  was going to be a meaningful earnings driver.That story can still work, but it s very much on hold for now. With revenue  excluding fuel  basically flat on an organic basis in the second quarter, there just isn t enough volume and price leverage to drive those efficiencies. Not only is Heartland not operating its fleet at maximum efficiency  more deadhead miles, fewer overall shipments, et al , operating costs are higher with inflation in wages, parts, and so on. That s driven the overall operating ratio back into the mid-90 s  adjusted , with Smith and CFI both in the high-90 s in the last quarter.Heartland is also reaping less benefit from gains on sale. Heartland maintains a very modern fleet, typically selling tractors after around two years of use. Keeping the fleet age low reduces operating and maintenance costs and keeps drivers happier, but Heartland generally relies on smaller carriers to buy their used equipment. With capacity exiting the market, though, that demand has dried up and gains on sale have shrunk this year  in response management has also cut back on its net capex, leading to modest creep in average tractor age  2.1 years versus 1.9 in the last quarter .I don t see any reason to expect that third quarter earnings will be strong. Around six months ago the Street was expecting  0.25 in EPS for the third quarter, and even 90 days ago the estimate was still  0.19. Now the expectation is  0.08 and I wouldn t be shocked if the company misses due to a higher operating ratio. Likewise, I think the Street very much wants to hear that not only has the market bottomed, but there are already signs of improving demand, including a stronger peak season. I do think that may be too much to hope for, and I see a risk of a lackluster peak season and an extended  bumping along the bottom , as I don t expect a big inventory rebuild cycle, nor a strong retail season.Heartland really doesn t do spot-rate business, but spot rates do inform contract rates, and I see a risk that large carriers like Heartland will be in a poor bargaining position for the next round of rate negotiations. There just isn t a lot of demand now and even though carriers like Heartland will argue that they need rate support to offset operating costs, customers likely won t see a compelling need to pay up. The risk, then, is that while the market does recover in 2024 from a volume standpoint, price could still be a headwind and that the real recovery gets pushed into 2025.I m still looking for long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4  to 5 , but a lot of that comes from the bump this year from the Smith and CFI deals. Long term, I expect core growth to be more on the order of 2 . Further consolidation could offer some upside, but time will tell. On the margin side, I do expect a significant decline in free cash flow margins in FY 23 and FY 24 as the company absorbs higher operating costs and resumes capex in FY 24. Longer term, I still think low-to-mid-teens FCF margins are attainable, driving mid-single-digit normalized FCF growth.While Heartland does look undervalued on a discounted cash flow approach, the intense cyclicality of the business makes it very difficult to rely on long-term modeling. Turning to multiple-based approaches like EV EBITDA and P E is not much easier, given the challenges in selecting the right multiples and earnings numbers   2022, 2023, and 2024 results aren t really representative of normal operating conditions.I can use  1 in EPS for 2025 and a 17x long-term cycle average PE to generate a  17 target, but it s worth noting that that 2025 number has come down sharply in six months. Likewise, I can argue for a 6.5x multiple on 2023 EBITDA  which gives me an  18 target , but at some point you have to be wary of picking numbers that give you the result you want   to that point, if I look at prior P Es on trough earnings, it would seem that 30x my 2023 EPS estimate of  0.42 would be appropriate, and that only gets me to  12.60 for a fair value.I do think that Heartland shares are undervalued and that the trucking cycle has bottomed out, but I also thought that six months ago and that was clearly the wrong call. I think investors can do okay from here with these shares, but I can t guarantee that there won t be another round of guidance expectation cuts as this correction drags on into 2024. If you can take the risk of being early, this is a name to consider but it s definitely not for those investors who struggle to cope with uncertainty.

And welcome to the Prologis Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Operator InstructionsAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jill Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin.Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.I d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management s beliefs and assumptions.Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer toAdditionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.I d likeWith that, I will hand the call over to Tim.Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely, growing supply translating to increased market vacancy, continued moderation of demand, and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time.We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What s incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it s had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand.In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth.We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values.In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of  1.33 per share. This result includes approximately  0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q A.Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5 , aided by retention of 77 . Net effective rent change was a record 84  at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200 , Toronto at 187  and Southern California at 165 . Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3  and 9.5 , respectively, driven predominantly by rent change.We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62  as of September.We raised approximately  1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2 , comprised principally of  760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record  6.9 billion of liquidity.Finally, it s noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA.Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points.At the macro level, our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters. Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low.Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters.In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it s clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what s also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment.In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter.Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2  as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed.From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3  while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn t too surprising as the Fed s language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the burn  ph  at just 50 basis points.We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5 , while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5 , a write-down that we don t believe has fully run its course.Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately  180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of  115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of  1.6 billion to approximately  700 million or roughly 2  of third-party AUMs.In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing  1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank.Also notable is the acquisition of  118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over  40 billion.We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity.Moving to guidance. We are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25  and 97.5 . As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9  to 9.25  on a net effective basis and 9.75  to 10  on a cash basis.We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of  520 million to  530 million and adjusting G A guidance to range between  390 million and  395 million.Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of  3 billion to  3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have  500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of  1.7 billion to  2.3 billion.In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of  3.30 per share to  3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of  5.58 per share to  5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between  5.08 per share and  5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5 .I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I d like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio.In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that s been central to our strategy and management as a company.I d like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release.And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks  You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there s -- you are calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and that s before the lower development starts hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024  Thanks.Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the  Technical DifficultyAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Hey, guys. Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me, because I am having trouble hearing you. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts  And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center salesLadies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We are just having a little technical difficulty here. Thank you. Please remain on the line.I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can t really explain it.Hello.Can you guys hear me  You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn t great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that s why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations.The reason occupancy is higher, it s unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before.I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here.But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high-quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets.And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it s going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it s lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that.Now, strategically, this is important to understand. We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions.You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That s where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it s more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data centerWell, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can t be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward.What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin.And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter, I think, you have got something like  1.9 billion of planned starts, given that you have done about  1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial  And if so, kind of what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume  Thanks.Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion s share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it s about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now.As we talk about market development starts now at 65  -- I guess down 65  from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume.Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit.Correct.And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Thanks. Question, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That s down from 2.5  last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframeHey, Todd. It s Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation.And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Hi, everyone. Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it s not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly. You did the  3 billion acquisition mid-year. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today  Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from, maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should beSure. It s a dynamic market and I think that s the essence of your question. It s really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here s a model for thinking about it.First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn t want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don t expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100  whole portfolios.Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5 , 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5 s, low 6  IRRs. Let s stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6 .So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9  on leveraged IRR and that s if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there s going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those.I don t think there s going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9  handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5  depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to addThe only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it s value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it s really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns.And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I am wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that  And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023.Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It s hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question  Oh, occupancy trade-off.Occupancy.It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20  of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80  of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change  And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65  and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60  or 70  of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there s no sense really going cheap, it s just. But I would say 20  of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy.And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.Oh  Thanks. Just a two-porter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire, if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity. And then, secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolioWell, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40  of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues.It s too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that s going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows.About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California.I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anythingYeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer.And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. First, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis  And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there s little that could change your core outlook from here, but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end. What could change your views more positively or negatively  Thank you.Hey, Camille. It s Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2  decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don t expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don t think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance.And the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Hey. Just a quick two-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually  Is it  200 million, is it  500 million, like how big can this get is the follow-up number one. And then number two on sort of the rent growth, appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers, but as you are sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one, potentially being sort of a headwind  Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year  Thanks.Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that s what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date.And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second partYeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that s going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth.As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it s probably fair to point to Tim s comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it s Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that s what I would look to.And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. I guess one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7  to 9 . I don t know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forwardSo, hey, the view is 7  in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I d like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information.And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks. How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023  Now, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there s going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023. I mean, is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bitHi. Thanks for the question. Again, it s Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider.And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline s going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it s really timing as it relates to that gap.Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out.But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days.And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. I just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across SoCal -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think, you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion  And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, six months to monthsSo the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn t conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that s been flat all year.In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there s that dispersion.And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Hi. I know you have used land in the past for higher and better uses, but do you think you would be looking at these development, the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren t seeing a normalizing of a traditional industrial demandAbsolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum.And by the way, let s not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years.So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it s been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can t get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand.And the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I am wondering if you are seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9  ROE returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer waltz or how do you get that if we don t see distress among current holders or owners  Thanks.So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85  plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don t think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle.And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions.We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn t move around that much.Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it s one consideration, so are all these other factors.And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit, but guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and one-time items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don t expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the  0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There s about  0.02 there I would call that, that s permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter.So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that  0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let s call it  1.30 million to  1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what s implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We are going to add -- probably add  0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter.And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6 . Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate.We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That s at 3 . So in the short-term, that s a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development s ramp.And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that picked down a little bit this quarter, I was wondering if you can provide any more color around that. And second, if you look at the larger development landscape and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks probably increases as we move forward. I am not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forwardHey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it s our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline.Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today s retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels.Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended.So actually, I think, what s going to happen is that they can t really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this.So don t be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it s -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65  decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market.So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that s why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20  all this time. This is when we put it to work.And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. I have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20  of your markets you are managing for occupancy not pushing rent. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power todaySure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland.And China.And China and I think I d offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix.And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.I just wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring team that we are hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon as they have put a lot of capital into the coast and across the country. I am just wondering sort of when you marry those two things together, is there sort of greater investment moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets  Is that an opportunity for PLD going forwardSo, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there s a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It s not all in China and it had been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to western China and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia.But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It s just not going to be all from China. But the container doesn t care whether it s coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports.Secondly, demand in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship. So the warehouse is a truck or a ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn t generate a lot of demand.When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that s when the demand is generated for deconsolidation. Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country, because that s where the consumption is and those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets.So we don t think the dynamic of on-shoring to the extent that it exists is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of on-shoring has been actually near-shoring and it s been in northern Mexico.Northern Mexico markets are 100  occupied and there s insatiable demand for product in those markets and most of that is for distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes. So that s where we have seen the material demand.If there s more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., A, we haven t really seen it and if we do see it, we will be the beneficiary of it because we are well positioned in those central markets as well.And our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Great. Thanks. Hamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you are thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability and maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at allYeah. I think the effect is going to be indirect, because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we are not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk and all of a sudden we have some drop off in demand, because that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to  200 a barrel. I mean, the bets are off.But boy, if we see that scenario, I can t think of a better business to want to be in and I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually on a relative basis, it should be good for our business, because it will mean that people will, first of all, inventory becomes really important and it means that -- it s yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we have seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case.So I hate to say it would be good because it s an awful situation that s going there and before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed and I don t want to see this happen. But I don t think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible. I am honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict.I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. Really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day and I promise it will be really good. So take care.This concludes today s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",3,2023-10-17T16:10:18.000-04:00
"As Yields March Higher, JAVA's Value Proposition Remains Unconvincing","I started covering the JPMorgan Active Value ETF  in , with a Hold rating. There are two main reasons why I am presenting an update today. First, the portfolio of this exchange-traded fund has seen a few changes, small wonderJAVA was launched in October 2021 and has amassed an AUM of about  606.5 million since then.The JPMorgan  says the fund has an  actively managed investment strategy that seeks to deliver a style pure U.S. large cap value equity portfolio  as it  employs a fundamental, bottom-up approach to identify quality companies at attractive valuations.As an actively managed vehicle, JAVA has the luxury of boosting exposure to stocks it considers capable of contributing to better performance compared to the Russell 1000 Value index, its , and, by the same token, to sell names that no longer have target characteristics without being constrained by an underlying index's rebalancing reconstitution rules, which is the case with its passively managed counterparts.Analyzing the JAVA portfolio as of October 17, I have found out that 15 companies were removed  in the August version, their combined weight was about 3.6 . The 3 most notable deletions were Qorvo , a semiconductor industry player, US Foods Holding , a food distributor, and KeyCorp , a Cleveland-based diversified bank.At the same time, 9 companies were added, with Royal Caribbean Cruises , Globe Life , and Silgan Holdings  having the largest weights.In all, in the current iteration, there are 150 stocks and REITs in the basket, compared to 156 previously. As of the August article, JAVA's  stood at 56  since then, it has risen to 80 .Interestingly, JAVA's sector mix has changed only slightly, principally driven by capital appreciation depreciation of the holdings, with healthcare and energy gaining 1.9  and 1.5 , and financials and IT losing 1.87  and 1.57 , respectively.Despite JAVA falling by almost 7 , its factor mix has not changed much, as the table below demonstrates.Since my article was published on August 7, JAVA has declined by almost 7 .But what were the major culprits  To answer that question, I have analyzed the performance of 141 stocks that were present in both the August 4 and October 17 versions of the portfolio  I have not taken into account newcomers and removed stocks since I was not tracking the portfolio between these dates, and I have no data on when exactly these positions were added or deleted.As it can be seen on the chart above, a few holdings did deliver a positive price return over that period, including Eli Lilly and Company  LLY's stock price surged by  35.1  amid the GLP-1 drug hype. But those that were in the red dominated nonetheless. More specifically, while 39 companies delivered gains, 102 saw their stock prices go down, with negative returns ranging from just a few bps to almost 31  in the case of Dollar General . The top 5 detractors, including DG, are compiled in the following table  the tables below are based on metrics calculated using data from Seeking Alpha and JAVA, unless otherwise noted .All the energy holdings in the group that I analyzed, which are predominantly represented by supermajors and E P companies, delivered gains ranging from 4.6  in the case of EOG to 14.4  in the case of FANG. The primary reason is obvious  the supply and demand concerns in the oil market have pushed the price of the commodity higher.At the same time, all the materials companies were in the red.Overall, for a better context, below are the median returns for each sector. The data show materials, utilities, and consumer staples were the essential detrators.Also, it is worth providing an update on annualized returns and other relevant performance parameters. Compared to the previous article, data for August and September were added. The period in focus now is November 2021-September 2023.The good news is that while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF , which is a passively managed fund tracking JAVA's benchmark, and the iShares Core S P 500 ETF  now have negative annualized returns over the period concerned compared to the low-single-digit CAGRs they had as of end-July, JAVA is still in the green, and its standard deviation is still the lowest.However, since the beginning of the year, JAVA has outperformed IWD by just 18 bps.Actively managed JAVA puts emphasis on value and quality factors in creating its large-cap-heavy portfolio. However, the issue is that, though its quality exposure is significant, I am not that optimistic regarding value. That is to say, I believe its value proposition remains unconvincing in the current environment, with interest rates  the central concern. I see no meaningful reason for an upgrade.

"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce: Better, But Still Bad","Canada can be a myopic place. There, I wrote it. In some ways, this is understandable. If your next door neighbour was very loud, very friendly, blasted movies and music at you 24 7, and occasionally fired off a few hundred bazooka rounds in their big backyard with theWith all that out of the way, it s time to venture down the rabbit hole of writing about yet another beloved Canadian bank. This time, I m going to review the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , known from this time forward in my article as  CIBC.  I m also going to try to address some of the responses to my Royal Bank article in this one. I m going to start my discussion of this bank with a few more points about residential real estate in Canada. I ll also include portions of an email exchange I had with a member of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions  OSFI , Canada s banking regulator.I know that my writing can be, uh,  a bit much , and for that reason I post a thesis statement paragraph very near the beginning of each of my articles. This gives investors the chance to review my thinking and then get out before they re exposed to too many bad jokes, and too much proper spelling. I think it behooves investors to seek the best risk adjusted returns, and I think the risk here is too great. The financial snapshot is not particularly inspiring in my view, and the exposure to Canadian residential real estate is troubling in my view. The mortgage book has grown dramatically over the past few years, so this problem has gotten worse not better. Additionally, those who think the regulators are going to  cut the banks some slack  in the parlance of our times, are in for a rude shock. Before getting into CIBC specific financials, though, I continue to dismantle the bullish case for Canadian residential real estate that I started when I wrote about Royal Bank of Canada yesterday.In this first section I want to make a few more arguments for why I think residential real estate in Canada is a ridiculous investment. For more, please review my article on Royal Bank. In my view, the fortunes of Canadian banks are inexorably tied to residential real estate for two reasons. First, and most directly, much of the growth the  big five  have enjoyed over the past several years has come from mortgages, and I think this growth will inevitably slow. Second, Canadian banks, particularly Royal and CIBC,  go as the Canadian economy goes.  The Canadian economy goes as Canadian residential real estate goes, and thus, a drop in residential real estate prices will have a knock on negative wealth effect for Canadians, which will harm loan growth. This will harm bank profits, obviously.The people who are aware of the coming population crisis in the developed world will tell you that the problem will be solved with immigration.This isn t just a Canadian phenomenon, because I ve heard the same solutions offered by Europeans, and Australians. When the subject of the demographic timebomb comes up in conversation, nearly every person I ve talked to says some variation of  immigrants will solve the problem.  Well, that s great in theory, and I ll admit that Canada has been very welcoming to immigrants since about 1970, but immigrants are increasingly being wooed by a number of places that aren t unbelievably cold.Even with a welcoming immigration culture, though, population growth has been anemic for decades. For instance, in 1970, the population of the country was about 21.4 million people. Today, the population is about 39 million people, so it s grown at a CAGR of about 1.12  over the past 53 years. This is because people also emigrate, and they also die. Further, the United Nations is projecting that Canadian population growth rate will actually slow to a CAGR of about 0.58  over the next 30 .Add to that the fact that prices are  dramatically, and the  immigrants to the rescue  thesis seems even more absurd in my view. To sum up so far, in order to be bullish on residential real estate in Canada, you need to believe that the country will buck a 53 year trend and will start to grow more rapidly, in spite of what the United Nations is suggesting. Additionally, immigrants are going to want to flock to the place, in spite of the fact that Canada has some of the most expensive housing stock on Earth. What would be the marketing pitch to immigrants   Come for the sometimes deadly cold, stay for the unaffordability of our housingIt s time to write about supply. I would strongly agree with the notion that there s a housing supply  in Canada. In my view, people misinterpret this, though. They take from this shortage of supply that prices will remain elevated. In my view, this justification of current house prices ignores a key element of the supply-demand relationship  demand. Demand for housing may be very inelastic, but the population is, as the kids say,  tapped out , so they cannot afford continuously elevated prices, and thus price has nowhere to go but down. This is exactly what happened to Canadian residential real estate in the months after the above article from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation  was published. Prices have fallen in spite of the housing supply shortage mentioned by CMHC.I admit that I forget the class at which I learned this, but I remember being tied to the oar of the MBA slave ship and hearing something about  supply and demand are not constants.  Translated, this means that sometimes supply is the pre-eminent determinant of price, and sometimes demand. I think falling prices in the teeth of a housing shortage convinces me that demand is key here.I think the stress test, elevated interest rates, sclerotic population growth, the fact that Canadians, especially younger households, are some of the most  people on Earth. Younger households are particularly important to real estate demand for pretty obvious reasons. In my view, all of this conspires to make residential real estate a risky bet in Canada, shortage or no shortage.Because a larger proportion of my audience for this article is likely Canadian, and I ve just uttered some blasphemies, I ll make the point by analogy. Let s pretend that the year s 1636 and a smaller and smaller percentage of the Dutch population can afford those beautiful Semper Augustus tulips that everyone s always going on about. At some point, the price will have to fall, no matter how beautiful the resulting flowers.That quick little analogy to tulipmania reminds me of a chart I included in yesterday s article about Royal Bank. It s relevant here, too, so, once again, feast your eyes on the relationship between income and house prices. Pay particular attention to that little spike of American house prices above affordability in 2008. Doesn t it look kind of quaint when compared to the Canadian  leviathan bubbleSo, if you re buying CIBC based on the assumption that the past growth in the mortgage book will be repeated, I would suggest that you reconsider that notion. In my view, residential real estate is increasingly unaffordable in Canada, and this will impact mortgage loan growth. It may also impact the bank in unprecedented ways. The  ways  are unprecedented because we have no historical record of anything like this.I think when talking about Canadian banks, it would be a good idea to have an interaction with the one institution that they all seem to be terrified of  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions  OSFI , so I reached out to those good people via electronic mail, or  e-mail  as the young people call it.A few real estate bulls I ve talked to over the past while have suggested that people who took on huge mortgages to buy overpriced real estate will be fine, because the banks are just going to extend their amortization schedules to keep things nice and affordable. I reached out to OSFI to clarify this point. Below I ve reproduced my question, and the response from the official.So, we can dispense with the idea that people will be fine because they can simply extend.Before we leave our discussion of OSFI, it seems that they re imposing new capital requirements on lenders. To  them directlyTo beat the proverbial dead horse as is my wont, if the  Value  in  loan-to-value  declines as I think it will, this will impose greater capital requirements on the banks, which is not a wonderful development from their perspective.Returning to the discussion on CIBC, when reviewing the financial performance here over the past several years, a few elements pop off the virtual page at me. First, the most recent six months has been less profitable than the previous year, in spite of an uptick in revenue. Rising sales and falling profits is never a great sign in my view. Additionally, we can t blame this on an unfortunate comparison period, given that net income over the past two quarters was about 17  lower than it was during the same period in 2019. I think a fair point could be made to suggest that the company hasn t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability.At the same time, the capital structure has deteriorated somewhat in my view, with total liabilities up from the previous year by about  33 million, or 3.9 .Most worrying of all, from my point of view, is the fact that the mortgage book is today about 30  greater than it was in 2019, and now sits around  271.4 billion. For reference, shareholder equity currently sits at about  51.51 billion. Using the arithmetic skills not so lovingly beaten into me by the good sisters at Holy Spirit School many decades ago, I ve managed to work out that equity represents about 19  of the current mortgage book.All of this suggests to me that I d need to be compensated for taking on the risks associated with this business. I d be compensated for that with a higher than usual dividend yield, or a cheaper than usual stock.As my regulars know, I look for stocks that are trading at a discount to both their own history and the overall market. This is because I think cheap stocks represent that perfect combination of lower risk and higher return potential. They re lower risk because much of the bad news has already been  baked in  to the price, so new bad news won t drive things much lower. They offer great potential returns because any moderately good news drives the shares higher. Incidentally, this  keep expectations limited  has been the primary strategy I ve used in my dating life, and it s worked out pretty well, for me at least.Anyway, I measure cheapness in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like sales, earnings, free cash flow, and the like. I d note that CIBC shares are cheaper than the overall market at the moment, but are hardly cheap when judged against their own history. This is troubling in my view, because the level of risk here has risen materially. The one thing the stock has going for it, though, is the fact that the shares are sporting a positive risk premium at the moment.Source  YChartsSource  YChartsThe question for most investors is whether this dividend yield is worth the risk here  Specifically, in the Great White , you re picking up an extra 124 basis points over the risk free rate, while in the land of the free and the home of the brave, you re picking up only 72 basis  of extra yield over risk free government instruments. I like the fact that the dividend yield is at least positive, but I think the premia remains light, given the risks here. For that reason, I would recommend eschewing shares of CIBC and putting new capital to work in investments with a superior combination of risk and return.

Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,"The U.S. economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasn't been witnessed since 1949  a shrinking money supply. M2 has declined by a whopping  700 billion since the hiking cycle began. This phenomenon is In this article, we will explore why the U.S. money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscape.The recent contraction in the U.S. money supply is not solely due to a single, isolated cause. Rather, it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, financial innovations, and shifts in market dynamics.We will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening. The Fed has been reducing its massive  8 trillion balance sheet  so far to the tune of  800 billion , which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as they reach maturity, it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money. Additionally, rising interest rates - which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets - have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in low-yield savings and checking accounts, leading to a decline in deposits Moreover, the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions, while the years of ultra-low interest rates, the growing digitization of financial markets, and the rise of user-friendly commission-free trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits. Yes, interest rates have risen recently, but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings account.These three major factors have led to a staggering  2.4 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022.So what does the shrinking U.S. money supply mean for SPY  The reality is quite nuanced.One of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates, though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex. Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income assets more attractive relative to stocks. As investors seek higher yields in bonds, there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY, thereby hurting its performance. We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPY's performanceConversely, when interest rates are very low, investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks, driving their prices higher due to increased demand. This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that - when market interest rates rise - it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects, leading to higher interest payments and lower profits. In some cases, projects may become unfeasible. Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a company's future earnings. Conversely, when interest rates fall, companies can borrow more easily, boosting profits and economic growth. A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners , where management just  its target growth rate in half due to a soaring cost of capital.Moreover, Goldman Sachs  that interest rates are one of the more reliable indicators for estimating the impact of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on the economy, which in turn can assist us with predicting SPY performance. In fact, one of the more prominent S P 500 valuation models in use today is known as the That said, while interest rates certainly do  in the behavior of stock markets, they are also influenced by a myriad of other factors, including investor sentiment, economic conditions, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events. While changes in the money supply can play a role in shaping economic conditions, they are just one piece of the broader puzzle. As a result, historical data reveals that relying solely on monetary aggregates for predicting market performance can be unreliable.Fortunately for SPY, its  are in cash-rich technology mega-cap stocks like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Nvidia , Alphabet , , Tesla , and Meta  as well as one of the strongest conglomerates in the world in Berkshire Hathaway , This should make it more resistant to higher for longer interest rates than some other financial instruments out there. That said, there are still reasons to be concerned. First of all, SPY is quite overvalued based on several leading valuation models such as the Buffett Indicator, the Price Earnings Model, the S P 500 Mean Reversion Model, and the Yield Curve Model.Moreover, as a  pointed outWhen a contraction in the money supply is coupled with inflation, such as we are seeing now, there is an elevated threat of the market and broader economy experiencing a deflationary crash. This would undoubtedly have a terrible impact on SPY. Similar circumstances occurred in the post-World War I era and the Spanish Flu pandemic, resulting in 11  deflation and high unemployment. A mere -2  contraction in the money supply in 1921 triggered this deflationary depression, and currently, in 2023, we are already at a -2  contraction. This suggests that the economy's resilience and the current inflation may not be as robust as believed.While the money supply in 2023 is substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, history indicates that depressions and deflation do not require a linear decrease in the money supply but can result from even a slight contraction of 2-4  year-on-year. Many expect the current inflation to persist indefinitely, akin to the 1970s, but the key difference is that the Federal Reserve is engaged in Quantitative Tightening right now, causing the money supply to contract. As a result, economic history seems to indicate that a deflationary depression in the near future is a possibility unless the Federal Reserve changes course away from QT.The currently shrinking U.S. money supply is a historically rare and complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, and financial innovation. While there are reasons to believe that it could bode poorly for SPY - particularly given that rising interest rates often follow and are mechanically bad for equity valuations, SPY appears to be overvalued based on numerous models, and a shrinking money supply dramatically increases the chances of depression - it is also important to keep in mind that the relationship between the money supply and stock market performance is not straightforward.As a result, while this analysis does lead us to be bearish on SPY and rate it a Sell, we do not think that long-term investors should overreact, sell everything, and  head for the hills  in a panic. However, it does emphasize the importance of proper diversification and having a financial plan that does not depend on liquidating SPY shares for several years to come.

Buy MGIC: This Time Mortgage Credit Really Is Different,"First, I know I write incessantly about private mortgage insurers. I can t help it. I just think they are generally ignored and frequently misunderstood when not ignored. Most importantly, I am confident they remain quite cheap to their likely outcomesSecond, a shout-out to me. Yes, pretty obnoxious. But my last piece on MGIC  was a compare-and-contrast piece versus Redfin , a related company in the housing space. Seeking Alpha published my article  on July 12, barely four weeks ago. Since then, MGIC is up 10  and Redfin is down 34 . Hopefully this fact will get you to read further down in this article.43 years  So the current state of mortgage credit  pretty different from what we have experienced during our investing lives.  It is different this time for this combination of reasonsMortgage defaults rise when some combination of three events occurI ll address the home price decline risk first. The law of supply and demand says that prices of any product fall when there is an excess of supply. In housing, a supply excess is indicated by a high vacancy rate. You judge from this chart whether single-family housing has excess supplyThe exact opposite of excess supply. Housing vacancies haven t been this low in our investing lifetime  It would take many years of overbuilding to create excess housing. So the risk of a sharp decline in home prices seems remote. Even the dramatic rise in mortgage rates from 3  to 7  over the past 1½ years barely dented home prices.Again I rely on the supply demand law. A sharp fall in demand for labor always creates the risk of rising unemployment. But we also need to keep on eye on growth in the supply of labor. So let s do that. This chart shows changes in the U.S. rate of change in the labor force, measured as 5-year rolling averages to smooth out temporary blips. I then added the unemployment rate, against using a 5-year averageThe chart clearly shows that labor force growth has slowed a lot over the past four decades, helping the unemployment rate trend lower. In fact, unfilled jobs currently total nearly 10 million, about double the average over the last few decades.So yes, a rise in unemployment due to a sharp decline in demand will be a risk for mortgage insurers. But that risk is lower than average now because of a material labor shortage.Perhaps the most important risk of rising mortgage defaults is caused by weak mortgage lending standards. And this is the best news yet.The mortgage industry and the MI s in particular have generated outstanding quality home loans for well over a decade. For proof, I turn first to more MBA data, this time a historical index of mortgage lending standardsMore evidence of conservative lending standards is supplied by looking at the share of mortgage debt outstanding underwritten by the private sector, not the government   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA VA. You might expect that government programs would be looser than private business loans, but that was not the case during the early  00 s housing bubble  the risky subprime and other whacky loans were very largely private sector products. Private sector credit was 33  of total home loans in  09. That percentage is now below 20MGIC s shift to more conservative lending has been radical, as shown by this history of paid claims on mortgage defaultsThis chart is stunning. Claims payments this year will be the lowest since at least 1995, as far back as currently available data. And compare the  45 million or so of claims payments this year to 2005, the peak of the early  00 s housing bubble. Default payments in  05 were  612 million. times largerAnd if the economy takes a big hit  86  of MGIC s risk is covered by reinsurance that pays in the event of a material recession.Again, home loan quality different this time.MGIC s operating EPS was  0.60, after my adjustment for loss reserve accounting, which added  0.08 to MGIC s reported operating EPS. That compares to  0.53  my estimate  a year ago. The results were good enough to cause Wall Street analysts to raise their average  23 EPS estimate to  2.31 from  2.15.Claims paid were a mere  12 million on a  292 billion insurance book. That is a tiny 1.6 bp loss rate. But nearly 70  of the claims MGIC paid were from loans originated prior to 2009  That means the insurance MGIC wrote since 2009 had a Q2 loss rate of a miniscule 0.7 bp. This time is different.Two more pieces of good news from Q2MGIC will generate about  700 million of cash flow this year, or about  2.50 per share. That is a 14  return on the stock price. And basically all of that cash flow can be paid to shareholders. That s because MGIC has  1.3 billion of excess capital above its regulatory capital requirement plus a 40  capital cushion.In fact, during the first half of this year MGIC paid shareholders  59 million in dividends and  150 million in share repurchases, for an 8  annualized return to shareholders. I expect it to return more to shareholders.MGIC can very comfortably use  350 million of cash flow per year to buy back stock. At the current price, that means a 7  decline to shares outstanding, and a therefore a 7  annual increase in cash flow per share without any increase in dollar earnings. Not bad for a stock with a 14  current cash flow yield.I believe that  25 is a conservative valuation for MGIC. Its cash return would then be 10 , with a 5-7  growth rate for the foreseeable future. That s a 40  upside.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

Mid-America Apartment Communities: 4% Yielder Positioned For A Solid Performance,"Mid-America Apartment Communities  is a pure-play U.S. apartment REIT and is one of the few REITs included in the S P 500. As of June 30, 2023, MAA had over 101,000 apartment homes in its portfolio spread across 16 states and the DistrictMost of the apartment buildings are of a high quality, where 92  of all buildings are classified as B  or higher.The existing tenant base is also greatly diversified with no major exposures towards a particular segment of economy.All in all, MAA can be considered a rather defensive REIT with an exposure towards specific REIT sector, which enjoys secular tailwinds and if properly managed can deliver stable and predictable returns going forward.Typically, apartment REITs have the optionality to grow organically via directing part of the total CapEx spend towards improving or redeveloping the existing asset stock. Acquisitions, which are based on higher cap rates than the cost of capital also play an important role, but usually are more procyclical depending on the prevailing spread  cap rates - WACC  and company's ability to attract sound financing.We can see that in MAA's case the net acquisitions for 2023 are projected to land at  400 million, which accounts for roughly 2.5  of the total market cap. This is conservative.The chart above reflecting MAA's dividend history is a clear testament of the Company's conservatism and stability, which have supported 117 consecutive dividend payments with some growth component attach almost each year.At the same time, MAA has managed to register more solid dividend hikes in the past two years by capitalizing on the prevailing sector-specific tailwinds  i.e., favourable supply and demand dynamics, which put an upward pressure on the rent levels  and its fortress balance sheet.In my humble opinion, MAA is positioned to deliver superior returns relative to the broader REIT market over the foreseeable future, where there is an increased probability of distress and 'higher-for-longer' interest rate scenario.It is a combination of two factors, which differentiate MAA from its peers and equips the Company to benefit from the volatility in the real estate market.MAA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire REIT space and is only one of eight publicly traded REITs, which carry an upper investment grade credit rating.Compared to 15 direct peers operating in the REIT  Apartments  segment, MAA has the second strongest balance sheet in terms of debt to EBITDA and debt ratio. On an absolute basis a net debt to EBTIDAre of 3.5x is considered very safe providing ample debt capacity to fund accretive transactions and   or redevelopment activities.An additional major aspect in the context of MAA's debt capacity and financing structure, which has to be factored in is the relatively extended debt maturity profile in conjunction with 100  fixed rate financing.This means that MAA is protected from materially higher financing costs imposing a significant and concentrated effect on the FFO generation. , provided that MAA does not assume incremental external financing in a major fashion, only  9  of the total debt is set to reprice towards market level interest rates on an annual basis. Given MAA's ability to deliver a positive like-for-like growth in NOI and fund new projects through internal cash generation, these gradual effects from higher interest rates should be easily offset with improved cash flows.Lastly, MAA possesses a great degree of flexibility to cover notable investments or obtain an optimal financing source to refinance the maturing borrowing. As of Q2, 2023, MAA had over  1.25 billion available under the existing credit facility, which is more than enough to refinance all of the incoming debt maturities until 2026.As elaborated above, the sector in which MAA operates is robust and with favourable growth prospects. Historically, MAA has managed to capitalize on these dynamics by registering relatively stronger FFO growth results compared to the peers.In fact, MAA has avoided negative rate of change movement in its annual FFO during 2020 and 2021, while the sector, on average, suffered from higher vacancy rates and temporarily reduced rents due to the COVID-19 shock.A major driver of the resilient performance has been both internal and external growth opportunities funded by primarily internal cash generation.On average MAA retains 40  of the generated FFO. This allows the Management to cover CapEx and   or accretive M A deals without a heavy reliance on external leverage. In the context of prevailing financing costs, this strategy clearly bears fruit allowing MAA to act opportunistically, while there is an increasing pressure for more indebted competitors to optimize their balance sheets via  among other  divestitures.In my opinion, MAA is great real estate investment for investors, who seek stability and protection amid the looming recessionary risks and potential consequences from higher-for-longer scenario in the real estate market.Currently, MAA yields 4 , which is not that attractive, but considering the growth potential and the resiliency of underlying business operations, the investment case looks attractive.The investment case of MAA should play out when the market becomes more depressed causing the property cap rates to go up materially. Under such conditions, MAA should be able to utilize its balance sheet capacity and internal cash generation to accommodate profitable deals in a sizeable fashion.

Centrus Energy: The Most Distinct Energy Company At Great Price,"Centrus Energy  is one of the most distinct companies in the uranium industry. They are the only producer of low-enriched uranium in the USA. Their balance sheet is alarming at first glance because itUranium offers an exceptional asymmetric investment opportunity. Its growing deficit caused by stagnating supply and increasing demand heralds the new bull market. Unlike commodities such as copper and oil, uranium is not dependent on the economic cycle. Geopolitics drives its price more and applies with even greater force today. The coup in Niger, the country that supplies 7  of the world's annual production, affirms that fact. Europe relies heavilyI'll summarize in a few points why we're at the beginning of an epic bull market in uranium. Lack of investment in discoveries and new mines, combined with political-economic fragmentation, significantly impacts supply. Even without direct sanctions, many countries have begun to supply uranium from other sources, but Russia.On the other hand, we observe rising demand due to nuclear power revival. The latter has become widely accepted as an alternative to fossil fuels, making it an essential element of the transition to zero carbon emissions. And it is not only that, the population of India and much of Africa is growing exponentially. Increasing capacity is the only way to meet the rising people's energy needs. In addition, India is climbing up the S curve of GDP, in which fewer people live in desperate poverty, and more are entering the . It is projected that the Indian middle class will grow by 65   by 2030. The chart below illustrates the Indian income pyramid.That means they will demand more stuff, and its production needs ever-increasing energy. The answer to the rising demand is nuclear power. Another crucial point is energy independence. World fragmentation is the driver behind it. An increasing number of countries plan to  for all the reasons listed - the Green Deal, demographics, and energy independence.A potential accelerator - sanctions against Russian uranium. The imbalance between supply and demand is a fact. It will slowly and steadily impact uranium prices. If sanctions are imposed on Russian uranium, the process described above will accelerate multifold, and the uranium shortage will reach epic proportions.That is not healthy for any market. The commodity CAPEX cycle creates imbalances between demand and supply, which are cured by the market dynamics. Epic deficits caused by exogenous shocks negatively impact the industry long-term, even if we, as investors, can cash significant returns. We can profit handsomely in a normal CAPEX cycle without systematic shocks, and the uranium market is such an opportunity.Centrus business is, at least to say, obscure. To make my thesis more comprehensive, I will briefly present the fuel nuclear cycle.In nature, uranium occurs in the form of 6 isotopes. The two primary ones are U235 and U238. In nuclear energy and for defense purposes, U235 is of leading importance. U238 produces plutonium for nuclear triad  intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, and nuclear submarines .Uranium 238  U238  makes up over 99  of the uranium found in nature. The remaining less than one percent includes all other isotopes. Among these is Uranium 235  U235 , which has the most comprehensive application in energy. The path of uranium from the mine to nuclear reactors and warheads is long and complex.I will give a glossary of terms that you will encounter later in the reportThis is what the  looks like from the mine through the nuclear reactor to the radioactive waste dump.We, as investors, can get involved mainly in the first two steps of the chart. At the following stages of production, only a few public companies are involved, and Centrus Energy is one of those companies.Centrus Energy is well-positioned to benefit from the new uranium bull market. The company's business has two segments. The image below from Centrus  financial report illustrates revenues by segment88   of the revenue comes from SWU and uranium sales. That segment supplies various components for producing nuclear fuel. 12   of the revenue comes from the technical solutions segment responsible for designing, constructing, and manufacturing uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication systems.Geographically, the company s customers are utility companies in the US. The chart below illustrates the revenue by countryThe primary market is the USA, with 91   revenues.Carbon-neutral energy requires a transition to a new generation of energy sources. Nuclear power is among them. In recent years, new reactors have been developed to cement nuclear power's place as the best solution. These reactors will operate with HALEU instead of those working with LEU.The higher concentration of U235 will enhance the reactors  performance. The goal is to achieve all three  simplified design, easier servicing, and increased safety. However, the limitation to their widespread adoption is the availability of a HALEU production facility. Centrus has a unique position recognized by the Department of Energy and the Gates Foundation. On 17 July, the company a memorandum of understanding with Terra Power company for developing small modular reactors backed by the Gates Foundation. On 22 November 2022, DoE awarded Centrus a 150-million-dollar contract to complete the construction and production of HALEU in the Piketon, Ohio, facility. More detail about the grant from DoD is shown in the image below.The projected demand for HALEU will increase due to the introduction and adoption of SMRs. The chart below from  illustrates thatBeing among the few producers of HALEU gives Centrus an exceptional moat. On top of that, it could not be duplicated due to business peculiarities and its importance for national security. Running Centrus business requires highly skilled professionals in particular areas - from legal consultants and lobbyists to mathematicians and nuclear engineers. Obtaining permits and following the regulations to operate nuclear-related enterprises is another unbearable endeavor.To begin with, Centrus Energy has negative equity due to accumulated losses of  214 million in past years. At the same time, their long-term debt is  182 million, and cash is  212 million, so the company has access to liquidity. Centrus has uranium inventories valued at  288 million too.

Higher uranium prices will expand the margins and positively affect Centrus's bottom line.CEO is Daniel Poneman. He has been in this role since 2015. His appointment coincides with the brutal bear market that lasted until 2021 when it bottomed out. Poneman has proven to be a strong leader by successfully surviving this crisis.

Centrus Energy: The Most Distinct Energy Company At Great Price,"Centrus Energy  is one of the most distinct companies in the uranium industry. They are the only producer of low-enriched uranium in the USA. Their balance sheet is alarming at first glance because itUranium offers an exceptional asymmetric investment opportunity. Its growing deficit caused by stagnating supply and increasing demand heralds the new bull market. Unlike commodities such as copper and oil, uranium is not dependent on the economic cycle. Geopolitics drives its price more and applies with even greater force today. The coup in Niger, the country that supplies 7  of the world's annual production, affirms that fact. Europe relies heavilyI'll summarize in a few points why we're at the beginning of an epic bull market in uranium. Lack of investment in discoveries and new mines, combined with political-economic fragmentation, significantly impacts supply. Even without direct sanctions, many countries have begun to supply uranium from other sources, but Russia.On the other hand, we observe rising demand due to nuclear power revival. The latter has become widely accepted as an alternative to fossil fuels, making it an essential element of the transition to zero carbon emissions. And it is not only that, the population of India and much of Africa is growing exponentially. Increasing capacity is the only way to meet the rising people's energy needs. In addition, India is climbing up the S curve of GDP, in which fewer people live in desperate poverty, and more are entering the . It is projected that the Indian middle class will grow by 65   by 2030. The chart below illustrates the Indian income pyramid.That means they will demand more stuff, and its production needs ever-increasing energy. The answer to the rising demand is nuclear power. Another crucial point is energy independence. World fragmentation is the driver behind it. An increasing number of countries plan to  for all the reasons listed - the Green Deal, demographics, and energy independence.A potential accelerator - sanctions against Russian uranium. The imbalance between supply and demand is a fact. It will slowly and steadily impact uranium prices. If sanctions are imposed on Russian uranium, the process described above will accelerate multifold, and the uranium shortage will reach epic proportions.That is not healthy for any market.

The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,"Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today. We are close, by far, to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year. As of this writing, WTI crude, for instance, is at  91.18 per barrel. Not surprisingly, Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year. At that time, I was talking about the new OPEC  production cut and how that represented a  massive gift  to the oil sector. Normally when I talk about investing, I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially. But when it comes to the oil patch, there are many different types of companies to choose from, with each one having a significantly different risk vs. reward payoff compared to the others. For some investors, it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fall.Back then, the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was  . But there are plenty of others to choose from, each one with its own positives and negatives. Examples include  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . To be clear, investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite. But in general, one thing that these all should have in common is that, as oil prices rise, they should appreciate. This should be true at least in the short term.Regardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market, a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here. There's certainly data to support that view. Take data provided by the EIA, for instance. In its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, which was published earlier this month, the agency calculated that, for 2023, global oil supply would come in at about 101.18 million barrels per day. This would be about 0.21 million barrels per day higher than the 100.97 million in consumption that would be experienced. This disparity might not seem like much to some investors. But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true. The total excess supply, spread over a single year, would be 76.65 million barrels.Now, it's important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldn't necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil. It all depends on how much crude already is out there. Generally, the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days' worth of supply of crude in OECD nations. Whenever this number starts ticking above 60, we start to drift into bearish territory. Based on the STEO report issued, by the end of this year, we should be at roughly 60.57 days' worth of supply for OECD nations. That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels. To make matters worse, the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 102.88 million barrels per day. That's 0.55 million barrels per day higher than the 102.33 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted. That would translate to 200.75 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year, with OECD inventories climbing to 2.84 billion barrels, or 62.14 days.Looking at the most recently available weekly , we see that domestic crude inventories for the US, excluding what's in the SPR  Strategic Petroleum Reserve , are about 1.27 billion barrels. That's an increase over the 1.23 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier. However, if we include the SPR into the picture, domestic inventories would have declined from 1.65 billion barrels to 1.62 billion. This is because, in order to combat high oil prices, the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR, taking inventories from 422.6 million barrels last year to 351 million this year.So to summarize, what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that exceeds consumption. We have evidence in the form of existing inventories of the picture looking worse than it did last year if we ignore the SPR. Although not mentioned previously, oil production also is the highest that it has been in more than two years, with output averaging 12.90 million barrels per day here at home. And you also have high pricing that, in theory, should attract more drillers that would, in turn, cause even more supply to come onto the market.All of this is fine, but there are some issues with the data from what I can see. For starters, while this is not necessarily an issue, the timing for oil prices to climb looks right. Even though the EIA has forecasted excess supply on a global scale for this year in its entirety, the current quarter that we are in, which is the third quarter, should actually see demand outpace supply to the tune of 0.58 million barrels per day. And in the fourth quarter, we should see demand outpace supply by 0.23 million barrels per day. All combined, this should cause global inventories to drop by 74.5 million barrels between the start of the third quarter and the end of this year.But when you dig into the actual data provided by the EIA, you end up with issues as well. For starters, the agency has Russia producing 10.57 million barrels of crude per day in the second quarter and 10.48 million barrels per day in the third quarter. For 2023 as a whole, the estimate is 10.64 million barrels per day. However, Russia has significantly reduced its own output. S P, for instance, recently estimated that, through 2024, the country should only be producing between 9.4 million and 9.5 million barrels of crude each day. OPEC, however, sees Russia dropping production from 10.85 million barrels per day in the second quarter of this year to only 10.22 million barrels per day in the third quarter. This year as a whole, we're looking at about 10.45 million barrels per day, which would be about 69.4 million barrels of crude, in the aggregate, lower than what the EIA data suggests.There are some other minor differences on the supply side. But the bigger differences involve demand. As an example, OPEC believes that global oil demand this year will average about 102.06 million barrels per day. That's 1.09 million barrels per day higher than what the EIA forecasted. For the third quarter of this year, OPEC believes that its own production would need to be roughly 29.23 million barrels per day in order to match demand. But if we take data provided by the group for the first two months of the third quarter, we're looking at an average of 27.39 million barrels per day. That translates to a deficit of 2.04 million barrels per day. That deficit is likely to grow to 3.32 million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year if OPEC production averages the same amount during that time. And with Saudi Arabia having just reaffirmed its target of keeping production lower by 1 million barrels per day through the rest of this year, that deficit is looking likely.If these estimates turn out to be accurate and if the historical data reported by OPEC for the first and second quarters of this year are correct, then we would be looking at an aggregate deficit of oil this year of 476.1 million barrels. While nobody knows what the future holds, the organization does think that global demand in 2024 will average 104.31 million barrels per day. And even with non-OPEC output slated to rise by 1.45 million barrels per day from 2023 to 2024, the group would need to put out 30.02 million barrels per day next year in order to avoid further shortfalls.As I mentioned earlier in this article, US production is higher than it has been in years. That trend also is looking set to continue. However, it could take quite a while before US output rises enough to bring prices down. For starters, as of August of this year, which is the most recent month for which we have  available, there were only 4,749 DUC wells across the major basins. This is actually down from the 5,191 reported one year earlier. To put this in perspective, in August of 2019, which was right before the COVID-19 pandemic, DUC wells numbered 8,156. The count of wells is often seen as the count of spots from which oil companies can realistically extract crude in a fairly short window of time. That's because a sizable portion of the cost of extracting oil comes from the drilling process. So when drilling is already done, but the entire well is not completed, it can be viewed as a mechanism to quickly ramp up output. But to see the DUC well count fall so low indicates that this potential is limited. In fact, the most recent Drilling Productivity Report issued by the EIA even indicated that production across the major basins should fall, collectively, by 40,000 barrels per day from September to October.At this point in time, I would say that investors probably have more reasons to be bullish on crude than they have reasons to be bearish. Yes, there are certain economic uncertainties and those could play a big role in what happens to pricing from this point on. But absent a major downturn in the economy, the existing balance between supply and demand in crude will have a much larger role in determining what happens with prices. Even though data provided by the EIA is showing a rather bearish situation, the OPEC data indicates otherwise and the market, from a pricing perspective, clearly is on its side. While some may argue that OPEC is not the most reliable source out there, my experience and looking at its data is that it tends to be quite accurate. And when you combine that with a lower DUC count, lower production moving forward in major basins, higher pricing in the market, and lower domestic inventories if we include the SPR, I would argue that the bullish case moving forward is definitely more compelling.Crude Value Insights is a service geared toward investors who are interested in keeping track of oil and gas E P firms.

AtThe balance of supply and demand in the oil market was predicted approximately correctly by most experts, and XOM stock ultimately proved to be the beneficiary, gaining 10.6  since the publication of my bullish article.As XOM's share priceExxon Mobil  a significant drop in its 2Q23 earnings, with adjusted net profit at  7.874 billion  1.94 per share , down from  17.551 billion  4.14 per share  in the prior year. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, weaker refining margins, and increased capital spending contributed to the decline. The firm's revenue decreased by 27  to  80.795 billion  the income from equity affiliates and other income are excluded , so it also missed the market's expectations.In April 2022, the company restructured, forming Exxon Mobil Product Solutions and centralizing certain groups. It now reports results in 4 segments  Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products.The Upstream segment's profit fell to  4.577 billion due to lower commodity prices and reduced oil-equivalent production. U.S. Upstream profit dropped to  920 million, while non-U.S. Upstream earnings declined to  3.657 billion. The Energy Products segment's profit decreased to  2.310 billion, primarily due to lower refining margins. Chemical Products reported a profit of  828 million, reflecting weaker industry conditions. In Specialty Products, profit improved to  671 million, driven by higher pricing.Capital and exploration expenses rose to  6.166 billion  Exxon Mobil aims to invest in promising projects, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain a sustainable dividend, with an expected 2023 CAPEX between  23- 25 billion.Oil prices got a boost as Saudi Arabia and Russia  voluntary production cuts until year-end, tightening the market. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in their recent note  September 20, 2023 - proprietary source , that Brent Crude exceeding  100 per barrel seems stretched, despite strong signals of market tightness, such as rising prices, robust demand, and falling inventories. The market is currently undersupplied by about 1 million barrels per day, mainly due to OPEC's 1 mb d cut, led by Saudi Arabia. The analysts expect that Saudi Arabia will maintain its cuts well into FY2024, keeping the market tight until at least early 2024. However, significant price increases are unlikely, with Brent expected to range between  85 to  95 per barrel by the end of 2024.So, based on the tight market situation until early 2024, XOM has an excellent background for its operational activities, which should become even more efficient in the foreseeable future.As another group of Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote a few days ago  proprietary source , the company aims to triple its earnings by FY2027 compared to FY2019, mainly thanks to strategic projects. XOM sets records for oil production in the Permian and achieved record production rates in Guyana. They also completed a significant chemical expansion project in the Gulf Coast. Exxon Mobil anticipates bringing on 2 new projects in the second half of the year, Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further enhancing earnings potential.After opportunistically rationalizing and divesting lower-margin refineries over the past few years, Exxon Mobil's Energy Products portfolio is now 85  integrated with its chemical facilities. In the long term, Exxon Mobil has positioned itself well to take advantage of opportunities in product reconfiguration, particularly in the biofuels, lubricants, and chemicals sectors as the energy transition continues to evolve.At the same time, we see that the valuation of the company currently looks quite modest  The market sees EV EBITDA for next year at the  6.7x level, although the EBITDA margin  TTM by quarter  is currently 21.5 , which is 57 basis points higher than last year for the same period. From a historical perspective in terms of EV EBITDA multiples, XOM is valued at the low end of the norm but has a very strong FCF that is likely to be even higher due to higher oil prices and is currently over 10  of market cap, indicating serious undervaluation.In recent weeks, refining margins have improved due to low clean product inventories, strong demand, facility outages, and geopolitical uncertainties, such as reduced Russian exports. Exxon Mobil, with its global refining capacity of about 4.5 million barrels per day, is expected to benefit significantly from these higher margins. Based on current price expectations, there is a  7  potential upside to Energy Products  downstream  consensus earnings in the second half of 2023 and a  15  upside to 2024 previous estimates, Morgan Stanley analysts added.Let's do the math together  If the above forecasts come true, or if actual earnings are close to these levels, then at 7.5x of EV EBITDA we should get a market cap of  533 billion after adjusting for net debt. Then the upside potential from the current price would be 14.38 , excluding   FWD . The expected total return exceeds 15 , so I reiterate my previous buy recommendation.I should mention that Exxon faces several significant risk factors in its operations, so everyone should be cautious when buying its stock.First, the company operates in a commodity-driven industry, where it has limited control over the prices of its products. This vulnerability to fluctuating commodity prices can impact its profitability and financial performance, as was the case throughout its entire history.Second, Exxon is engaged in major capital projects, and cost overruns on these projects can pose financial challenges. These overruns can strain the company's financial resources and potentially affect its ability to meet its investment goals and deliver expected returns to shareholders.Additionally, geopolitical risks are a concern for Exxon. Operating in countries with a history of corruption and political instability can expose the company to uncertainties that may impact production volumes and returns. However, Exxon's global presence helps mitigate some of these risks by diversifying its operations across different regions.Despite many obvious risks, Exxon Mobil stock is a  Buy  today even at the high end of its multi-week price range becausea  the oil market is still tight,b  refining margins are improving,c  management is taking some strategically sound steps to improve the company's operational efficiency  andd  the stock is quite cheap given the strong FCF levels,As a result, I expect XOM to be higher for longer - at least until something fundamentally changes.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Mid-America Apartment Communities: Advantages Being Ignored Amid Supply Glut," is the largest and arguably strongest Sunbelt apartment REIT with about 102,000 units in the portfolio. This portfolio is well diversified across various types of multifamily communities, including highly amenitized and luxurious apartments appealing to higherIt also boasts the best-positioned balance sheet in its peer group with investment grade credit ratings of A3 A-, net debt to EBITDA of 3.4x, a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , and a weighted average debt maturity of 7.5 years.Beyond discernible traits of quality in the portfolio and balance sheet, there's often a certain  about high-quality companies that's difficult to pinpoint. You just know it when you see it, assuming you have an adequately trained eye.If I hadThe current CEO Eric Bolton has led the company for over two decades and has been at MAA for nearly three decades. During his tenure, MAA's total return performance has absolutely crushed that of its peersAnd yet, the market is pricing MAA at only a slight premium to its two closest Sunbelt multifamily REIT peers and a  to its high-quality coastal multifamily cousins.I'll show below that MAA's balance sheet remains in pristine shape, and the market has little to worry about on that front. It appears that the market has become concerned about the oncoming wave of supply scheduled to come online in MAA's select cities over the next year or two.I would argue, however, that this wave of supply will only be a temporary headwind, and that the current stock price decline represents a phenomenal buying opportunity for this best-in-class landlord.MAA owns a Sunbelt-concentrated yet meaningfully diversified portfolio of apartment complexes stretching from Las Vegas, Nevada to Norfolk, Virginia.In addition to a heavy presence in major Sunbelt cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Tampa, and Orlando, MAA also has significant exposure to fast-growing secondary markets like Jacksonville, Greenville, and Charleston.These Sunbelt markets have enjoyed population and job growth well above the national average over the past several years but also over the decade preceding COVID-19.The factors that drive these domestic migratory trends have not changed. Housing costs remain higher in many non-Sunbelt states, while lower taxes across the Sunbelt have attracted many businesses and jobs. Moreover, crime rates and rampant homelessness have fueled a population outflow from many coastal cities.MAA's median resident age is 34 years old, and the average rent-to-income ratio  sits at 22 .As I explained in a recent  titled  'Higher For Longer' Is Totally Unsustainable  Buy Defensive Dividend Stocks,  homebuying affordability has reached a nearly  as both home prices  mortgage rates keep rising. The practical result of this will be that many would-be homebuyers will have to remain renters until homeownership becomes more affordable. This is great news for multifamily landlords like MAA, because a rent-to-income ratio of 22  is far more affordable than the alternative of buying a home right now.Another competitive advantage for MAA is its robust development and redevelopment platform, which was significantly bolstered by its  of Post Properties in 2016. Post had expertise in property development that has clearly been beneficial to MAA over the years since the acquisition. Today, most of MAA's portfolio growth comes from internal development projects.This development arm, in addition to MAA's redevelopment platform that constantly upgrades a portion of its apartments with the latest technologies and interior designs, keeps the portfolio fresh and in tune with renter preferences.What's more, MAA is able to deliver internally developed properties at stabilized yields of 6-7  or higher. For development projects currently in the lease-up phase, MAA expects to generate a stabilized NOI yield of 7.2 . This is a massive strength at a time when multifamily cap rates are in the 4-5  territory.The above investment approach has worked extraordinarily well for MAA over the last few decades. We see it in the numbers. Compare, for example, MAA's Q2 core FFO per share and same-store NOI growth to that of its peersUses AFFO instead of core FFOUses NFFO instead of core FFOGranted, this is only one quarter. But if you zoom out further, you'll find more evidence of MAA's outperformance over its peers.Quality isn't always easy to describe, but it does tend to be quantifiable in performance numbers. That is certainly the case for MAA.The market seems to think that Sunbelt multifamily REITs' time in the sun has come to an end. The period of very low-interest rates from the second half of 2020 through early 2022 spurred a surge in new development starts in the multifamily space, focused on the areas where people were moving during the pandemic. This includes the suburban areas of coastal cities and pretty much everywhere across the Sunbelt.Notice in the chart below how multifamily construction starts averaged about 500,000 in 2022, compared to an average of under 400,000 during the 2010s.A large share of these new apartments are going to be delivered in MAA's Sunbelt markets.The market seems to think these new units will compete directly with MAA's existing portfolio, which is not necessarily the case. MAA enjoys at least two competitive advantages amid this wave of new supplyYou can see both competitive advantages displayed in the illustration below.First, in many of MAA's markets, the submarkets where the REIT's properties are located are expected to receive only a fraction of the total supply coming to those cities. MAA's communities often enjoy superior locations that offer greater convenience in terms of proximity to highways, shopping centers, and workplaces.Second, MAA's existing portfolio is able to offer rent rates significantly below the asking rents of these newly delivered apartments. Everyone knows that construction costs have gone up a lot in the last few years. Plus, developers typically have high-interest rate construction loans in place. That, in addition to the desire to sell the stabilized property for top dollar, requires them to seek out the highest possible rent rates.Thus, the primary competitors of newly delivered apartments tend not to be existing apartments but rather . These new apartment communities will likely have to offer concessions such as one or a few months of free rent in order to get leases signed at these higher rent rates. But in most cases, it is unlikely that they will drop rents low enough to compete with MAA's existing apartment stock.Plus, notice in the chart above that both construction starts and building permits for multifamily properties have dropped significantly below their 2022 levels. High-interest rates have caused starts to plummet. This means that the wave of new supply will be severely curtailed starting sometime in 2025.The supply headwind is temporary.In the long run, I would worry more about the supply pressures urban apartment landlords in coastal cities will face from office-to-multifamily conversions. Cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago with lots of old, half-empty office buildings and local governments that are desperate to revitalize their downtown areas  and therefore likely to subsidize conversion projects  are more likely to face a secular trend of apartment supply growth than the Sunbelt.According to a recent  put out by researchers at New York University and Columbia Business School, the top five metro areas with the most potential office-to-multifamily conversions were  you guessed itDue to greater office utilization and less public transportation, the Sunbelt is at a much lower risk of apartment supply growth from office conversions in the long run.MAA has among the strongest balance sheets, if not  strongest, in its multifamily REIT peer group. It is not the only multifamily REIT with credit ratings of A- A3......but it is the only REIT with 100  fixed-rate debt and net debt to EBITDA as low as 3.4x.But net debt to EBITDA is only one metric to measure balance sheet strength. There are others, and they all show MAA well-positioned compared to peers.MAA stacks up well against its peer group average in terms of debt to assets, unencumbered assets, debt service coverage, and weighted average debt maturity.Notice the small highlighted section showing that the  peer group  constituents include AVB, CPT, EQR, Essex Property Trust , and UDR Inc. . In other words, MAA is only comparing itself to the largest and strongest multifamily REITs, not any of the smaller ones with weaker balance sheets.The REIT does have a steady slate of debt maturities to refinance in the coming years. That is perhaps the weakest aspect of the balance sheet. Even if the bond market is favorable to MAA, the REIT will likely have to roll over these loans at new interest rates at least 200 basis points above the weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , based on the current average effective bond yield for corporates with an  A  rating.The good news is that MAA has plenty of liquidity as well as significant retained cash from its low payout ratio. This should help it blunt the blow of refinancing at higher rates.Certainly, up until now, MAA has managed to avoid rising interest expenses. Just the opposite has been the case. MAA's interest expense has  since 2019  i.e. the trailing twelve-month period ending at the beginning of 2020 .Perhaps the only reason why EQR's interest expense has fallen more than MAA's is that EQR has been a net seller of assets in order to deleverage. Notice in the chart below that while MAA's total assets have crept up since the beginning of 2020, EQR's total assets have declined by about 5 .EQR sold properties in order to reduce its debt load, while MAA has  needed to sell properties to reduce its debt.As more supply comes online and developers get desperate to offload properties amid high-interest rates, MAA's management believes that they will soon be able to utilize their significant dry powder  1.25 billion capacity on the credit facility plus  150 million in cash  to scoop up attractively valued acquisitions.MAA is best-in-class in the multifamily REIT space because of itsThis explains why it is my largest multifamily REIT holding and why I view it as a phenomenal buying opportunity right now.There will be mild to moderate headwinds in the short term from supply deliveries and debt refinancing, but MAA will be able to navigate these slight headwinds far easier than the market seems to think.What the market seems to ignore is  the Sunbelt is growing, and would-be homebuyers are largely stuck in the rental market for the foreseeable future.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

GLTR Dulls: Time To Buy,"In a June 27 article on , I wroteThe   was trading at  87.22 on June 22. On October 2, it was 5.6  lower at the  82.34 per share level. GLTR has lost its glitter over the past months, which could be a golden opportunity, no pun intended, for the future. It is virtually impossible to pick tops or bottoms in any market as they tend to extend past reasonable, logical, and rational price levels during bullish or bearish trends.Gold prices declined 3.28  in Q3 2023, while silver fell 1.58 . Over the first nine months of 2023, gold was 2.18  higher, while silver dropped 6.61 .December COMEX gold futures settled at  1,866.10 on September 29, with COMEX silver for December delivery at  22.45 per ounce.The chart shows that December gold was trending lower in early October.December silver was also in a bearish trend on October 3, over  1 lower than the Q3 closing price.While gold and silver posted losses in Q3, platinum and palladium prices increased. Platinum closed at  915.90 per ounce, 1.26  higher for the third quarter. Palladium, at  1,256 per ounce on September 29, was 2.78  higher than the closing price at the end of June 2023.

The long bond is steaming toward critical long-term technical support at the June 2007 104-41 low.Rising interest rates increase the cost of carrying commodity inventories, and precious metals are no exception. The trajectory of rate increases attracts capital from stocks and other assets to fixed-income products as yields rise.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have caused the US Dollar Index  to recover.After probing below the 100 level in July 2023, the U.S. dollar index that measures the U.S. currency against other reserve foreign exchange instruments recovered to near the 107 level. A rising dollar tends to be bearish for precious metals and commodity prices.Gold is a unique asset, a hybrid between a currency and a commodity. Gold is a metal and a hard asset held by central banks, monetary authorities, and governments worldwide as a foreign exchange reserve asset. Central banks have been net buyers of gold over the past years, increasing their holdings and validating gold s role in the global financial system.While gold prices have declined, the following factors favor gold at the current price levelMeanwhile, silver, platinum, and palladium could go along for the bullish ride if gold prices resume the upward trajectoryEach year, investment demand is the critical supply and demand fundamental factor for the four precious metals. Limited liquidity in platinum and palladium can cause significant price moves when trends change. A sudden herd of buying could send prices significantly higher as low liquidity exacerbates price variance, causing moves to extreme levels.The top holdings of the Aberdeen Physical Precious Metals Basket shares ETF includeAt  81.93 per share on October 3, GLTR had around  904 million in assets under management.

Plains GP Holdings: Healthy Financials Coupled With Upside Growth Potentials,"Plains GP Holdings  is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership  since the end of , the company's cash flow has been completely derived from an indirect investment in Plain All American Pipeline Plains All American has a prominent position and infrastructure in the Permian Basin, which is the most important basin in North America. As theFigure 1As mentioned earlier, a solid balance sheet and capital structure is one of the strong elements of Plains. The company was successful in increasing its cash generation during the last year. It reached a cash balance of  983 million in  versus only  327 million in 2Q 2022. Higher cash generation improved their balance sheet by declining their net debt to  7.2 billion in 2Q 2023 year over year compared with  8.6 million in the same time in 2022. Thankfully, their equity level of  14.8 billion is far higher than the net debt, which offsets the risks of future debt and equity financing  see Figure 2 .Figure 2 - PAGP's capital structure  in millionsFurthermore, the solid cash structure of Plains is another element that makes the company prominent. After a deep drop in their operating cash flow from  941 million in 3Q 2022 to  334 million at the end of 2022, they increased their cash flow from operations and reached  887 million at the end of 2Q 2023. Thankfully, their capital spending remained at a reasonable level of  159 million, thereby leading to an ample amount of  728 million of free cash flow at the end of the recent quarter. Except for 3Q 2022, their generated free cash flow hit the highest amount in the previous quarters. In the recent quarter, the management declared a  0.2675 dividend per share, which accounts for approximately  52.5 million of dividend payments based on 196,000,000 outstanding shares. According to their large amount of FCF, there is room for both deleveraging and higher shareholder distributions in the future  see Figure 3 .Figure 3 - PAGP's cash structure  in millionsThe management predicted to keep their leverage level at lower than 3.5x by the end of 2023. After analyzing their healthy cash and capital structures in the previous quarters, it goes with no surprise to see that their guidance is easily reachable. The wake of the COVID-19 outbreak and the downturn of 2020 caused leverage ratios of Plains to surge over 7x  however, the company enhanced its leverage condition considerably through successful deleveraging in the last couple of years. Ultimately, Plains' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2.8x in TTM, and its net debt-to-CFO ratio is 2.5x in TTM  see Figure 4 .Improved financial flexibility paves the way for higher cash returns to investors and allows the management to consider a new capital allocation framework. The management  to increase its cash distribution by  0.15 per share per year, and this increase will continue until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 . Their guidance for their unit distribution coverage ratio by the end of 2023 is 215 , which shows that the company has plenty of room to grow, and its unit price, therefore, has an upside potential to rise.Figure 4 - PAGP's leverage conditionIt is worth noting that the company's healthy liquidity condition, coupled with strong coverage conditions, eliminates risks of probable economic recessions to a great extent. During the recent quarters, the company improved its liquidity condition across the board of current and cash ratios. The company's current assets are well enough to pay back its short-term obligations, with a current ratio of 1.0x. In addition, their cash ratio became twofold to 0.2x in 2Q 2023 versus 0.1x at the end of the first quarter, which indicates the company is capable of paying circa 20  of its obligations only with its generated cash, which is attractive  see Figure 5 .Figure 5 - PAGP's liquidity conditionThe first and foremost risk associated with Plains operations and profitability is related to any major or minor changes in supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas, NLG, and other services that PAA provides. Shortages in supply and demand, which can be caused by a variety of factors that are not under the management's control, may adversely affect their operations and financial condition. Also, the management's prediction for 2023 WTI crude oil is  82.5 bbl on average. If oil prices drop more, other projections and operations may adversely become affected. It is important to mention that Plains distributes all of its available cash  thus, its growth process may be slower than businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand their operations.Plains is a stable and well-performing business in the oil and gas industry  it is one of the most prominent midstream companies in North America. The company's operation and financial results have been on the same path as the management's guidance, which shows their stability for more growth in the future. The management plans to increase its cash distribution by  0.15 per share yearly until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 . Based on this year's 215 , we can say that the company has plenty of room to grow, and its unit price thereby has a good potential to rise. Furthermore, the healthy cash and capital structures of Plains resulted in strong leverage and liquidity conditions that eliminate risks of further financial and economic constraints in the future.

Public Storage Short Thesis: Supply Glut Coincides With Declining Demand,"Public Storage  is trading at a high multiple of 20.7X AFFO at a time when self-storage is oversupplied. Occupancy and rates are already dropping substantially with significantly more developments in the pipeline. Self-storage inventory was built up to meet event-driven demand of the post-pandemic surge which will result in significant competition and price cuts as demand drops back down.Factors unique to the self-storage sector make way for a harder landing than would be possible in more traditional real estate.Allow me to begin with acknowledging that I was too early in this thesis. Back in 2017 I wrote an article about PSA being . While PSA has underperformed the S P since then, it is still a positive return which makes a short position unsuccessful.While I was clearly far too early, I think the fundamentals remain in place that make PSA a dangerous investment.If one observes the last few decades, self-storage has been an amazingly strong sector. It has enjoyed consistently strong organic growth with only brief dips in recessions. PSA, as the largest player in the space, has captured its fair share of the upside.Most of the time, when trends go on for decades there is some sort of underlying stability. However, I don't think that is the case with self-storage. While the demand function of most real estate sectors is well-bounded within clear macroeconomic guardrails, the demand function of self-storage is completely unbounded.Allow me to elaborate as to what I mean by this. Housing, for example, has clear guardrails. The number of households will be related to population and GDP. As population and GDP rise the number of households rises, but because GDP and population stay within a fairly tight band the demand for housing stays within a tight band.Industrial also had guardrails in that demand for warehouses and manufacturing facilities was related to overall retail sales. As retail sales increased demand for industrial real estate increased but it was at a slow and measured pace. The birth of e-commerce broke through the upper guardrail in that it functioned as a multiplier on the ratio of industrial space needed per sale. E-commerce is the new guardrail and I think it is quite firmly here to stay which keeps industrial in a new steady state.Self-storage is more lawless. There is no natural economic factor to which demand is tied. The overall demand for self-storage space is contingent on the percentage of U.S. households that utilize self-storage.According to the Wall Street Journal, which used data from EXRThat is a very nebulous number.Why did it go from 2.7  to 10.6What is stopping it from going back down to 2.7I think the self-storage market has been lulled into a false sense of security by their baseline demand factor going up 4X  from 2.7 to 10.6  in the last 40 years.That is not normal. In fact, it is extraordinarily atypical and exists only in a small pocket of the world for a small portion of modern times.There was a period of time in REITs known as the retail apocalypse in which over the course of a few quarters the market collectively realized that the U.S. was over retailed. Retail REIT stocks collapsed as it became broadly known that the United States had somewhere between 150 -300  the retail square footage per capita of other developed nations depending on whom you compared us to.That is tiny compared to the magnitude of self-storage in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world.According to Converting to feet that is 118 million square feet in Europe. The U.S. has over 1.7 billion square feet of self-storage.According to a 2018 Statista survey, 90 percent of worldwide self-storage inventory is in the U.S.This is a strictly American phenomenon based on our propensity to buy lots of stuff. That extreme level of consumerism is required to maintain the 10.6  of households that pay for self-storage.Maybe that can be maintained, but it is far from certain. I think the natural level of demand is much lower.So what happens if that 10.6  of households paying for self-storage drifts back down to the former 2.7  level, a level which is still high compared to most of history and compared to the rest of the worldSelf-storage is among the easiest property types to develop. As demand has grown, the number of units has grown to meet that demand. That is how most real estate works, but most real estate has guardrails.Apartments and Industrial had the same wave of supply in the 2022-2023 timeframe but that will merely take occupancy rates down to about 93  and 94 , respectively. The demand in those sectors is permanent as long as the population of the U.S. is permanent and the internet is capable of creating e-commerce orders.In self-storage, the supply has been built up to match a lofty and unsustainable level of demand. The displacement of the pandemic resulted in a surge of demand. Rather than the sector just enjoying the good times, it built supply as if that demand was permanent.39.9 million square feet were developed in 2022 with another 52.5 million square feet on the way in 2023. to above dataOver the last 5 years, 254 million square feet of self-storage was developed in the U.S. That is more than twice the entire self-storage industry in all of Europe.All of this supply is predicated on a notion that the 10.6  level of utilization is sustainable. It is a blind extrapolation of historical growth. It relies on a level of utilization that has only been made possible by extreme goods-based consumerism.Humans will always spend money on the stuff that makes them happy. Perhaps they should. I'm not here to judge anyone.But what happens when the things that make people happy changeInstead of physical goods maybe people start preferring vacations. Or perhaps they start preferring digital goods like a library of music on Spotify over their former CD collection.I'm not suggesting that I can know where utilization rates will go, but I do think it is dangerous to build up supply as if the all-time record demand level will last forever.Back when utilization rates were at 2.7  the number of self-storage units in the U.S. was just a fraction of what it is today. On today's level of supply, that 2.7  level represents roughly 80  vacancy rates.As there is no other clear use for self-storage facilities, the value would drop to the value of the land. Those which are well-located could be redeveloped for other purposes but most would suffer.There are preliminary bits of evidence that utilization is in fact dropping.At a national level vacancy is starting to creep back up toward the historical 10 .As the pandemic gets further away people are returning to more stable lives and pulling their stuff back out of storage units.The result is that rental rates are collapsing, albeit from the surge highs.20  lost rental rates on top of declining occupancy is likely to make for a rough remainder of 2023.Apartments and industrial are absorbing their 2023 supply surge as demand remains strong. Thus, the new units are mostly absorbed by new demand and only partially hurting occupancy.In self-storage, demand growth appears to be negative in 2023 from the aforementioned return to post-pandemic normalcy. Thus, vacancy is rising both from the new units and from negative absorption.Construction is concentrated in a handful of submarkets with the top 10 as followsUnfortunately for PSA, these are most of their top markets by NOI.Highlighted in yellow are the markets in common with the 10 highest new construction markets.Where utilization rates go is completely unknown. If it stays at 10.6  this will be a normal cyclical recession for the space. If it dips it could be disastrous.The challenge for PSA's stock is that even if utilization stays at historically high levels it appears significantly overvalued.The self-storage sector as a whole is expensive with a 17.3X P AFFO. That strikes me as too high given the rental rate contraction data that is already available.Other REIT sectors trade at significantly cheaper multiples with positive growth outlooks.Within the sector, PSA trades at the highest multiple of 20.7X 2023 AFFO.At a property level, I think valuations have peaked because cap rates are sitting at a level below prevailing interest rates.Given where the Fed Funds rate is, I would anticipate cap rates climbing to about 8  and since it looks like NOI is going down, that change would likely come from price declines.Even as data has come out showing higher vacancy rates and significant rental rate declines, PSA's stock has not responded.This suggests that the upcoming weakness has not been priced in at all.Fair value consists of a composite of various plausible scenarios weighted by the chance of occurrence. The scenario in which vacancy skyrockets due to self-storage utilization falling back into the 2s is the downside scenario. My base case is that utilization remains roughly where it is with merely the pandemic surge getting undone.This suggests negative AFFO share growth in the short to medium term followed by more normal growth. In general, this sort of trajectory would warrant an AFFO multiple closer to 10X, but PSA does have some strong attributes which could justify a higher multiple.Given these positive attributes, I see fair value at around 14X AFFO which represents about 33  downside from today's price.Shorting in general is riskier than going long because the downside of a short is theoretically infinite. That said, there are a few aspects which make a PSA short a bit more approachable.1  it is a large company with low volatility which suggests the chance of going parabolic is reduced.2  As the most expensive and largest in its sector there is no company that could reasonably buy out PSA accretively.3  PSA has minimal existing short interest which largely prevents a short squeeze.Availability of shares to short will depend on one's custodian. Given the magnitude of float and lack of existing short interest, PSA should be available at most custodians without a  hard to borrow  fee.Right now there are abnormally great investment opportunities.

KNOT Offshore Partners: Main Concerns Regarding Leverage And Liquidity,"KNOT Offshore Partners LP  is operating and acquiring vessels to pursue its business in the shuttle tanker segment. In other words, a shuttle tanker is a floating pipeline that operates under a period charter and is based onOne of my main concerns about the Partnership was related to their upcoming debt maturities during 2023, which totaled around  372 million because this amount was much higher than their operating cash flow. Thankfully, during the recent quarter, the management  that they fixed credit approval for the  320 millionGoing forward through 2023, KNOP's debt refinancing will remain on my watch list. For instance, they will announce the result of a discussion with their lenders regarding the two  25 million unsecured revolving credit facilities with maturity dates of August and November 2023. Moreover, their new contracts developments regarding new three-year time charter contracts for the Fortaleza Knutsen and the Recife Knutsen with Transpetro lower their risk of losing their total assets.Notwithstanding the boom in oil prices during 2022, it seems that KNOP Partnership could not take appropriate advantage of high energy prices to improve its financial results. In other words, my main concern about the Partnership is associated with their debt levels, which is of great importance to be cared for. Albeit their net debt level declined slightly to circa  986 million by the end of  versus  1.011 billion at the end of 2022, their net debt level is still higher than the equity amount. During the last year, the Partner's equity levels were almost constant, finally sitting at  648 million by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, KNOP could increase its cash generation slightly to  52 million in 1Q 2023 versus  47.6 million and  41 million at the end of 4Q 2022 and 1Q 2022, respectively  see Figure 1 .Analyzing their cash structure indicates that during the first quarter of 2023, the Partnership's cash from operations reached over  29 million versus  21 million and  18 million at the end of 4Q and 1Q 2022, respectively. Meanwhile, despite favorable energy prices during the last year, and the end of the downturn of 2020, the Partnership's charter contracts ended in tandem with several vessels dry docking. Being dry docked for vessels is the same as auto repairing for vehicles on the land. Thus, routinely maintaining and repairing their vessels increased their costs. As a result, the Partnership's capital expenditures surged to  1.4 million at the end of the recent quarter versus only  0.5 million at the end of 2022 and  0.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. When all was said and done, approximately  28 million is left as a free cash flow for the Partnership to finance its distributions. Moreover, KNOP Partnership  a  0.026 dividend payment per share for the second quarter of 2023, which was paid a few days ago on August 10th, 2023, which was the same as the fourth quarter of 2022 after the management decided to cut their quarterly dividends by 95 . Consequently, their cash inflows should outpace their cash outflows because the number of their common number of outstanding shares was 34,900,000. Their dividend payment, thereby, was less than  1 million for the second quarter of 2023  see Figure 2 .Investigating the Partnership's leverage condition across the board of net debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-CFO indicates the importance of declining debt levels. As it is indicated in Figure 3, Although KNOP's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from over 26x at the end of 2022 to 22x in 1Q 2023, it is still very high. Moreover, their net debt-to-operating cash flow is even worse at 33x, while it was at 49x year over year compared with 1Q 2022. Their leverage condition is particularly concerning, and hopefully, the management reduce net debt levels, and thus, their leverage should be at a decent pace.Besides leverage ratios, you can see that the Partnership's liquidity condition is at high risk. After analyzing the Partnership's cash and capital structures, it is not too surprising to receive warnings from their current and cash ratios of 0.22x and 0.13x, respectively, at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Notwithstanding not changing considerably from the fourth quarter of 2022, both liquidity ratios dropped considerably year over year as versus 1Q 2022. The partnership's current ratio was 0.56x, and its cash ratio was 0.38x in the first quarter of 2022  see Figure 4 .Looking ahead, as the supply constraints have mostly been solved, it is  to see a strong period for crude tankers during the coming winter months, and it is expected to be continued over the next few years. In other words, the supply and demand balance outlook is positive, with oil consumption in 2023 expected to exceed its 2019 levels for the first time after the COVID-19 outbreak and even grow more during 2024. In minutiae, it is  that the supply in the crude tanker segment to grow by 1.1  and 0.5  by the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively. Also, on the demand side, the demand for crude tanker volumes will improve by 1-2  in 2023 and 2024.Additionally, based on  report, global oil inventories will decline and thus put upward pressure on crude oil prices in the second half of 2023. This upward trend is mainly due to the extended voluntary cuts of Saudi Arabia's crude oil production and increasing global demand. Meanwhile, rising global crude oil production in 2024 will put moderate downward pressure on crude prices in the second quarter of 2024.Analyzing KNOT Offshore Partners LP's financials and market outlook indicate that there is a particular concern associated with the Partnership's leverage and liquidity conditions. They cut their dividend payments by 95  in the first and second quarter of 2023, thus this distribution cut may provide an opportunity for their free cash inflow exceeds free cash outflow. However, it may take years for the Partnership to deleverage and thus be able to increase its dividend payments. Moreover, thankfully the management signed new three-year charter contracts and could successfully refinance some debt maturities. As a result, I prefer to keep an eye on the Partnership's leverage and liquidity conditions, and thus I believe that a hold rating is appropriate for KNOP units.As always, thank you for your reading, and I welcome your comments.

Goehring & Rozencwajg Q2 2023 Natural Resource Market Commentary,"Picture it, if you will  December of 2029. In a dimly lit private dining room, the sound of cutlery clinking blends with spirited conversation. Gathered at this stately round table is a diverse group of investors. Some wear the hard-fought wrinkles of significant gains, while others wear the furrowed brows of regrettable losses. What stratagems, one wonders, divided the winners from the less fortunateTo call the 2020s volatile might be akin to calling the sun slightly warm. Consider 2020, with the globe in the clutches of COVID-19. Then there was the inflationary flare of 2022, a fire stoked by Russia s move on Ukraine. Central banks, as reactive as ever, escalated rates in a dramatic fashion, prompting many to toast to the Federal Reserve s apparent mid-2023 success. Alas, as the hypothetical scene suggests, the party might have been premature.The prevailing wisdom of 2023 still held that oil demand had seen its heyday in late 2019. How baffling, then, that by the end of the decade, demand kept reaching new unexpected highs, largely propelled by emerging markets like India. A trust in the boundless potential of the US oil shales was dashed, as production waned midway through our tumultuous decade. The American solution, releasing a sizable portion of its strategic reserves, was a mere temporary salve, and oil s price ascended to dizzying heights. In a few short years, oil had gone from universally accepted as  uninvestable  to the  must-own  asset class.A brief upturn in food prices post the Russian-Ukraine conflict turned out to be just the opening act. The main event  A succession of agricultural calamities, the most severe being a midwest US drought, eerily reminiscent of the 1930s Dust Bowl.Renewable energy, hailed as the savior of both wallet and environment, took a rather ironic turn. With heavy government backing, these  clean  energies seemed to generate only escalated electricity costs and persistent power shortages, plaguing the very Western economies that championed them.The mighty dollar began the decade without peer. Yet, halfway through the 2020s, the musical chairs of global monetary order began, with nations gravitating towards their own currencies and the golden touch of precious metals to square off their imbalances.With the dollar s retreat, the inflationary inferno pushed commodity demand significantly higher. Bonds were not spared, resulting in the central banks  predictable rescue operation as governments had trouble rolling over their short-term obligations.Equity markets too grappled with inflation s weight and the diminishing lure of bonds. A stark illustration  The Dow Jones Industrial Average s  relationship with gold. From a once formidable 20 1 ratio at the decade s onset, a historical crossroads loomed  ten years later, they looked set to cross   a rare event that had occurred only three times in 140 years  1896, 1932-4 and 1980 .Retrospect at our 2029 table illuminated the follies and triumphs of a decade. Those that had bought the  must own  assets of the early 2020s  i.e., fixed income and growth stocks  were rewarded with the worst inflation-adjusted returns. Conversely, the assets most universally hated at the start of the 2020s  i.e., hard assets  produced the best returns by far. Leading that hard asset class would be the quintessential  hard  asset  gold.Those far-sighted souls who, a decade earlier, had the wisdom to acquire gold found themselves comfortably ensconced in the cozy realm of foresight. While much of the market grappled, rather inelegantly, with the unforeseen maladies of the decade   resulting in discernible, tangible losses in what were once deemed  safe  portfolios   these astute speculators sat on the very asset that the generalist hordes suddenly found irresistible. Come the twilight of the 2020s, they stood not just as benefactors of their own prudence but as the envy of many, having firmly secured the reins of their financial future.Peering into fog of the future, one is invariably met with a degree of uncertainty, a kind of myopia if you will. Yet, it might amuse our diligent readership that the unforeseen turns and tempests in today s financial landscape were none other than the subjects dissected at our Fall 2022 Investor Day.Marko Papic candidly expounded on our trajectory  veering away from the quiet sanctity of a unipolar world to the cacophonous theaters of multipolarity. The aspiring occupant of the Oval Office, Vivek Ramaswamy, elucidated on the curious ways ESG pressures have begun to distort corporate investment, particularly when one treads the rugged terrains of natural resources.Leigh Goehring sounded the clarion call on a looming metamorphosis   our gas fields, both global and our own continental, teetering on the brink of a structural deficit. As for agriculture  Shaun Hackett painted a frosty panorama, hinting at the dawning of a global cooling epoch, replete with its tantrums of volatile weather and crop yields that greatly disapointed. Adam Rozencwajg warned of the faux allure of renewables, focusing on the paradoxical energy crisis it might birth, thanks to the nettlesome issue of their efficiency. Edward Chancellor, always the astute historian, regaled us with tales of investment cycles, drawing our gaze to the grand pendulum swings in energy and metals   a narrative of liquidation, but promising prosperity in its aftermath.Now, it s true that at Goehring   Rozencwajg, our crystal ball isn t infallible. Yet, it s in our DNA to speculate, prognosticate, and occasionally, pontificate. An interesting tapestry woven by our speakers was a shared spirit of contrarianism, a thirst to not just see the future but to envision it with a tint different from the many.The golden thread for our attendees  A bullish outlook for several commodities. But ah  One precious element was not discussed  gold. The gilded metal, we assert, stands on the precipice of a roaring bull run, perhaps echoing its luminous days of the  70s and the 2000s. Despite its sluggish dance since the commodity rally began in May 2020, with gold s mere 15  advance looking rather pale against the Rogers International Commodity Index s 160  and the Goldman Sachs Spot Commodity Index s 125  leap, we sense an imminent turn of the tides. Investors, it seems, might be getting one last golden ticket.Those with long memories might remember how gold became the  must-own  asset of the 1970s. We believe the same thing is happening today. Gold demand will come from speculators seeking a short-term profit and generalist investors seeking protection from financial turmoil and mounting inflationary pressures. Gold and silver were radically undervalued in 1971. Over the next decade, they were the best-performing asset class. Between 1970 and the peak in January 1980, gold and silver surged 2,000  and 2,800 , respectively.After peaking in 1980, gold spent the next 20 years drifting lower. By 1999, it had become as cheap as ever on many metrics. Between 1999 and today, gold advanced more than eight-fold, significantly outperforming stocks and bonds. Despite its strong appreciation, we believe gold remains exceptionally cheap based on our framework. In the following essay, we will describe our valuation techniques and show that gold still has a considerable upside, irrespective of what occurs in global financial markets.The question remains  Come 2029, on which side of the table do you envision yourselfGold is no different than any other asset class  it becomes popular, rises in price, is overvalued, and ultimately represents a poor investment. Other times, it undergoes periods of investor disinterest, suffers sustained price declines, becomes undervalued, and ultimately represents an excellent investment.We are not gold bugs. Over the long term, gold protects monetary debasement  however, unlike equities, gold will provide little real return. If an investor can identify periods when gold becomes extremely undervalued, it can offer exceptional excess returns, often uncorrelated with other financial assets.The key is figuring out when gold is undervalued and overvalued.In this essay, we will describe the various valuation frameworks we have used over many years to estimate gold price targets and determine when to add or reduce our gold exposure.In May 2000, I was  and discussed gold s radical undervaluation. I predicted gold would reach  2,500 per ounce before the bull market ended. When the article was published, gold was  275 per ounce, and continuous central bank selling had left investors wildly bearish towards the so-called  barbarous relic.  Our valuation framework pointed instead to substantial potential returns. Although gold never hit our  2,500 target, it reached  1,900 in 2011 and was the best-performing asset class of the 2000s.Gold has been in a bull market for nearly a generation, leaving many questioning if it still represents an attractive investment as in the late 1960s or 1990s.After bottoming at  251 per ounce in August 1999, gold surged to  1,900 in August 2011, pulled back to  1,050 by December 2015, and resumed its advance, making an all-time high triple-tops of  2,050 in August 2020, March 2022 and May 2023. However, gold is now as undervalued as in 1999 on several metrics.Potential gold investors must ask three questions. First, is gold undervalued today  Second, if gold is undervalued, to what degree  And finally, how high could it go were it to swing from undervalued to overvalued   something that has happened twice in 100 yearsTo help answer the first question, we compare the value of gold to both the money supply and the value of financial assets. We also find it helpful to consider the historical relationship between gold and other commodities.Below are three charts that highlight these relationships over the last 100 years. The first chart shows the relationship between the size of the US Treasury s gold holdings and the Federal Reserve s balance sheet. Although somewhat controversial, we believe the size of the Fed s balance is related to the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings over the long term. According to this chart, there have been two distinct periods over the past 100 years during which gold was highly overvalued and three periods during which gold was significantly undervalued.In the late 1930s, President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 65 , raising the gold price to  35 per ounce. At the same time, clouds of war were gathering across Europe. The combination of a higher gold price in the US and growing hostilities in Europe led to a massive volume of gold inflows in America. At the peak, the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings exceeded the size of the Fed s balance sheet by an incredible 1.7 times. The gold flows into the US were so great that the Treasury could have exchanged every dollar bill in circulation for gold and retained half of its gold stock.The gold s second period of overvaluation occurred in January 1980. Gold spiked in a parabolic blow-off to  850 per ounce in January 1980, following two decades of accelerating inflation. At the peak, the Treasury s gold holdings  vastly diminished from the late-1930s levels  were once again valued at 1.7 times the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.Gold turned out to be a terrible investment after both periods of radical overvaluation. Between 1937 and 1971, gold was flat while the stock market advanced tenfold. Between 1980 and 2000, gold fell 70  while the stock market ran thirteen-fold.On the other hand, gold was radically undervalued three times. The first period occurred in the late 1960s. With gold fixed at  35 under the Bretton Wood s Gold Exchange Standard and inflationary pressures mounting in the US, gold flowed out of the Treasury. By 1971, the Fed s monetary base exceeded the Treasury s gold holdings by seven times. The three-decade reversal was impressive  between 1938 and 1971, the Treasury s gold holdings went from covering the Fed s monetary base by 1.7 times to less than 15 .The second period of undervaluation occurred during the late 1990s. Following twenty years of falling gold prices and a rapid expansion of the Fed s balance sheet, the size of the Fed s monetary base exceeded the Treasury s gold holdings by nine times. In other words, the dollar s unofficial  and unconvertible  gold coverage reached an all-time low of 11 .As we saw, the periods of overvaluation  the 1930s and 1980  were great opportunities to sell gold. Conversely, the periods of undervaluation  1969 and 1999  were excellent buying opportunities. Gold was the best-performing asset class in the decade following each period of maximum undervaluation.Gold, relative to the size of the Fed s balance sheet, is more undervalued today than in the late 1960s or 1990s. The reason  even though gold advanced over seven-fold over the last twenty-three years, the Federal Reserve s balance sheet has grown even faster. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, global central banks have undertaken radical monetary policies.Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has undertaken four massive rounds of quantitative easing, resulting in a monetary base nine times larger than in 1999. The Fed printed money faster than gold appreciated over the last twenty-three years. The Fed s monetary base currently stands at over nine times the Treasury s gold holdings, compared with six times in 1969 and nine times in 1999   the other two excellent buying opportunities. According to our analysis, gold is 30  more undervalued than in 1969 and on par with 1999.Valuing gold against financial assets tells a similar story. Chart 2 shows the relationship between gold and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over the last 100 years, there have been three periods during which gold was radically undervalued relative to financial assets.The first period occurred in the late 1920s. In response to a decade of rapid monetary growth in the US  related to Britain s failed attempt to peg the pound to gold at the pre-World War I rate , the US stock market surged, driven mainly by speculation funded by borrowed money. From the 1921 lows, the Dow appreciated six-fold, hitting 380 in August 1929.With gold fixed at  20.65 per ounce, the Dow, by the fall of 1929, was equivalent to approximately eighteen ounces. In retrospect, the stock market was radically overvalued. Over the next four years, the Dow fell 90 , bottoming at 42. At the lows, the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold   an extreme reading that would not be repeated for fifty years.In January 1934, Roosevelt raised the gold price to  35 per ounce. The Dow and gold nearly reached parity in 1932  however, they missed each other by  7 per ounce and eighteen months. Between 1929 and 1934, the Dow fell 80  while gold rose 70 . From 1929 to 1935 gold radically outperformed global equity markets.The next time financial assets were radically overvalued relative to gold occurred in the late 1960s. The Dow first broke 1,000 in 1966 and then again in 1969 and 1971. With gold still fixed at  35 per ounce, the Dow was equivalent to twenty-eight ounces  a new record. The 1960s experienced long periods of excess money and credit creation, resulting in a speculative bull market again funded by debt. In retrospect, financial assets were overvalued. Between the late 1960s and 1980, the Dow fell by 25  while gold advanced twenty-four-fold. Finally, by 1980, the Dow and gold both hit 850.Gold entered a grinding bear market following its record overvaluation in 1980. On the other hand, financial assets spent the next two decades rallying. Following the 1929 episode, gold took fifty years to work off its overvaluation. Following the 1980 peak, gold only took twenty years to become cheap relative to financial assets. Between 1980 and 1999, gold fell by 68  from  850 to  253 per ounce, while the Dow advanced thirteen-fold from 850 to 11,000. A prudent investor ought to have been out of the gold market entirely.In 1999 the Dow surpassed 11,000 while gold had fallen to  253 per ounce. The Dow was equivalent to forty-three ounces of gold at those levels   an all-time record. Given these extreme levels, an investor ought to have expected a booming bull market in gold to develop. Indeed, that is what I expected when I made my investments and gave my interview to Forbes in 2000.We were handsomely rewarded. Between 1999 and 2011, gold surged seven-fold, becomingthe best-performing asset class of the decade. Global equities suffered two massive bear markets, ending the period where it started.Over the last decade, the stock market has again entered another huge bull market, leaving the Dow equivalent to 20 ounces of gold. The question is whether this represents under- or overvaluation. Financial bulls  i.e., gold bears  might highlight how the Dow has been equivalent to thirty ounces of gold in the late 1960s and forty ounces in the late 1990s. In this context, 20 1 does not appear radically undervalued. Perhaps the equity bull market will continue. Unfortunately, for equity markets, we firmly believe otherwise.Chart 3 gives us great confidence that today s 20 1 ratio will end up being the cycle peak and that over the next several years, the Dow will be equivalent to fewer than five ounces of gold, the level reached at gold's peak in 2011. The Dow and gold may again cross, similar to what happened in 1980 and almost happened in 1932-4.Each peak in the Dow-gold ratio  1929, 1969, and 1999  coincided with periods of commodity undervaluation. As each commodity bull market started, the Dow-gold ratio contracted massively. In 1929, commodities bottomed relative to financial assets exactly as the Dow reached a high of twenty ounces of gold equivalent. Four short years later, commodities were overvalued relative to financial assets, and the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold after having rallied 70 .In 1968  the year President Johnson removed the US dollar s required 25  gold backing , commodities were the cheapest in history relative to financial assets. At that moment, the Dow peaked at twenty-eight ounces of gold. Over the next twelve years, commodities entered a massive bull market and, by 1980, had become radically overvalued. Gold led the bull market and soared twenty-four-fold from  35 to  800 per ounce. Like in 1929, the Dow-gold ratio peaked in 1968 at precisely the same time commodities bottomed. By January 1980, the Dow was equivalent to one ounce of gold   the lowest reading since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was established in 1896.In 1999, commodities were almost as radically undervalued as in the late 1960s. The Dow-gold ratio reached an all-time high of forty-two just as commodities bottomed. As commodity prices rose, the Dow-gold ratio contracted, reaching eight in 2011.Were commodities overvalued today, we would agree that the boom in financial assets  and bear market in gold  still had years left to run. Under these circumstances, the Dow-gold ratio would continue to move significantly higher. Instead, commodities are as undervalued as they have ever been relative to financial assets. According to our historical framework, a commodity bull market has likely started. As such, we believe the Dow, equivalent to twenty ounces of gold, probably represents a cycle-high and will fall throughout the decade, similar to 1929, 1969, and 1999.How high could prices go if we enter a new gold bull marketIn past gold bull markets, the value of the Treasury s gold holdings has surpassed the monetary base by over 1.5 times   including in 1980 after the US dollar was no longer backed by gold.Given the Fed s balance sheet explosion since 2009, a projected target price for gold seems outlandish. The Fed s monetary base today stands at  5.6 tr. For the Treasury s gold holdings to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times, gold would have to reach  32,000 per ounce. Critics might argue the monetary base is distorted by excess reserves left on balance at the Fed. At present, excess reserves foot to  3.2 tr, and the Fed has talked of someday draining them out of the system. If that were to happen, the Fed s monetary base would fall to  2.4 trillion. Even under this conservative scenario, gold would have to reach  14,000 for the Treasury s gold position to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times. Although these numbers sound outlandish, they represent relationships that have emerged twice in the past 100 years. The first time  the late 1930s  was during massive deflation, while the second  1970  was during inflation. In both scenarios, gold had become the  must own  asset class that all investors clamored for, and the valuation of gold was pushed to the extreme.Could the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings reach 1.5 times the monetary base-- as it has twice in the last 100 years  We believe it s highly probable. As financial turmoil surges this decade, investors will aggressively buy gold as an asset class that provides both wealth protection and the opportunity for huge speculative profit. In such a scenario, gold s valuation could very well be pushed to extremes just like it was in the late 1930s and 1980. What about looking at the Dow-Gold relationshipIn the 1930s, the Fed aggressively shrunk its balance sheet by half, producing a deflation implosion that turned into the Great Depression. At the worst point in the crisis, the Dow traded at half its  80 book value. By 1934, gold  now at  35 per ounce  nearly reached parity with the Dow. Currently, the Dow s book value is 8,000. Were the Fed to undertake equally draconian hawkish measures as in the 1930s  something we believe to be unlikely , the Dow could conceivably trade for half its book value, or 4,000. Were gold to trade at parity to the Dow, like it nearly did in 1934, it would more than double. In other words, in the most extreme deflationary scenario, the Dow would fall almost 90  while gold would double   similar to between 1929 and 1934. Investors, with a substantial gold allocation, would do very well.In the late 1970s, the Fed ultimately raised interest rates to record levels in a final successful attempt to break the inflationary forces of the past twenty years. Record real rates put severe downward pressure on global equities. By 1980, the Dow traded at its book value of 850. Gold reached parity with the Dow in January 1980.If we repeat the 1970s and the Fed raised interest rates significantly because of persistent acceleration in inflation, we should see a huge bear market in the Dow with a downside target of its 8000 book value. If history were to repeat the 1970s experience, the Dow toenter a huge bear market and potentially trade down 75  to its book value, and gold prices would rise four  fold Again, investors with significant gold allocations would be the winners.Finally, let us consider a third scenario that has never occurred in 230 years of US financial history. What might happen if the US directly monetized its debtGiven the massive amount of sovereign debt held by governments worldwide and the inherent refinancing risks that it creates, countries  including the US  may attempt to directly monetize their debt in response to a potential failure of a government debt auction. Were this to happen, inflationary pressures would surge, and hyperinflation may ensue. Our hunch is that equities markets may rise, but gold would enter a massive bull market as investors sought assets to protect against currency debasement and the resulting inflation. In such a scenario, gold could easily surpass  35,000 per ounce   1.5 times today s  5.6 tr monetary base. Once again, the winners would be gold investors.In our view, gold will emerge as the asset class with the most potential this decade, no matter the financial or geopolitical backdrop. Under the most extreme scenarios  a repeat of the deflationary implosion that produced the Great Depression or a period of inflation that verges on hyperinflation , gold will be the winning asset class.Commodities and related natural resource markets were broadly weak in the second quarter. Investors remained concerned about a global recession driven by rising interest rates and persistent central bank hawkishness. Adding to the overall gloom was a perceived disappointment in Chinese economic activity. Caused by problems in the real estate sector, disappointing exports, and weaker-than-expected aggregate economic data, investors were decidedly  risk-off   when it came to China, and commodity markets were not spared.With its heavy energy focus, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell almost 6 , while the Rogers International Commodity Index, emphasizing metals and agricultural commodities, fell by 2.5 .Natural resource-related equities were weak as well. The S P North American Natural Resource Stock Index  heavily energy weighted  fell 1  during the quarter, while the S P Global Natural Resources Index , more metal and agricultural exposure  fell almost 6 . By comparison, global equity markets were strong during the second quarter  the S P 500 rose 8  while the MSCI All Country World index advanced almost 6 .Metals were among the weakest performers in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about China. Copper prices pulled back 9 , despite easily mobilized copper inventories approaching all-time lows during the quarter. Nickel fared even worse, falling by 14 . Aluminum, meanwhile, fell by 11 , while zinc plummeted by 21 . Cold-rolled steel fell almost 25  in the ferrous metal sector, while iron ore fell 10 . Mining equities were also weak. The  ETF  which tracks copper equities  fell by almost 3 , while the S P Global Base Metals Index fell by 4 .Weak LNG and Chinese worries drove coal prices lower. Australian and South African thermal coal pulled back 30  and 22 , respectively. In the US, coal with access to seaborne markets  notably Central Appalachian and Illinois Basin  fell 28  and 32 , respectively, after surging last year.The oil market was also weak during the second quarter. West Texas Intermediate  WTI  fell almost 7  during the quarter, while Brent fell 5 . Energy-related equities were mixed. The  ETF  mega-cap international energy weighted  fell 2 . However, the S P Oil   Gas E P index and the  oil service stock ETF were strong, rising by 1  and 4 , respectively.Global energy demand continues to surprise to the upside, and even the IEA has raised its estimates. For example, at the end of 2022, the IEA estimated global oil demand would average 101.6 mm barrels per day -- a significant 1.7 mm increase over 2022. In their June  Oil Market Report,  the IEA raised their 2023 demand estimate by an additional 700,000 b d, with the bulk of their underestimation again coming from China. Since the end of 2022, the IEA has raised its Chinese oil demand estimates by 400,000 b d.Responding to global recession worries, the IEA reduced global oil demand by 200,000 b d in its July 2023 OMR. However, we believe the IEA is still radically underestimating global oil demand and that further upward revisions must be made. For example, the IEA has 1.3 mm b d of missing barrels in its first quarter 2023 balances. Our readers know that missing barrels represent the excess of supply less demand that are missing literally-- they can t be found in global inventories. Historically the IEA has made missing barrels disappear by revising global demand upwards, and we believe this time will be no different. We believe the weakness in oil prices in the second quarter can t be explained by faltering demand.We believe the primary weakness in global oil prices in the second quarter is unexpected supply issues. In the final week of March, the US government began selling an additional 26 mm barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil under previously legislated Congressional mandates. All 26 mm barrels had been sold by the last week of June. Over the next four years, the DOE, under Congressional mandate, was scheduled to sell an additional 155 mm barrels of oil out of the SPR 42.5 mm barrels in 2024 and 2025 and 35 mm barrels in 2026 and 2027, and these sales would represent almost 50  of the remaining SPR reserve.In July, however, the DOE announced the cancellation of these sales as part of the attempt to begin  refilling  the SPR. Over the last 18 months, 330 mm barrels have been released by US, European, and Japanese SPR and have been 100  responsible for the slight build we ve seen in commercial inventories. Given July s DOE announcement, SPR sales will be zero over the next four years, which we believe has already begun impacting oil prices. We think it s no coincidence that oil prices rebounded almost 18  since the last week in June just as US SPR releases wound down.SPR sale cancellations, combined with rapidly slowing production growth from the Permian basin and unexpected production cuts from Saudi Arabia, mean that commercial inventories will experience rapid drawdowns in the second half of 2023.Natural gas staged a massive rebound in the second quarter, advancing 26 . European gas, still influenced by swollen inventories related to last winter s record warmth, fell by 26 . Asian gas also continued its retreat falling 5 .With the restart of the Freeport LNG export facility, US inventories have begun to decline versus historical averages, even in the face of highly cool weather at the beginning of the 2023 air conditioning season. Adjusted for population, cooling degree days were 33  below average for May and June. US natural gas inventories peaked relative to ten-year averages in mid-March, just before the Freeport facility returned to service, and now sit only 6  above ten-year averages.We remain incredibly bullish on natural gas prices. The Natural Gas section of the letter discusses the rollover in Marcellus natural gas production and how the 40  plunge in the Haynesville rig count over the last six months will severely impact its output in the next six months. In the next eighteen months, we will add close to 6 bcf per day in LNG export capacity, and our modeling continues to suggest that US natural gas supply will begin a prolonged contraction starting now. Convergence of US natural gas prices-presently at  2.50 per MMBtu with international prices presently at  12mmbtu is practically unavoidable given our modeling of both US natural gas demand and supply. Much of the turmoil in global gas markets, weather-related over the last twelve months, has given investors another extremely opportunistic chance to invest in North American natural gas markets.Uranium rose 10  from  50 to  55 per pound in the second quarter. In the Uranium section of the letter, we discuss our updated supply and demand models for uranium and their implications. Since 2011 post-Fukushima the global uranium market has been in massive surplus as Japan s 50 reactors came offline and global uranium supply surged primarily from Kazakhstan. Between 2011 and 2018, we calculate global uranium inventories built by over 265 m lbs, resulting in substantial downward price pressure uranium prices bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2018 at  18 per lb.However, as our models suggest, the uranium market has now slipped firmly back into deficit. Also, the Yellow Cake and Sprott Uranium Trust closed-end physical uranium investment vehicles have removed over 80 mm lbs of uranium over the last five years. Since 2020 we calculate that uranium has shifted back to deficit and that commercial inventories have been drawn down by 180 mm tonnes. We calculate excess commercial uranium inventories related to the Fukushima-related shutdowns have now been 50  worked down and stand at approximately 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months.Depending on how much physical uranium the two closed-end vehicle buy in 2023 and 2024, we calculate that 100  of the excess Fukushima-related inventory will have been consumed by the end of 2024. Given the deficit between power generation demand and mine supply, and given that almost all easily mobilized Fukishima-related inventory has been removed from the market, we believe uranium prices could move chaotically to the upside.Global agricultural markets fell in the second quarter. Corn fell 16 , wheat fell 8 , and soybeans rose 3.5 .Fertilizers also sold off. Urea  the solid form of nitrogen  fell 10 , phosphate fell 27 , and potash fell 3 . We believe the correction has run its course, and markets have now set up for another crisis. Dry weather continues to plague the corn belt. In their latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate report  WASDE , the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  significantly reduced their US corn yield estimate from 181.5 to 177.5 bushels per acre.Food nationalism has also reemerged. Once again, India banned rice exports as adverse growing conditions lowered the expected harvest. India is the largest rice exporter, representing almost 50  of the seaborne trade. Finally, Russia suspended its agreement allowing Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea. Also, the Russian military has now started to systematically target Ukrainian grain infrastructure over the last month, including Ukraine s grain export facilities on the Danube River.Ukrainian wheat and corn exports were already halved compared with their peak two years ago. After the recent destruction, a further reduction in export volumes is a distinct possibility. In 2021, we predicted a coming agricultural crisis. Our same models now call for a new crisis to develop as we progress through the rest of the year and into 2024. The recent pullback presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Precious metals were weak in the second quarter. Gold fell 2.5 , while silver fell 5 . Platinum and palladium fell 10  and 17 , respectively.Gold and silver equities were also weak. The  and  ETFs  which track gold and silver equities  fell by 7  and 15 , respectively.Earlier in this letter, we outlined the fundamental underpinnings of the upcoming gold bull market and provided a framework for how high gold prices might go.Since the summer of 2020, precious metals have been in a corrective phase. We believe things are about to turn much more bullish.On a short-term basis, one headwind remains. Western investors have again started to liquidate their precious metals holdings.We track the behavior of 18 gold ETFs. For the twelve months ending March 2023, the ETFs liquidated 450 tonnes of gold. Beginning in April, the ETFs stopped shedding. For a moment, it appeared they were starting a period of accumulation. The same ETFs added 60 tonnes of gold holdings from March to May. Unfortunately, western investors returned to shedding over the last two months, this time by 100 tonnes.The ETFs indicate Western interest in gold remains bearish. Western investors, we believe, will drive the upcoming bull market. Thus far, they remain uninterested.On a more positive note, central banks continue to buy gold. In the first six months of 2023, central banks purchased 387 tonnes of gold   a record first-half result, according to the World Gold Council. China accumulated 103 tonnes in the first six months of 2023 and has continuously purchased gold over the last nine months.Since the start of the corrective phase in mid-2020, the ETFs have shed over 600 tonnes of gold.Over the same period, open interest in the COMEX gold futures contract contracted by over 300,000 contracts   or 900 tonnes of  paper gold,  the majority of which were likely matched with physical gold. In total, we estimated western speculators have shed 1,500 tonnes. Central banks, meanwhile, have more than offset this liquidation. Between 2020 and mid-2023, central banks accumulated 2,200 tonnes of physical gold. It stands to reason that prices are now re-testing the mid-2020 highs. Even though western investors have been gold sellers, all selling has been met with central bank buying. We believe western investors will turn into aggressive buyers once central banks turn dovish. When that happens, western demand will collide with central bank buying and gold prices will move dramatically higher. As outlined in our introductory essay, gold prices are heading much higher than anyoneenvisions today. We recommend all investors have significant positions in various precious metal investments, both physical and equities.Why has uranium rallied while every other energy commodity has collapsed  Over the past twelve months, spot uranium advanced 12  while oil, natural gas, and coal all fell anywhere from 30-70 . Our models suggest uranium s strong performance has just started. Uranium has likely reached a pivotal inflection point that could force the price higher by as much as three- to four-fold over the next several years. For the first time in history, uranium has slipped into a persistent and widening deficit. We believe the results will be dramatic. Uranium is much less transparent than other commodity markets  in this essay, we will help shed light on the forces driving uranium over the course of the decade.From the start of the nuclear age in 1945 until 2019, the uranium industry has gone through four distinct periods. Each period has been unique in terms of supply and demand, leading to wild price swings that lasted decades. The market has now definitively entered its fifth major period, likely defined by persistent severe deficits.The first period took place between the mid-1940s and the late 1960s. Governmental stockpiling, for both weapons programs and nuclear power advancement, drove demand. Following the Trinity test in Los Alamos and the subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, attention quickly turned to nuclear s commercial applications. The USSR and England inaugurated the first two nuclear power stations in 1954 and 1956, with England s being the first truly commercial reactor. Despite these early reactors, commercial demand remained extremely low. Throughout the Manhattan Project, a persistent shortage of uranium  along with enrichment bottlenecks , presented ongoing challenges. Protection of supply remained a pivotal point of national security after the war as first the US and then the USSR built up their atomic arsenals. Between 1945 and 1969, Nuclear Engineering International estimates global uranium mine supply totaled 900 mm lbs of triuranium octoxide  U3O8 . Roughly half of this material was purchased by the US Atomic Energy Commission , while 40 mm lbs was purchased by the nascent commercial nuclear energy industry. Although the remaining 226 mm lbs was officially unaccounted for, it likely made its way to a combination of American, British, French, and Soviet government stockpiles.The uranium market began to change in the early 1970s as commercial nuclear power gained adoption. Private sector utility buying became a dominant source of demand. Total installed capacity grew from 1 GWe in 1960 to 10 GWe by 1970 and 100 GWe by 1980. The arrival in earnest of the nuclear age also stoked a speculative boom in uranium mining. Production in the US peaked in 1980 at nearly 45 mm lbs of U3O8 per year. Despite the widespread adoption of nuclear power, mine supply actually grew faster than reactor demand throughout the decade. The 1970s were a period of rolling energy crises and insecurity. As a result, commercial buyers were more than happy to build up excess uranium inventories. From 1970 to 1983, mine supply exceeded reactor demand by 450 mm lbs of U3O8, all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Adding to the glut, the AEC reclassified approximately 100 mm lbs of its stockpiles from  governmental  to  commercial,  making it available to the nuclear power industry. By 1983, commercial inventories were 550 mm lbs   enough to cover reactor demand for nearly eight years. Prices peaked in 1982 at nearly  40 per pound and started a decades-long collapse.Uranium mine supply peaked in 1982 and fell modestly during the decade. Reactor demand meanwhile grew robustly and finally exceeded mine supply in 1991. For the first time since the days of the Manhattan Project, uranium entered into a primary deficit. The deficit would persist for the next twenty-seven years, until the Fukushima incident. Unlike during the Manhattan Project, however, secondary sources of uranium filled the shortfall. Between 1983 and 2010, Nuclear Engineering International estimates reactor demand exceeded mine supply by an incredible 1.1 bn lbs of U3O8. Mine supply fell by nearly half from 170 mm lbs in 1982 to a plateau of 75 mm lbs by 1995. Reactor demand was nearly the mirror image, growing from 65 to 175 mm lbs over the 27-year period. Secondary supply made up the shortfall.In 1993, Russia and the US entered into the so-called  Megatons for Megawatts  program, through which Russia pledged to decommission 20,000 nuclear warheads and convert the highly enriched uranium into 15,000 tonnes of low-enriched uranium suitable for manufacturing into reactor fuel. Russia also sold additional material outside of the program to provide much-needed funding following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Fuel recycling became widespread in the UK and France during this period as well, as did enrichment-tailing reprocessing. Secondary sources supplied a combined 630 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent between 1983 and 2010. Commercial inventory destocking contributed another 500 mm lbs. The Department of Energy  the successor to the AEC , reclassified another 75 mm lbs of U3O8 from governmental to commercial, adding more material to the commercial market. All of this secondary supply put extreme downward pressure on uranium. Prices bottomed at  7.10 per pound in 2000.By the mid-2000s, commercial inventories had fallen dramatically. The Russian disarmament program was due to expire in 2013, threatening to reduce secondary supplies materially. Uranium began to firm in 2003  by 2005 the price had tripled from  7 to  21 per pound. By the late 2000s, commercial inventories had fallen nearly 70  and stood at only 200 mm lbs. Commercial inventory coverage went from eight years in 1983 to less than two years by 2007. Utility buyers scrambled and speculators swooped in.Spot prices reached a high of  136 per pound in June 2007, with long-term contracts settling at  95 per pound  an increase of between twelve- and eighteen-fold in seven years. Uranium collapsed during the Global Financial Crisis, but resumed its rally in 2010. By February 2011, uranium was once again over  70 per pound and commercial inventories stood at a mere 150 mm lbs.On March 11 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami led to a partial meltdown of Japan s Fukushima Daishi reactor. Japan shut down all its nuclear reactors over the next several years. European demand, led by German decommissioning, fell by 25 . Global reactor demand fell sharply from 182 mm to 150 mm lbs between 2010 and 2012 before beginning a slow recovery. Meanwhile, responding  with a lag  to the prior uranium boom, primary supply grew for the first time in decades. In-situ leach production in Kazakhstan grew by nearly 50 , or 20 mm lbs, between 2010 and 2016. Primary production nearly satisfied reactor demand in 2015   a first in over twenty-five years.Secondary supplies weighed on the market as well. Although the Russian disarmament program ended in 2013, tailings reenrichment, DOE surplus sales, recycling and underfeeding continued to contribute as much as 40 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent by 2016.Between 2011 and 2018, the uranium market was in surplus by 265 mm lbs., all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Commercial stockpiles, which started the period at a record-low 150 mm lbs., reached 415 mm lbs. by 2018, covering reactor demand for three years.We became interested in uranium producers this cycle in late 2017, when Cameco announced they would curtail production at its flagship MacArthur River Mine. Kazatomprom followed suit, announcing it would curtail production. Our models told us these cuts would push reactor demand firmly above total supply, including secondary sources. In retrospect, we were correct. Commercial inventories peaked in 2018 and declined slightly in 2019 and 2020. The era of persistent deficits had started.The uranium price meanwhile remained depressed, averaging less than  25 per pound between 2016 and 2020.Uranium s structural deficit has accelerated dramatically since 2021. Reactor demand bottomed in 2020 at 161 mm lbs of U3O8 and is expected to reach 188 mm lbs this year. After spending a decade decommissioning its nuclear reactors, Europe and the US appear to have finally reversed course. We have long argued that wind and solar simply cannot provide efficient base-load carbon-free electricity. We warned that grid instability and energy insecurity would soon follow. Russia s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 put Europe s natural gas supply at risk, bringing renewables  shortcomings to the fore. Primary uranium production remained depressed through 2022 at 120 mm lbs   a multi-decade low. Secondary supply averaged only 22 mm lbs. leaving a deficit of nearly 30 mm lbs in 2021 and 2022.A new source of demand burst onto the scene in 2021 as well  the financial buyer. Led by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, financial vehicles have acquired between 25 and 30 mm lbs each year in 2021 and 2022. Unlike open-ended funds such as the GLD, the financial uranium vehicles are closed-ended, meaning the material cannot readily flow back into the commercial market. Once material is purchased it is permanently locked up.As a result, the uranium market experienced a deficit of nearly 180 mm lbs between 2020 and 2023. The deficit was met by materially depleting the commercial inventories that had accumulated following Fukushima. By the end of this year, we expect commercial inventories will be back to 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months. The last time commercial inventories reached these levels in the mid-2000s, prices spiked to their all-time highs of  145 per pound. We expect the same now.Looking to the end of the decade, global uranium markets are set to tighten to unprecedented levels. Looking only at nuclear power plants that are currently under construction, reactor demand is set to grow from 188 to 240 mm lbs by 2030. If every uranium-producing country gets back to its maximum output  a big if  , primary production will only grow from 140 to 174 mm pounds by 2030. Assuming secondary supply stays flat at 20 mm lbs per year, the annual uranium market deficit will grow from 27 to 45 mm lbs by the end of the decade, before factoring in further financial buying. The cumulative deficit between 2023 and 2030 will likely exceed 250 mm lbs, completely depleting all commercial stockpiles.These figures are likely too conservative. There are presently fifty-nine reactors under construction with a total capacity of 66 GWe. Every new reactor requires three years of uranium fuel for its initial core loading. We believe this will consume an additional 60 mm lbs of U3O8 between now and 2030. Over the past twenty years, new reactors have been mostly offset by retirements. When a reactor is decommissioned, it is able to harvest its final core loading without requiring a replacement. Therefore, new reactor loadings have been offset by retiring old reactors. This will not be possible going forward.Furthermore, financial accumulation is likely to accelerate once speculators realize the small size of the market and the precarious commercial inventory situation. How large financial buying can get is an open question, however adding another 100 mm lbs of U3O8 would only cost  6 bn and would dramatically tighten balances even further.Utilities remain dramatically under-contracted post-2025. Fuel buyers have been very complacent in recent years, due to the persistent commercial inventory overhang following Fukushima. Simply put, it has paid to wait to secure supplies. That dynamic is quickly changing as fuel buyers feel insecure and under-covered for the first time in nearly fifteen years.Although it is an opaque market, all signs point to uranium entering into a sustained and frenetic bull market. Prices have rallied from a 2018 low of  18 to nearly  60 per pound already. However, even at these prices, it is unlikely many new greenfield uranium deposits can be economically developed.The uranium industry has been dramatically starved of capital for many years. In our view, the persistent bear market   in many ways present since the 1980s with only a single reprieve   is over. Investors should act accordingly.We believe oil is on the verge of a sharp rally. As we write this, West Texas Intermediate and Brent trade for  84 and  87 per barrel, respectively. We believe it will not be long before both are well above  100. Since the COVID bottom in March 2020, energy equities have been the best-performing sector of the S P 500, while spot crude has been the best-performing asset class. However, for the twelve months ending June 2023, spot crude fell by 33 . The question has been whether the recent selloff was a consolidation amidst a broader rally or the start of a new bear market.We are adamant in our belief that this bull market has only begun and prices will increase. All of the bullish elements we have discussed remain firmly in place  the industry is still highly capital-starved, oil demand is strong, and the US shales are depleting.The recent selloff resulted from massive liquidations from various strategic petroleum reserves. For 2022, the US released 220 mm from its SPR, amounting to 607,000 b d. Other countries liquidated 40 m b or 100,000 b d. The US continued liquidating its SPR into 2023 as well. Although concerns surrounding Russia s invasion of Ukraine may have prompted SPR liquidations last spring, this year s sales were part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which mandated the US to sell oil from the SPR to fund spending bills. During the second quarter, the US released 25 mm bbl from the SPR or 260,000 b d.Our last letter explained the tight relationship between price and seasonally-adjusted inventory levels. Oil is fairly valued at  75 per barrel based only on commercial inventories. Including the now-depleted SPRs, oil should be trading at  120. Therefore, we estimate the impact of the SPR releases at anywhere between  30-40 per barrel. It is no coincidence that as soon as the US stopped liquidating its SPR at the end of June, oil bottomed and has since rallied 20 .The Bipartisan Budget Act SPR sales automatically  phased out  if reserves reached 350 mm barrels. When Congress passed the Act, the SPR held 650 mm barrels, and it is likely few policymakers ever expected to use the  phase out  provision. However, with the SPR now at just 347 mm barrels, the Act no longer allows further liquidation. Just last week, the administration announced it would cancel all additional planned sales from the SPR. With the US no longer selling several hundred thousand barrels per day from its strategic reserves, commercial inventories are set to fall sharply throughout the rest of the year, pushing prices higher.Even with the unprecedented SPR liquidation, commercial inventories remained subdued. Inventories peaked at 280 mm barrels above and bottomed at 60 mm below the five-year average in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Presently, inventories are in line with the five-year average. Including the SPR, inventories are 300 mm barrels below five-year averages   a record deficit.Global inventories are just as tight. OECD commercial inventories went from 300 mm bbl above to 300 mm bbl below five-year averages between 2020 and 2022 and currently stand at 95 mm bbl below average. Including government stockpiles, inventories remain 400 mm bbl below average   another record.Based upon our supply and demand estimates, inventories could draw by 360 mm bbl between now and yearend, leaving commercial and total inventories at dangerously-low levels.Despite headlines to the contrary, the oil market remained extremely tight over the past twelve months. Governments effectively hindered the bullish price signal by liquidating vast quantities from their strategic reserves. This is unlikely to continue, clearing the way for prices to increase.Most analysts attribute the selloff to recession fears and weak demand, but our data tells us consumption remains robust. For nearly fifteen years, headlines have called for the  end of oil demand.  As recently as 2020, many agencies, including the International Energy Agency  IEA , predicted that 2019 was the peak in global oil demand. Hardly four years later, consumption set a new record and shows no signs of slowing. Any worries about long-term structural oil demand are entirely misguided for at least the next decade.The oil market will be driven higher by lackluster supply caused by years of underinvestment. Demand, meanwhile, will enjoy a persistent tailwind and continue to consistently surprise to the upside. In our following letter, we will write extensively on global commodity demand  today, we offer a preview.Energy consumers fall into two categories  those in the developed world and those in emerging markets. The former comprises 17  of the world s population and consumes 170 GJ per person of primary energy. The latter makes up 83  of the population  or seven billion people  and annually consumes less than 60 GJ per person. Each year, millions begin their move from emerging-market to lower-middle-income energy consumers.As they prosper, their primary energy consumption triples from 60 to 170 GJ annually. This phenomenon will be the primary growth driver over the next twenty years. Analysts pontificate on EV penetration, but even the most aggressive scenarios cannot overcome this dramatic increase in primary energy demand per capita. Others worry about energy efficiency. Again, the move from emerging markets to lower middle-income energy consumers will eclipse any improvement in energy efficiency.For example, over the last fifteen years, OECD per capita energy demand fell by 11 , primarily due to improved energy efficiency. However, non-OECD per capita demand surged by 25 , pushing global per capita demand higher by 5  the so-called  S-Curve  at work. While it is true that, in theory, making something more energy efficient should reduce demand, in practice, the trend has been towards more demand, not less. More people are in the energy-intensive period of their development, moving from 60 GJ to 170 GJ of primary energy demand. According to Jevons  Paradox, efficiency may lead to faster growth. In 1865, Jevons postulated that improved energy efficiency would lower costs and ultimately increase demand. While his Paradox is controversial, we believe there is evidence of this phenomenon in emerging market economies.Amazingly, in their latest long-term forecast, the IEA projects global per capita primary energy demand will fall between now and 2035. Simply put, this cannot happen. The IEA  and others  will chronically miss the mark until they realize this.The IEA has also warned about near-term oil demand  we believe these worries are similarly unfounded. In their latest Oil Market Report, the IEA revised down 2Q23, 3Q23, and 4Q23 demand estimates by 250,000 b d. In their summary  which is released to the press ahead of the full report , they warned that  persistent macroeconomic headwinds, apparent in a deepening manufacturing slump, have led us to revise our 2023 growth estimate lower for the first time this year, by 220 kb d.The IEA neglects to mention how they quietly revised historical demand higher for 2020, 2021, and 2022. They also revised 2024 estimates higher as well. Furthermore, the 1Q23 balancing item ran at a near-record 1.4 m b d, suggesting global demand likely reached 101.9 m b d   a record level for any quarter and a full 2.5 m b d above 1Q22. In their long term Oil 2023 report, the IEA expects oil consumption to grow by 6  between now and 2030, or by 900,000 b d, not materially lower than the fifteen years between 2005 and 2019 despite all the talk of EVs and efficiency. In 2020, the IEA predicted 2019 marked peak oil demand. Only a few years later, the IEA pushed its prediction to 2030. We have no doubt this revised out further as well.While investors remain fixated on demand, they seem to neglect problems in the global oil supply. In our last letter, we wrote about depletion problems in the Permian basin. Over the past 15 years, the US shales were the only material source of non-OPEC  growth. In turn, the Permian has represented most of all shale growth over the past five years. We warned that emerging depletion in the Permian would have a massive impact on global oil markets.Since we last wrote, Permian depletion has accelerated. Last year marked the first time Permian productivity per lateral foot decreased year-over-year, falling by 7 . For the first three months of 2023, productivity per foot fell by a further 4  compared with 2022. According to the Energy Information Agency , by August, the Permian will be growing by only 360,000 b d year-on-year, compared with nearly 700,000 b d as recently as February. Our models suggest that year-on-year Permian growth will be less than 100,000 b d by year-end and turn negative in early 2024. Although the next few months may be bumpy, we believe the Permian will definitively roll over sometime in 2024 as companies run out of their best drilling prospects. Despite high prices, producers dropped fourteen rigs in the Permian over the past three months, potentially signally inventory exhaustion. The other US shales are not faring any better. Shale production outside the Permian has not grown in nearly three years, despite oil rallying from  20 to  75 per barrel. The only material source of non-OPEC  growth over the past fifteen years is about to peak.The IEA meanwhile predicts non-OPEC  production ex-US to grow by 400,000 b d this year. However, we believe this is too optimistic. Since first releasing their projections last summer, the IEA has systematically revised non-OPEC  ex-US production lower by 300,000 b d and we believe this trend will continue.As non-OPEC  production falters, OPEC  will gain market share and pricing power. In early August, Saudi Arabia announced they would extend their production cuts by at least another month. Saudi produced less than 10 m b d in May and June   a thirteen year low. Some analysts view the cuts as an admission of weak global demand. Based on our demand analysis, we disagree. We and other analysts believe the cuts are necessary to rest aging fields, including Ghawar. Still, others argue the Saudis are merely offsetting government SPR liquidations. Whatever the case, several years ago, the Saudis would have been far too worried about losing market share to the growing shales to cut production. That concern is now gone.According to the IEA, demand will average 103.2 m b d in the second half of 2023. Global supply  including OPEC NGLs, processing gains, and biofuels  will only reach 101.5 m b d, leaving the market undersupplied by a massive 1.7 m b d. We think this understates the problem. The balancing item ran at 1.3 m b d in the first quarter, suggesting demand was understated. Adjusting demand higher by 1 m b d for the rest of the year implies a 2.7 m b d deficit that would take inventories down by over 400 mm bbl by December 31st. At that point, commercial inventories would reach a record 500 mm bbl deficit while total inventories would reach a record 820 mm bbl deficit   the lowest levels since our data begins.We are amazed at the level of investor apathy and disinterest. Despite three years of market-leading performance, funds continue to flow out of significant energy ETFs, including the XOP and XLE.The past six months saw the lowest level of energy IPOs and secondary offerings in nearly 25 years. Capital spending trends remain depressed and corporate valuations are at record lows. Energy remains less than 4  of the S P 500, nearly two-thirds below its long-term average. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Buffett has steadily added to his Chevron and Occidental Petroleum positions. Berkshire Hathaway added to his Occidental Petroleum position in the second quarter and now owns 25  of the company. Investors have radically undercapitalized the energy industry over the past ten years, and the results are becoming apparent. The only way to attract capital back to the space will be through solid returns. We believe that by the end of this bull market, everyone will argue that energy is again the  must-own  sector. Still, for the time being, contrarian value investors are being offered an excellent opportunity with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations. Investors will not be able to remain apathetic for much longer.In our view, natural gas prices are reaching a turning point. Gas spiked to decade highs last spring following Russia s invasion of Ukraine, only to fall back on milder-than-normal winter weather. Instead of running out of gas, traders worried about running out of storage as prices collapsed to near-all-time lows.During market panic or euphoria, investors make the mistake of linearly extrapolating current trends. As a result, they fail to see the ground shifting underneath them and miss out on excellent opportunities. Natural gas represents a classic buying opportunity, and we believe investors are again focused on all the wrong issues.Only several weeks ago, we heard many analysts openly question whether the US would run out of natural gas storage before the end of the injection season. Such an event would create the dreaded  gas on gas competition,  potentially driving prices to zero  or below . With the injection season half complete, these concerns were unfounded. Inventories started the year in line with seasonal averages. Extremely mild weather resulted in nearly 5  fewer heating degree days between January and April, significantly reducing heating demand. Inventories grew to 382 bcf above seasonal averages by April. Mild winter weather was followed by a mild start to summer. Cooling degree days in April, May, and June were nearly 30  below the five-year average, reducing air conditioning demand. Despite the milder-than-normal start to summer, US inventories did not grow relative to seasonal averages.Bymid-June, inventories remained 385 bcf above average. As the weather turned warmer in July, inventories have started to come down and currently stand at 320 bcf above average, the lowest level since February. Notably, July was 3  milder than average, suggesting the market would be in an even more significant deficit had temperatures been average. Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  exports help explain why US inventories declined relative to seasonal averages despite mild weather. LNG demand reached a record of 12.5 bcf d in May as Freeport returned online after a damaging fire left it inoperable for over a year. Based upon our analysis, the likelihood of full storage by the end of the injection season in the fall is very low  gas prices will likely rally from here.Over the next two years, an additional six billion cubic feet of LNG exports will come online at Golden Pass, Plaquemines, and Corpus Christi. Another 1.6 bcf d is due to come online at Port Arthur in 2027. Where will these facilities source their gasIn our last letter, we explained how the same depletion issues plaguing the oil shales are also at work in the gas shales. The Marcellus represents 25  of all US dry gas supply and has not grown in nearly two years. Production peaked in late 2021 at 26.5 bcf d   almost one bcf d higher than current levels. The Permian produces natural gas alongside oil, but declining productivity across the basin suggests sustained growth will be difficult.The Haynesville surged to nearly eight bcf d by 2011 before declining by half through 2017. Renewed interest led to a second period of growth, until by late 2022, production peaked at 14.3 bcf d. Unfortunately, production has now been flat for eight months. The Haynesville is deep and highly over pressured, resulting in elevated drilling and completion costs. Companies raced to lay down rigs as prices fell from  7.00 per mcf in December 2022 to  2.00 by February 2023.After peaking at seventy-two rigs in December, there are now only forty-four rigs operating in the play, with most of the decline occurring in June. Production often follows drilling with a several-month lag. If seventy-two rigs cannot produce much growth in the first few months of 2023, then production will likely fall from here. High prices would likely incentivize increased drilling in Haynesville, similar to what happened in 2017. However, the field had only produced 20  of its reserves back then compared with nearly 50  presently. It will likely be more challenging if not impossible-- to boost production this time once basin-level declines take hold, considering it is a much more mature play.Our models tell us we have overbuilt our LNG export capacity without adequately considering where the upstream feedstock will come from. US natural gas remains by far the cheapest unit of energy globally by as much as 75 . Once demand, driven by LNG expansion, exceeds domestic supply, our expectation is that this discount will evaporate, sending US gas prices up several-fold, as US prices converge with international prices.Turning to Europe, hot summer weather was not enough to offset their record mild winter  air conditioning in Europe remains less prevalent than in North America . European gas storage is now 88  full compared with an average of 74  for this time of year   a surplus of 14 percentage points. While still high, this is much lower than the record set after the winter on March 26th when inventories reached 56  full, a 22  surplus compared with seasonal averages.In March, the German energy minister Klaus Mueller warned that Germany would run out of natural gas by January 2024 on colder than average weather. Considering inventories at the time were running further ahead of seasonal averages than they are today, we would expect his concerns have not lessened.Both US and global natural gas markets rest on a knife s edge. After last year s incredibly mild winter, inventories are no longer at dangerously low levels. However, the longer-term supply and demand trends point to extreme tightening, particularly in the US. Investors are extrapolating current trends but missing the significant shifts taking place. They should take heed.Driven by concerns of an impending global recession, copper sentiment remained bearish during the second quarter. On the other hand, copper s short-term fundamentals became increasingly bullish. Mine supply disappointed again in the first four months of 2023, according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics  WBMS . Chilean production continues to be particularly problematic.For the first four months of the year, Chilean mine supply fell by nearly 2  compared to last year. Codelco warned that production could hit the lowest level in twenty-five years. In June, André Sougarret abruptly resigned as Codelco s Chief Executive Officer after only one year on the job. Mr. Sougarret cited the numerous  complexities  facing the Chilean copper mines.Chile supplies almost one-quarter of all copper production and, in past letters, we have discussed the issues plaguing their copper industry  in particular, declining ore grades, water shortages, labor issues, and uncertain fiscal regimes all negatively impacted production. Unfortunately, we do not expect any of these issues to improve going forward. Global copper mine supply contracted by 0.2  in the first four months of 2023 compared to last year, driven by disappointments in Chile.Meanwhile, global copper demand remained robust in both OECD and non-OECD countries. For the first four months of 2023, OECD copper demand increased by a robust 3.7 . Despite countless bearish articles in the financial press, Chinese copper demand continues to surge, with refined demand rising by 8  year-on-year.While China always dominates the headlines, we believe the pivotal element of Asian copper demand is India. We first wrote in 2018 that Indian copper demand was set to surge, very similar to China in 1999-2000. Even though few analysts have paid any attention, India s copper consumption grew by almost 30  during the first four months of 2023 compared to last year. Global consumption in aggregate has surged 6  so far this year. Strong demand and weak mine supply continue to drive inventories to near all-time lows.Exchange inventories on the Shanghai, London Metal Exchange  LME  and COMEX fell from a high of 900,000 tonnes reached in 2018 to only 170,000 tonnes today. Although inventories are twice as high as the all-time low of 75,000 tonnes reached in 2005, production has grown by nearly 60  over that time. As a result, when measured in days of consumption, exchange inventories are almost as low as in 2005.Given the low exchange inventories and the bullish supply demand trends, we believe speculators will soon panic much as they did back at the end of 2005 into 2006. Low inventories, combined with massive short covering, spiked copper prices higher by almost 200  in just six months. We are now potentially set up for a recurrence of that 2005-2006 copper price spike.Although we remain concerned about the universally bullish outlook adopted by the global metal analytic and investment community a topic discussed in last quarter s letter we believe the rapidly tightening underlying fundamentals will push copper prices significantly higher in the next six to twelve months. For those investors that have exited their copper investments on global recessionary fears, we believe the copper s weakness in the second quarter has given investors another excellent opportunity to increase their exposure.

StealthGas: Flying Under The Radar,"In the intricate mosaic of the global shipping industry, certain players, while being fundamental, often remain unnoticed. StealthGas Inc.  is one such entity, maneuvering silently within the LPG sector and crafting a unique success story. As the worldStealthGas serves as a global conduit for transporting liquefied petroleum gas and other related gas products. These products, which are liquefied derivatives of natural gas and crude oil, encompass substances like propane, butane, butadiene, isoprene, propylene, vinyl chloride monomer, and other similar liquefied gases. The company boasts one of the most expansive independent LPG carrier fleets in the world, ranging from 3,000 to 8,000 cubic meters, with additional vessels capable of holding up to 40,000 cbm. These vessels transport goods all over the world but due to high rates they mostly trade west of the Suez in the EU  Mediterranean Sea area. Overall the LPG segment has benefited from increased rates due to the Russia-Ukraine War and the associated EU regulations concerning Russian energy. EU countries have sought energy elsewhere and LPG ships have helped fill the energy gap, which has benefited worldwide fleet rates.Historically GASS, like many in the sector, has been highly leveraged with a majority of cash flows being used to pay debt obligations and acquire new vessels. The changing market dynamic recently has led GASS to be in a much better situation. They have paid off a large amount of their debt and their profitability is at all time high.Similar to the  we see structural supply and demand differences in the market. We see LPG rates continue to climb as LPG ships get older and reach the end of their operational lives. We see the limited growth of worldwide fleets benefiting the whole LPG space but especially GASS due to their low leverage.StealthGas showcased a record performance in the first half of 2023, marking its highest profitability for any H1 at  10.5 million. The company leveraged the rising asset prices to actively sell vessels, with four vessels already sold and two smaller LPGs, Eco Dream and Eco Green, set to be sold for around  35 million. Despite operating with four fewer vessels, the company noted a slight increase in net voyage revenues to  67.2 million. In chartering, StealthGas secured employment for 80  of 2023's remaining days, translating to  90 million in revenues for future periods. Unlike others in the industry GASS has no vessels operating in the spot market which limits their ability to make more from higher rates but also limits their downside as the ships are lock in on profitable contracts.In Q2, StealthGas observed a 5  decline in adjusted net income. However, during the six-month span, there was an impressive growth in profits, moving from  20 million to  28 million  40  YoY . A notable accomplishment for the company was the significant reduction of its debt, decreasing from  316.6 million in June 2022 to a mere  166.7 million by June 2023. This substantial reduction resulted from a mix of robust earnings and vessel sales. With the current margin rates, GASS's total debt equates to 15.8 quarters of net income. Moreover, with its long-term debt  due within the upcoming year  at  16.6 million, and a healthy cash reserve of  48.1 million, GASS is financially solid. This allows the company to prioritize investor returns and fleet expansion over the need of debt repayment. The net debt standing at  83.9 million further bolsters the potential for investor returns in the foreseeable future. The strong financial positioning allows GASS to fund expansion with debt instead of equity dilution and has allowed them to secure  30 million for a new vessel.StealthGas's liquidity, inclusive of restricted cash and short-term investments, was recorded at  55.1 million at the quarter's end. This was a drop from the previous year's  95.7 million, mainly attributed to the strategic debt repayment. The company's investments in joint ventures dropped to  38 million, following a hefty  19.2 million dividend received post the sale of a vessel. StealthGas also achieved a non-cash gain of  2.9 million from the sale of two vessels, while simultaneously recognizing a non-cash impairment of  2.8 million on the agreed sale of two vessels set for delivery in January 2024. Interest and finance costs were slightly diminished for the quarter, despite a threefold rate increase in the comparative periods. This was a result of StealthGas's aggressive debt repayment strategy, aiming to mitigate interest costs.Operationally, in Q2 2023 GASS saw a 12  reduction in calendar days, while net revenues for the quarter stood firm at  33.1 million. Over a six-month period, there was a slight 1  increase in costs compared to the prior year, even with a reduced fleet size. The quarterly operating expenses climbed to  13.4 million, mainly due to inflationary factors that were especially noticeable in the first quarter. Contracted days remain high for 2023, with projections showing  90 million in revenues up to 2026. All vessels for 2023 drydocking have been serviced which shows they are ready for a productive next couple of quarters. The drydocking costs, which were at  1.5 million for Q2 and  2.6 million over the previous six months. This significant increment was due to the drydocking of three of the four Handysize vessels in the fleet. These larger vessels naturally incur higher expenses when dry docked which occurs every five years.GASS has been selling their older ships, reinvesting the proceeds and utilizing their better capital structure to secure financing for purchases of new ships through a collection of Joint Ventures and financed purchases. GASS has been selling their smaller vessels and moving in to larger, more modern and more efficient vessels. These vessels will be coming online over the next couple of quarters and should lead to an increase in not only GASS's capabilities but also their revenue and profit generation.These large vessels known as VLGCs command higher rates and in June of this year commanded  rate. The move in to more modern vessels not only expands their top line revenue but also protects them from upcoming regulations that will affect a variety of global vessels.The age old question of investing   When can I see a return  Due to GASS's historically high leverage they have not been in a position to return cash to investors through dividends or stock buybacks. During the recent earnings call when asked about capital return Harry Vafias responded with the followingWhen examining a company for capital returns we like to take a look at a modified version of total shareholder yield. We take the combination of Dividends and Stock Buybacks relative to trailing twelve month Net Income. GASS over the last 12 months has spent  0 on dividends and has the ability  not obligation  to purchase roughly  10 million worth of stock. Against a TTM net income of  41.7 million. Showing a modified shareholder yield of  24 . This to us shows what percentage of net income is being used to bolster investors vs bolstering the company.Currently trading at  184 million, GASS approval of  10 million in stock buyback translates to a possible 5  reduction in total outstanding shares for GASS while only needing roughly 1 4 of net income. We believe that this fact alone is what makes GASS a buy at current prices. Add in the FWD valuations of EV EBITDA of 3.66 and Price-to-book of .34 we believe that GASS offers significant upside from current prices. If elevated rates and high profitability continue we expect to see similar percentages of net income going to stock buybacks.While risks are evident in the volatile and capital intensive shipping market we believe that the low leverage, prudent management, new fleet, and market dynamics are in GASS favor. We believe that the lack of a dividend, low market cap and existence in the Oil and Gas Sector have led to underinvestment and under coverage in GASS from many market investors. Despite the recent performance of the stock, up 83  YTD, believe that there is more upside in the stock. Due to the low float and high upside potential from earnings beats and ship deliveries on the horizon we see GASS as a strong buy up to  7. At  7 we see P E come more in line with industry peers.We believe that at current prices the stock presents little downside risk and see little reason to hedge below current prices. We believe any further drop in price will incentivize management to begin their repurchase program which will buoy the stock. In addition to this the lack of dividends is also a bonus of r along position at this point. Catalysts that may cause downslide slippage would be weaknesses in the LPG market which could be caused by Supply Demand miss matches or through a warm winter requiring less energy than expected. From a trading perspective we see much greater chances of upside, with the stock trading at low valuations and relatively low Implied Volatility we are going to be initiating a synthetic long here. In this specific example we will be selling  5 Mar. 2024 Cash Covered Puts and then using the proceeds to purchase  5 and  7.50 Calls Mar. 2024. This strategy will provide us with limited downside protection and offer unlimited upside on a stock that we believe is chronically undervalued   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Bull Market No One Is Talking About...,"The best bull markets are those that move higher on very little fanfare. It seems uranium is now firmly in that camp.On the back of ever-growing demand  the long-term bull case  and increasingly tight supply  the short-term bull case , theI am  uranium and continue to believe the market offers an excellent risk reward setup over the medium term.The big elephant in the room for the sector is the ever closing discount to NAV of the Sprott physical fund . Remember, when this entity trades at a premium to NAV  which has historically occurred when speculation has run rampant , the fund can issue additional shares and use theOf course, the fund has been trading at a discount to NAV for most of the past 24 months and has not reported any physical purchases since April. But, should utilities begin to feel the pinch of dwindling supply and speculators return to the market, there remains the risk of much higher uranium prices on the horizon, of which a financial buyer such as Sprott would only exaccerbate.Oh, and Cameco  cutting its 2023 production estimates isn t going to help this supply and demand imbalance one bit.The fact the uranium miners ETF  recently broke out of its two-year symmetrical wedge pattern and is testing 52-week highs only acts to reaffirm the outlook for uranium prices. Clearly, this is a sector to keep an eye on.Another sector where price action continues to unfold in a positive fashion is the oil market. I have been  oil and energy stocks for a few months now, and it seems the technical picture looks to be confirming the bullish fundamentals. If you look closely, oil looks to be breaking out to 2023 highs, suggesting the downtrend in oil prices is all but over.Speaking of oil market fundamentals, the term structure remains firmly in backwadation and thus continues to suggest the oil market is tight.While the inventory picture seemingly confirms this point. Not only are inventory levels well below their seasonal averages, but we are seeing some of the largest inventory draws since 2021.These inventory drawdowns and term structure backwardation continue to reaffirm the notion that supply is tight and the market is in a deficit. Whether this continues into next year remains to be seen  I must admit I am somewhat sceptical that we see  100  oil just yet , but for now, things are looking good for oil bulls.This near-term outlook is only further reinforced when we consider these dynamics in the context of what is historically a very favourable period for oil prices through September and October.And although we have seen somewhat of an unwind of the recent multi-year low in speculative positioning, positioning and sentiment overall are far from any levels representative of irrational exuberance.Until we see a change in the fundamentals, any pullback in oil and energy stocks should be viewed as a buying opportunity for the time being.The ISM Manufacturing report for August was released this past week, with my overall takeaway being the overall PMI and its subcomponents continue to support the  that many of the primary leading indicators of the business cycle have bottomed.The ISM Manufacturing PMI - which I view as the most timely indicator of the business cycle, and tends to lead the primary hard economic data points such as industrial production, consumption and employment by around 3-6 months - increased by 1.2  from 46.4 to 47.6. Although it is still in contractionary territory  sub-50 , it looks to be forming a bottom.In relation to the subcomponents of the ISM report, the New Orders index also ticked higher while Inventories ticked lower  with the spread between the two generally leading the composite PMI itself by around three months . We also saw the Prices Paid index tick higher, also confirming my  that goods disinflation may be over.Although the Employment index ticked higher in August  4.1 , the overall trend remains to the downside  albeit slightly . This was largely in-line with the BLS s August payrolls report, which was stronger than expected  reinforcing the theme of a resilient economy and that we are likely not yet in recession , but the continued downward revisions confirms underlying weakness  as suggested by the ISM Manufacturing Employment  and that continued deterioration in the labour market lies ahead.Remember, when analysing economic data, it is important to remember the leads and the lags. Employment is lagging, which the ISM subcomponents are leading, and no single indicator can be relied upon in isolation to guide one's investment strategy.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Super Micro Computer Q4 Earnings Review: Strong Demand Hampered By Supply Shortages,"Super Micro Computer, Inc.  has been one of the hottest AI stocks of 2023. I initiated coverage of SMCI with a Strong Buy rating in late May, stating that I had been building a positionLast quarter, SMCI missed on EPS estimates and barely beat on revenue. Throughout fiscal Q3, the company was grappling with unforeseen component shortages, and yet the stock  following earnings. SMCI CEO Charles Liang had this to say about fiscal Q3In this article, I'll review again why SMCI is such a hot stock and review the recent earnings call.Despite an overwhelmingly pessimistic attitude in markets throughout 2022, SMCI prevailed as one of the top performers. This rampage has continued throughout 2023 with SMCI benefitting from the AI-stock bull run. As with most bull runs, price behavior is somewhat estranged from business fundamentals which become overshadowed by growth expectations. This is commonly known as a multiple expansion, with common metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio growing significantly. The trend in the multiple gives insight into investors' expectations of future growth. Stocks with higher growth expectations will trade at higher multiples. Traditionally, SMCI was a very low multiple company. They were plagued by reputational issues throughout the 2010s, with a  from Bloomberg causing years of underperformance. The dust has settled here and years of investigations have yielded no major incriminating evidence against SMCI products.Now with AI reshaping the modern world, attention on SMCI has exploded and the future looks promising. SMCI builds supercomputers and sells them to companies for far cheaper TCO than if those companies attempted to build their own supercomputer. Chip innovations typically feature either more computing power or energy efficiency improvements. SMCI touts some of the most energy-efficient server solutions on the market, which will be a huge tailwind in the era of drastic increases in computing power.This quarter, my sentiment remains bullish for SMCI. Despite a major beat in sales  2.18B vs  1.90B estimated  and EPS  3.51 vs  2.57 estimated , shares are getting pummeled and closed down almost 15  after hours following the earnings release. Gross margin has decreased a few ticks, from 17.6  last quarter to 17.0  now. The drawdown in the stock is being caused by lower future guidance than the market had hoped forThe story is still overwhelmingly positive though in my view. The company has a strong balance sheet, with growing assets and shrinking liabilitiesWith a strong balance sheet aided by improvements in average days in inventory  mentioned on the earnings call , which was down 50  days this quarter. In other words, cash is growing, debt shrinking, and inventory is turning over faster. Further, management mentioned multiple times on the earnings call that top-line growth was kept contained by a shortage of supply, not demand. While this is not ideal, it's better than the opposite.Despite the recent dramatic price drop, the industry-agnostic rush to incorporate generative AI into business operations will continue to provide a strong secular tailwind for SMCI. I don't see any major reason for concern and believe this price behavior is short-term. In that light, I added a few shares to my total position in after-hours trading, which now brings my average cost to just over  175 per share.Of course, investment is not without risk. An investment below the  100 range was a safe bet, but the valuation is much more extreme today. With under  1B in annual profit, paying  15B represents a P E of over 20. SMCI will need to continue rapidly growing amidst an increasingly competitive environment, which is a tall task regardless of tailwinds.Further, management exhaustively noted that there are component shortages. They are dependent on key  unnamed  vendors and are not being entirely transparent on specifics. Transparency is a huge benefit to companies, so the lack thereof could cause concern. It's most likely that the shortages are being caused by chip suppliers ramping up production of AI-optimized chips, which are still relatively new to market. There could be quality and yield issues, but these should resolve themselves over time as suppliers build manufacturing capacity and expertise.There's another risk that SMCI's servers become outright unnecessary in the market. Some companies with sufficient financial resources have built their own computers using proprietary chip design, cutting out suppliers like Nvidia for design and SMCI for plug-and-play supercomputers. A recent example is Tesla  and its supercomputer built on the Dojo architecture. This strategy reflects what Apple did with its M1 chip line, namely to internally design a chip and build a supercomputer on that chip. Dojo chips feature an architecture colloquially known as 'system-on-a-chip', meaning instead of a typical computer that connects separate physical components, the Dojo architecture has packed all necessary components onto a single chip. This significantly increases the efficiency of the system overall and will be used for Tesla to train its FSD  full-self driving  AI model.Few companies have the technical and financial wherewithal to complete such a feat, though. Herein lies SMCI's core market.Despite the risks, I do believe SMCI is a buy. Using a discounted cashflow model, I estimate SMCI to be worth around  245- 265, up from my previous estimate of  230- 250, based on a net income of about  640m. In that light, I believe SMCI is very slightly overvalued at the time of writing, with the stock trading in the  270- 280 range. I do believe the stock is still a Buy, motivating my Buy rating, because I use a very conservative terminal P E of 5 in my valuation. With the current multiple exceeding 20, I've built in a lot of room for multiple contraction. Further, I use far more conservative growth estimates  10  for 2023-2025, 7  for 2026-2028, and 5  for 2029-2032  than management is guiding, and use an aggressive discount rate of 15 , far above the current 10-year treasury yield.Considering the risks, I believe my model paints an accurate picture of SMCI's intrinsic value, and believe that buying at the current price is a wise decision for long-term investors. I do expect more volatility, however 5 years from now I expect this stock to be much more richly valued than it is now.The management team discussed a number of key points for the 2024 fiscal year on the call. With AI establishing its roots throughout the modern world, a key secular trend will be the increase in demand for high-powered computing. Fabless chip companies, many of whom SMCI has close working relationships with, are rapidly innovating chip designs to increase computing power. Alongside this, hardware companies like SMCI are grappling with the challenge of keeping servers and supercomputers from overheating.  is a somewhat nascent but promising product in this space, though the majority of sales are still attributable to air-cooled serversWhile innovation is a net benefit for data centers, it's increasing the complexity of the required infrastructure and is making it more burdensome for cloud-service providers.  allows SMCI customers to enjoy industry-leading time-to-market, energy efficiency, and total cost of ownership.Management expects sustained growth in the TAM  total addressable market  driven by AI adoption, as such they opened a new manufacturing facility today and have plans for another new facility in 2024. However, it was noted multiple times that supply constraints are keeping total sales contained. As with the demand for more computing power, there will be a continuously growing demand for data storage. Management noted they are not only focusing on building AI supercomputers but also high-capacity storage solutions.Rounding out SMCI's offerings and the smallest business line by revenue is 5G IoT Edge computing solutions. Although somewhat immaterial now at 2  of total revenue, this business line should grow well into the future. In summary, SMCIs three current major product offerings are for 1  Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning High-Performance Computing 2  Storage, and 3  5G Internet of Things Edge computing. All three of these markets show promise for long-term growth. CEO Charles Liang is very optimistic, stating on the earnings call that he expects  20B in annual sales  within a few years .Despite a 400  run-up in price and what some believe to be a bubble in AI stocks, I am still rating SMCI stock a Buy. I am fundamentally bullish on the company and believe it will continue to grow into the future.As Warren Buffett often says, it's better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. Don't let a large price tag scare you from a good opportunity.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Navios Maritime Partners: Strong Quarter Results Amid Challenging Logistical Market,"I am invested in various value stocks and one on my radar is Monaco-based shipping company, Navios Maritime Partners L.P. . It has a decent dividend yield of 1.18  with an annual payout rate of  0.20. DespiteNavios Maritime expects net fleet growth in 2023 and 2024 despite geopolitical concerns that have disrupted supply and demand across the globe. The maritime giant is bolstering its fleet of tankers with two Japanese MR2 productNavios Maritime's gross fleet value as of Q2 2023 stood at  4.4 billion with a net fleet equity of  2.2 billion. The company boasts of a contracted revenue of  3.3 billion on its modern fleet with an average age of at least 9.8 years. Despite having a higher market cap of  1.41 billion Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.  total revenues for Q2 2023  61.8   YoY  to  1.31 billion as the company sought to overhaul its fleet profile and instead advance its ESG goals.On its part, Navios Maritime, increased its profitability in Q2 2023 boosted by capital gains from the sale of ships especially container ships and tanker ships that recorded stronger earnings. The company had spent  80 million as of Q4 2022 on the acquisition of two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels. The company was optimistic that it would attain  52.5 million as the aggregate EBITDA for the 2 MR2 vessels after five years with a 13  annual yield. Aside from that Navios is looking at an aggregate charter revenue of  84.5 million with a 20  residual value after the charter contract.The delivery of the two new builds is expected by the end of H1 2026 and H1 2027. Navios managed to negotiate a similar interest rate on both consignments meaning that they will each cost about  40.2 million each.Already, Navios has  270.1 million in cash as of Q2 2023 representing an increase of 26.6   QoQ . Each of the two MR2 vessels will be chartered out during the 5 years at a net rate of  22,959. This gain is significant since the company has at least 175 ships in water as well as under construction. The new acquisition will put Navios' total fleet at 177 ships comprising 81 bulk  ship  carriers, 47 containers, and 49 tankers. Under construction are about a dozen boxships, 6 MR2s, and 6 Aframax LR2s. I have known Navios to not shy away from making big purchases as long as there is a perceived value at stake. In Q2 2023, the company agreed to buy the 2019 Navios Horizon 1 for  28 million  built and chartered . I also expect the 81,692 dwt ship to be delivered by Q3 2023.Despite experiencing an almost 50   YoY  drop in the charter market in Q2 2023, Danaos Corporation  recorded  241 million in operating revenue and even secured about  500 million in new charter contracts in the quarter. By the end of the quarter, DAC's total charter backlog  to  2.5 backlog with the contracted charter coverage 99  for 2023 and 86  for 2024.For Navios, Q2 2023 contracted revenue stood at  46.8 million identified as long-term revenue from 3 contracted MR2 vessels. These vessels are responsible for an average daily net pay range of  21,831 for at least 2 years.As noted earlier, fleet proceeds  YTD  from the gross sale of 13 vessels in the quarter yielded about  242.2 million. In Q1 2023, Navios generated  160.3 million, in Q2 2023 it generated  59.6 million and in Q3 2023 it is expected to generate the remaining  22.3 million. From the total of  242.2 million, Navios intends to spend about  108.4 million in acquiring 2 new building MR2 vessels to be delivered by 2027 and an additional 3 new building capsize vessels for delivery within 2023.The newbuilding development by Navios has used up almost 95  of its available financing. In Q2 2023, the company arranged a total of  350.2 million in new financing which I think came in at an opportune moment since its total debt stands at  2.22 billion. In its Q2 2023 transcript, Navios explained that it organized its  first export credit agency backed facilities in China and South Korea.  Of the  350.2 million attained,  287.8 million is expected to refinance 36 vessels- which are already existing facilities with an average margin of 2.4  running for about 3 to 5 years. The remaining  62.4 million will be used to finance the two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels  at an implied interest rate of 7.0 0 for a 10-year term .In the containership section, Navios acquired 12 vessels for  860 million hedged on a long-term credit line, and expected to generate about  1.1 billion in contracted revenue in about 6.5 years. Then there is also the LR2  Aframax tanker subsector where the company ordered 6 vessels for  380 million. In the dry bulk newbuilding section, Navios is looking at 81 vessels with an average age of 10.4 years and a carrying capacity of 9.9 mdwt. The contracted revenue from the dry bulk fleet is the lowest at  308 million against  2.1 billion from container ships.Navios expects the global GDP to grow by 3  in both 2023 and 2024 bolstered by the rising demand for world oil. Reports  that in the first 7 months of 2023, crude oil imports into China grew 12.4  clocking 122.4 million tons. It is expected the Chinese economic growth in 2024 may be delayed if the Russian-Ukraine war persists. I am also looking at slower industrial production and the constant overhang of inventory as possible inhibitors of the recovery of the shipping industry.Analysts expect dry bulk cargo volume to rise 1.5  and 2.5  in 2023 and a range of 1  to 2  in 2024. Sanctions on Russian coal are also expected to motivate a 0.5  and 1.5  increase in average haul in 2023. This trend will also positively affect the shipment of iron ore and grain shipments in Brazil. With the abandonment of the Black Sea grain export deal by Russia due to the ongoing war, Navios expects to reap additional grain volume transportation from Brazil, Europe, and Russia. Overall, seaborne grain trade is expected to grow by 2.5  in 2023 alone.Navios' price-to-earnings ratio  TTM  stands at 1.14 against the industry average of 19.66. This mark leaves off a difference of -94.22 . The enterprise value against EBITDA  TTM  also stands at 4.11 against the industry average of 12.03  indicating a difference of -65.86 . It is not uncommon for high-value shipping stocks to have low PE ratios. GSL's PE ratio stands at 2.18 against the industry average of 19.66  a difference of -88.91 . I think NMM is slightly undervalued and has a strong upside potential, especially when the 2 new MR2 Japanese vessels come online.The persistent uncertainty over grain and fertilizer supplies from Ukraine due to the ongoing war may affect global shipping into 2024. Wheat futures have also been plummeting in 2023 lower than  5.8 per bushel. Global consumption of the commodity may also be revised lower with forecasts down 3.4 million tons to 796.1 million.Navios also indicated in its transcript that seaborne coal trade is expected to decrease by 2.7  in H2 2023 due to the shifting patterns caused by the Russian-Ukraine war.I also feel that the LR2 Aframax subsector tankers ordered by Navios for  380 million will not generate enough money to cover the expenses  not unless I am missing something from the statistics . The company ordered 6 vessels to be chartered out at an average net daily rate of  26,580 per day for 5 years. These vessels are expected to generate roughly  290 million, meaning that the company will incur a loss of about  90 million exclusive of any maintenance charges.Navios Maritime Partners has increased its profitability over time, bolstered by capital gains from ship sales and accretive acquisitions in the industry. Q2 2023 has seen the company register strong earnings, especially from container ships and tankers within its diversified fleet portfolio. I am looking forward to the delivery of its new build tanker fleet from Japan and the recovery of the global logistical economy as the key drivers to the company's growth into 2024. For these reasons, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

AGCO: Cultivating Success In Deere's Backyard,"It's time to talk about a company that makes me mildly nervous. That company is the Georgia-based . Its much larger peer, Deere   Company , is one of myWhile I stick to everything I've ever written in my Deere articles, it needs to be said that AGCO is turning into an increasingly strong competitor that deserves recognition.Over the past five years, AGCO stock has returned 140 . Deere has returned close to 200 . While I continue to believe that Deere is the way to go, itIn this article, we'll talk about the company's increasingly impressive growth strategy, agriculture fundamentals, and some of the company's comments during the most recent Morgan Stanley Annual Laguna Conference on September 12.So, let's get to itIn general, I would make the case that there's no reason why anyone absolutely needs to invest in agriculture.Personally, I am investing in agriculture for two reasons. The secondary reason is that it's my passion. I'm fascinated by agriculture and the importance of the agriculture supply chain.The primary reason does not come with a bias. Companies selling top-tier agriculture equipment  the ones with a wide moat  tend to be terrific tools for outperforming capital gains - especially during times of elevated inflation when farmers see rising farm income.Since the year 2000, both Deere and AGCO have outperformed the S P 500 by a wide margin, unfortunately with  expected  elevated volatility.Most people are familiar with Deere. I have heard countless country songs about the company. It's also by far the biggest tractor company in the world, with a market cap more than 10x larger than AGCO's  9 billion market cap.AGCO, although smaller, is still a significant player in the industry. The company is the owner of Fendt, Massey Ferguson, Valtra, and Challenger.Additionally, AGCO also owns smaller brands like Gleaner and companies such as GSI that specialize in building crop storage solutions, among other things.While these companies are large in their home markets  Massey is British, Fendt is German , the company is launching a full-scale attack on North and South American markets.With that said, like its peers, the company benefits from a number of tailwinds.During the recent annual Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference, the company highlighted the robust long-term fundamentals driven by global population growth, expanding middle class, and increasing demand for protein.The current stocks-to-use ratio in grains  ex-China  is at a multi-decade low, suggesting that we need multiple good crop years before supply and demand conditions normalize again.It also highlighted the impact of biofuels on grain demand and profitability in the farming sector.The war in Ukraine has influenced crop challenges and elevated grain prices, encouraging farmers to invest in modernizing their equipment.Moreover, the age of the average farmer fleet presents an opportunity for equipment upgrades, further fueled by advancing technology.The overall industry dynamics suggest a positive demand outlook leading into 2024.Despite a decline in key crop prices  like corn, soybeans, and wheat , demand remains strong, as visible in the company's order books.Furthermore, there are two other major tailwinds.On top of this, the company is focusing on precision equipment as part of its aggressive expansion strategy.The precision equipment segment includes equipment like planters, sprayers, and whatnot that are able to operate with extremely high precision. This lowers input costs  like fertilizers  and often boosts yields significantly.By 2025, the company aims to do  1 billion in precision sales. Using analyst estimates, precision sales could account for almost 7  of total sales.The company has also achieved substantial success by retrofitting precision technology into the aftermarket, distinguishing itself by being OEM-agnostic.AGCO's approach allows retrofitting on competitors' products, expanding its market reach. This is a genius strategy, as it somewhat applies a modular approach to agriculture.I also believe that this is a smart way of potentially grabbing market share.Speaking of market share, the company has a major focus on expanding the Fendt market share in North America and South America.The company targets achieving  1.5 billion in Fendt sales by 2025, aiming to outpace industry growth by 4  to 5  annually.AGCO believes that Fendt's premium technology and high fuel efficiency have positioned it as a leading product, capturing market share by appealing to growers seeking advanced technology and performance.The strategy involves offering a full line of Fendt products, including tractors, sprayers, combines, and planters, allowing dealers to provide comprehensive solutions to customers.As part of a potential pricing war, the company will not lower prices on premium Fendt products but use Messey Ferguson to target farmers looking for lower-priced products.It will also make its dealer network more efficient, which has been a reason why Deere has dominated the North American market.So, what about the dividendAGCO has a special dividend - literally.The company currently pays a  0.29 per share per quarter dividend. The yield is 0.97 .While this is low and nothing to get excited about, there's good news.On May 5, the company announced its highest special dividend ever of  5.00 per share. This brings the total annualized dividend to  6.16, which translates to a 5.1  yield. In other words, AGCO could be a high-yielding agriculture stock if it sticks to this policyFurthermore, the company's net leverage ratio is just 0.2x EBITDA. Next year, the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debt.The company has a BBB- credit rating.So, what about the valuationThis is the tricky part. According to analysts, the company's growth streak is expected to end next year. I disagree with that, as I do not believe that the company is about to see two consecutive years of contraction - not unless we enter a steep recession with severely subdued crop prices. Or if rates remain so high that farmers are unable to buy new equipment. Rising rates are a major problem.Having said that, expectations are that free cash flow remains close to 10  of its market cap. This means that high special dividends are very likely unless the company engages in M A or decides to further enhance its already healthy balance sheet.With regard to the valuation, rising EBITDA and an unchanged stock price since early 2021 have caused the valuation to drop to just 6.3x EBITDA.Currently, a lower valuation makes sense, as investors aren't willing to buy machinery stocks when global growth is in decline.However, AGCO benefits from strong secular tailwinds, close to zero construction exposure, and a solid strategy to gain market share.Longer-term, I do not believe that AGCO should trade below 8x EBITDA.This would put the fair value at almost  190 per share, 60  above the current price.Please note that this is based on very conservative analyst estimates  I would argue that the company could see 10  to 20  higher EBITDA in 2025.Although I do not believe that AGCO will start this uptrend anytime soon, on a longer-term basis, the stock remains extremely undervalued.Knowing a bit about its top brands like Fendt, I have no doubt that the company is in a great spot to take away market share. I'm not sure that a lot of it will come from Deere, but in general, AGCO is an increasing force to be reckoned with.While Deere   Company remains my favorite dividend growth holding in the agriculture space, AGCO has emerged as a competitor deserving of recognition.Boasting top-tier tractor brands and advancing technologies, AGCO is ready to take away market share from its peers.Despite a dividend yield slightly below 1 , the company offers juicy total yield potential, especially during favorable economic times.With a strong growth strategy and a focus on precision equipment, AGCO is aggressively expanding its market share, aiming for  1 billion in precision sales and a significant foothold for Fendt in North and South America.The company's special dividend policy further enhances its appeal, presenting a potentially significantly undervalued high-yield investment.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Charting A Course In Choppier Waters,"At the start of 2023, consensus expectations were decisively negative and reflected a high likelihood of a recession. A string of positive economic surprises, along with excitement around artificial intelligence  AI , fueled strong equity market performance throughoutNow, market focus has started to shift towards concerns over policy rates remaining higher for longer. While avoiding a recession still appears achievable, alternative indicators suggest that economic surprises may become more two-sided and could pose challenges to equity investors in the months ahead. This also means that the ability to accurately forecast the direction of those surprises may be increasingly valuable for harnessing alpha opportunities as they surface. In this quarter's Systematic Equity Outlook, we explore theEasing inflationary pressures and resilient growth measures were among the string of positive developments that strengthened the case for a US soft-landing earlier this year. Despite acknowledging progress on inflation, the US Federal Reserve  Fed  continues to look for further evidence that policy is sufficiently restrictive to fully restore price stability. The Fed raised the bar for rate cuts and signaled they may keep rates higher for longer with the September Summary of Economic Projections  SEP , prompting a repricing of policy expectations.So can inflation continue to decline and provide the evidence needed to satisfy the Fed  To answer this question, we monitor a wide range of alternative datasets that provide a timely and granular view of inflation ahead of official reports. For example, we use data from online job postings to track wage inflation in real time. Figure 1 shows a reacceleration of wage growth that we started to observe near the end of August. Some official data releases like the September Jobs Report and JOLTS data have since shown signs of increased labor market strength, and we expect other lagged measures to reflect higher wage growth in the coming months.Year-over-year   wage inflationBeneath the surface of high-level wage increases, our job postings data also reveals an important shift in the distribution of wage inflation. Figure 2 shows that the largest wage gains are concentrated in higher-paying occupations while wage gains for lower-paying roles have been more muted. This suggests that declines in wage inflation highlighted in many aggregate measures may be masking a more nuanced story of ongoing tightness in the labor market. Our data shows that along with potentially reaccelerating in aggregate, the wage inflation picture is becoming increasingly complex with growing divergence across occupation types.Year-over-year   change by occupation categoryIt's important to note that the reacceleration of inflationary pressures appears to be confined to wages, as alternative data measures across several other price components are showing continued progress on disinflation. But given wages have been a key driver of stubborn services inflation  especially the so-called  super-core  core services ex-shelter inflation now running back above 5 , the Fed may feel added pressure to keep rates higher for longer.The strong job market is just one characteristic of the post-pandemic economy that's contributed to resilient economic growth  and inflation  throughout the Fed's hiking cycle. The unprecedented level of pandemic stimulus is another factor that's bolstered household savings and supported strong consumer spending. Among a wide range of stimulus initiatives, student loan payments were paused from nearly the start of COVID-19 through September 2023.Now, the resumption of student loan repayments could have the opposite effect on consumer activity. To gauge the magnitude of potential impact, we leverage US state-level student loan and income data. Figure 3 illustrates the aggregate student loan burden for each state, suggesting that the resumption of repayments will likely have the largest impact on household balance sheets in lower-income states.Aggregate spending headwind vs. post-tax income by stateThe resumption of student loan payments also has the potential to drive increased labor participation as households face higher debt obligations. The aggregate participation rate of higher-educated cohorts remains below pre-COVID levels, suggesting that there's room for more normalization to occur.If this is the case, the unemployment rate may increase due to rising labor participation, as we saw in August. While higher unemployment is typically perceived as a negative for the economy, it may be viewed positively if it's driven by an uptick in labor supply rather than broad-based layoffs. This is because it could relieve wage pressures by further restoring balance between labor supply and demand without requiring widespread job losses and economic pain. As shown in Figure 4, corporate layoff mentions across earnings calls and news articles have continued to moderate in recent months. The absence of severe layoffs is one of several indicators suggesting that economic growth in the US remains stable enough to avoid a recession in the near term.Unique mentions of layoffs in US large-cap conference calls and Dow Jones news articlesIn recent months, yield curve steepening has largely dominated equity returns, putting downward pressure on valuations given higher discount rates. Looking ahead, it's possible that equity beta could face some additional headwinds even if a recession is avoided. This is because as the yield curve normalizes  un-inverts , further  would take place. Given that equity market pricing still reflects a largely optimistic growth outlook, the effect of higher discount rates could once again dominate broad equity performance in the absence of a significantly positive growth shock.At the same time, the alpha opportunity set for equity investors has become increasingly compelling. Macroeconomic and market uncertainty is contributing to increased security dispersion, or divergence in returns across individual stocks. Active managers with the ability to rapidly uncover security selection insights and recalibrate portfolios may be well-positioned to harness alpha opportunities amid heightened volatility. This environment particularly enhances the opportunity set for managers who can invest both , as they can exploit performance differences across stocks and target returns in the cross-section of markets with reduced dependence on overall market direction.The AI theme is one area where we see cross-sectional opportunities emerging. In the first half of the year, AI could be thought of as a rising tide that lifted most boats, particularly in the mega-cap tech universe. Now, the surge in long-term rates has dampened the initial broad AI rally, making individual company characteristics a more relevant return driver. Some of the early AI leaders have differentiated themselves by starting to monetize the opportunity and delivering strong earnings results. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we've seen a reversal in the performance of certain companies that initially benefitted from the rising ride but haven't shown evidence of sustained leadership potential.It's worth noting that within BlackRock Systematic, we leverage  to help inform these security selection insights. One example of this is our use of transformer-based models to analyze unstructured text at scale, which provides a higher level of precision and accuracy than more traditional methods of analysis.For example, we can analyze corporate earnings call transcripts from previous quarters throughout history to determine which companies were genuinely focused on AI long before the recent wave of hype. From a broader industry perspective, Figure 5 illustrates the acceleration of AI-related job postings across the economy. We can use the text from these online job postings to understand how companies across industries are integrating AI into their business models, and the potential enhancements to productivity and efficiency that may follow.Cumulative count of job postings over timeAfter a string of positive surprises in the first half of 2023, our outlook is becoming slightly more balanced as we look ahead. Wage pressures and consumer spending headwinds may be emerging, and equity markets could face periods of pressure from further curve steepening even if a soft-landing is achieved. Despite these risks, increased security dispersion is enhancing the opportunity set for active managers to generate alpha amid choppier waters. 2023 BlackRock, Inc.

Maersk Doesn't Need A Soft Landing To Be A Great Investment,"A.P. Møller   Mærsk A S,  or more commonly known as just Maersk, is one of the largest container shipping companies in the world and has its hand in nearly 1 6 of global trade withOne thing that catches my attention every now and then is , and his adoption of bulk shipping companies from time to time.No, Michael Burry did not buy Maersk, but this past quarter, he did start small positions in several shipping companies - Safe Bulkers , Euronav , Costamare  and Star Bulk Carriers . This basket of shipping companies reminds me a lot of his old trade in Golden Ocean  from a couple of years ago, which was highly successful. After I decided to start a recent position in Maersk, I noticed the 13-F filings were starting to come out, so I took a look at Burry's recent changes to his portfolio. I noticed he was also buying shipping companies during the quarter, which was a welcome surprise, but also most likely just a random coincidence of market timing.Burry's trading style is a bit hard to follow because usually his holdings turn over every quarter or two, and he trades at a fast pace which can be hard to draw any conclusions from. Earlier this year, he bought a bunch of US bank stocks and was out of them by the very next quarter. Michael Burry is not a Warren Buffett,  buy-and-hold  forever type of investor, but what can value investors learn from his portfolio  What can be useful to investors from watching Burry's portfolio over time is learning  and seeing when he enters into a trade and what  he chooses to focus on, and come back to time and time again. Could it be the right time to buy into the shipping cycle now  Or is Burry simply making a macro bet on a soft landing with a basket of shipping companiesJust recently, on September 18th, 2023, J Zim Integrated Shipping  citing margin declines as temporary, with a rebound being likely as COVID-era charters get re-chartered or redelivered at cheaper rates. If an economic soft landing is perhaps in the cards after all, shipping stocks such as Maersk are sure not trading like it.Whatever the case may be, I see Maersk as somewhat the opposite of what Michael Burry would typically buy in the industry. The market capitalization and sheer size of the company is not like him at all  Burry typically trades small caps or even borderline micro-cap shipping companies with a short time horizon, but I intend to do the opposite. My goal is to not trade the stock in the short term, but hold Maersk for much longer, reinvesting the dividends along the way.I like Maersk simply because it is a massive company in its industry with a competitive advantage, trading at a large discount to book value, with potential for outsized returns from stock buybacks over time. It is unusual to find a company with such a huge market presence that trades at nearly half of book value  even if this is the shipping industry we are talking about here . The potential returns from just buybacks in future years are significant, but combined with dividend reinvestment over time, I think the stock could be a worthy compounder.In this article, I will outline the basic thesis for investing in Maersk stock, and explain why buying at nearly half of book value makes sense given the buyback strategy.Maersk trades at roughly 0.5x book value and also at historically low levels when isolating for this variable, even slightly below the COVID crash levels of March 2020.Most of the  seem very low, but the recent P E ratio of the stock is somewhat misleading, due to cyclical reasons and the recent years of earnings being abnormally good for the company. I would not go from just the recent earnings of the prior two years, but use other variables to determine if the stock really is as cheap as it currently appears to be.A P E multiple for 2023 is estimated to be around 7x, which seems more in-line with a fair valuation, but earnings could be better than expected next year, even if a soft landing for the economy is not in the cards. The most recent earnings call shed light on this, as management stated that while  on the industry, earnings guidance would be better than expected for the full year. Sort of contradictory statements, but better earnings for the full year would translate to possibly better dividends than expected as well. Recent declining financial results since 2022 and a big crash earlier this year have both pushed the stock from near record highs back to test a support level  near  8.00 for the ADR, which trades as AMKBY . I like the stock here around this price, as the discount to book value should not be viewed as a weakness, but rather as a support level and buying opportunity for those with a longer-term mindset.For me, Maersk seems like a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on the economy and collect dividends along the way. When I look at companies like this, I always try to screen for low valuations, a competitive advantage, nice margin of safety, and if possible, potential for reinvestment of dividends each year. Shipping companies can be tricky because they are cyclical, with highly variable earnings and dividends which are usually not consistent. This makes valuing the company difficult based off of EPS alone.Maersk paid a  in March, which will likely not stay high again next year. Even with a big drop in the dividend yield being priced-in, the recent action in the stock does not worry me. I would rather see management prioritize stock buybacks over dividends anyway at this time, as the discount to book means that more value likely can be created from these buybacks over the next few years, rather than paid out as dividends to shareholders.The future dividend yield is somewhat uncertain, but nevertheless, it helps in terms of offsetting the downside that may be apparent in the next 6 months. Could the stock get even cheaper and trade for under 0.5x book given a hard landing for the economy  Yes, I believe that anything is possible, but this could be a necessary outcome to create future value from buybacks at rock bottom prices before the cycle inevitably turns positive once more.Making macro bets directly via complicated strategies and hedging is not my style as an investor. However, investing in Maersk seems like a good way to have some protection against the downside while making a largely macro bet on the economy.The thing that stood out to me right away in my research into the company was how surprisingly good the balance sheet was. Maersk does not have too much debt, and the company has tons of cash which can be used to buy back stock at discounted prices to book value.This alone will create value for shareholders over time in my opinion, but there is some risk that management may prioritize dividends over buybacks in the next couple years, make acquisitions, or change the capital allocation strategy in some other way which could hinder performance.Shown above is the company's balance sheet from the . Maersk has over  10 billion in cash and around  14 billion in total non-current liabilities. Compare the debt with the total equity, at  56 billion, and the debt-to-equity ratio is close to 0.25.Comparing the cash position to the market cap, at around  29 billion, and it becomes clear just how much buyback potential there is over the next several years. Buybacks have already been aggressive, and management seems committed to this strategy as the stock price has declined in recent months.When considering certain stocks like Maersk as an investment, one should ask themselves, how am I going to get to my desired return  For some stocks, it is clear that growth in some capacity is going to be a main factor, while in other stocks, a lot of the return comes from dividends. What if the company is not growing at all  Are multiples expanding or contracting  In many cases, returns will come from four things - dividends, multiple expansion, earnings growth, and stock buybacks. Reversion to the mean is always something that must be considered, especially with cyclical companies like Maersk. Timing the cycles can be difficult, and so a longer-term approach is necessary to produce favorable results. Trading these stocks in the short term is possible, but it is risky and does not always guarantee that dividends will contribute to the return.One possible place the return could come from would be simply from a reversion to the mean in terms of book value. In my opinion, it is somewhat more likely that Maersk could become loved by the market once more in the next cycle and trade closer to 1x book value, rather than the stock getting punished even further to trade in a range near 0.25x book value from 0.5x book value. A risk is that given a bad enough recession, today's prices could be too high compared to future earnings potential.Another place the return could come from would be the combination of two factors - one being dividends reinvested over each year of the holding period, and management's commitment to stock repurchases going even higher over the next several years. The results of the buyback program are already exceptional, as the number of shares outstanding  from 21 million as of 2019 to almost 17 million as of this year. Aggressive buybacks are one thing, but buying back stock at major discounts to book value is an overlooked mechanism that could supercharge future returns. Dividends will likely not be very large next year, but reinvesting the dividends at opportune moments in future years will be important to the longer-term strategy of holding the stock through various parts of the cycle.The last place the return could come from could be the most overlooked of them all - actual unexpected economic growth in future years and Maersk being re-rated with a higher multiple compared to similar players in the industry. The company has an excellent balance sheet, so it would not be a shock to see the stock trade at a premium to book value at some point in the future when the cycle inevitably reverts.Shipping companies are widely known for their cyclicality. In good times, the earnings and dividends will be astronomical, but in bad times, shipping rates decline and the company struggles to make any profits at all. Similar to the semiconductor cycle, the market goes through ups and downs as conditions with pricing change. One year, a certain company in a cyclical industry has high margins and earns record profits  the next year, the margins are terrible and the company barely makes any money at all. This can be a problem for many shipping companies that use excessive leverage to build their fleets, as the downturns can be worse than expected, causing financial difficulty and instability. In my opinion, Maersk does not use excessive leverage, but this is still a risk which should be considered before making an investment in the company.It is also important for investors to realize that Maersk's earnings potential and dividends in a given year are closely tied to shipping rates, which are highly volatile. In terms of recent years, the post-pandemic environment caused demand to skyrocket, and many bulk shipping companies looked dirt cheap compared to what they were trading for in the middle of 2020. Now that this post-pandemic rush has subsided, for the most part, supply and demand are beginning to look more balanced. Investing in shipping companies is notoriously tricky, as timing the cycles becomes more important than other aspects of the business itself, and being on the right side of the cycle is easier said than done.A.P. Møller   Mærsk A S, or simply just Maersk, is a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on global trade, with a further advantage given due to a margin of safety with shares trading at nearly half of book value. This relative safety stems from managing downside risk with high dividends and the potential for future returns stemming from sizeable stock buybacks over time. The company has an excellent balance sheet, and a commanding market position with a market share of around 17 , giving a competitive advantage in the shipping industry. The valuation is extremely favorable, with a low P E multiple and shares at nearly 0.5x book value, which makes management's buyback strategy even more enticing for longer-term investors. A soft landing for the economy would be an amazing outcome, but this is not entirely necessary for Maersk stock to produce favorable returns in future years. I currently view shares of Maersk as a Buy at this time, and will be watching the stock closely for continued buying opportunities in the  8.00- 9.00 range for the ADR.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

STAG Industrial: Cost Of Capital Exceeds The Cap Rate - Shares Untimely,"One of the salient features of REITs is that profits and prices often move in cycles. And there are two cycles worth considering. First, there is the space market cycle which describes the supply and demand for a type ofSTAG enjoys a BBB rating from Fitch and a Baa3 from Moody s. Both credit agencies have stable outlooks for STAG. Please take a look at Table 1 which compares the total return that can be earned from an equity interest in STAG and the 5-year median yield on the Corporate Baa BBB.Finance is based on several fundamental precepts, one of which is a balance of risk and return. When you can earn 94 basis points more in an instrument that has less risk, it may be time to reevaluate the investment thesis for a stock.In economic theory, when a business can deploy assets and earn a return that exceeds the cost to acquire the assets then value is created. In the case of a REIT, value is created when the capitalization rate, or cap rate, exceeds the cost of capital. The cap rate is the net operating income obtained from the assets and the cost of capital is the cost to use capital to purchase the assets for which income is generated. This is especially important for a REIT because they are not able to retain earnings and have to rely on capital markets to fund their growth. In general, REITs tap debt and equity markets to fund acquisitions for growth and to refinance debt as they come due.Let us now evaluate how much value is created by looking at the difference between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG. Please take a look at Table 2The cap rate presented is the midpoint of the guided stabilized cap rate in STAG s Q2 2023 Earnings Supplement. For STAG to create value, their cost of capital must be less than this figure.In order to calculate the cost of capital, we have to calculate the cost of debt, the cost of equity and weigh each cost to the extent they are used in the business. Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by STAG. Please take a look at Table 3.STAG does not currently have any preferred shares outstanding.Now that we have the relative weights, we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost. Please take a look at Table 4 for the cost of equity.There are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity. We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM  in which we essentially add a spread to the risk-free rate and scale the spread by the volatility of the particular stock.The beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market. The beta is 0.92 which implies that STAG s stock is less sensitive than the market. Conceptually, this is justified because REITs as an asset class generally have revenue streams that are contractual and more stable than non-REITs. I use the 10-year treasury as my risk-free rate and apply a spread, or an equity risk premium of 4.38 . The equity risk premium I used is from . The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 8.26 . STAG would have to offer an 8.26  return to entice equity investors to purchase shares by this estimate.Now that we have a cost of equity, let us now estimate the cost of debt. Please take look at Table 5 in which we provide the issuer rating for STAG as before and the 10-year Corporate  Baa BBB  median yield.The implication of the cost of debt is that should STAG wish to refinance debt at about the 10-year tenor, it would be facing a cost of debt of 5.70 . This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 5.70  of their long-term debt because some fixed-rate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower. Because of this, the actual cost of debt may be somewhat less. In general, businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates. STAG also employs swaps to manage their interest rate exposure. Nevertheless, for our purposes, 5.70  is the most accurate reflection of the current market conditions and so we will use this as our input.Now that we have a cost of debt, the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital. Please take a look at Table 6.The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate level.Taking into account the current macroeconomic environment, STAG would have to generate a cap rate of more than 7.57  to create economic profit. In Table 7 we quantify the amount of the deficit between cap rate and the weighted average cost of capital for STAG.The calculation indicates that STAG does not create value as measured by this framework. Let us explore further why this may the case. We have looked at the spread between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG. Let us take a broader perspective and look at the spread between the Industrial REIT cap rate and the 10-year treasury from 2010-2019. Please take a look at Table 8.In Table 9 we look at the spread as of the second quarter of this year.The 63-basis point spread as of the second quarter is beyond two standard deviations from the mean spread from 2010 to 2019. These figures suggest that cap rates have yet to meaningfully adjust upwards. In the recent earnings call, STAG s leadership The commentary suggests that sellers still have in their recent memory high asset prices that were reflective of a low interest environment. There seems to be some hesitancy on their part to accept the new market environment. When sellers reduce the price, that will potentially increase cap rates in deals moving forward.For cap rates to increase, either the net operating income has to increase or the asset values have to come down. One way for net operating income to increase is when leases come up for renewal, they are re-leased at a higher contractual base rent which is reflective of the current market conditions. For the second quarter, renewals showed a cash rent change of 28.3  which was higher than the year-to-second quarter rent change of 23.5 , suggesting an accelerating trend. The comparable statistics for 2022 were 13.7  and 11.2  respectively.Another way for cap rates to increase is if asset prices come down. Asset prices coming down may seem like a positive development for an acquirer such as STAG, but it could also put a dampening effect on STAG s stock price as their current portfolio will potentially be valued less.Finally, operating performance would be impacted. About 17.4  of their debt principal balance has a maturity date on or before June 2025 which implies meaningful refinance activity in the near term. Additionally, interest expense for the first six months of 2023 was 29.3  higher than the comparable period in 2022. Debt was only 12.88  higher during the period by my estimate. If more of the pie is going to fixed income holders, there is less available for equity investors.Let us look into the operating performance in more detail.Please take a look at Table 10 in which we compare the per share metrics for the first six months of this year with the first six months of 2018.Looking at the metrics, it appears that even with the current inflationary environment, STAG s performance is better than it was in the first six months of 2018. This is the sort of five-year performance you would expect from a REIT in a stable interest rate environment. In 2018, the 10-year treasury was hovering around 2.90  and it is at 4.24  today. Let us look at this in more detail.The metrics presented in Table 10 are per share metrics for the first six months of the respective year. Let us look at the share count  growth from 2018 to 2023. To maintain consistency, the share count is as of the second quarter of each year not year-end. Please take a look at Table 11.Share count growth showed an increasing trend from 2018-2020 and then dropped to about a third of the pace in 2021 and then showed an increase in 2022 and then slowed to a crawl in 2023. My first impression from overall cadence of share issuance is that management is adroit in issuing shares and units when the environment is favorable.The second impression is that the miniscule growth in share issuance in the first half of 2023 is not sustainable. REITs are not able to retain earnings to a meaningful extent so they have to issue shares regularly to fund growth. The slow share count growth in the first six months of 2023 is probably a reflection of the unfavorable market conditions that exist in acquiring assets. When a healthy spread exists between the cap rate and the cost of capital, that would be an opportune time to issue shares and fund growth. There is another dimension to this which may be of potential concern to investors.Because the per share data for the first six months of 2023 as presented in Table 10 does not reflect the historic pace of share issuance as we have seen from Table 11, investors should contemplate on how accurate the performance comparison between the two time periods really is. Had share issuance continued at its average pace in the first six months of this year, the period comparison would probably favor the 2018 performance. Additionally, while management strategy of holding back on share issuance until a balance between cap rate and cost of capital is sensible, it may portend an accelerated pace of share issuance with its dilutive effect.When the fixed income instrument of an issuer can offer a return that exceeds the dividend yield  growth rate, the investment thesis of the stock has to be revisited. In revisiting the worthiness of the investment, we have raised some questions as to the timeliness of an investment in STAG s stockFirstly, there is an imbalance between the cap rate and the cost of capital. Investors should consider waiting until a positive spread is restored and value creation is demonstrated by figures. Secondly, if and when cap rates adjust upwards, there could be downward pressure of real estate asset prices. STAG s current portfolio would be potentially valued less which may negate some of benefit of the cap rate improvement. Thirdly, the per share performance in the first half of 2023 is not reflective of performance under the normal pace of share issuance. When share issuance resumes at its historic pace, operating metrics may compare unfavorably to past periods which may dampen stock prices. Lastly, as debt matures and requires refinancing, increased interest expense will make it less likely that future dividends can grow at an attractive clip.Prudent investors should consider foregoing an investment in STAG at the current time.

BRF: Uncertainty Persists Despite Commodity Cycle Advantage,"Although I see the current momentum with a more positive slant in the face of more optimistic poultryThe slower revenue growth can be attributed to a decline in average sales prices that gained momentum in July. However, ABPA anticipates this trend to reverse. Competing exporters like the United States, Turkey, Ukraine, and Chile face challenges in expanding production. In contrast, China, which recently increased its domestic supply, has reduced breeding stock between late 2022 and early 2023 and has already shown signs of slowing down in the coming months.This combination of factors is advantageous for Brazil, which leads the world in meat shipments with a 35  market share. Additionally, decreasing corn and soybean prices provides further incentives for increased production. ABPA projects a potential growth of up to 3  in Brazil's production in 2023, ranging between 14.8 million and 15 million tons.The growth prospects depend on Brazil continuing to report no cases of avian influenza in commercial farms, likely leading to import barriers from China and possibly other regions. It's worth noting that even if a disease outbreak occurs in commercial farms, embargoes tend to be regional, as has been the case with the United States, which is currently dealing with avian influenza in its production chain.In the second quarter, there was an oversupply of chicken meat in the global market, negatively impacting BRF, Brazil's largest chicken exporter. Additionally, the weakening of the dollar against the Brazilian real led to a 75  decrease in EBITDA from the company's international operations compared to the same period in the previous year, with the figure at R 241 million.However, BRF's management is optimistic about the upcoming quarters, anticipating a trend toward supply and demand rebalancing, even though the company has not released any specific guidance.BRF is poised to witness improved operations and a debt reduction. The deceleration in inflation, declining unemployment rates, and rising income in Brazil bolstered the year-end sales prospects for BRF.Furthermore, he mentioned that the full impact of the drop in grain prices on the index is yet to be realized, signaling the potential for improved profit margins in the upcoming months.Moreover, the company's ongoing restructuring efforts have exhibited a positive outlook for the near future. BRF's operational improvement plan has been highlighted, contributing R 540 million in efficiencies. This underscores that the management is on the right path to provide a more optimistic profitability outlook. Generating higher-than-expected cash flow has been a critical factor in the company's financial position.BRF's net debt EBITDA stands at 7.1x, marking its highest level in the past three years. Despite the company having more debt than equity, it continues to generate positive cash flow. This implies that BRF is producing more cash from its operations than it is expending, which is a positive indicator of its cash generation capability, at least for a certain period.According to Marfrig's statement, this increase in stake is not intended to alter the current composition of BRF's control or management structure. Still, it is solely aimed at expanding its ownership in the company. Additionally, Marfrig clarified that it has not entered into any agreements related to voting rights or agreements governing the purchase or sale of BRF shares.Nevertheless, this increased stake is part of Marfrig's broader strategy to enhance its control over BRF, an initiative that commenced in 2021.This increase in ownership is expected to take Marfrig's stake in BRF to around 50  and that of Salic to 25   currently, the fund holds a 10.7  stake , with minority shareholders retaining 25 .However, the timeline for Marfrig to gain complete control over BRF remains uncertain. On the one hand, the seven-year limitation on Salic's ownership of a maximum of 25  of BRF indicates a potentially more extended timeframe. Additionally, Marfrig has been grappling with reduced margins in the US beef market, which could persist for another year, limiting its cash flow.Recent developments suggest that a merger between Marfrig and BRF may be a less likely scenario. Salic has made investments in BRF, not Marfrig, and it's unclear if they intend to expand their presence in the beef segment further, especially considering their existing stakes in Minerva. This raises doubts about the feasibility of a merger. Nevertheless, the potential for synergies could be seen as an argument favoring such a move.If Marfrig's acquisition of 50  of BRF materializes, it could positively impact BRF's share price due to increased buying pressure. However, for Marfrig, there might be investor concerns about financial leverage.Since Marfrig began increasing its position in BRF in early September, BRF's shares have exhibited a strong positive response, helping to recover from their underperformance throughout the year partially. In contrast, Marfrig shares have moved in the opposite direction.Despite its substantial and challenging debt position, BRF continues to generate cash and is poised to benefit in the coming quarters as the commodities cycle improves, further facilitating the company's ongoing deleveraging efforts.Due to the complexity of estimating an implied share price for a food processing company that involves high capital expenditures, experiences seasonal cash flow patterns, relies on the commodity price cycle, and also maintains a significantly higher level of debt compared to its equity, I believe that analyzing BRF in comparison to its peers provides a relative assessment of its value.As we can observe, BRF has a higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio than its Brazilian peers, such as JBS, which is its primary competitor to Sadia and Perdigão through its Seara brand. It also competes with Minerva, which, despite its primary focus on beef, offers a competitive line of processed products in the domestic market. Additionally, BRF maintains a lower current ratio than its peers, indicating a reduced ability to meet its short-term obligations with its current assets.Given the nature of the meat production and processing industry, I believe the P CF  Price Cash Flow  metric is suitable for making peer comparisons.When we examine valuation multiples, we find that BRF is currently trading at a P CF ratio of 4.35x, representing a premium compared to JBS and Minerva. Considering that BRF carries a higher level of leverage and greater liquidity risk, it is unclear why the stock trades at a premium rather than a discount.The fact that corn prices are currently at their lowest levels in the last three years and soybean prices in the previous two years should support an improvement in BRF's operational margins, particularly in the second half of this year. Additionally, the company appears to be on track with its deleveraging efforts.These favorable conditions could make it an opportune time to consider investing in BRF shares. However, it's worth noting that the company's shares have seemingly already reflected this trend, and their recent boost following the news of Marfrig's increased stake in the company has led to a valuation that I view as a hindrance to investing in BRF.Therefore, I would only consider adopting a bullish stance on BRF if the company traded at a discount in its P CF multiple relative to its peers.Alternatively, I may favor considering other companies in the same sector facing similar challenges but offering a more attractive valuation.
