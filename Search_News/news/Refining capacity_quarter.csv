Chevron Is Better Than Cenovus,"I had to stretch to rate Cenovus  a  Hold  in my last Seeking Alpha article  see . But I shouldn't have  I should have gone with what IThe investment thesis for the oil sands producers is relatively simple and straightforward  Before the era of shale oil  i.e., light-sweet crude , U.S. refiners assumed that they would be heavily dependent on heavy crude imports from Venezuela and OPEC for many years into the future in order to meet domestic demand for gasoline, diesel, and distillates. As a result, they reconfigured their refineries to run a larger slate of heavy crude. That slate included Canadian oil sands crude, which were effectively landlocked with pretty much all export capacity going south to its energy-hungry neighbor, the US. Indeed, Phillips 66  imports more Canadian oil sands crude than any other company and, as a result, has a generally higher distillates yield vs. its peers.Today, of course, growing U.S. shale production has overwhelmed domestic light-sweet refining capacity and pretty much all the incremental production increases of shale are now being exported. Indeed, according to RBN Energy  see , U.S. crude oil exports are currently running at  4 million bpd with the vast majority being shale barrels and a relatively small percentage originating from Canada in the form of WCSThis is that many  analysts  - and especially politicians on the right - don't understand when they say  America is no longer energy independent.  They point to U.S. foreign oil imports and somehow reach the conclusion that  America is not energy independent  when just the opposite is true  America is the largest oil producer on the planet, became the No. 1 LNG exporter on the planet last year, and is the No. 1 overall petroleum producer in the world. What these politicians and analysts don't seem to understand is that the American refining industry is all about efficiencies and optimizing your feedstock to run as profitably as possible given the configuration of your refinery.So, Canada has a ready market for a large portion of its heavy crude production, and any leftover can potentially be exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast, as most all of it shown in the graphic above  in pink  was. However, U.S. refiners pretty much have all they want and need. So it's not a big growth market. For growth, the oil sands producers - including Cenovus - have put all their organic production growth hopes in the Trans Mountain pipeline, which last I knew is scheduled to go online early next year with an extra 590,000 bpd of badly needed  and long overdue  oil sands exit capacity  see .Meantime, Cenovus' best asset might well be the WRB 50-50 refining joint venture it has with Phillips 66.  WRB  stands for Wood River Borger, two refineries that are owned and operated by Phillips 66. The distributions from this partnership are likely what kept Cenovus out of bankruptcy back when the oil sands glut in western Canada had the CEO - the one they hired after the one they fired  for making the big oil sands acquisition from ConocoPhillips  - running to the government for production cut mandates. In retrospect, it's quite humorous to consider what a novel idea that was  A CEO of a North American energy company asking the government for a production  mandate. Regardless, the point is - as I have been saying on Seeking Alpha for years - the best way to play the oil sands is not through the oil sands producers  It's through the refinersFrom a big picture perspective, the slide below from Cenovus'  summarizes the company's assetsAs you can see from the graphic, Cenovus is very much an oil sands centric producer  76  of production  and has upgrading  i.e., to WCS  and refining capacity that's roughly in line with its production  248,000 bpd with WRB alone . The company has a very large oil sands 3P asset base  i.e., bitumen  with a reserves' life of three-plus decades.Chevron, on the other hand, has a global asset base that's much more diversified and includes excellent exposure to the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the global LNG markets via Australia  Gorgon and Wheatstone  and Angola, a growing and impressive footprint in the Eastern Mediterranean natural gas market, and . In Q3 Chevron pumped  from the Permian Basin alone. That was up 11  year-over-year and was almost as much as Cenovus' total production. Chevron plans to ramp Permian production to over 1 million bpd by 2025 and keep it there for at least a decade.Chevron also has 1.7 million bbls of refining capacity  primarily in the U.S. and Asia  and a strong presence in the global chemicals market via its 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, which is called CPChem, i.e., the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.The following chart summarizes the free-cash-flow profiles of the two companies over the first six months of 2023Clearly this is a short-term comparison, and free cash flow can be greatly impacted by a variety of factors from quarter to quarter. However, in general, what you see above is a major reason why Chevron has greatly outperformed Cenovus over the past decade  It's a much more efficient and profitable company with, in my opinion, a superior asset base.And this is why Chevron has delivered much better dividend growth as well. The chart below shows the 10-year track record of Chevron vs. CenovusAs you can see in the chart, Chevron's quarterly grew by  50  over the past decade to the current  6.04 share on an annual basis. On the other hand, Cenovus' quarterly dividend actually declined by 41  over the past 10 years and the current payout is only  0.56 share annually. Indeed, during 2020, Cenovus suspended its dividend completely  i.e.,  0.00  for three quarters in a row.From a debt perspective, to my knowledge no leading O G company has a better balance sheet than Chevron  if you think one does, please let me know . CVX ended Q2 with  9.6 billion in cash, long-term debt of , and a net debt to equity ratio of only 7 .Cenovus had  1.6 billion in cash at the end of Q2 and long-term debt of . With a recent ratings upgrade, Cenovus is rated  by Fitch. Chevron has an .Being an oil sands producer that is still dependent on the U.S. export market, and the fact that Cenovus is competing with other big oil sands producers  i.e., Suncor  Suncor Energy Inc. , Imperial Oil , Canadian Natural Resources , etc.  for pipeline exit capacity to reach that market, the discount of WCS  Western Canadian Select  to WTI is important. And, as we have seen in the past, the WCS-to-WTI discount can swing wildly. Indeed, sometimes the price of WCS can reach near  0 during glutsCurrently, the discount is   WTI 79.20 bbl, WCS 62.14 bbl . As they say,  all barrels are not created equal.Lastly, what would you rather own in the era of ESG and global warming  Oil sands assets like Cenovus, or a company like Chevron that produces a ton of light-sweet crude and cleaner burning  natural gas  LNGChevron has a superior and diversified global asset production portfolio as compared to Cenovus, which is still a primarily and oil sands producer. That said, Cenovus has expanded its refining capacity which today roughly equals its total production. Still, Chevron is a much more efficient company with a higher free cash flow margin and a much better long-term track record of delivering dividend growth. That being the case, any investor thinking of buying Cenovus stock should consider buying Chevron instead. And any investor that holds Cenovus in a qualified retirement account  i.e., won't face any tax-selling consequences  should sell CVE and put the proceeds into Chevron.I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart of the major oil sands producers as compared to some major shale oil producers and the S P 500. As you can see, Cenovus - along with peer Suncor - is at the very bottom. Shale oil producers like EOG, COP, and CVX significantly outperformed the oil sands producers  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Valero Energy: A Solid Q3 With A Powerful Buyback In Place,"Shares of Valero  have essentially tread water over the past year, lagging the broader market gain. After reporting Q3 results on Thursday, shares fell about 1 , in what has been a down day for the overall market. WithIn the company s , Valero earned  7.49, which beat  by  0.17. The first thing to highlight is that net income fell from  2.8 to  2.6 billion but EPS rose by  0.30 from  7.19. That is the power of the company s capital return policy. With earnings particularly high, VLO has been aggressively buying back stock. It returned  2.2 billion to shareholders last quarter with a  360 million quarterly dividend and the balanceOver time, VLO targets a capital return policy of 40-50  of operating cash flow. Last quarter though, it returned 60  of operating cash flow to investors. This is not because cash flow has fallen to a troubling degree, rather cash margins have been so strong that VLO has been generating excess cash well beyond its investment needs, which it then is returning. That 40-50  is intended to be a cycle average. However, the dramatic share count reduction will mean EPS will outperform net income as we saw last quarter. Since 2012, VLO has bought back nearly 40  of the company.Looking at Q3 results, refining operating income was down  400 million to  3.4 billion. Its refineries ran at a solid 95  utilization, even with some maintenance work. With that work complete, management is expecting to run at a 96.5  utilization rate in Q4 as product demand has stayed strong with diesel inventories being relatively tight still. With investments to modernize refineries over the past ten years, VLO has been able to increase utilization and lower operating costs, leaving it with a cost advantaged system and boosting margins.Valero earned a margin per barrel of oil of  19.47 from  21.43 last year. On a percentage basis, refining margins actually expanded to 9.4  from 9  as crude oil prices were lower, but that decline in dollar margin per barrel is what caused earnings from this unit to fall from last year. We will discuss refinery margins further in a moment.Briefly though, VLO has two smaller units. Its renewable diesel unit generated operating income of  123 million from  212 million last year. While sales were up a third as expansion projects came online, diesel margins compressed from last year. While still healthy, diesel markets were extremely tight last year as Europe scrambled for fuel after turning away from Russian oil. This unit is operating at more of a normal level now.On the other side, ethanal operating income rose to  197 million from  1 million last year, with production up over 20 . Corn prices are lower than a year ago, outpacing the decline in crude oil, which has helped to widen margins. While these renewable energy businesses provide some earnings, 90-95  of Valero s results come from its core refining business. Refining margins, more so than renewable diesel or ethanol, are what will drive the stock.It has been a bull market for refining since shortly after COVID. 3 2 1 spreads, which measure how much refiners get for their refined products  gasoline, diesel  relative to the crude oil input soared. This is why Valero s profits surged and it has been able to buy back so much stock. Now, these margins have been to normalize. A reason VLO trades at such a low multiple is markets are viewing some of its  20 barrel margin as a one-time windfall rather than a recurring source of income. The one-time windfall is definitely good for shareholders, but VLO will never get a 15x multiple on peak earnings.A question then is where do margins go over time  in other words, what is Valero s true run-rate earnings power. At the current share count and with its  23  tax rate, if we cut Valero s refining margins in half, it would have run-rate earnings of  3.75 share or about  14-15 year. That would leave the stock with just an  8.5x multiple. Right now, per the analyst consensus, earnings are  to decline to  15.51 next year. Given the share count will continue to fall next year, the consensus is essentially in-line with a halving of refining margins.In , VLO was earning  9.65 a barrel, and in 2018, it earned  10.32 a barrel. So this halving would be in-line with the pre-COVID norm, which was a good but not record setting environment for refiners. I see the risks skewed to the future being a bit brighter than this on average, for the simple reason that the world does not have much refining capacity. As you can see below, after rising steadily in the 2000s, refining capacity growth has really slowed down. There has essentially been no new refining capacity over the past four years. Oil demand is still rising though given ongoing economic growth and development in emerging markets. This increasingly means refining, even more so than production, is the bottleneck in the supply chain. That should mean wider margins on average.This is particularly true in the US. As some smaller refineries have shuttered, our refining capacity is down about 6  from pre-COVID levels. While these markets are global to a large extent, there is shipping cost, so local market dynamics do matter. The relative underperformance of US refining capacity to global capacity is likely to further insulate US refining margins, all else equal.Now, as economics 101 student can tell you, the reason bottlenecked, or supply-constrained, markets have wider margins is to encourage investment and the development of new supply to meet the demand. The last significant refinery in the US was built in the , though. Given the regulatory environment and the fact a brand-new refinery could cost well in excess of  8 billion, it simply is not feasible to build one. Indeed, the cost could be even greater with Mexico s plans to build a refinery potentially spiraling to . Western governments are also focused on investing in renewable energy not supporting increased supply of crude oil refining capacity. There is no investment supply-side reaction function to wide refining spreads given this backdrop.This has left existing refinery owners in a strong position to enjoy wider margins. Indeed, we can see the lack of interest in investing in Valero s financials. Last quarter, it spent  303 million of sustaining cap-ex and just  91 million on growth spending, mostly in its smaller renewables businesses. Barring something truly unforeseen, the US has as many refineries today as it ever will. The same is likely true of Europe. As such, it will be difficult for global refining capacity to match, let alone exceed, underlying product demand. That means margins will be structurally wider, maybe not as wide as today, but wider than 2018 2019 on average.I would write that Valero has 14 refineries and will never grow beyond that. However, while that is true in terms of its not organically building more, there is the possibility of M A. Finally, the Citgo  is starting and expected to last until next summer, though there is likely to be further legal arguments over it, which could end the auctions altogether. I could see Valero bidding for some of Citgo s assets which are quality refineries able to process cheap, heavy crude. Whether Citgo will be sold and to what parties is impossible to know, but if Valero does win, that would likely cause a temporary slowing in its buybacks to fund the purchases. If Citgo is sold, I expect different firms would buy different assets, limiting VLO s potential purchase to a manageable  5-8 billion.Overall, I view  15-17 as a reasonable estimate for VLO s earnings power the next year given a likely 5  share count reduction and where refining spreads are. However at 8.5x earnings, markets seem to be discounting that even this lessened margin is unsustainably high. Given the reasons discussed, that is where I disagree. I see run-rate earnings holding at least at the  15 level. It is a low margin, capital intensive business but I believe 10x run-rate earnings is reasonable, pointing to a fair price of  150. That is 20  of upside.I believe investors should begin accumulating VLO stock. In the meantime as it trades below its fair value, that just means the buyback reduces the share count even more quickly, further increasing run-rate earnings power and long-term value for shareholders. Refining is a supply constrained business, and it is likely to remain so. That is good news for Valero and its shareholders.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Wayne Gretzky Investing: Modeling Calumet Specialty Products,"Wayne Gretzky ,  I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.  Understanding  the where  isn't simple nor perfect, such that investors might view this as art rather than science. Our focus using CalumetOn the surface, Calumet's June quarter disappointed until discovery opened the internals defining the puck's direction.  summarizing the results.Again, at first glance, disapointments abounded with low Specialty and the extremely low MRL results. Digging deeper, the weather around Shreveport forced a plant shutdown again resulting in a loss of profit equaling  20 million, the difference plus the actual equaling our prior estimate. Management wisely decided to manage through an unscheduled turnaround with an unexpected outage, eliminating a future oneAn ultra disappointment came also with MRL generating a smidgen of profit. More very relevant details follow later in the article. So, let's head onto the ice for close up viewing beginning with this next table on interest and debt. Notes associated with Specialty   Performance Only .  MRL carries approximately  550 million debt which we discuss later. Management has stated that it plans to delever by  400- 500 million from cash flows or otherwise. We estimate all refinances at 9.5 .The puck on these two important factors slides smoothly toward another goal.The next table summarizes . Half of the capital has been spent.The long-term capital expenses stated by management equals approximately  60 million, but additional opportunities exists with returns of greater than 20 . We aren't totally confident of the actual capital expenses past 2024 except that it won't exceed  60 million without the operational cash generation to support it.This completes the expenditure pucks. Now lets head to revenue.Several factors influence performance including demand within the economy and refining capacity. With economies forever cycling, our focus targets capacity.The performance for specialty relies heavily upon crack spreads in particular the Gulf Coast 2-1-1. American refining capacity plus demand influences this factor immensely, which now  barrels per day. It has dropped from near 19 million in 2020. An increase of 250K per day is expected during 2023. The EIA continues  or effectively full-capacity maintaining upward price pressures. This was true even in the lower usage non-summer periods. Without plans for significant capacity increases, crack spreads can be expected to continue higher. The EIA also forecasts  with fossil sources still growing modestly. We don't expect any major shift downward in crack spreads under normal economic conditions.Our table outlining performance follows. Specialty suffered from several weather related events which materially lowered recent results in the  20- 30 million per quarter range. Used our formula with the September and June quarters as the base plus the adjustment stated in a previous article,  Again, in our ,  we noted that every  10 increase in GC 2-1-1 spreads adds approximately  30 million of EBITDA per quarter. Average results for  and  quarters. Crack spread were  50 in June and  40 in September. Performance Brands results suffered miserably from critical feed stock availability plus weather outage issues. Results prior to the March 2023 quarter aren't reflective of the business. Includes a one time insurance payment of  5 million.The Specialty puck might range in the  80- 110 million range long-term with the existence of this constant market-place pricing pressure. Performance Brands appears poised for growth, significant growth into the  20 million per quarter region.A final remark from management concerning specialty,  We try to stay out of the commoditized markets and focus more on the high-value applications, Group 1, Group 2.  This is a critical note in understanding where the puck is headed in that this practice adds to profitability stability.Now, next, MRL positioning is addressed. Thus far, the Great Falls performance for both the older refining business plus the new renewables has been reported together. The results for June were surprising low until a detailed look revealed the true story. We begin with the June results equaling  13 million. A table showing the critical parameters follows. Feed times 91 days times margins times 0.70. WCS plus GC 2-1-1 taken from our own data. Our guess. Management reported this average feed rate. Back calculated from the data given and the asphalt assumption. The feed stock was a mixture of treated, very expensive, and untreated. Back calculated margin equaled  1 plus the difference between treated, last quarters primary feed and untreated of  1.The state of the business at quarters end can be summed with Also, from the ,At the mid-point using the above statement, MRL generates  65M per quarter in EBITDA. By another calculation presented in the above table, MRL clips along at approximately a  70M per quarter rate. We summarize September with a little more detail in the next table. With 2 3s of the feed untreated at the quarters beginning, we used  1.6 for the average margin. This number is likely low.In addition, the Great Falls fossil portion at 12,500 b d feed rate and  50 crack spreads likely generated  20- 30M, asphalt revenue being unknown, but guessed at  10- 20M.The puck is still moving. The company continues an evaluation for MaxSAF refining. From the June quarter remarks,  W e believe that with MaxSAF, we can more than double our current EBITDA run rate in 2025.  And work is progressing on using a natural cover crop, Camelina oil. Management noted,With respect to MRL, the quarterly EBITDA is likely to range from  65M to  140M depending on the final decision for SAF.A question still remains, how are investors going to reap lucrative returns  The only hint we have is that the company noted its desire to begin an IPO approach in the early part of 2024.Let's relationize the pucks in whole. A summary follows with totals from the 2026 location.The capital expenses for next year equals approximately  140M. Debt repayment equals  500M for the older Calumet business and  500M- 700M for MRL depending on whether the MaxSAF project moves forward.Yearly, cash flow from businesses equals approximately  100M per quarter into 2026. Yes, all of this changes if or when an MRL IPO occurs, but until then, Calumet could pay off debt for each entity after 2024, MRL or Specialty, in approximately one year, for each. After 2025, the net cash flow per quarter could increase to  200M or  800M per year. This is where the puck is headed and the coach pulled the goalie. With approximately 80 million units issued, a  10 per unit yearly result is possible.Successful investing requires an accurate vision of the future followed by a comparison of the market's vision at today. The question, is or does the market have the price mismatched. In our view, with Calumet, it has. A unit earning  10 yr. is totally and completely mismatched at the recent prices of  17, completely.Yes, risks exist. Over the past few years, the company experience three major storms which materially affected results. Also, another lockdown might occur for a quarter or so, drastically lowering sales. But, in our view, this compelling mismatch continues with a strong buy. In essence, this look at Calumet skates us into greater understanding. This approach offers meaning far past Calumet. Each winner we have held was determined by following this pattern. We haven't been always correct having had to bail a few times with significant losses. Yes, we missed  But the results from the winners has been a several orders of magnitude higher than the losses. We, again, rate Calumet a strong buy without apologizing.  It is our 2nd largest position. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,"  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of one-time expenditures.  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins. Therefore, there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business. That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders. Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard. Therefore, the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies. This should be expected when there is no formal standard. That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an  apples to apples  comparison.Obviously, the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made. But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown above.Rising prices of commodities should help that forward progress. But so will the transition of cash-using assets to cash generating assets.Longer term, the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company. That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products. Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances, this demands a flexible manufacturing process.The  be thought of as a starting point. The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitability.The main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity. Some products like asphalt, could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted product.Others, like gasoline, can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that  holds up better  during times of weak commodity prices  during a cyclical business downturn cycle .This process will likely take years  rather than happen overnight . That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions. Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time, this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happening.The other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production. This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary. Sometimes, the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required. Therefore, using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply source.Long term, there is still a very clear need for more refining capacity.As can be seen above, there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production. Clearly, management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing, or they would not produce it in the first place.But long-term, enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities. Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities. But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organization.While the company has made considerable progress, there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits process.In addition to the previous discussion, management plans to grow upstream production. While that makes downstream production expansion capabilities a priority as well, it does mean that this management has a full plate of future growth projects  on the table.An integrated company often means that growth in place often implies growth elsewhere to optimize profits.What this appears to point towards is high single-digit growth rates for the company well into the future. Now that the company is far larger than it was when I first initiated coverage, the initial frantic growth rate will give way to a growth and income strategy for the foreseeable future.That means total annual returns from growth will likely decline. But the increased safety of an enhanced downstream division will remove some of the corresponding risk to achieve what management likely believes is an acceptable proposition to Mr. Market.There are other possibilities in the offshore and overseas business. But probably the most attractive idea is for the unconventional business  or conventional depending upon the area  to find condensate that can be used by the company to make the oil produced flow through the pipelines. If this happens and is successful, then it would eliminate a major purchase from outside suppliers.Management has at times mentioned the need for condensate and wants to explore the acquired acreage for more products than the current natural gas production. But there is no guarantee of success. The speculative upside for shareholders would be company supplied condensate as a major cost reduction.Cenovus Energy Inc. management has done very well, as quarterly cash flow is up something like 16 to 32 times  depending upon commodity prices for the quarter  since I began coverage of this company about 5 years ago. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done.There is also a potential foray into the Chemicals business that many diversified giants have.The very low stock price valuation protects against the threat of downside principal loss over the long term. It should be noted that Mr. Market really has yet to give the company any credit for the larger downstream operation. This company is a strong buy consideration because the upside potential from all those acquisitions far exceeds any downside potential at the current price.As long as Cenovus Energy Inc. grows, I intend to hold the stock until the story changes materially. However, the volatile trading price does allow for a lot of trading opportunities along the way. So, there are likely to be a lot of ways to make money. With the currently low market valuation, the odds are in your favor.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Exxon Mobil: It Is Only Another Billion,"There has long been an argument that   is large enough that  a billion here and a billion there  is not significant. So many just did not  of theNow admittedly, one cannot tell whether each discovery that is commercial will need an FPSO or whether they will need to combine a few discoveries to justify an FPSO. has probably a  line of sight  to spend at least  100 billion of partnership money as shown above. The fact that they are going for still more expenditures demonstrates the optimism of the future production of what is quickly turning into the largest basin find in modern times.While it can be argued that current progress is too slow to be meaningful to a company like Exxon Mobil, I would argue that anyone putting the kind of money down now and lining up the commitment shown above, is going to sooner, rather than later, have a material addition to current production.Management already has four FPSOs approved as shown above and the partnership has a reasonable way to get to 6 more FPSOs. Clearly, if the company has plans for the partnership to continue to explore, then the likelihood of still more FPSOs in the  certain  future is going to be climbing.Investors need to remember that the partnership retains something like 5 million acres after the  giveback  to Guyana.  has been delayed one year, it will still happen. This is still a whole lot more acreage than many basins make available for bids at any given time. What you are likely seeing is the operator trying to convert as many acres as possible to producing and therefore not subject to future givebacks. But that is a pretty standard race against time that I have reported on many times over the years.The other thing to consider here is that Exxon Mobil is getting a lot of attention for just one of the blocks held in Guyana and really no attention at all for any holdings in Suriname. Yet all of this provides still more upside potential if a commercial discovery is determined to justify producing.One of the things that Hess Corporation  management has mentioned several times is how Exxon Mobil manages an FPSO through the approval process while another FPSO is in the development or building phase, and still another one in the hookup and initial production phase. With all the holdings in the area, that scenario could eventually multiply several times over depending upon which partnership and lease holdings have commercial discoveries.Point Thompson is one of  that is producing liquids up in Alaska. This project is also one of the largest natural gas fields in North America. There has been talk about finding ways to export this gas to markets to take advantage of what is anticipated to be a strong natural gas market. However, so far anything solid has not yet really emerged. Still, with liquids production already in place, it would be probably economically attractive to at some point produce the gas for use elsewhere. This would likely be a long-term speculative upside potential project at this time.Production growth has been rather robust for a company of this size. There were some one-time items that hid the progress. But sooner or later the growth will show through. is already heading towards 10 . Now taking into account the one-time items volume was actually below the previous quarter  sequentially speaking . Even though volume was down sequentially, the volume reported was still very strong compared to the year before. Management has still more projects that will accelerate the growth rate besides Guyana.There is a robust production growth guidance for the Permian operations and additional refining capacity was built to handle that volume. The company earnings will not only benefit from the additional production but also should benefit from the refining upgrade to more valuable products.This pattern points to a likely future scenario for Guyana. Right now, the Guyana partnership produces oil. But there certainly would be a market for refined products should the company follow its usual pattern of adding the capability to produce value added products from the production.This is just a summary of the major 2023 projects that will begin to add to cash flow in the near future.The  are the result of billions in expenditures over a multi-year budget. But they are all scheduled to start up and contribute to cash flow either this fiscal year or not long after this fiscal year.Since , Exxon Mobil announced the acquisition of Denbury Inc. . This acquisition will add yet another major project to the group shown above.Management has more of these projects underway and still more in the planning stage. Some like Point Thompson are more likely in the talking or wishing stage.But the key is that this company is now on a growth trajectory. For a long-time, this company  tread water  and the stock price largely reflected that. Now, clearly that is changing to a growth trajectory.That means that future dividend increases are likely to be larger than what has happened in the past. It takes time to transition to a new growth strategy  and money . So, dividend increases are currently lagging behind the profitability progress. But in the long run, dividend increases will catch up the pace of corporate growth.The result of all of this is that Exxon Mobil is slowly turning into a growth and income play. For the last decade or so, it was primarily an income play with growth as an afterthought. As the growth part increases in importance, the company is likely to receive a higher valuation in the market long-term to recognize that growth.Even without that consideration, the oil and gas industry is historically cheap and relatively out-of-favor. Just returning to some normal valuations should result in some decent appreciation pretty much across the board. Any premium growth projects would add to that. As a result, Exxon Mobil remains a strong buy consideration for those looking for a growth and income vehicle.The oil and gas industry has cycles. But this company is safe enough to hold through those cycles. That appeals to a lot of risk averse investors.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience. He has been focusing on this industry for years. He is a retired CPA, and holds an MBA and MA.

"YPF Sociedad Anónima: A Speculative Trend Play With Record Profits, Low Multiples, And Deleveraging","YPF Sociedad Anónima  NYSE is an energy company that mostly operates in Argentina, deriving the bulk of its revenues  66  in FY2022  from sales of fuels and natural gas. As its  filing explainsIn addition to its operations in Argentina, YPF also sells lubricants and oil derivatives in Chile and Brazil.Revenue  LTM  has been in an uptrend since Q1-2021 and has more than doubled since, now at a post-2014 record of  9.23b, according to . The firm s EBIT  LTM  is close to a record level, a significant recovery from its Q4-2019 - Q1-2021 rough patch. Net income  LTM  is at a record high.YPF s net margin  LTM  is at a record high, now at 11.9 . Operating margin  LTM  is approaching record levels. Its operating cash flow margin  LTM  is fairly healthy, hovering around 30  since Q3-2020, however that margin has been slightly downtrending since its earlier peak in Q3-2019.YPF has been deleveraging. Its net debt  quarterly  peaked in Q4-2018 and has fallen 36  to a level of  6.31b. Its debt equity and debt asset leverage ratios have been in downtrends since Q2-2020 and now sit at 0.7 and 29 , respectively.The company s number of book-entry shares of common stock in Q1-2023 was 393,312,793, the same as it was in Q1-2022 and Q1-2021.YPF s P S, P B, and EV EBITDA multiples are all close to record lows since 2014. For the past several quarters, P S and P B have been expanding, meaning that investor sentiment appears to have recently rebounded  investors are repricing their estimate of firm value upwards.In the recent quarter, YPF s refinery processing levels reached a 13-year record high, growing 9  YoY, per the . Management attributes this to its recent update of a topping unit at the firm s refinery in La Plata. The firm saw substantial growth in its shale oil and gas production, climbing 31  and 9  YoY, respectively. Also, the recent quarter saw domestic fuel demand rise 4  YoY.Since 51  of YPF s shares are owned by the Argentine Republic  AR , that AR determines the outcome of all decisions that are put to a shareholder vote and require a majority approval.The firm notes in its  that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected YPF s performance in the past. If the pandemic s trajectory worsens or a new health threat emerges, YPF s financial results could suffer.A large part of YPF s success depends on favorable economic conditions in Argentina, a country with a history of substantial economic volatility and debt crises such as those in 2001, 2005, 2015, and 2020. If inflation intensifies or another factor impairs the country s ability to refinance, economic growth could suffer and pull down company revenues. If Argentina has trouble meeting its future debt obligations from foreign borrowers, it may lead to retaliatory measures that could impede YPF s ability to do business in those countries.About 7   as of FY2022  of the firm s total debt is sensitive to fluctuations in bond yields. Adverse rate movements could increase the firm s debt servicing costs and lead to a drop in margins.Import and export restrictions that apply to YPF could change and become less favorable. At one time, the AR forced the firm to redirect some of its natural gas to domestic customers as opposed to export clients, resulting in customer disputes. Luckily, YPF is not currently facing restrictions on its natural gas exports  permitted under  Plan GasAr , but future restrictions are possible and could hurt its results.YPF is exposed to currency fluctuations. The recent devaluation of the Argentine peso has hurt Argentina s economy and accelerated inflation. All else equal, those factors tend to increase key costs like wages and materials and pull down customer demand.Finally, the AR government has outstanding claims which are before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  ICSID . The outcome of those claims may be unfavorable to the AR and impede economic growth.Buying a stock is a bet on where its price goes, not necessarily the fundamentals of the business. Since there is statistical evidence of trends in equity markets, investors who apply a scientific mindset may benefit from focusing on companies with trending share prices.YPF s stock price broke above its 200-day trend in August 2022 and has been in an uptrend since, rising more than 200  since that time, per .Zooming out, the stock is 46  below its peak in 2017 and 62  its peak in 2014, indicating significant potential upside if mean reversion takes effect.Note that YPF s website states it reports Q2-2023 earnings on August 11. Investors could consider holding the share into earnings and betting on a favorable quarter and market reaction, or they could consider waiting to see what price action looks like afterwards. The latter approach might be more suitable for investors who want to avoid gap risk.YPF s record margins, depressed valuation multiples, recent deleveraging, and trending share price make it an interesting opportunity for investors. While its share price continues to trend, the stock could be a reasonable bet for investors with a momentum-inspired strategy to consider.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks  Archer-Daniels-Midland . The company, which just reported its quarterly numbers, is doing extremely well. It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds, including strong secular growth in biofuels.In thisSo, let's get to itRoughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I highlighted the company's massive footprint in the agriculture industry.Listed in 1924, the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42,000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations, allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview, the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery stores.This includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions, which account for the biggest part of the company's revenue.In the United States, Archer-Daniels-Midland is the third-largest producer of ethanol, according to .With this in mind, earlier this week, major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good position.The bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth, driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policies.As one can imagine, this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers, who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sector.As biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation, various biobased feedstocks, including agricultural crops and animal-derived products, are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and net-zero emissions by 2050.Like many people, I am not a fan of using  food  to produce fuel, but in light of global energy policies, my opinion doesn't matter.Furthermore, while corn-based ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  and Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS  in the mid-2000s, there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks, driven by the growth of renewable diesel production.Meanwhile, increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil, as well as soybean and canola oil, further used in renewable diesel.This shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023.Adding to that, the new Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  provides tax credits to the biofuels industry, extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuels.In this light, during last year's JP Morgan All-Stars Conference, the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels, with strong biodiesel margins, high demand for ethanol, and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants, which confirms the trends noticed by ING.The company also mentioned the start-up of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota, which will add 1.5 million tons of capacity, focusing on low-carbon intensity feedstocks.Furthermore, the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide low-carbon emissions power.In the third quarter, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of  1.63, accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of  1.5 billion.Notably, this quarter's results contributed to an outstanding year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of  5.62, making it the second-best EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally, ADM's trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 13.2 , which reflects the company's consistent strength in this environment.ADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market, where opportunities and challenges coexist, which makes it challenging for traders and investors.Consumer behavior trends vary across categories, impacting spending.Issues also include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and fluctuating commodity supply and demand.Despite these challenges, ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved year-to-date, with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total company.With that in mind, ADM's different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwinds.During its earnings call, the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork, which is something I already briefly mentioned.In 2023, ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network, partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable, sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo , Nestle, and Carlsberg.The company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025, equivalent to powering over 100,000 homes annually.ADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project, contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for  greener  fuels.The company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9x, which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their long-term strategic agenda and return capital to shareholders.It enjoys a credit rating of  A .ADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates full-year EPS in excess of  7 per share.Based on that context, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently pays a  0.45 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to  1.80 per year. It implies a 26  2023E earnings payout ratio, which is extremely healthy.The dividend yield is 2.5 .ADM is attractively valued. As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below, the normalized P E ratio is 14.6x, which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decades.Now, the company is trading at 9.5x earnings. That's the lowest valuation since the great financial crisis.Even if earnings moderate in the next few years  analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years , the stock is significantly undervalued.A return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18  annual returns through 2025.The current consensus price target is  97, which is 38  above the current price.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. I believe that ADM has a fair value between  100 and  110, which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four years.Archer-Daniels-Midland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector. The booming biofuel industry, supported by evolving government policies, presents a significant growth opportunity for ADM.Their diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sources.ADM's strong financial performance, improved earnings outlook, and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment. With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation, ADM could offer investors an 18  annual return through 2025.Hence, I maintain my belief in ADM's fair value between  100 and  110, which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four years.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

My Portfolio Q3 2023 Results: Cautiously Positioned Heading Into Q4,"In Q3 I returned  versus  for the S P 500 . In 2023, I've returned  versus  for the index. I've gone from a fairly large underperformance to a sizable outperformance.My performance inWith the benefit of hindsight, I closed this too early, selling in late July for  47.50. But, I used the proceeds to buy more Cenovus at  18.8, so it's been a wash.I'm bearish on refiners right now. Gulf CoastAdd to this any risk of a global slowdown and further demand destruction via EVs, and I'm happy to take the win here and move on. I'm more bullish on integrated producers or pure E P's here.This was a miss and with the benefit of hindsight, a reactionary sell.I sold out around  9.3, which was my cost basis. I still like the story here, but my disappointment in the Q2 results, coupled with how overweight energy I already am made me decide to cut this position. The overarching part of my investing strategy is  don't lose money  and I have less conviction in Genesis now than I did previously.Still holding the most cash I ever have held, while opportunistically deploying it for trades. I still believe this is a time to be defensive.Still holding my position in Cenovus, and remain bullish on the company long term. Cenovus returning 100  of capital in dividends and repurchases is getting closer.I'm considering selling calls against this position. Above  20, I think Cenovus management opts for more dividends over repurchases, and the premiums on the call options look enticing.I added a small amount of common units in the low  12's, and added more of the Series E  under  23 back in Q2.I still believe Energy Transfer offers a lot of value, but we may start hitting some near-term resistance after such a strong run. I think the common units are worth between  18- 20 and the prefs offer a lot of value for floating rate securities. The Series E prefs start trading at LIBOR   5.161  starting in May  nearly 11Berkshire Hathaway   remains an anchor in my portfolio, though its valuation is certainly on the  high end  of fair. After repurchasing the Jan24  350 call at a 20  profit, I recently sold a Jan24  380 call with the stock at  365.This was a 12  position up until a few days ago. I said it was  at  33.50, and when shares hit  43.50 late last week, I decided to ring the cash register on the 30  gain in two months.Still have a significant position that I don't plan on selling.Still patiently waiting for the  to close. FCF will inflect when it does.I still hold a small JPMorgan Chase  position from my original  90 purchase price. I'm considering selling this. I don't love buying banks in general, and I'm negative on the sector. My dislike of the sector is mostly driven by spiking interest rates.That said, JPM is the best of the banks and the valuation is very reasonable.These get safer by the quarter as the company continues to redeem the privately held class D Prefs, and Nustar's common units have had a good run this year. I'll continue to hang on to these 12  floating rate prefs.In , with the S P500 above 4500, that it was a poor time to be chasing stocks, especially when you can earn 5  in Treasuries. With the S P around 4300, I still think the risk reward in stocks is poor, with the bond market flashing warning signs.We are running close to a  2 trillion dollar deficit and just ran past  33 trillion in national debt. We are adding this much to the debt during a non-recessionary period with rates resetting higher. I'm old enough to remember when the  National Debt  was a big concern for far more people than it is today, and it's a far bigger problem today than it was back then.This gets solved through a combination of 3 thingsThey are all major negatives for the economy and US stocks. I'd be wary of owning anything that has a reliance on the government as a major customer. I know that trying to time things like this are difficult, but I'm also reminded of 2008 when the bond market started flashing warning signs far before the stock market.I don't know what's going to happen, but everything I see makes me think that Capital Preservation is the name of the game right now. I'll continue to look for trading opportunities, but otherwise, I remain defensive.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Magellan Midstream: Overvalued, But Hold For Solid Dividend Yield","Magellan Midstream Partners  deals in crude oil and refined petroleum products. The company has a remarkable history of consistent dividend payouts which makes it an attractive stock to hold in a portfolio to reduce theMMP is a partnership firm that mainly engages in the storage, transportation, and distribution of crude oil   refined petroleum products in Tulsa, Okla. The company conducts its business in two operating segments  . The Refined Products segment consists of a pipeline system of around 9,800-mile refined petroleum products including 54 terminals and 2 marine storage terminals. This pipeline covers a 15-state area starting from the Texas Gulf Coast and also linked with other interstate pipelinesMMP has recently reported its financial results for the . The company reported revenue of  877.2 million which is increase of 11.23  from  788.6 million in Q2FY22. This growth was mainly fueled by a decent increase in both transportation and product sales revenues. Refined Products segment revenues surged by 11.65  and Crude Oil segment revenues declined by 5.02  compared to the previous year's same period. MMP reported net income of  238.7 million which is dramatic decrease of 32.55  compared to  353.9 million in the Q2FY22. Decreased net income resulted in diluted net income per share of  1.18 compared to  1.67 in the same quarter of the previous year. It reported distributable cash flows of  312 million, up 36.84  compared to  228 million in Q2FY22. Free cash flows stood at  271 million. The firm reported cash and cash equivalents of  128.4 million.The energy industry experienced a significant downturn during the pandemic and the growth was later hampered by the supply chain obstacles arising from the geo-political issues of Russia and Ukraine. However, it is observed that the industry is rebounding significantly and experiencing rapid growth in demand. estimates for 2023 and 2024 have been raised by 130 kb d and 90 kb d, respectively, to 82.5 mb d and 83.5 mb d which reflects a positive growth factor for the participants operating in this industry. Identifying these growth opportunities, the company is highly focused on expanding its refined products pipeline which can significantly help it to cater to the rapidly growing demand and capture the additional market share by expanding its profit margins. The company is working extensively to complete the 30,000 barrel-per-day expansion of its refined products pipeline to El Paso, Texas. The new 16-inch, 30-mile pipe between Odessa and Crane, Texas, has been completed, with enhanced operational storage to meet incremental shipments presently under construction. I think that this development can considerably assist the firm in establishing a strong position in a competitive market and increasing its access to the country's refining capacity. I believe these expansions can potentially help the company to increase its cash flows and further increase its dividend payout. The company's future growth may be anticipated to be stable due to favorable industry trends and its expansion plans. It has also provided its guidance for the third quarter and FY23, which represents an optimistic outlook for the company's growth. It forecasts the annual EPS to be around  5.05. In addition, it projects the third quarter can be  1.15 per share. Distributable cash flow is estimated to reach  1.26 billion in the current fiscal year. I think the company's estimates are correct looking at the current growth factors.The firm has experienced 21 years of continuous dividend growth which indicates its healthy market position. The company paid a cash dividend of  1.0375 in each of the first three quarters of 2022 and  1.0475 in the fourth, which accounted for a total annual payout of  4.16 per share and a dividend yield of 6.48 . It distributed a  1.0475 dividend in each of the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, and given the company's strong cash positions and growth prospects, I believe it can maintain its quarterly dividend of  1.0475 in the last quarter as well, representing a high dividend yield of 6.53 . I think this attractive dividend can help investors to mitigate the risk arising from recessionary pressures.The company highly depends on refineries, gathering systems, and petroleum pipelines owned by third parties to supply its assets. If the quantity or quality of this crude oil production changes or if there are any disruptions in the throughput on these pipelines and gathering systems due to reasons such as line repair, testing, competitive forces, and other weather-related causes, it can negatively affect the company's operations and reduce its shipments. These disruptions might also limit its cash flows by further contracting its profit margins.The demand has rebounded in the industry in the current year and I believe the company is also well-position to cater to the growing demand as it is constantly focused on expanding its pipeline system. After considering all the above factors, I am estimating EPS of  5.07 for FY2023 which gives the forward P E ratio of 12.64x  share price   64.10 . After comparing the forward P E ratio of 12.64x with the sector median of 11.50x, we can say that the company is overvalued. ONEOK is planning to acquire MMP at  67.50 per unit which is a 5.3  premium compared to the current share price. However, the company's impressive dividend payout makes it an attractive opportunity for investors to protect their portfolios in these recessionary times. The company has tremendous growth potential due to favorable industry trends and its vigorous expansion activities. It is exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions which can further contract its profit margins. The stock is overvalued at the current share price, however, its attractive dividend yield makes it an attractive stock to hold in the portfolio to mitigate the recessionary impacts on the portfolio. After considering, all the above factors, I assign a hold rating to MMP.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Phillips 66: Crack Spread Decline Lowers EPS Estimate By Over Two-Thirds (Rating Downgrade),"Over the past year, I have held a bullish view of refinery stocks, specifically Phillips 66 . Refineries have outperformed the energy sector due to the rise in the price of gasoline and other refined products comparedMy  the  crack spread  will be permanently elevated compared to pre-2020 levels until gasoline is phased out of  vehicles, potentially giving Phillips 66 over a decade of significant returns. This long-term outlook is based onOf course, potential profit margins on oil refining have declined dramatically since August. Philips 66 and its peers have hardly declined in value. Thus, refinery stocks may be significantly overvalued on a short-term basis. To better determine that, we must look more closely at the core causes of the crack spread's volatility and how it may impact Phillips 66 on a short-term basis.Since 2020, oil production and refinery capacity utilization volatility have led to immense crack spread changes. The crack spread is often measured as the difference between a barrel of two-thirds RBOB gasoline plus one-third Heating Oil minus one barrel of crude oil. There are 42 gallons per barrel. To simplify, I will show both on a 1 1 basis  however, the spread between RBOB and oil is generally more critical for Phillips 66's profits than the heating oil spread. See belowThe gasoline spread is back in its 10-year average range, falling by over 50  over the past three months. Conversely, the heating oil spread, which, as a distillate, is more telling of diesel fuel, is back at its high range. Overall, the  3 2 1  crack spread, which measures both together, is down by over one-third over  the initial 2022 spike. Accordingly, aside from hedging and other sources of income, this data implies Phillip 66's EPS will soon be back near its 2021 levels.There are multiple causes for the boom and bust in the crack spread. For one, refinery capacity utilization was generally low earlier this year but strengthened dramatically over the summer, improving the gasoline supply. The manufacturing PMI has slipped over the past two years, indicating a slowdown and contraction in industrial activity. Further, refinery capacity utilization has also fallen, pointing toward a potential decline in gasoline demand. See belowNotably, the US  miles traveled is still around 2.5  below the pre-COVID peak, similar to 2018. Vehicle usage has increased throughout 2023 but remains just below pre-COVID levels, while gasoline production and products supplied are generally at 2019 levels. These data indicate a small glut may have developed in the gasoline market over the past two months.That said, total stocks of both gasoline and distillate fuels remain below average today. Total petroleum product exports are also very high, though they have declined marginally over the past two months. See belowWith fuel exports high and inventories low, there remains the significant possibility that gasoline will fall back into a shortage. The price of crude oil has also risen dramatically over the past two months due to  that market, creating higher costs for Phillips 66. The short-term outlook for the company's refining margins is bearish due to the low crack spread today. However, there have been no evident fundamental supply changes, such as  dramatically  improved refining infrastructure investments or a sharp increase in inventories that would point toward a prolonged glut. Most likely, the current small surplus is caused by a decline in gasoline demand associated with the economic trend.From a longer-term standpoint, we're also seeing a massive increase in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles. Interestingly, there is a relatively strong correlation between the sales of these types of cars and the price of gasoline. As gasoline becomes more expensive, more people buy these more efficient vehicles to save costs. See belowStrong EV sales are also promoted by a marked  19 -  vehicle prices over the past year, partly due to overproduction and growing competition. Of course, as more companies build EV infrastructure, they're becoming more competitive with conventional vehicles  which are  expensive . Additionally, battery prices are falling due to the overproduction of  which may continue over the coming years.Admittedly, the core reason for my bullish perspective on Phillips 66 has been that I do not believe EV adoption will be as quick as many investors expect. I think barriers include higher prices, technological constraints, utility infrastructure needs, and greater exposure to economic shifts  due to higher prices . That said, the fundamental trend does not support my previous outlook as improved battery prices and immense infrastructure investments are making electric vehicles more competitive, which has dramatically accelerated in 2023.The recent sharp decline in EV prices has caused some analysts to expect that  be electric by 2030. Such an outlook appeared to be extreme in the past, but given the increase in fuel prices and the decline in EV production costs, it is becoming far more reasonable. In my view, the primary remaining barrier is  infrastructure and poor investment patterns by significant utilities. Still, if that barrier is overcome, electric vehicles may be adopted accelerated, potentially limiting gasoline demand significantly. Roughly two-thirds of crude oil is used for transportation,  for some fuel products. Given that, Phillips 66 does far relatively significant long-term risk associated with a potentially complete decline in transportation gasoline demand.Around one-half to two-thirds of Phillip's  is derived from its refining segment. Other vital segments include downstream marketing and midstream transportation, which should be stable due to the current volatility in crack spreads. The overall crack spread is now back at similar levels to its 2021 and 2019 range but above its 2020 range. Between 2021 and 2019, Phillips 66 had an average  segment income of - 282M. Its refining income was over  5B annually during the first half of 2023, indicating immense exposure to changes in crack spreads.Since the company  crack spreads, I will estimate its future income using the - 282M average for 2019 and 2021, given the crack spread is now back in that range. However, I will extrapolate its income for its other segments based on their six-month profits during Q1 and Q2 of this year. Total segment profits from non-refining segments were  2.15B during the first half of 2023, giving us a  4.3B non-refining annualized profit outlook. Combined with expected losses on refining, its annual profit outlook is  4.03B. Those  each segment's interest, depreciation, and other operating and non-operating costs, excluding taxes. At a 25  tax rate, my income target for PSX is  3.02B, or  2.87B, after accounting for noncontrolling interests.With a twelve-month profit outlook of  2.87B, I expect PSX to deliver an EPS of around  6.45. This figure is well below the consensus EPS estimate from other analysts . However, most of those estimates were likely made before the very recent crack spread crash, erasing the most significant portion of Phillips 66's usual income. Of course, my method for estimating its segment income may differ from others, so there is a wide range in potential variation to its income, with  -  1B not being unreasonable. Further, based on low gasoline stocks, the crack spread could certainly rebound over the coming months should the minor glut reverse. That said, I prefer to make estimates based on current commodity prices.PSX has traded at an unreasonable low  P E  over recent years due to immense profits in its refining segment. Since the data has shifted against refining profits, its EPS will likely decline,  back to around  6.45. Before 2020, PSX traded at a  P E  of around 12.5X during most of the 2010s decade, which were more stable years for crack spreads  but not oil prices . Using my EPS target at a 12.5X valuation, I value PSX at  80 per share today, just over 25  below its current share price.As such, I am slightly bearish on the stock today but would not bet against it because the crack spread could rebound and dramatically improve its outlook. Obviously, my new target for PSX is quite bearish compared to my bullish outlook seven months ago. I continue to believe that PSX could have ample long-term upside due to a lack of total refining capacity, as previously discussed. However, as investors, we must also remember the immediate reality, which is bearish for Phillips 66 due mainly to the sharp increase in oil prices and stagnate gas prices.Further, my long-term view is based on the rate of adoption of electric vehicles. If adoption is slow, then Phillips 66 could benefit from abnormally high crack spreads as it has over recent years. However, if adoption is faster, as  to see this year, then marginally lower gasoline demand could easily cause crack spreads to become lower than usual. At this point, I will not admit that EV demand is so high that the bulk of the refining business model will soon be antiquated. However, it is admittedly more elevated than I previously assumed, mainly due to improvements in battery costs and greater EV price competition. If that pattern continues through 2024, Phillips 66 could face more significant issues as gasoline demand falters. Even then, I believe the company should have enough time to alter its investments to cater to a post-gasoline future, which could be anywhere from one to three decades away.

Marathon Petroleum: Elevated Crack Spreads And Share Repurchases Make This Attractive,"Marathon Petroleum  was started in 1887 with the combining of several smaller oil companies in the Lima, Ohio region. When the company combined, the new company was called the Ohio Oil Company and was foundedBy 1888, Standard Oil already controlled most of the Lima Oil Field and was the primary company that transported oil from the Lima Oil Fields to Chicago and other cities. In 1889, like it did with so manyFast forward to 1911, when the Standard Oil Company was broken up thanks to the anti-trust laws at the time. The separation finalized in 1913 and The Ohio Oil Company was once again an independent company.In 1930, The Ohio Oil Company acquired the Transcontinental Oil Company which had a brand name called Marathon with a slogan that stated,  The best in the long run.  The 1940s and 1950s was a very innovative time period for oil and gas companies and The Ohio Oil Company was one of the leading companies in innovation and then in 1962, the company officially changed its name to the Marathon Oil Company.Up until 2011, the Marathon Petroleum Company operated upstream assets as well as downstream assets. However, in 2011, the company chose to spin off its upstream assets into a separate company called the Marathon Oil  and became named the Marathon Petroleum Company. Therefore, Marathon Petroleum Company only consists of downstream assets such as refineries and pipelines, today.The outlook for the refining business remains very strong through 2023. In 2022, the business experienced some of the highest crack spreads in recent history. You can see below that the spreads jumped over  1.20 when historically, they hover around  .40.The EIA, for what it is worth,  that crack spreads will normalize once again over the coming years. Their forecast for after 2023 is shown after the gray dotted line. Will this happen  I would be skeptical if this can return to what it was prior to the pandemic but time will tell.Here is what crack spreads have actually done throughout 2022. Throughout 2023, crack spreads have remained elevated in the range of  .80 per gallon.The EIA forecasts that refinery utilization will remain in the 90 percent range in the future, just as it has in the past. In other words, the industry is operating at full capacity and there isn't going to be any meaningful new refining capacity coming online any time soon. In 2022, Biden approved a large export terminal for the Gulf Coast, but it doesn't appear there is new refining capacity, only the ability to .The last, large scale refinery to come online was in 1977 and was the Marathon refinery in Garyville, Louisiana. It came online with 200,000 barrels of capacity and has around 600,000 barrels per day of capacity today. Since then, no new refineries have opened that produce greater than 50,000 barrels per day. New refining capacity does not appear to be a threat to Marathon's business.Marathon's business remains strong. I would say the industry and Marathon are well-positioned for the future. Given the regulatory environment that is engulfing the oil and gas industry, it should provide large refiners like Marathon with a competitive moat for years to come.Since spinning off the Marathon Oil Company, MPC has operated with anywhere between 500 to 600 million shares outstanding. For the past two years, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. This is going to continue to be a bullish signal for Marathon. In 2019, the company had about 664 million shares outstanding. Today, the company has reduced that by over a third, down to roughly 400 million shares outstanding. They were able to reduce shares since the end of 2022 from above 500 million, to where it is today. Year-to-date, as of this writing, the company's shares are up over 30 percent.This has been a good strategy for the growth of the share price. However, with interest rates continuing to rise, I would think that capital deployed towards share repurchases becomes a much less effective use of capital and that at some point, it will become more strategic to either strengthen the balance sheet, or find stronger capital projects to invest into.That said, Marathon has a relatively strong balance sheet as most of their debt comes from their holdings of their midstream company, MPLX . They own 64 percent of the shares in MPLX.Here is Marathon's debt-to-asset ratios over the past 5 years. With some senior notes coming due in 2024 through 2026  slide above , it will present good opportunities to deleverage the balance sheet, especially if interest rates continue to rise.Here you can see that Marathon is able to operate at a 93 percent utilization rate indicating strong demand remains for refining and that Marathon is operating efficiently despite having significant maintenance downtime in the quarter. This dovetails with the industry outlook above, demonstrating that despite the regulatory monster, demand remains strong.Strong crack spreads combined with Marathon's established refining and marketing business creates a strong position for Marathon. Much of how their stock will perform will depend on crack spreads going forward, but with their midstream assets providing some level of diversification, I believe Marathon represents a good value. Crack spreads have remained elevated through 2023 so far and so it represents a risk of buying while crack spreads are high. However, they have remained elevated since 2022 and perhaps this is the  new normal  as many things have remain changed since 2021.That said, Marathon's shares have had a very good run in 2023 and it might be prudent to wait for a pull-back in the share price, or dollar-cost average.Overall, Marathon is a good way to gain access to downstream assets if you believe this is the best way to position yourself to the energy industry. However, I also prefer upstream assets   as they represent greater  in my opinion. The downstream refinery business' source of growth will be more at the mercy of crack spreads as it is difficult to bring new refining capacity online in this regulatory environment. And with a dramatic shift continuing in the transportation industry towards electric vehicles, greater refining capacity may not be an extremely prudent investment. There are a lot of variables to consider at the moment but nothing is going to change so quickly to take away Marathon's current and long-term strategic position inside the energy industry.

Exxon Mobil: Superior Asset Base And Execution To Fuel Returns Throughout The Cycle,"Looking at Exxon Mobil's financials and operations, the company is undeniably in a better spot than it was 10 years ago. Following the decline in oil prices due to US shale overproduction and especially since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent crash in oil prices, management has shifted its strategic focus away from an expansion-at-all-costs mode, to aThis shift becomes evident when looking at the proportion of CAPEX to total cash generated by operating activities  CFO . Especially the years 2013 and 2014 saw a CAPEX to CFO ratio more than 3x that of 2022 and 2023 in a comparable oil price environment. Another key point to highlight is the spike during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 which is part of management s countercyclical spending approach as despite the sharp decline in cash flow, it did not cut CAPEX to the extent that peers did. This spending was to a large degree concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico as capital spending was redirected from supporting producing assets due to low oil prices to the buildup of new assets as countless new idle wells were drilled. While presenting a risk to the company s debt position in the short run, this strategy reaped huge benefits for the Exxon Mobil as those wells could be quickly setup for full operations during the subsequent recovery and spike in oil prices with CFO growing more than more than 4x from FY20 to FY22 opposed to peer s average of 2.3x.Alongside the Permian Basin, XOM currently focuses its capital and exploration expenditures on developing its operations in the Starbroek Block off the coast of Guyana which, together with the company s assets in the Permian, yielded a combined production of c.0.9 Mboed or 24  of total as of FY22. These key strategic growth projects, which also include Exxon s LNG and Brazilian operations account for c.70  of total CAPEX and are initiated at 10  and 15  respective IRR hurdle rates at  35 bbl Brent while capital spending on other, legacy assets is largely comprised of maintenance to keep production stable with targeted divestments of high-cost projects. As part of its Q2 23 earnings call, management stated that the company s wells in the Permian and Guyana deliver 2x of unit earnings compared to divested ones, highlighting the effect this decision will have on Exxon s productions costs per barrel in the long run.With management s production targets of c.1.2 Mboed in Guyana, c.1 Mboed in the Permian and around 405 kboed of Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG   author estimated growth at 3  p.a.  as well as an assumed decline in non-strategic asset s production of c.5  CAGR over the period, I estimate Exxon s total output to grow at 4.3  CAGR to c.4.6 Mboed by FY27. Management has also included Brazil s Bacalhau field in their strategic growth projects, estimating it to add c.220 kboed, however, as Exxon has  a failure to find oil there I have excluded it from my forecasts. This shift towards higher-return and lower-cost assets which I estimate to comprise more than 50  of total production by FY27 is the first pillar of management s business plan to bring down breakeven costs to an industry-leading  30 bbl from  37 bbl as forecasted for FY23.In my opinion this will not only benefit Exxon in terms of pure costs, but also make the company more agile and flexible to react to changes in oil demand and price. Especially in the Permian, the production of these  short-cycle-barrels  can be brought up quickly in a favorable price environment and equally quickly be shut down in an unfavorable environment. Management estimates that by FY27 28  of the company s total production base will be comprised of such assets which I view as a key advantage in times where oil cycles seem to get shorter and shorter with oil trading as low as  20 bbl to as high as  120 bbl in the span of less than 3 years.As second pillar of its plan to produce oil at  30 bbl by FY27, management has also undertaken several internal initiatives to streamline the company s operations and help reduce overhead and corporate costs beginning in 2019. Exxon is fully on track to deliver the targeted  9bn of structural and sustainable savings in operating expenses as compared to FY19 baseline with around  8.3bn realized as of Q2 2023, the majority of which achieved through operational efficiencies in production and marketing as well as reductions in workforce with total FTE down from 74,900 to 62,000.The combination of a lower-cost asset base and structural cost savings has resulted in recent margin levels being almost 50  higher than in oil price comparable years 2013 and 2014 with most of the expansion happening post FY20 after the company had initiated its new savings strategy. With the increasing ramp-up of low-cost production in Guyana and the Permian and further reductions in headcount and operational inefficiencies due to continuing technology adoption across the value chain, I estimate this margin expansion to continue and allow Exxon a significant degree of operating flexibility throughout the oil price cycle going forward.Another metric that highlights the much stronger position that Exxon Mobil is currently in when compared to prior high oil price environments, is the increase in return on capital employed  ROCE  which measures earnings as an output relative to the company s asset base less financial debt as an input. This is where both aforementioned key points come together with earnings growing at a higher pace than capital employed through an expansion in margins while capital spending remains disciplined. Plotting XOM s achieved returns on capital against the annual average  bbl Brent for FY13 to FY22 and estimating a regression between the two variables for a benchmark FY13-19 period, it becomes evident how much Exxon has been able to improve its capital efficiency when operating at similar oil price levels. While FY21 has largely performed in line with the benchmark prediction, FY22 and the LTM period generated 1.58x and 1.67x that of benchmark estimated ROCE levels respectively, highlighting the stellar operational improvements the company has achieved in recent times, irrespective of underlying oil prices.This trajectory has also placed the company well ahead of European oil majors and closest US competitor Chevron with XOM generating 1.3x of peer average ROCE over the LTM period further supporting the company s strong investment case ahead of peers.I view Exxon Mobil s downstream business which is the largest among peers at c.38  of total earnings as of FY22  vs peer average of 20  as a key competitive advantage due to the diversification it provides the company with, with refining and chemical production as a partial hedge against cyclicality in crude oil prices. When compared to peers, Exxon has shown a lower correlation in YoY  EBITDA to YoY  oil prices over the period from FY14 to FY20  for FY21 and FY22 the correlation would take into account Exxon s much faster recovery as shown earlier  which in my view highlights the  at least partial  downside hedge a large downstream business can provide for an integrated oil company as refining and chemical production margins benefit from lower crude oil input prices all else equal.As part of its business plan to improve efficiency in the segment and grow earnings 3x by FY27 to FY19 baseline, XOM has divested a set of underperforming and older refineries in recent years, focusing human and physical capital on high return complexes with large scale and tight knit integration of refining and chemical production. This should allow the company high flexibility in adjusting production output and mix to a changing energy landscape. On the other hand, Exxon is actively growing the business with expansions at the Baytown, TX and China facilities, the second of which scheduled to start operations in FY24 and produce an estimated 1.7mt of polyethylene per year. With the majority the company s refining capacity located on the US Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana, I estimate the increasing share of production coming from the Permian to offer additional upside to margins.The second pillar of management s strategy is a shift in production mix in the chemicals segment towards higher value-add performance products which offer higher margins and growth with sales of performance chemicals having grown at 2x the rate of commodity chemicals. With those key projects on the ground and the aforementioned company-wide structural cost reduction programs, I estimate Exxon to further lead its peer group in downstream, in both scale and operating efficiency with earnings margin already around 1.5x that of peer average  5.9  vs 4.1 .This segment is also one of the key factors in Exxon s preparations for an eventual post-oil period, rapidly building up its capacities in biofuels with management estimating them to add  700MM in annual earnings by FY27. Next to carbon capture technology, biofuels have become XOM s strategic focus in the renewable energy space as the company seeks to draw from its strengths in molecules and refining instead of diverging operations into adjacent fields such as power and electricity production, as some of the European oil majors have done in recent years. Management has also clearly communicated its commitment to keep renewable and fossil energy products competing for capital with IRR hurdle rates around 10  applied across the entirety of the company s operations. This is a direct differentiator to the strategy employed by European competitors which invested, and continue to invest heavily in power generation through wind or solar which from an IRR perspective, significantly dilutes profitability and capital efficiency with i.e. Shell aiming for IRRs of 6-8  in this field.As of Q2 23, Exxon has around  41.5bn of debt and  29.5bn of cash on its books, equating to a net debt position of  12bn. Since a peak of 21  net debt to total assets in FY20 as crashing oil prices forced to company to take on debt to fund management s counter cyclical spending and dividend payout  Exxon did not cut its dividend during the pandemic , the company had gradually delevered to a current net debt ratio of 3 , a 10-year record low. This is remarkably low when compared to peers with Chevron at 4.7  and European majors at around 10 .At such low debt levels and with oil prices projected to remain elevated in the near term, this should greatly benefit shareholders as management can fully allocate FCF to grow dividends and buy back shares instead of using parts of it to pay down debt. This is further benefitted by Exxon s capital discipline with lower CAPEX increasing conversion of CFO to FCF. XOM shares currently yield 3.3  with dividends having grown at 2.74  CAGR over the last 5 years and being increased consistently since 24 years. Current yield is lower than peers, however I do estimate significant upside here as aforementioned factors will benefit Exxon s ability to grow shareholder payouts above industry-average for the coming years.Next to dividends, management has long let shareholders participate in the company s profits by buying back outstanding shares, lowering share count and thus increasing earnings and dividends per share. Since FY13, Exxon has bought back approx.  70bn in shares or around 16  of current capitalization along with paying out  148bn in dividends. At a cumulative CFO of  446bn for the period this equates to a total shareholder payout ratio of c.53 . When compared to Chevron at 48  and especially the European majors which have averaged a payout ratio of 36 , this in my view highlights Exxon s superior commitment to its shareholders with management recently announcing an   annual  17.5bn for FY23 and FY24 with  15bn of purchases in FY22 , up 15  from its previous guidance for  30bn to FY23  15bn annualized . At current share prices, this could retire up to 319MM shares and lower total share count by a further 8  to help stabilize EPS with profits coming down from record FY22 levels.Due to the Oil   Gas industry s long-lived nature, I value Exxon using a 5-Year DCF model with a WACC of 9.5   derived from XOM equity beta of 1.04 and assuming a post-tax cost of debt of 5  and a perpetual growth rate of -2  which in my view reflects the overall prospects of the industry as fossil fuels will eventually be phased out despite the transition period likely lasting until at least 2050. For oil prices I assume a base scenario of  75 bbl Brent over the projection period from FY23 to FY27 which I estimate as a good proxy given OPEC s commitment to keep prices elevated and removal of Russian crude from  Western  oil markets. For cash flows I follow the company s official guidance as of its Investor Day 2022, aiming to bring breakeven cost per barrel to  30 and a CFO of  60bn  2x vs FY19 at  60 bbl Brent benchmark . This yields a CFO per  bbl above breakeven price sequentially rising from  1.6bn to  2bn through FY27. CAPEX is assumed at midpoint of company guidance of  23-25bn for FY23 and  20-25bn for FY24-FY27.Using these inputs with October 16 as valuation date, I obtain an Enterprise Value of c. 610bn  of which 64  accounting for Terminal Value  which, adjusted for Q2 23 Net Debt of  12bn and Minority Interests of  8bn, yields a Fair Equity Value of c. 590bn or  149 per share, giving an approx. upside of 35  to current trading levels. Accounting for different scenarios with oil prices from  70 bbl on the lower end and  90 bbl on the upper end as well as perpetual growth rates of -1  to -3 , total upside potential ranges from 9  to 67 , highlighting an upwards skewed current risk-reward profile for XOM shares.Following the reasoning laid out above, I view Exxon as a best-in-class play on structural tailwinds in the energy sector given ongoing cost-reduction programs leading to increased margins and capital efficiency as well as management s strategic decision making to limit capital spending on high-return, lower-cost assets and products across both up- and downstream. Coupled with Exxon s strong position in the Permian and leading position in Guyana as well as management s industry-leading commitment to shareholders, I see significant upside to current trading levels which in my view do not accurately reflect the stellar trajectory and operating performance the company has managed to deliver in recent times.Risk to my thesis include a stronger than expected economic slowdown with the US and Europe entering recession and China s post-covid recovery not materializing which could drag oil prices materially lower despite OPEC supply cuts as well as more extreme shifts in political and social climate towards hydrocarbons.Exxon is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings at October 27. Given my very long-term view on the stock I do not expect any significant changes in my investment thesis arising from the call, however, I advise current and prospective investors to pay specific interest to management s quarterly reporting of its progress in cost-reduction vs 2019 as well as any news regarding the Exxon s Brazilian operations after recently announcing a continuation of its E P activities in the Bacalhau field despite failing to find oil there earlier in the year.

Petrobras: Q2 Earnings Confirm Deteriorating Outlook,"In  on Petrobras  , I took a neutral view of the stock due to several yellow flags surrounding the company, particularly concerning the appointment of a former politician as Petrobras' new CEO and stateThe flow of negative news for Petrobras, especially with the company being influenced by political measures, such as subsidizing the price of gasoline in Brazil, has led me to maintain my cautious stance. Despite the company's attractive valuation compared to private and state-owned peers, the lack of clarity regarding its future direction makes me skeptical about entering into Petrobras shares.The recent Q2 results were disappointing, and the trend suggests that Q3 performance may be even worse due to the company's subsidies on fuel prices. The gasoline subsidies have already resulted in nearly R  10 billion in losses, with an average subsidyAlthough Petrobras has been considered a robust dividend payer, I believe this positive outlook could now be in jeopardy. As a result, I struggle to adopt any stance other than being bearish about the company's future.Petrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new , reducing the percentage of free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous 60  to 45 .The company's investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain. Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan, which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming months.Over the last five years, Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R  160 billion annually, while the average cash flow from investments was R  40 billion. Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations, while the other half went to growth and new business lines  approximately R  20 billion each .Based on this historical data, the average free cash flow in recent years was around R 120 billion, suggesting that Petrobras would have distributed R 54 billion under the new dividend policy. This would result in an average dividend yield of 12.8 . Consequently, those who received super dividends of over 20  in the past year may not expect a similar payout this year.Looking ahead, I believe that Petrobras will probably continue to maintain yields in the double digits. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the company's investment program for the coming years.Petrobras has recently undertaken an extensive divestment program, selling refineries to private companies to increase cash flow and promote competition. However, with the current Worker's Party government in Brazil, there are indications that this process could be reversed, potentially pausing sales to expand refining capacity.Furthermore, increased spending and past management under the Worker's Party  President Lula's party  have raised concerns about irregular investments, as  by  Operation Car Wash  and the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts.I believe Petrobras' Q2  left something to be desired, primarily due to the company's new commercial orientation, despite presenting reasonable operational impacts.Regarding the company's financial performance, there were notable highlights. Revenues dropped by 18  YoY to R 113 billion due to the fall in Brent prices, lower export revenues, and reduced refining margins. The Exploration   Production segment also saw a decline in revenues, totaling R 72.9 billion, down 32.5  YoY, primarily influenced by the drop in oil prices.EBITDA in the second quarter amounted to R 49.9 billion, compared to R 78.5 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Recurring consolidated EBITDA stood at R 56.7 billion, and recurring free cash flow  operating cash flow minus investments  reached R 33 billion, with R 7.8 billion related to non-recurring divestments.Investments increased to  3.2 billion in Q2 2023 compared to  2.1 billion in Q2 2022, with 80.2  of this amount directed towards the Exploration   Production segment, aligning with the company's current business plan. This value will likely continue to rise for other segments in absolute and relative terms.Considering a net debt of R 203 billion reported in the quarter, the company's net debt EBITDA ratio stood at 0.74x, resulting in R 28.7 billion of net income compared to R 54 billion in Q2 2022.While the financial figures, such as revenues, EBITDA, and dividends, appeared at reasonable levels and were attractive in size, specific points stood out and required closer examination moving forward. Notably, gross debt's evolution increased from  53 billion in Q1 2023 to  57.9 billion in Q2 2023. It's important to note that the dividend policy, based on 45  of operating cash flow minus the company's investments, is subject to a clause that applies only if the gross debt remains . This condition challenges the bullish thesis based on dividends' strength.However, it would be premature to assert that the debt will reach its limit, considering the potential effects of fuel price adjustments. The  of 23  and 20  in gasoline and diesel prices, respectively, representing around 70  of revenue, coupled with the exchange rate effect and an 8.1  fall in the value of Brent, a 1.6  drop in volume, and a further 16.5  reduction in prices in BRL, all contributed to approximately R 10 billion extra losses QoQ.Petrobras' import parity prices policy  IPP , adopted in 2016, was  in May. Despite the expectations of a significant decline in the company's shares, the impact was not as severe as anticipated. The new pricing policy was not drastically different from the IPP and did not substantially affect the company's profits and dividends.However, recent concerns resurfaced when Petrobras introduced a new price-cutting measure, which seemed poorly timed. On June 30, the company  a price cut on gasoline and cooking gas, leading to a 5  decline in its share price. This decision surprised many investors, and some fear that Petrobras is intervening in gasoline prices to protect President Lula's image. Monitoring the evolution of discounts applied to the nominal value concerning parity during the third quarter of this year will be essential to assess the situation further.These factors add complexity to Petrobras' financial outlook, and careful analysis will be crucial to assess the company's ability to manage its debt levels and maintain its dividend policy in the future.Despite the uncertainties, Petrobras announced a dividend payment of R 1.14 per share, totaling about R 15 billion, scheduled to be paid in two installments in the last two months of this year with a cutoff date of August 21.Currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio  P E  multiples of 3.8x its earnings, Petrobras is still trading at a significant discount compared to its peers. So it is challenging to argue that the company does not have an attractive valuation looking purely at the multiples.Take the example of larger petrol companies in market capitalization Exxon , which trades 11.9x its forward earnings, and Chevron  12.1x. Historically, both companies trade at a 40  discount to Petrobras  today, that discount is about 70 .Unlike the two American companies mentioned earlier, Petrobras is a state-owned company with a history of governance heavily influenced by political interference. The company's  is a former Brazilian politician from the Worker's Party.The presence of state risk and the company's past use as a political tool are concerning factors that, in my view, are already materializing. This is evident in the recent price-cutting measures and the discontinuation of the international price parity policy, with the company now subsidizing fuel prices.Given these risks, Petrobras would need exceptionally attractive multiples to be considered a good investment. A slightly stretched multiple, such as the company's , may be enough to raise a yellow flag. Petrobras trades at multiples of 1.1x, representing a premium of about 9.6  compared to its average over the past five years.The graph below illustrates that the period between 2020 and early 2022, when the share price significantly deviated from the P B ratio, is now in the past. The decline in the P B ratio from 1.6x in 2021 to 1.1x may indicate that the share price has decreased relative to the company's book value. This could result from investors reducing their expectations regarding the company's future performance and the decreased , such as its refineries, relative to its share price.While Petrobras maintains solid fundamentals and is expected to pay good dividends for some time, I perceive it as highly unlikely that the company will replicate the exceptional results of the last two years.Following the second-quarter results, I have identified significant uncertainties that cast doubt on a bullish thesis for Petrobras. These uncertainties include the discounts applied to the nominal value concerning international parity prices, the potential risks associated with investments in new refineries given the company's controversial past in this area, and the company's increased use to support national content policies. The latter may exert additional pressure on the company's investment line, and there is also a possibility that the company may  assets that were sold in the past.As a result of these concerns, I currently maintain a bearish stance on the company's prospects for the third quarter, and I foresee at least a 10  downside potential from the current  13.50 share price. Such movement would be supported by the company's forward P B premium. Additionally, considering the substantial decline of over 40  observed throughout this year, it seems probable that further downward movement will occur.

Sigma Lithium: Emerging Producer In A Volatile Lithium Market (Rating Downgrade),"For several months now, Sigma Lithium  has been the subject of takeover speculation. Numerous media reports have been , discussing how Sigma was being shopped around to companies both inside and outside the mining world. I But despite being at the center of all this media noise, the company's mining operations have kept chugging right along. Sigma started commercial production this year and has very ambitious plans to grow total production in the years to come. Its managementSo, given all of these positive factors, one would expect to see Sigma's stock price trading at or very near all-time highs. But, as most investors are probably well aware, that's not the case. Sigma has been unable to escape the effects of broader macroeconomic trends that have been impacting the whole industry. In this article, we'll discuss why Sigma's stock price has been trending downward since mid-July.Sigma's Grota do Cirilo Project has had a rather smooth ride over the last few years. The company has been able to bring the project to completion without any major operational, jurisdictional, legal, or financial challenges slowing down the process. And although Sigma's recently released Q1 numbers, for the quarter ended March 31st, don't yet show any revenue, that should all change when Q2 numbers are eventually released.In May, the company  its first revenue when it sold 15k tonnes of tailings and 15k tonnes of 5.5  battery grade lithium concentrate to Yahua International Investment and Development Co., Ltd., a China-based company which is one of the largest lithium chemical refiners for EVs in the world. Sigma also announced that it had signed an offtake agreement with Yahua to cover the sale of up to 300k tonnes of tailings per year for 3 years. These will be upcycled into battery grade lithium concentrate for use in electric vehicle battery production.Since then, the company has continued to ramp and expects 2023 total production to be 130kt and to hit an annualized run rate of 270kt by Q3 of this year. And, as discussed in , this is only the first of a multi-phase project that will eventually see production grow to 766ktpa when Phases 2 and 3 are eventually added on. Sigma filed a PFS this past January and is currently working on the Definitive Feasibility Study for both Phases 2 and 3. It hopes to complete both phases sometime next year, a very ambitious target indeed.Sigma's management often points out the disconnect between its current  3.7 billion market capitalization and the market caps of other large producers when each companies' total production is taken into account. Intuitively this makes sense  if Sigma, which is now guiding to a production number of 130kt this year, produces as much as Livent  and Allkem  combined and half as much as Albemarle , should it really be valued at a fraction of what these companies are valued atHowever, that valuation method takes an overly simplistic view. Sigma has yet to show a profitable quarter, has one property, operates in one country, has no refining capacity, and is a relatively young company. Albemarle and Livent on the other hand, have been around for decades, have been profitable for quite some time, have well-developed downstream capacity, have numerous properties in many countries giving them geographical diversity and long production lives, have diversified revenue streams  in the case of Albemarle , have both hard rock and brine experience  in the case of Livent Allkem , and have deep and long-standing relationships with clients. Investors are clearly assigning some value to these factors and that seems very reasonable.If Sigma can continue to ramp up production without any major problems and if it can bring its other projects online successfully it will eventually be able to somewhat narrow the price gap between itself and other senior producers. But given Sigma's current stage of development, it seems fairly valued at these prices relative to the others. But its price, however, may continue to pull back in the short term due to factors that are completely out of its control.Over recent years, the lithium narrative has become very well known. The rise of EVs has prompted many investors to wonder how auto OEMs will ever be able to source the battery metals required for the assembly of all these new vehicles. Graphs projecting the growth in lithium carbonate demand, such as the one below, have become very common and can be found all over the Internet.Amongst many investors the lithium thesis has become received wisdom, and, in my opinion, it is 100  correct. Barring some revolutionary technological breakthrough which allows for the assembly of effective batteries without lithium, lithium consumption will continue to increase for many years to come. However, it is also highly unlikely that growth in demand will be as smooth as the graph above suggests. Lithium, like all other commodities, will be subject to the ebbs and flows of the global economy.China currently accounts for the lion's share of the global EV market. In June, EVs held a  of the Chinese passenger car market and China accounted for 57  of global plug-in car sales. And, as can be seen in the exhibit below, year-over-year sales growth continues at a very healthy clip. The North American and European markets are also growing quickly but it's clear that, at present, the global EV industry is quite dependent on the Chinese market. And that's a problem.It's becoming increasingly clear that China's economy is in real trouble. Over recent years, the Chinese government has had to lower its GDP growth target from 8-9  per year a decade ago to 5  this year, and that's just the target, the real number is probably much, much lower. Youth joblessness in the country has become such a problem that the government now  to publish youth jobless data. And the real estate crisis that began several years ago has also grown much worse and now threatens to engulf some of the country's largest developers such as Country Garden Holdings .It appears that the deteriorating economic situation has not yet reached the car market, but, in all likelihood, it eventually will as long-term unemployment and plunging property values are not conducive to a buoyant car market. And if that occurs, the impact is likely to be felt all the way up the EV supply chain, causing lithium prices, which over recent months had already begun pulling back, to fall even further.The Chinese car market will eventually recover from any pullback, and even if it were to enter a long and dawn out economic recession, growth in the US and European EV markets would eventually offset any long-term loss of demand in China. But the current rapid deceleration of the Chinese economy may mean that lithium prices are in for a bumpy ride over the next couple of quarters. Sigma Lithium is being downgraded to  for those reasons.Sigma is a solid, well-run company, and its share price will probably get some support from the takeover speculation currently swirling around it. Over the long term the stock may have promise, but over the next few months it will probably have limited upside due to the macro factors impacting the lithium space as a whole.

"Phillips 66 Vs. Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not","In the last 60 days, the refining segment has seen strong gains. So much so, that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface. After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads, the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels. However, all refiners are not created equal. In fact, when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US  Marathon, Valero, and Phillips 66 , you will find three different business structures.In this article, I will discuss two refiners, Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole, the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic. Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry . We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic. The pandemic's sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop, and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat. This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners. These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 12-18 months.Since greenfield refineries aren't exactly appealing in the public eye, and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry, the industry has shifted its investment focus. The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefits.To that end, several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits  more on that later  for producing renewable diesel. Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the works.As with most things, the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes. Currently, the EIA projects the 3-2-1 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024.Does all of this point toward the demise  or at least regression  of the refinery sector  Let's dive in to VLO and PSX to find out.VLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of  46 billion, just a bit smaller than PSX  50 billion . VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7,000 gas stations nationally. VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment. The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plants.When I look at Valero's , I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology, the Green Diamond Diesel brand, and ethanol production. These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal  possibly negative  economic value. As with any renewable initiative in an investing format, the measuring stick will always be how much 'green' it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineries.Below you will find Valero's Q2 10-K report. You can see that after impressive growth from 2022's numbers, the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12  of the companies operating income, up from approximately 5  in 2022. While not an overwhelming number, it is certainly a contributing factor to the company's bottom line.In my opinion, the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels' potential. To get our facts straight, I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves. The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data, is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining, although at much smaller volumes. Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon, we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involved.Diamond Green Diesel is VLO's brand for renewable diesel. In the 4th quarter of 2022, VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port Arthur. The premium generated by this product results from the multiple credit sources the government has established to spur its production. As shown below the price of RINs, LCFS credits, and BTC credits all play into the margin generated by DGD.It is important to note that currently LCFS credits are only offered in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington and thus the addressable market is relatively small. The pricing mechanism for these credits is affected by the number of 'credits' produced by low carbon sources and the number of credits 'consumed'  i.e. penalized  by high carbon sources. Therefore, this pricing mechanism could deteriorate as more renewable projects come online and replace high carbon fuel sources.More detail can be found at the The remaining price mechanisms for renewable diesel are the  and the   BTC . Both of these programs are administered at the federal government level. Similar to LCFS credits, RIN credits fluctuate based on supply and demand that is created by government established criteria.From the graph below  right side  you can see that the entire monetary value of renewable diesel is based purely on government subsidies with the feedstock costs significantly exceeding the selling price of the basic diesel commodity  Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD . Ultimately, dollars are dollars so I choose not to judge the source. It is important however, to understand the origination of profit.The ethanol group is by far the smallest of the three segments. But Valero has big plans for the small unit, again intending to capitalize on the government's various incentive mechanisms. It intends to do this via the combination of LCFS credits and by connecting the ethanol plants to a CO2 sequestration pipeline.VLO plans to connect eight of its 12 ethanol plants to a common pipeline to support CO2 capture. This entitles the company to the  invoked by the Biden administration. The 45Q tax credit is expected to contribute an additional  0.25 per gallon uplift when the pipeline enters service in late 2024. This credit, combined with the LCFS credits pose to significantly boost the profitability of the ethanol group by roughly  100 to  300 million on a quarterly basis.Given all the above data there is certainly opportunity for Valero to continue to boost overall profitability based on various government incentives. However, given the general size of both the DGD and ethanol segments, this most likely will not be sufficient to sustain the company's current performance should crack spreads decline as we enter 2024.Therefore, I believe VLO will face downward pressure in the medium term. This is based on two assumptions.1. Additional renewable projects come online that reduce the value of government incentives. RBN Energy has a very detailed discussion of this risk in its series, .2. The gradual adoption of electric vehicles will erode demand  or at least hamper meaningful growth  for conventional transportation fuels. This will gradually reduce crack spreads over time. I don't believe the pace of the EV transition will be sufficient enough to pose any near term risk. I view this transition as gradual, becoming more impactful over the course of a decade.PSX has a slightly smaller capacity and retail presence than VLO, coming in at just shy of 2 billion BPD refining capacity with around 2,500 gas stations. What I like about PSX is its diversification and not relying solely on refining. In the chart below you can see that refining only accounts for about 50  of its income. The remainder is spread amongst its midstream segment, marketing, and chemical businesses.Globally, the transition to cleaner burning fuels centers around the use of natural gas  methane  and or similar natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, and ethane. Europe and Asia are consuming these fuels at an accelerating rate, with a large percentage of it being sourced from the United States. This is where PSX's midstream business shines.PSX recently completed the transaction to boost its  in DCP midstream to 86.8  at the end of Q2 of this year. Following the DCP acquisition, the company owns or operates 72,000 miles of pipeline to transport products such as crude oil, refined products, NGLs, or Natural Gas to its export terminals. This allows the company to extract profits at every phase of the value chain from the wellhead to the docks, making it ideal for energy producers to transport using the PSX system.I am extremely bullish on LNG and NGL exports beginning to ramp significantly over the next 12-18 months.  for liquefied natural gas is expected to come online by the end of 2024 with additional projects still in the pipeline. This initial wave of projects accounts for nearly a 75  increase in US exports.Increased demand for midstream services will allow for margin expansion. This will enable PSX to have a thriving secondary business that provides solid and dependable cash flows. More importantly, since midstream businesses are generally fee based with only slight commodity exposure, they can hedge against declining refining margins.In the first quarter of 2024, PSX is expected to start up the Rodeo Renewed unit which is a conversion of the original refinery into a renewable diesel unit. As mentioned earlier, in the current market this carries significant potential for high margin production. PSX targets an annual EBITDA of  700 million from this project once it is operational.This project will be important for PSX to meet its stated projection to return  4.5 billion to  6.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024. , I showed that even taking conservative numbers for the Rodeo Renewed project and factoring in a 40  decline in refining margins, PSX should still be able to beat the high end of their return package guidance.PSX has overall less exposed to pure refinery risks than VLO. This is mostly attributed to the presences of its midstream business in DCP which provides a powerful diversification tool.Additionally, PSX is on track to complete an extremely large renewable diesel project in Rodeo Renewed. As mentioned earlier this has the potential for very high margins in the near term. As with VLO, I do feel the renewable diesel industry may see margin contraction due new supplies coming online.Another important comparison point would be the overall health of each company's balance sheet. The table below shows a stark difference in debt cash profiles between the two.PSX clearly will have some debt obligations to tend to over the next several years that could rob meaningful cashflow unless refinanced out into the future. Conversely, VLO is sitting in a very solid position, with more than enough cash on hand to meet all debt obligations for the next three years with ease. VLO certainly has the edge in this regard.Source  VLO PSX Quarterly and Annual 10-K reportsObviously, the common risk to both of these companies is declining crack spreads. With several incremental projects coming online in the next several quarters it is possible crack spreads drop in response to the supply increase. In this scenario, the overall profitability of both companies would drop back to more historical levels.I believe PSX's current business structure helps preclude much of this risk by having alternative forms of income from its midstream business that is inherently stable. Further, the midstream business focuses on natural gas resources that is in high demand around the globe. This attribute is key to my thesis that PSX is a more stable long term investment than VLO.A secondary risk to both companies is declining government incentives to produce renewable diesel as several new projects come online. A reduction in incentives will clearly impact these high margin products as they are not economically viable without this aid due to high feedstock costs. Due to the relatively small volumes of renewable diesel, neither company has sufficient exposure at this time to dramatically alter the course of the business. However, any anticipated growth aspects would be muted in this scenario.In this article, we reviewed the operational differences between VLO and PSX. Despite both being large scale refiners, their business structure is significantly different with VLO almost entirely focused on refining and PSX diversified with midstream, and chemical segments. However, VLO does have an upper hand in its balance sheet and near term debt requirements.The BoA thesis surely has merit, but is more applicable to VLO than PSX due to the latter's diversification from refining. This diversification provides for a safety net should crack spreads drop over the medium to long term. I therefore, in spite of the comparably inferior balance sheet, find PSX to be a more desirable long term investment than VLO. Further, PSX should have sufficient cash flows to manage its near term debt obligations. I previously included PSX in my  for a look into how I view its purpose in a dividend portfolio.

Enbridge Is A Core Retirement Portfolio Holding,"Enbridge  is one of the largest midstream companies, focused in Canada, with a market capitalization of more than  70 billion. The company has a dividend yield of more than 7 . As we'll see throughout this article, the company's recent dip in share priceEnbridge has an impressive portfolio of assets.The company's core business involves several major pipelines such as the Mainline pipeline, one of the most significant pipelines on the North American continent. The pipeline had record volumes of 3.1 million barrels day with the open season upsized and extended. The company has access to 75  of the refining capacity access in the U.S. and this pipeline will remain essential.The company expects escalators to start next year and is working to fixThe company also has a substantial gas transmission LNG asset it's built that connects to the major Rio Grande LNG asset. The company has a  1.2 billion cost for Phase I, as it supplies 100  of the feedstock gas to Rio Grande LNG. LNG plants have a multi-decade lifespan, and that'll provide reliable cash flow on the asset for the company.The company is also building up Canadian Gas transmission in the West, essential as Middle Eastern LNG goes to Europe and Canada has high premiums for transporting assets outside of its core asset bases. The Woodfibre LNG has 60  engineering on track for the second half of the year, and it's building up relevant gas storage assets.The company has worked to build up a strong utility business, highlighting its financial strength.The company has a massive number of renewable projects under development. A substantial   of these are wind projects, especially offshore wind which is growing rapidly. In North America, the company has more than 4.5 GW worth of projects in development, across a number of wind and solar projects.These renewable projects will enable the company to substantially expand its reliable long-term revenue.The company is building up a strong utility business in parallel with its renewable business, which provides substantial reliability to its cash flows. The company has grown from 3.5 million to 3.9 million connects, and expects 42k more connections in 2023. As the urban Canadian population grows, the company's strength will improve.The company has continued to achieve strong ROE on its assets, and we expect its growth to continue.The company's cash flow strength is becoming increasingly reliable.The company's asset base is more than 50  liquids pipelines earnings from EBITDA. The company has 47  regulated cash flow and 51  take-or-pay cash flow. 80  of the company's EBITDA has inflation protections with minimal commodity risk and a high   investment grade customers. The company maintains a high credit rating.That reliable cash flow will help future returns.The company's financial picture continues to enable strong shareholder returns.The company's adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to hit  16.2 billion as the company's DCF share increases to  5.45  4 USD . The company is impacted by hefty interest rates, and we'd like to see it roll down its debt yield, but its financials remain incredibly strong. Versus the company's  36 share price, it has a 12  DCF yield, showing its financial strength.The company's adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly coming from rising tolls on its liquids pipelines. The rest of the company's business has actually seen some weakness. The company's financing costs remain hefty and increased by double-digits YoY, but the company's incredibly strong EBITDA has continued to support its financials and earnings.Versus the company's  16.2 billion target EBITDA, its debt is  75 billion CAD. That's a massive  56 billion USD debt versus its  73 billion market cap USD. The company plans to continue using its cash flow for growth. Its debt to EBITDA can stay fixed as its EBITDA grows, enabling additional debt capacity for the company.The company's financial strength and continued growth make it a valuable investment.The largest risk to the company's thesis is the impact of continued debt raises in a rising interest rate, along with protests against the company's operations. Specifically, efforts to get rid of Line 5 or make it difficult to replace. That could dramatically hurt the company's ability to maintain its cash flow and shareholder returns.Enbridge has seen its market cap trend down by more than 20 . That has pushed the company's yield up to 7.5  and pushed its market capitalization down to just over  70 billion. The company has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years, which only uses up roughly 70  of the company's DCF. That allows the company to have additional cash for other needs.Going forward, the company has a robust pipeline of development assets as it continues to build out its renewable business and utility operations. Out of the company's  14 billion USD capital program,  1.3 billion USD is renewables, and more than 50  is gas. That will enable the company's returns to diversify and grow.The Retirement Forum provides actionable ideals, a high-yield safe retirement portfolio, and macroeconomic outlooks, all to help you maximize your capital and your income.

Marathon Petroleum: Investing In The Fossil Fuel 'Supernova',"The US oil and gas sector has faced significant volatility, with little-to-no correlation to the S P 500 over most of the past three years. The sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2021, led by production cuts the year prior, caused most inMarathon Petroleum has significantly outperformed the general energy ETF The crack spread has been abnormally high in recent years for various reasons. It also rose rapidly over recent weeks due to refinery outages and a and diesel stockpiles. Accordingly, those two energy commodities have risen in value compared to crude oil, which has also increased in recent weeks. See belowThe gasoline spread has been generally elevated since the initial refinery issues in 2020, but has never returned to its pre-COVID levels due to ongoing refinery capacity shortfalls. The diesel spread was high last year due to the acute shortage of diesel fuel. Although that spread declined considerably after, it has begun to rise again due to signs that the deficit will likely return.In my view, the situation facing refining margins and profits on other downstream energy segments makes companies like Marathon particularly interesting today. MPC is hovering around its peak value but trades at a lower forward  P E  of 6.9X, indicating it could be discounted today. Of course, the downstream sector also faces economic, technological, and regulatory risks, which could offset its significant pricing power and tremendous moat. The company faces numerous complex factors  however, I believe its short-term outlook is solid, with decent potential over the coming years. Of course, the company will likely need to make more significant green energy transition investments in the long run. Still, those may never drive substantial profits for well over a decade. Accordingly, I expect MPC will benefit tremendously from the lack of investment in  legacy  oil and gas until then.Marathon's earnings  to lower refining margins that quarter, primarily driven by the low diesel crack spread. In Q3, its earnings outlook is much stronger due to the recent spread improvement, with both showing a strong upward trend. However, one of the company's major refinery plants will be  due to a recent fire, pushing its capacity utilization down to 93  from 100 . Of course, this issue is a double-edged sword because it contributes to the lack of available refining capacity pushing the crack spread higher. Across the industry, refinery capacity utilization is around 93  today  a standard level , but total capacity is still significantly depressed. See belowThe decline in total refinery capacity is the primary reason for the increase in refining profits, creating a chronic shortage of refined products due to a lack of production and high demand. This was triggered by a large wave of refinery . Refinery shutdowns or production issues will likely continue to grow as no new refineries have . As the country looks to shift toward electric vehicles,  due to the immense costs, low projected lifespan of refining projects, and increased regulatory burden outlook.One company is looking to build a , which will be completed in 2027  however, it will not add much to total production  129 refineries . I expect that project   and shortages . The labor and materials shortage is a significant secondary issue limiting capacity expansion and utilization. After that, the sharp increase in interest rates limits these companies' willingness to borrow money to expand and strongly encourages a return of invested capital. This trend is evident in Marathon Petroleum, which has slashed the CapEx budget  despite high profits , and substantially increased its cash-flow returns. See belowCash from financing  are net cash-flows from dividends, stock buybacks, debt repayments  being negative , and stock and debt sales  being positive . When compared to Enterprise Value  79B for MPC , it gives us a  true  dividend yield for the company as a whole  not just its equity . That figure is currently a staggering 19  for MPC, meaning at its current pace, it could buy back all of its debt and equity in about five years. Of course, MPC's ability to return cash highly depends on its refining margins, as that is the most variable part of its . More importantly, the sharp change in Marathon's focus from capital investing to return on capital shows the company is not looking to expand and is instead paying back its investors - a great sign for investors. The same trend is seen across the oil and gas sector, with virtually all larger companies halting most CapEx instead of capital returns, indicating a widespread unwillingness to expand into the  theoretically  limited lifespan environment  given the rise of electric vehicles .If the refinery market continues to see low production levels, which I strongly suspect, then there is a significant probability of a sharper increase in gasoline and diesel prices. One major catalyst is the lower inventories of these commodities and the rising fuel export level. Many other countries face similar issues to the US, mainly Europe, which was previously dependent on Russian fuel. As demand for US exports grows amid depressed refinery production, fuel inventories may fall to critically low levels and cause another significant price spike like that seen in diesel last year. See belowOverall, I believe the current situation points to a potentially large increase in refining profits, led by a sharp rise in diesel and gasoline prices compared to crude oil. Low inventories of those two critical commodities, volatile production after summer, and rising export demand could bring a more considerable shortage than last year's diesel shortage. As hurricane season nears, the potential for a black-swan decline in is very high, possibly creating a larger temporary production decline that pushes the shortage to an extreme.I believe MPC is an excellent way for investors to bet on increased gasoline prices. Indeed, it is also a means to hedge against a rise in fuel costs, a significant ongoing risk for most companies and the economy today. Marathon offers thepotential of a sharp acute rise in refining profits, which I suspect could occur over the coming months. The stock also appears attractive over the 3-7 year horizon, as fuel demand may be substantially higher than supply over that timeframe due to underinvestment across the industry. Eventually, the associated increase in fuel costs should accelerate the transition toward electric vehicles, likely causing MPC to lose. After that, the company can still sell chemical products, around 10-15  of total oil consumption today  however, its total profits should be much lower after the transition.I believe MPC's most significant long-term value opportunity is the possibility that the energy transition will take longer than expected. Marathon, and its major peers, are acting as if it will occur very quickly, rapidly reducing investments and returning capital today. However, should fossil fuel demand , the chronic shortage today could become far more significant. In my view, this situation makes MPC a  Supernova  investment, where it could see extremely high cash flows for years before its eventual demise  of its fossil fuel segment, but not its much smaller chemical segment . Given the US power grid must be expanded significantly before a  combined with utility , fossil fuels may dominate for longer than expected, extending the size of this  supernova.The difference between Marathon and its peers Valero  and Phillips 66  is insignificant. MPC's valuation is between the two, with a forward  EV EBITDA  of 4.7X vs. PSX at 5.8X and VLO and 3.9X. However, their three-year out-forward valuations are closer, with three-year forward  P E  of 12.3X compared to MPC at 12X. That indicates Valero's EPS will likely decline faster than MPC and PSX. Marathon is larger and has a higher operating margin of 10.4  compared to both of its peers. Thus, I believe Marathon has the best potential to maintain production over the coming years and reinvest  after the energy transition is complete. As such, MPC is my favorite stock in the group, but I am also bullish on PSX and VLO.The most significant long-term risk for Marathon is a more rapid increase in the utilization of electric vehicles. Currently, the EV market is a bit cold, with sales lower than likely due to economic strains on  workers. For the EV transition to occur more quickly, interest rates on consumer loans would need to be lower, discretionary income higher  or EV prices much lower , and fossil fuel prices would likely need to be higher. All those factors are possible, but today's specific environment does not encourage a rapid EV transition. Indeed, I believe the transition may be slower than most expect.Marathon also faces short-term risks, particularly with the stock reaching a new record peak. While I am moderately bullish on MPC, a short-term pullback may occur simply due to its recent breakout. A sharp economic slowdown could also harm gasoline consumption, pushing crack spreads and refining profits back down. That is a distinct possibility today  however has been highly resilient despite economic and price strains since late 2021, so a recession may not harm gasoline consumption as much as it did in the past. A recession would likely further break refinery capacity, probably increasing the sector's total  supernova  potential. While MPC faces distinct short- and long-term risks, it also offers tremendous immediate value and is a strong hedge against today's most considerable inflationary strains.

HF Sinclair Appears Fairly Valued Right Now,"Just like all the refiners,   has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis. Thanks to the sky-high refining margins that have resulted from the war in Ukraine, the company posted record earnings last yearJust like all the U.S. refiners, HF Sinclair incurred excessive losses in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis, which caused a collapse in the global demand for oil products. However, thanks to the reopening of the global economy, the company recoveredEven better, HF Sinclair has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis. Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine in early 2022, the U.S. and the European Union imposed strict sanctions on the exports of refined products from Russia. As this country provided 10  of global oil output and an even greater share in the global markets of diesel and gasoline, refining margins skyrocketed to unprecedented levels last year. As a result, HF Sinclair posted record earnings per share of  14.73 last year. To provide a perspective, the previous record of the company was earnings per share of  6.44 in 2018.Refining margins somewhat moderated off blowout levels in the first half of this year but they remained far above normal levels. As a result, HF Sinclair reported earnings per share of  in the first half of the year and is expected by analysts to achieve earnings per share of  10.06 in the full year. If the refiner meets the analysts  consensus, it will post the second-best earnings per share in its history.It is also important to note that HF Sinclair is one of the highest-quality refiners in the country thanks to its exemplary management. Some oil companies, such as Exxon Mobil , curtailed their growth projects in 2018-2021 in order to keep offering generous dividends. On the contrary, HF Sinclair suspended its dividend for one year and issued some shares in order to fund two highly profitable acquisitions.In late 2021, the company acquired the Puget Sound Refinery from Shell  for  350 million. In addition, in early 2022, the company acquired Sinclair Oil and thus it added two refineries, a renewable diesel business, and a branded marketing business to its business portfolio. It is needless to say that the timing of these acquisitions was ideal, as refining margins skyrocketed shortly after the deals and have remained above average since then. Therefore, these two deals have offered outsized returns on investment so far.On the other hand, investors should not expect the exceptionally high refining margins to remain in place for years. The refining industry is infamous for its dramatic cyclicality. During periods of wide margins, some refineries invest in the expansion of their capacity while some new refineries are built as well. Consequently, global refining capacity increases, and thus it leads refining margins to lower levels, especially if the global economy decelerates or falls into a recession.Notably, the U.S. refining margins  by approximately 30  during the last month, from about  29 per barrel to  20.2 barrel. This is their lowest level since January 2022, just before the onset of the war in Ukraine. The current refining margins are somewhat higher than the average refining margins of about  18 per barrel in 2018 and 2019, but the tailwind from the Ukrainian crisis seems to have abated. The steep correction is somewhat surprising, given the heavy seasonal maintenance activity of refiners, which normally provides support to refining margins. Moreover, as the sharp correction of refining margins is very recent, it is hard to forecast at what level margins will stabilize.Overall, the tailwind from the sanctions of western countries on Russia seems to be fading. Indeed, analysts expect the earnings per share of HF Sinclair to decrease by 31  next year and by another 15  in 2025, from  10.06 this year to  5.91 in 2025.HF Sinclair is offering a 3.3  dividend yield. The stock has a payout ratio of only , and hence its dividend has a wide margin of safety, despite the cyclical nature of its business.It is also important to note that HF Sinclair has one of the strongest  in the energy sector. Its net interest expense consumes just  of its operating income, and its net debt  as per Buffett, net debt   total liabilities   cash   receivables  is standing at  3.3 billion. This amount is less than twice the annual earnings of the company and only 32  of its market capitalization, and hence it is easily manageable.The strong balance sheet of HF Sinclair is paramount, as it helps the company easily endure the fierce downturns of the refining industry that occur every few years. It also enables the company to perform highly profitable acquisitions during opportune times, such as the two acquisitions mentioned above.HF Sinclair is currently trading at an extremely low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 5.4x due to its blowout earnings this year. As the earnings of the company are abnormally high this year, they are not suitable for the evaluation of the stock.The earnings per share of  5.91, which are expected by analysts for 2025, can be considered much more sustainable and hence they can be used in the evaluation of the refiner. The stock is currently trading at 9.2x times its expected earnings in 2025. This valuation level is somewhat lower than the 10-year average of 10.3x of the stock. Therefore, the stock appears slightly undervalued right now.On the other hand, it is prudent to keep in mind that refiners are facing a long-term threat due to the exponential growth of the sales of electric vehicles and the unprecedented number of green energy projects that are being developed in response to the energy crisis experienced last year. Whenever all their renewable energy projects come online, they will probably take their toll on the global consumption of fossil fuels and hence on refining margins. Overall, HF Sinclair appears fairly valued around its current stock price.HF Sinclair has been thriving in the last two years, primarily thanks to the tailwind from the sanctions of western countries on Russia. In addition, the company is characterized by exemplary management, which does its best to enhance long-term shareholder returns by focusing on the factors of the business it can control. However, the refining business is highly cyclical, with its cycles being out of the control of the company. Therefore, it is prudent for investors to expect refining margins to revert to normal levels in the upcoming quarters. Overall, HF Sinclair Corporation stock appears fairly valued right now.

"New refineries set to come online could cut refiner stocks, gas prices - Barron's","Refining stocks have run higher this year, thanks to soaring demand for gasoline and diesel and a relative shortage of the products around the world, but next year could be different, according to Avi Salzman of .Two long-delayed refineriesThe two new refineries alone would add more capacity than the average year during 2015-19, when 800K bbl day of new capacity was added each year, Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Blair .The VanEck Oil Refiners ETF  is up 16  YTD, and refining stocks have performed even better  PBF Energy  , Marathon Petroleum  , Valero Energy  , Phillips 66  , HF Sinclair  .The new capacity in Nigeria and Mexico could hurt existing oil refiners, even in the U.S., since oil is a global market, and Blair predicted cracks - a measurement of margins used for refiners - will drop to  12 bbl for gasoline and  28 bbl for diesel in 2024, compared to  19 and  32 respectively this year.But in the short term, refiner stocks and gasoline prices could keep climbing, as already low fuel inventories have come under increased pressure from a  so far this year combined with higher planned maintenance after a long run of operating near full-bore.As of September 15, U.S. gasoline inventories were 4  below the five-year average for this time of year, while diesel and other distillates were 14  lower, the Energy Information Administration reported this week.Russia's announcement this week of a temporary ban on gasoline and diesel exports has tightened an already stressed global fuel market, but the severity of its impact will .Analysts at TD Cowen estimate the ban may last a little more than a month and could offer further upside for U.S. refiners.",132,2023-09-23T20:30:00.000-04:00
Marathon Petroleum Q2 Earnings: Why This Stock Is An Attractive Investment," is one of the refinery stocks that has been on my radar for many years and the biggest peer of my own refinery investment, Valero Energy .The company just reported its Furthermore, the company is expanding its business as it captures opportunities related to renewable fuel and its superior network of assets.In this article, we'll discuss all of this and assess the risk reward after the stock's 50  rally off its 52-week lows.So, let's get to itMarathon's second quarter was a success. The   36.8 billion in revenue, which was  2.94 billionThat said, sales were down 32.1  year-on-year, which might seem like a stunning number - it is. However, it's caused by last year's unusual developments. The war in Ukraine and refinery shortages caused gasoline prices to explode, leaving companies like MPC with favorable margins.Now, the environment is still strong, but not as strong as it was in 2022, which is a good thing for the economy.Having said that, in the Refining   Marketing segment, refining utilization increased by 4  to 93 , despite significant turnaround activity.An incident at one of the refineries' catalytic reformers in Galveston Bay reduced crude throughput by approximately 2.5 million barrels and its capture by about 1 .Please note that margin capture refers to the actual realized margin compared to a market-based benchmark margin.Sequentially, per barrel margins, were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions due to lower crack spreads and sour crude differentials.Refining operating costs decreased to  5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, primarily due to higher throughput and lower energy costs.As the overview above shows, the refining and marketing margin capture for the quarter was 97 , with the company's commercial team performing well despite planned and unplanned refinery downtime.The company expects fluctuating capture results based on market dynamics but believes its capabilities will provide a sustainable advantage.I have to agree with that, as fundamentals remain favorable.For example, at the end of July, Bloomberg  that gasoline prices are having a strong revival, causing refinery margins to jump.According to Bloomberg  emphasis addedThis is the chart Bloomberg usedWhen zooming out - using my chart - we see two things.Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum has a Midstream segment, which is its majority ownership of midstream giant MPLX LP .This Midstream segment delivered strong second-quarter results, with adjusted EBITDA remaining flat sequentially but 5  higher year-over-year.The business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows, with high-return growth projects progressing in the Marcellus and Permian basins.As a result of these tailwinds, MPC returned nearly  3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, representing a 100  payout of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.The company had approximately  6.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization and held roughly  11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.After all, one of the key reasons why the company is so aggressive when it comes to buybacks and dividends is its healthy . Not only did the company have roughly  11.5 billion in cash  10.7 billion excluding MPLX , but its gross debt-to-capital ratio is just 21 . Even including MPLX's  20.4 billion in debt, that number is below 50 .It also has no maturities in 2023.Since May 2021, MPC has repurchased 264 million shares, accounting for approximately 40  of the shares outstanding.The current dividend yield is 2.3 , which enjoys a payout ratio of just 9  and 10.5  average annual dividend growth over the past five years.Like Valero, Marathon Petroleum did not cut its dividend during the pandemic but used its balance sheet to take on more debt. Luckily, the years after the pandemic allowed the company to quickly reduce debt again.Having said all of this, the company is upbeat as it looks into the future.For the third quarter of 2023, MPC expects crude throughput volumes of approximately 2.7 million barrels per day, which would translate to a utilization rate of 94 .The utilization rate is expected to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, incentivizing high refining utilization.The company's guidance also assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter.Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter is expected to be  5.10, benefiting from higher throughput and lower costs due to completed turnaround and project activities.Distribution costs are expected to be approximately  1.4 billion, and corporate costs are expected to be  175 million, reflecting sustained reductions.Additionally, the company is investing in growth.For example, MPC completed the STAR project at its Galveston Bay refinery, which enhanced the competitive position of the refinery. The project increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing capacity and improved distillate recovery.MPC boasts two premier 600,000 barrel-per-day refineries on the US Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity, supporting its global commercial strategy.Additionally, construction activities at the Martinez renewable fuels facility are ongoing, with pretreatment capabilities set to come online in the second half of 2023.This facility is expected to reach its full capacity of producing 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.According to MPC, the Martinez facility will become one of the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a strong operating profile, logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate, supported by a strategic relationship with Finish refinery giant Neste.With that said, let's look into the valuation.When looking at the analysts' free cash flow estimates, we see a steep downtrend. However, it's not as bad as it looks. Essentially, what we're seeing is an expected long-term normalization in margins. 2022 was truly exceptional. Unless a miracle happens, we will continue to see normalization.However, bear in mind that in 2019, the company generated  3.3 billion in free cash flow. Even the expected result of  4.1 billion in 2025 would be far above that.Having said that, I do not believe that the decline will be this steep. Analysts continue to underestimate the earnings power of this company and its peers, which was confirmed by 2Q23 numbers.Nonetheless, sticking to analyst numbers and using 2024 estimates, the company is trading at 9.1x 2024E free cash flow.Not only does an 11.0  free cash flow imply a lot of room to maintain aggressive dividend growth and buybacks it also indicates a favorable valuation.Given the health of MPC's business and ability to capture long-term growth, I would make the case that the company should not trade below 12x free cash flow.This would indicate a fair price 32  above the current price.The current consensus price target is  144, which is 7  above the current price.Based on this context, I still do not urge anyone to jump into MPC. The economy is not in a good spot, and given the recent uptrend in the market and MPC, I would only buy this company after a 10-15  correction.My rating is bullish to reflect the fact that my longer-term target is well above the current stock price.In conclusion, Marathon Petroleum has shown impressive resilience and earnings power, despite economic weakness.The company's recent quarterly earnings report revealed strong refinery demand, setting the stage for aggressive buybacks and consistent dividend growth.With MPC's expansion into renewable fuels and its superior network of assets, the company is well-positioned for future growth. Despite a dip in sales compared to the exceptional numbers of the previous year, the company remains in a favorable spot.Furthermore, MPC's Midstream segment, through its ownership of MPLX, continues to generate strong cash flows and offers high-return growth opportunities.The company's healthy balance sheet allows for aggressive buybacks and dividends, making it a sound long-term investment with an attractive valuation.Overall, I rate MPC as bullish for the long term, considering its ability to weather market fluctuations and deliver sustained growth.However, given the prevailing economic conditions, it may be prudent to wait for a 10-15  correction before considering an entry into this promising refinery stock.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Exxon Mobil: Likely Higher For Longer,"The only time I    was on December 22, 2023, when the stock was trading at  107.9 and many investment banks began to revise their forecasts for the stock's future growth potential. AtThe balance of supply and demand in the oil market was predicted approximately correctly by most experts, and XOM stock ultimately proved to be the beneficiary, gaining 10.6  since the publication of my bullish article.As XOM's share priceExxon Mobil  a significant drop in its 2Q23 earnings, with adjusted net profit at  7.874 billion  1.94 per share , down from  17.551 billion  4.14 per share  in the prior year. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, weaker refining margins, and increased capital spending contributed to the decline. The firm's revenue decreased by 27  to  80.795 billion  the income from equity affiliates and other income are excluded , so it also missed the market's expectations.In April 2022, the company restructured, forming Exxon Mobil Product Solutions and centralizing certain groups. It now reports results in 4 segments  Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products.The Upstream segment's profit fell to  4.577 billion due to lower commodity prices and reduced oil-equivalent production. U.S. Upstream profit dropped to  920 million, while non-U.S. Upstream earnings declined to  3.657 billion. The Energy Products segment's profit decreased to  2.310 billion, primarily due to lower refining margins. Chemical Products reported a profit of  828 million, reflecting weaker industry conditions. In Specialty Products, profit improved to  671 million, driven by higher pricing.Capital and exploration expenses rose to  6.166 billion  Exxon Mobil aims to invest in promising projects, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain a sustainable dividend, with an expected 2023 CAPEX between  23- 25 billion.Oil prices got a boost as Saudi Arabia and Russia  voluntary production cuts until year-end, tightening the market. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in their recent note  September 20, 2023 - proprietary source , that Brent Crude exceeding  100 per barrel seems stretched, despite strong signals of market tightness, such as rising prices, robust demand, and falling inventories. The market is currently undersupplied by about 1 million barrels per day, mainly due to OPEC's 1 mb d cut, led by Saudi Arabia. The analysts expect that Saudi Arabia will maintain its cuts well into FY2024, keeping the market tight until at least early 2024. However, significant price increases are unlikely, with Brent expected to range between  85 to  95 per barrel by the end of 2024.So, based on the tight market situation until early 2024, XOM has an excellent background for its operational activities, which should become even more efficient in the foreseeable future.As another group of Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote a few days ago  proprietary source , the company aims to triple its earnings by FY2027 compared to FY2019, mainly thanks to strategic projects. XOM sets records for oil production in the Permian and achieved record production rates in Guyana. They also completed a significant chemical expansion project in the Gulf Coast. Exxon Mobil anticipates bringing on 2 new projects in the second half of the year, Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further enhancing earnings potential.After opportunistically rationalizing and divesting lower-margin refineries over the past few years, Exxon Mobil's Energy Products portfolio is now 85  integrated with its chemical facilities. In the long term, Exxon Mobil has positioned itself well to take advantage of opportunities in product reconfiguration, particularly in the biofuels, lubricants, and chemicals sectors as the energy transition continues to evolve.At the same time, we see that the valuation of the company currently looks quite modest  The market sees EV EBITDA for next year at the  6.7x level, although the EBITDA margin  TTM by quarter  is currently 21.5 , which is 57 basis points higher than last year for the same period. From a historical perspective in terms of EV EBITDA multiples, XOM is valued at the low end of the norm but has a very strong FCF that is likely to be even higher due to higher oil prices and is currently over 10  of market cap, indicating serious undervaluation.In recent weeks, refining margins have improved due to low clean product inventories, strong demand, facility outages, and geopolitical uncertainties, such as reduced Russian exports. Exxon Mobil, with its global refining capacity of about 4.5 million barrels per day, is expected to benefit significantly from these higher margins. Based on current price expectations, there is a  7  potential upside to Energy Products  downstream  consensus earnings in the second half of 2023 and a  15  upside to 2024 previous estimates, Morgan Stanley analysts added.Let's do the math together  If the above forecasts come true, or if actual earnings are close to these levels, then at 7.5x of EV EBITDA we should get a market cap of  533 billion after adjusting for net debt. Then the upside potential from the current price would be 14.38 , excluding   FWD . The expected total return exceeds 15 , so I reiterate my previous buy recommendation.I should mention that Exxon faces several significant risk factors in its operations, so everyone should be cautious when buying its stock.First, the company operates in a commodity-driven industry, where it has limited control over the prices of its products. This vulnerability to fluctuating commodity prices can impact its profitability and financial performance, as was the case throughout its entire history.Second, Exxon is engaged in major capital projects, and cost overruns on these projects can pose financial challenges. These overruns can strain the company's financial resources and potentially affect its ability to meet its investment goals and deliver expected returns to shareholders.Additionally, geopolitical risks are a concern for Exxon. Operating in countries with a history of corruption and political instability can expose the company to uncertainties that may impact production volumes and returns. However, Exxon's global presence helps mitigate some of these risks by diversifying its operations across different regions.Despite many obvious risks, Exxon Mobil stock is a  Buy  today even at the high end of its multi-week price range becausea  the oil market is still tight,b  refining margins are improving,c  management is taking some strategically sound steps to improve the company's operational efficiency  andd  the stock is quite cheap given the strong FCF levels,As a result, I expect XOM to be higher for longer - at least until something fundamentally changes.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Strong 3rd Quarter For Commodities,"Commodity indexes hadThe energy sector rallied sharply during the quarter led by strong gains in gasoil and heating oil. There is a global shortageThe industrial metals sector was up a little over 3  for the quarter and CMCITR s larger exposure to the sector allowed for slightly improved relative performance versus BCOM. Gains in the sector were led by aluminum  8  and zinc  12 . Disappointing growth in China continues to be a concern for the sector as China is the largest consumer of industrial metals by a wide margin.The agriculture sector was mixed with large gains for sugar, cocoa, and cotton, while wheat fell around 15 . Soybeans, soy meal and bean oil all fell marginally. Curve positioning of CMCITR for the agriculture sector added to relative performance versus BCOM.The livestock sector gained 2.5  during the quarter, led by continued gains in live cattle. It is currently trading at all-time historic highs. Lean hogs steered BCOM s outperformance in the livestock sector ahead of CMCITR  however, the small sector weight in both indexes  CMCITR  4.5  BCOM  6.15  contributed minimally to absolute performance. This is evidenced in the Roll Yield chart below.The precious metals sector was the only sector down during the quarter, falling around 3.6 . This was led by a 4  drop in gold prices. CMCITR s smaller exposure to this sector versus BCOM added to the relative outperformance.The near-term outlook for commodities continues to be uncertain as U.S. interest rates and the U.S. Dollar continue to rise. The sharp rise in 10-year U.S. treasury yields late in the 3rd quarter was a headwind for growth and commodity demand. Over the longer term, we still believe commodity supplies will be tight, which will likely lead to higher prices and continued positive roll yield.

Biofuel Demand Strengthens The Business Case For U.S. Agribusiness,"Farmers are often both food producers and suppliers of a range of raw materials, with the latter now becoming more important than everThere are a number of feedstocks that the US biofuels industry uses to produce biofuels. Corn is by far the largest, representing over 90  of the volume, with most corn being processed into conventional ethanol. The second largest feedstock for biofuels is soybean oil, making up around 3  of the total feedstock used. Animal fats used cooking oil  UCO  and vegetable oils like soybean oil are generally turned into biodiesel orUsing corn to produce ethanol initially took off following the Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  in the mid-2000s and California s Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS . We've written about these policies in a bit more detail previously . The number of corn bushels used for ethanol has been relatively stable in the last decade.We're now seeing strong growth in the use of other feedstocks, which is mainly the result of . The expansion in refining capacity has led to additional demand for animal fats and UCO, but we also see more soybean and canola oil from oilseed crushers and corn oil from distillers being turned into renewable diesel. Increased production of renewable diesel is mainly taking place at the expense of biodiesel, and total renewable diesel production volume has overtaken biodiesel production for the first time in 2023.Both animal fats and UCO are rapidly approaching their supply limits, according to the International Energy Agency. The US already has high UCO collection rates, so it s also looking abroad for additional supply   and this means that competition between the US and the EU for Asian UCO supply is heating up. The future supply picture for animal fats is mixed. US cattle inventory is following a downward trend, limiting the growth potential for beef tallow, the most important animal fat used in biofuels. Larger supplies from the poultry industry can partly offset this due to the growth in the number of broilers.The biofuel market continues to evolve, and we see varying demand outlooks for different feedstocks. Since corn ethanol demand from the road transportation sector has likely peaked already, overcoming hurdles to enter the market for sustainable aviation fuels remains a key concern. Given the ongoing growth in renewable diesel capacity, there is clearly more growth potential for fats and vegetable oils. Ethanol producers and oilseed crushers are also busy with upgrading the protein content in their other products to tap into higher value-added feed and food applications.Corn is the most widely used feedstock when it comes to biofuel production in the US, specifically for ethanol production. The ethanol sector accounts for around 38  of total corn consumption, which is up significantly from just 6  in the early 2000s. Historically, the view has been that there is a blending wall for the US ethanol industry, with the widely accepted barrier being at 10 . However, it's become more apparent in recent years that this blend wall does not appear to be as impenetrable as previously thought, with the ethanol blending rate in the US exceeding 10  since 2016. The growing availability of E15 and the capacity for a larger share of the vehicle fleet running on it would have helped to break above 10 . Any car with a model year 2001 or newer is approved to run on E15, which is basically almost 96  of the car fleet.A further increase in blending rates will likely drive any growth in US ethanol demand from the road transportation sector. However, given efficiency gains in cars with combustion engines and the growing share of electric vehicle  EV  sales, road fuel demand in the US is likely to decline in the coming years. In turn, this will reduce the amount of ethanol that will be needed.In the next decade, we expect downward pressure to emerge on the demand for biofuels in road transportation   especially in the latter part of this decade. Because current biofuel production for cars is primarily driven by the federal Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  mandate to blend biofuels into fossil gasoline,  will replace both fossil gasoline and biofuel demand. Weaker-than-expected RFS biofuels blending mandates for 2023 to 2025 add further constraints to demand growth.We estimate that, mainly because of EV development, current levels of ethanol demand are likely to decrease by 7.6  to 14  by 2030 based on different scenarios of gasoline consumption and ethanol blending rates. In the scenario of rapid reduction in gasoline consumption without increased blending, the 14  decline in ethanol demand works out at around 700 million bushels less in corn demand. This is equivalent to losing around four million acres of corn.A potential key outlet for the corn and ethanol industry is the aviation sector, driven by soaring commitments from airlines to use Sustainable Aviation Fuels  SAFs  to power their fleets. The aviation sector is more difficult to decarbonise, and biofuels will likely have to play a more significant role in this. Biofuels still make up a marginal share of jet fuel. Feedstock availability and costs mean it is more challenging compared to road transport. However, given the large-scale and stable production of ethanol in the US, and with ethanol-to-jet technology becoming more widely available, we could expect the contribution of ethanol-to-jet fuel  EtJ  in total SAF production to increase.US jet fuel demand is currently around 1.55m b d  24 billion gallons , and the EIA expects it could approach close to 1.75 mb d  27 billion gallons  by 2030. . With current regulations allowing SAF blending rates of up to 50  with jet fuel, the demand potential is significant, particularly when considering that current blending rates are less than 1 . Assuming the aviation sector fully absorbs the 14  reduction in ethanol demand from road transportation, it would only take SAF blend rates up to around 4  by 2030, all else being equal. So, pressure on ethanol demand means the stakes are high for ethanol producers to open up new markets in aviation.When it comes to biodiesel in the US, soybean oil is the largest feedstock. Around 11.6 billion pounds of soybean oil goes towards biofuels, which is almost 44  of total soybean oil demand. This is up significantly from less than 1  in the early 2000s. In order to produce the necessary amount of soybean oil, around 991m bushels of soybeans are needed  assuming 1 bushel of soybean produces 11.7 pounds of soybean oil .The EIA forecasts that US diesel demand will fall from around 3.67m b d  56 billion gallons  in 2022 to 3.31m b d  51 billion gallons  in 2030. At face value, this suggests that the outlook for biodiesel is for demand to edge lower, which theoretically would mean that the demand for soybean oil from the biofuels industry would also trend lower over time. Obviously, this can be offset by higher blending rates of biodiesel into petroleum diesel.However, the more significant factor which is likely to support soybean oil demand  along with other vegetable oils  from the biofuels industry is the growth in renewable diesel capacity. Renewable diesel can be used as an alternative to petroleum diesel so the potential demand growth is significant, given it can fully displace petroleum diesel rather than just be blended with it.There has been significant investment in recent years in renewable diesel capacity and the demand for renewable diesel is less likely going to be negatively impacted by the adoption of EVs. This is because renewable diesel serves trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles, and these vehicles are less well positioned to use batteries because of their large sizes and consequent long time to charge.By the start of 2021, the US had around 791 million gallons of renewable diesel capacity, which grew to around 3 billion gallons by the start of 2023. Meanwhile, some forecasts suggest this capacity could reach as much as 6 billion gallons by 2025, and from 2026 onwards, capacity could total 7.4 billion gallons with a number of projects still in the pipeline. Looking at EIA numbers, we can derive that almost 30  of US renewable diesel was produced using soybean oil as a feedstock. If we were to assume a similar proportion was used for renewable diesel in future and total capacity of 7.4 bn gallons between 2026 and 2030, there would be additional demand for 16.9b pounds of soybean oil, which would equate to around 1.2b bushels of soybeans.But, if we were to assume all new capacity was to use soybean oil as feedstock, this would increase the need for additional soybeans to almost 4.1b bushels. In reality, future demand needs will likely be somewhere in between this, with plenty of uncertainty over the feedstock mix, given availability issues. In addition, there are questions over whether all this planned capacity will actually come about.That said, it is clear that the longer-term demand prospects for soybean oil are constructive. The US would need to see a combination of increasing soybean acreage, reducing soybean exports and increasing the domestic crush to meet future demand. Significantly stronger demand for soybean oil would mean the need to invest in domestic crushing capacity. Under this scenario, the US would move away from being a significant exporter of soybeans to a larger producer and exporter of soybean meal. The surplus meal produced could prove challenging for the industry in terms of logistics, whilst clearly weaker meal prices would mean that soybean oil prices will have to do most of the work to ensure margins remain attractive for crushers.The Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  is providing generous tax credits to the biofuels industry. Firstly, the IRA extends the previous biomass-based diesel blender s tax credits from December 2022 to December 2024. With biodiesel, renewable diesel, and some other kinds of alternative fuels eligible for application, these credits will continue to boost the production of biofuels for road transportation. Secondly, the IRA creates new tax credits for SAFs at  1.25- 1.75 per gallon until the end of 2024. This will strongly encourage the production of SAFs, especially when fuel production faces high upfront investment and still needs technological advancement. The clean fuel production credit will replace both sets of tax credits starting 2025 through 2027.While the current SAF tax credits sound attractive to producers and investors, several areas deserve special attention. First, produced SAFs must achieve emissions reduction of at least 50  to be qualified for the tax credits under the IRA and this is not easily the case for every SAF. For instance, different producers may have different life-cycle intensities even for the same SAF production pathway, but on average, producing SAF through the ethanol-to-jet fuel  EtJ  pathway with corn grains as the feedstock can emit as much as 66 gCO2e MJ according to a research paper published on Journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. This is not enough to meet the 50  emissions reduction threshold to be eligible for IRA SAF tax credits.So, the case for corn-based EtJ is less straightforward from a carbon reduction perspective unless corn-based ethanol producers are able to reduce carbon emissions, such as through on-farm measures and by applying carbon capture and storage  CCS  at production sites. Whilst plans for several pipelines are in place, they also face opposition. If only corn-based SAF that is equipped with carbon reduction technologies can meet the IRA tax credits  requirements, it will be put it at a more disadvantaged position when competing with other kinds of SAFs in the market.Secondly, to receive the highest levels of tax credits, the prevailing wage requirement will need to be fulfilled. Biofuel producers need to pay their workers the minimum wage set by the Department of Labor and use at least 12.5  of the labour hours from workers registered under the federal apprenticeship programme or a state-level equivalent. There were roughly 600,000 active registered apprentices in the US in 2021, but large discrepancies exist across geography and industry. Therefore, it is not by default that companies can meet this requirement, and producers may find themselves in a position of needing to raise wages or recruit more qualified workers to take full advantage of the IRA.Growing demand for cleaner fuels offers companies along the agricultural value chain an opportunity to extract more value from their crops and by-products. Policy continues to play a key role in setting the pace. Recently updated Renewable Fuel Standards for 2023-2025 will likely slow down some of the anticipated expansion of soybean processing capacity. Markets are expecting more clarity from policymakers on the conditions for using corn ethanol in jet fuel by the end of this year.That said, future biofuel demand will greatly influence farmers  planting decisions. Prices will need to do the work to ensure that farmers adjust plantings, which implies sowing more soybeans at the expense of corn. However, the potential opportunities for Ethanol to Jet  EtJ  in sustainable aviation fuels may complicate this.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Oil Won't Hit $300 But Chevron Is Still A Buy,"Lately it has become fashionable for writers to predict that WTI crude oil will go to . Several commentators floated this price target in recent months, and countless news outlets repeated their claims. It all got started back in theTo lay my cards on the table, I don t think that oil is going to  300 per barrel any time soon. Oil consumption has been rising lately, but the pace of increase over theFor this reason, we can expect the supply of oil to stay close to its historical range in the near term. The Saudis may cut or boost output briefly for political reasons, but their long run incentives argue for selling the profit-maximizing output.It s for this reason among others that I think   stock is a good value today. We are likely not going to see oil prices reach a level where CVX will stage a monster rally, but prices should remain healthy enough for the company to pay its dividend, and maybe even deliver modest capital gains. This is significant because the stock s current dividend yield--is far above average. If investors just realize a modest 10  capital gain on their CVX shares over the next five years, then their total returns will be substantial. In this article I make the case that CVX stock is a decent buy today not because oil will go to  300 or any other ultra-high target, but because it can make very good money at the oil prices we re seeing now.Chevron is an energy company involved in the oil industry in a number of . It sells oil, natural gas, diesel and jet fuel. It operates a natural gas business, which includes LNG transportation services. It s one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian Basin, which Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger consider one of the best oil fields in the world. It has 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity. Finally, it has a chemicals business, which transforms crude oil into chemicals needed for heavy industry.Chevron is a pretty diversified, full-service oil and gas business. That's a good thing, because it allows the company to make money in different market conditions. Pure play E P companies tend to make the most money in oil bull markets, because they sell oil and gas on the open market. Refiners on the other hand can make good money even when the price of oil is fairly low, because their business involves in order to refine it into gasoline, diesel or some other usable fuel. Compared to a pure play E P like  , CVX won t gain as much from rising oil prices, but it won t suffer as much when oil prices go down either.This diversified business model is a major competitive advantage for Chevron.Being involved in exploration, production, refining and sales, the company can capture profit at many different points along the oil   gas supply chain. Whereas a pure play E P can only make money selling crude oil, Chevron can extract, refine and sell  in the form of gasoline , the same barrel of crude. This ultimately enables Chevron to earn higher margins than many of its competitors.In order to gauge how well Chevron will do in its upcoming third quarter release, we need to look at previous earnings releases from periods when oil was at about the level it s at now. According to , WTI Crude was hovering around  90 in the fourth quarter of 2022, much like it is today. So, Q4 of 2022 could be a good indicator as to how 2023 s third quarter will turn out.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Pretty decent results. The second quarter of 2023 on the other hand was not as good. Its  includedAs we can see, Chevron s results for the most recent quarter were worse than those seen two quarters prior. However, the price of oil today is closer to that seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the second quarter of 2023. So, there is a decent probability that the company s upcoming earnings will look more like the Q4 2022 release than the Q2 2023 release. If that s the case, then CVX will beat on revenue, as analysts are only expecting  in salesHaving looked at Chevron s recent earnings, we can now turn to its valuation. At today s prices, CVX stock Speaking of free cash flowChevron does pretty well in terms of discounted cash flows. If you take the  14.5 in TTM free cash flow per share, and discount it at the current treasury yield , assuming no growth, you get a  322 fair value estimate. If you incorporate a risk premium of 6 , you get a  138 fair value estimate. The average of these is  230, which implies 38  upside to Friday s closing price.As we ve seen, Chevron stock certainly does not need  300 oil, or anything close to it, in order to have upside at today s prices. To my mind, that makes it a buy. However, there are many risks and challenges facing chevron stock today, including the followingThe bottom line on Chevron is this  it s cheap, it s profitable, and it s likely to post renewed growth in its third quarter earnings release. We re probably not going to see  300 oil anytime soon, but it doesn t matter. CVX stock is a buy anyway.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Making My Own Super Major Oil Company - Version 2.0,"Super major oil companies like Exxon Mobil  or Chevron  are household names. There isn't a person you could ask who hasn't at least heard of these companies. These companies are worth more than the In this article, I will compare the performance of a  10,000 investment in Chevron to the same investment spread amongst smaller sized companies that operate in the same upstream and downstream markets of the oil and gas industry in search of higher returns. This is my second installment of my experiment. In , I definitively concluded there were better investment options than Exxon Mobil. Now ITo draw a definitive answer, the following questions must be answered.I'll define certain criteria I used to framework this comparison.1. The smaller component companies are still large companies. A market cap of  10 billion is the minimum to be considered.2. The second investment will be spread as evenly as possible to match Chevron's production mix. For example, if 60  of Chevron's earnings  EBITDA  was from refining,  6,000 would be invested in a refiner. The remaining  4,000 invested in an oil and gas producer.3. All results will be based on Q2's returns and annualized for a full year. Returns during 2022 will not be considered since energy prices were largely an outlier from the past 10 year average due to the Russian Ukraine conflict. This has been done to not over inflate the projected numbers. I view Q2 commodity prices as a good barometer for below mid-cycle pricing.To facilitate this experiment, I have chosen to compare CVX against a blend of companies in the refining and E P spaces. These companies will be totally separate than those selected to compete against Exxon Mobil in the previous experiment.In the refiner space, I have selected Valero  and HF Sinclair . To shake up the producer section, I have selected Diamondback Energy  and Occidental Petroleum .CVX is a global producer, with major oil and gas projects all over the world. Conversely, the competitors, FANG and OXY, mainly produce out of the Permian Basin of the US. Therefore, there will clearly be operational differences between the companies and this is not necessarily an apples to apples comparison.Typical Permian production is in the range of 50  oil, 25  NGLs, and 25  natural gas. CVX's production profile is geared more to the natural gas segment, producing nearly  from natural gas. As one would expect, the shear size of volumes produced are also significantly different. In Q2, CVX's total daily output . This dwarfs the output of  and  for FANG and OXY respectively.Aside from these operational differences, the shareholder return packages are structured very differently. CVX employs more of a standard format with a moderate dividend and buyback program. FANG and OXY have altered their programs to match the ebbs and flows of the commodity cycle.FANG utilizes a base plus variable dividend strategy that is based off 75  FCF  inclusive of base dividend and buybacks . OXY aims to return as much as possible to shareholder through share buybacks and redemption of preferred shares with only a small dividend. So right off the bat, investors should be aware of that important difference between the companies.Chevron's refinery segment is on the smaller size for a company with a market cap of almost  300 billion. CVX brings home a total capacity of . This is on par with the capacity of Valero, which produces 1.42 million barrels per day. The smallest producer of the bunch is HF Sinclair  Market Cap of only  10 billion  which has 716,000 barrels per day of refining capacity.The competitors in the refinery space have a similar dividend program to CVX but have been pouring an unparalleled amount of cash into buybacks. Record crack spreads have allowed these companies to capitalize on the rapid influx of cash without creating a future liability by ramping up the dividend excessively.Before we get started, let us discuss the indicators we will be using to grade performance.1. Total Shareholder Returns - This includes dividends and buybacks to demonstrate which investment has superior returns to investors.2. Valuation - This will evaluate free cash flow generation per share, cash, and debt levels to demonstrate which investment has a superior value.3. Historical Price Performance - Understanding where we've been can help us get an idea of where we are headed.Through these points, I will look to draw conclusions if there is a superior alternative investment vehicle to CVX.To evaluate our return options, I first had to calculate the percentage of earnings related to each given segment. For CVX,  of Q2 earnings came from the upstream segment, leaving 18  spread across the different downstream segments, which can largely be lumped under a refining title.Below is an annualized summary of dividend payouts and share buybacks from the peer group. It is easy to see that CVX is near the bottom of the group, only beating out OXY by a 1  improvement in total returns.I used the following table to calculate the number of shares that would alternatively be purchased. Note that two different companies were selected for both the upstream and downstream segments to give some diversity to the results.Taking the number of shares in the above table against an equivalent  62.77 shares of CVX  at  159.31 share  generated the following investment options. Using this method, you can see that CVX is competitive with investments 2 and 3 and solidly outperforms investments 4 and 5.An important factor to note is that the return method is shifted more toward equity than dividend payments with these alternative investment options.From a valuation standpoint, it is pretty reasonable to expect that investors will be paying a premium to own a slice of the Chevron brand. But exactly how much of a premium are we paying and how much is that brand value worthThe first item we will look at is Price to FCF, or investment dollars spent for cash produced. Using the chart below CVX looks to be valued at a fair price for a pure producer. The refiners, however, are generating significantly more cash per share. Both VLO and DINO cost less than half that of CVX for every dollar of free cash flow produced suggesting that the refiner stocks are a better overall value.The second item to evaluate will be the cash and debt profiles for CVX. I have taken the net debt position of all five companies and represented that on a per share basis and a percentage of share price.CVX is a clear front runner in this area. CVX has a miniscule net debt position for a company of its size, setting it up to have a healthy balance sheet for the foreseeable future. This will ensure profits are either directed toward productive endeavors like capital projects or into shareholder's pockets.For our last valuation metric, we will look at historical price performance of a  10,000 investment. In this area, CVX is the bottom feeder for share price appreciation over the last 3 years. This is where the risk reward discussion needs to be weighed. From the chart below you can see the relatively smooth price curve of CVX versus the more volatile curve of FANG OXY. If investors are prepared to stomach the increased volatility, higher appreciation is possible with the smaller peer group.The comparison performed here has focused purely on stock performance and does not take into account any operational characteristics such as quality of assets, growth aspects, or management performance. As a result, it does not give credit to CVX for its incredibly diverse set of projects that span the globe.The resources at Chevron's disposal are unparalleled. The shear amount of cash flow and cash reserves give the company the capability to find and develop the world's next major reservoir. Simply put, CVX has the capability to be an industry trail blazer.Conversely, the smaller peer set does not have this ability. In the big picture, they are optimizers, seeking to be as efficient as possible in the Permian, while CVX is out scouring the globe for big pay days.There are both pros and cons to this approach. Even though big pay days excite investors and can drive record profits, this is also the status quo for a super major. It is a tall bar to constantly live up too.In this article we compared the stock performance of Chevron against a variety of both independent oil and gas producers as well as leading US based refiners. To draw conclusions from our comparison, we tried to answer three questions.Conclusion  Conclusion  Conclusion  CVXAnother downside to selecting the smaller peer group will preclude investors from benefiting from CVX's excellent balance sheet as well as the diversity of its world class assets. From a long-term vantage point, CVX's vast resources almost guarantee it will be at the forefront of the industry for the foreseeable future. These two factors can provide an ample amount of security that an investor may wish to consider.When selecting an option, both age and financial goals come into play. After weighing both options, my personal preference would be to select any of the alternative investment options. My personal preference would be to select Investment Option 2 or 3 thanks to FANG's variable dividend policy which could dramatically boost returns should oil continue its upward trend. This would also allow for the opportunity to capitalize on market volatility and share appreciation.Does this require additional work us as investors  Absolutely. However, in principal, we can be rewarded with both higher returns. CVX still has merit as potentially a more secure and less volatile investment while still producing moderate income, should that be a goal for the current season of your life.If this thought process has caught your interest, I have written individual analyses on all four of the  alternative  companies discussed in this space .Happy Investing.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently , I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash   in the  crack spread.  As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around  87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The  crack spread  is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of  32 barrel to  19 barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this  12 barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of - 12.96 annualized  3.24B quarterly .  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See belowHistorically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around  15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around  1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative   seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage . Its refining segment EBITDA was  3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as - 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected  1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at  1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about  5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a  1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of  5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around  830M, and its interest is currently around  142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra  972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at  4.67B, or  3.7B after taxes  21  historically . The company usually has  350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of  3.35B or an EPS of  8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at  7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at  1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of  448M, or  353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest  4M, or a  0.01 EPS . The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at  4.53 EPS  however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA  however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to  7.5 and a Q4 nearer to  1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4 , indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 , that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See belowAgain, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade  and today in particular  would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential ,  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves  both strategic and commercial , could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC  production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See belowAs the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around  -1 to  2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward  P E  of  30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a  highly sensitive   environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Energy Transfer LP (ET) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Energy Transfer LP  Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call August 2, 2023 4 30 PM ETTom Long - Co-CEOMackie McCrea - Co-CEOSpiro Dounis - CitiJeremy Tonet - JPMorganBrian Reynolds - UBSJean Ann Salisbury - BernsteinKeith Stanley - Wolfe ResearchMichael Blum - Wells FargoNeel Mitra - Bank of America Merrill LynchGood day, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Operator Instructions  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded.I now like to turn the conference over to, Tom Long. Please go ahead.Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer s second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website.As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow August, the 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website.I'd like to start today by going over our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. We generatedOur volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower quarterly average natural gas and NGL prices, which declined 70  and 45  respectively over the second quarter of last year. DCF. Approval to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was  1.55 billion, compared to  1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of  579 million. On July 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of  0.31 per common unit, or  1.24 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from  0.23 paid in the second quarter of 2022. We continue to target a 3  to 5  annual distribution growth rate, while balancing our leverage reduction, increasing equity returns and maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest and our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. As of June 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately  2.36 billion. Now turning to results by segment for the second quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was  837 million, compared to  763 million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transportation, storage and terminal services margins related to increased volumes and higher rates, partially offsetting this with a  51 million negative impact, due to timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains over the next two quarters. Adjusting for this non-cash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter would have been  888 million. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13  to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region, and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 5  to a record 989,000 barrels per day, compared to 938,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2022. For the month of April, throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day, which was a new monthly record. NGL export volumes grew 15  over the second quarter of 2022, driven by record NGL exports out of both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, 2022, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. Year-to-date, we have loaded more than 30 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And we are also exporting record volumes of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company and maintain approximately 20  market share of worldwide NGL exports as well as nearly 40  of U.S. exports. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was  579 million, compared to  903 million for the second quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput as a result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as increased operating expenses. Gathered gas volumes increased 8  to 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 18.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was  674 million, compared to  562 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines increased throughput at our Gulf Coast and Permian terminals, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.3 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken pipeline, and the Bayou bridge pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Excluding the Lotus assets, crude oil volumes were still up approximately 10  compared to the same period last year, which was also a record. Integration of the Lotus assets is going as planned, and we continue to discover additional commercial synergies that are in excess of our original forecast. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was  441 million, compared to  397 million for the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 17  over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Tiger, Pebble and Trunkline. For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was  216 million, compared to  218 million in the second quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts in Texas and the Haynesville as well as lower operating expenses were offset by decreases in retained fuel revenues resulting from lower natural gas prices, and fewer pipeline optimization opportunities. Utilization on our EOIT and rig systems increased due to higher demand for gas takeaway, and increased production in the Haynesville Shale. Now turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with our Lake Charles LNG project. In May of 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the DOE for an extension of the DOEs deadline for the commencement of exports. As many of you are now aware, in April of this year, the DOD denied our request for this extension, and in June, the DOE denied our request for rehearing of this decision. We have had discussions with the DOE subsequent to this decision and we believe the best path forward with the DOE is to file an application for a new export authorization. We expect to file this application in August and during the DOEs review of this application, we intend to continue to work with our existing customers, prospective equity investors and other stakeholders to progress the development of this project. In this regard in July, we entered into three non-binding HOAs related to the long term LNG offtake from this project for an aggregate of 3.6 million metric tons per annum. One of the HOAs is with Chesapeake and Gunvor for 1 million metric tons per annum. A second HOA is with EQT for 1 million metric tonnes per annum. And the third HOA is with a Japanese customer for 1.6 metric tons per annum. The HOAs are subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. Now turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. These terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. We remain bullish that there will be significant long term growth in international demand for ethane and LPG products, as we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. Last quarter, we FID-ed an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address this demand. We expect this expansion which is projected to cost approximately  1.25 billion to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This project is expected to be in service in mid-2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based on based upon customer demand. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future. We also continue to pursue FID on an optimization project at our Marcus Hook terminal that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belview, we expect frac 8 to be mechanically complete in the next couple of weeks, which would put it into full service around September the first. This addition will bring our total Mont Belview fractionation capacity to over 1.1 5 million barrels per day. Out in the Delaware basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. And in June, we placed the Bear plant into service, which is our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware basin. These plants are supported by new commitments and growth from our existing customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin.Turning to the Gulf Run pipeline, which we placed into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We continue to utilize a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run. And during the second quarter, we added additional long-term customer volume commitments through Zone 2, which are being delivered into our Trunkline Pipeline.We have very limited available capacity in the near term and are fully subscribed beginning January of 2025. As a result, we are in discussions to add approximately 1 Bcf of capacity via compression, which will require minimal capital investment. Depending on demand, we also have the ability to loop the system to another approximately 2 Bcf of capacity.On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with Capture Point that is related to our North Louisiana treating plants. An application for a Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was followed by Capture Point with the EPA in June of last year.Also we are working with Oxy related to its Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, North of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. We are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. We are also continuing to have discussions with third parties related to the development of ammonia facilities at sites along the Gulf Coast, where we have docks with Deepwater access.Now looking at our growth capital spend for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Energy Transfer spent  794 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and interstate segments, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately  2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL refined products, interstate and crude segments. As a reminder, this capital outlook includes the NGL export expansion projects at Nederland as well as expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition.A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of this year at very attractive returns, including Frac A, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Additionally, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. As we look forward to this potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we now expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately  2 billion to  3 billion.Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance. As we get further into the year, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately  13.1 billion to  13.4 billion, which slightly tightens our range while keeping the midpoint the same. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022.Our base business continues to perform well, generating strong volumes and providing stable cash flows, which demonstrates our ability to operate through a volatile macro environment. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products, and our assets are strategically positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities to meet this demand. As such, we continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. Our financial position remains strong. And we remain committed to our targeted distribution growth rates and the lower end of our leverage target, which we continue to balance while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis from Citi. Please go ahead. Guys, first question, maybe just go to Lake Charles quickly. Two-part question there. So one, do you have any sense on the DOE timing at this point to approve a new non-FDA authorization  And Tom, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I believe you mentioned working with equity investors on the project. You actually identified potential equity counterparties yet  Or was that just more of a general statementYes, this is Mackie. Let me start, and Tom may add to it. Yes, for confidentiality reasons, we can't talk about who our equity partners. Maybe we can say that we have two very significant partners at a minimum, one that is one to step up for a large amount of the equity as well as a lot of the offtake.And I'll just make a quick comment. We've worked pretty hard on this project. We slowed down during the pandemic. Mason and his team did a great job picking this back up when Ukraine war started. We had tremendous momentum, signed up a lot, 8 million or 9 million tonnes developed relationships all around the world, really good relationships. A lot of those folks I've met over the last three or four months that really believe in our project, and then lowering the whole DOE cut the legs out from under us kind of by surprise without us even expecting it. So we kind of read gearing. We've spent a great deal of time with the DOE over the last several weeks. We have a real important meeting next week with them. And we're being optimistic that they'll work with us to exponentially go down this new path that we're going down to try to get an export authorization approved by them. But in the meantime, as Tom said, we are continuing to work with not only existing customers, but with new customers. And as I said, we have some equity partners that really believe in this project, and we'll be excited to have them part of the team as we work diligently towards FID.Great. That's helpful color, Matt. Second one is going to switch gears a bit here, but just in thinking about TTM. I think it was maybe two quarters ago, it sounded like you were hoping to be able to be in a position to announce something later in '23, but it also sounded market dependent, basically, I think, sort of looking for things to get better. And I guess we haven't seen that yet. So just curious, where are you in that process  How much is that delayed and maybe new sort of timing  I'm thinking about an announcement thereYes, I'll give a little background first. So we're talking about that earlier today. Nederland is such a gem for any partnership, but especially for ours. If you look at what sits at Nederland, in all of our connectivity to all the refineries, we actually are connected to over 25  of refining capacity from that area in South Texas. We have the ability to move large volumes of feedstocks to that facility. We've got four pipelines from Mont Belvieu with ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that can feed the petchem facility. And as I just mentioned, there's a lot of belief over the next 5 or 10 years by some, that there's going to be an issue of getting -- of finding a home for gasoline components, which would also feed -- or could be very good feedstocks for our petchem project. And then you add that to our ability to deliver to ethylene and propylene downstream of this project as well as the export markets, we couldn't be more excited. This is a very unique world-class facility, and we have an extreme amount of interest. We are focused with one equity partner today, who's very interested in a significant portion of ownership and also a significant portion of takeaway capacity. They actually have assembled a very large team working with us. And at the appropriate time, we'll be able to talk more about it. But yes, just like a lot of our projects, it is going to take time. It's a very unique cracker like nothing else in the world, not only because of what it can crack and what it can do, but also logistically with the advantages it has over any other crackers. So we're very excited about it, and we have a great team led by Raj and others working that project. And we do believe at some point in the road, we'll get to FID, but it is going to be down the roadways.The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Just want to pick up with, I think, some of the comments towards the end there with regards to capital allocation priorities. And now that the leverage has come in a bit, just wondering how you balance, I guess, capital at this point, be it distribution growth seems like it's a focus there, but also kind of tuck-in M A has been something that ET has done over time. And it seems like there might be larger industry consolidation of foot right now. At the same time, buybacks has been topical in the industry. So just wondering if you could kind of walk us through the latest thoughts on capital allocationYes, Jeremy, this is Tom. Still a very, very good question. So I always appreciate it. As you know, we have focused on the debt. We're very, very obviously pleased to have it down into our 4 -- kind of 4.5 range kind of at the top of it. So we'll continue to look at moving down maybe towards the lower end of that like we mentioned in the prepared remarks. But moving on past the debt side, the balance sheet side of it, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the projects that we've talked about here. I know we've got a fantastic team that's coming up with a lot of really, really good investment opportunities that continue to expand the great footprint that we've built. And we're just very, very excited about a lot of these and excited about the returns that we're getting on them. So you're going to see us continue to do that.But the distribution growth is the other piece of it. Moving on to that one, where we've put out that guidance of 3  to 5 , and we feel very good each quarter as each quarter goes by is to where we are on that. So we're going to continue to allocate toward that. The unit buybacks still remain on the radar screen. But I will say that right now, we're continuing to focus on investing in the company as well as the balance sheet and of course, the distribution growth to given back to our equities.But I do want to go ahead and expand a little bit on one other item you brought up in there, and that was the M A side of it. We do still remain very optimistic that you're going to see consolidation in the midstream space, and that's something that we feel like we're very, very good at. You can see from all the acquisitions that we've done, we can always make them very accretive. And they've got us to where we are today as well as within the organic growth projects that come along with each one of these. So we're going to continue to stay very focused on that side of it and allocate a lot of time toward that piece of it, too.Got it. That's helpful. And maybe picking up with that, some of the recent acquisitions, be it Lotus or even looking back at Enable, if you could kind of walk us through synergy capture, where it stands now versus expectations at that time  Just curious how things have materialized.Okay. Listen, why don't you let me start with that a little bit, especially on the cost side. And then Mackie will -- he's got a lot of great things to talk about there. So if you look at really both of those, and we'll start with the Enable one. That one just continues to exceed anything that we ever expected on that. So even if you go back to the S4 and you look at what forecast we had in there, we're significantly higher, a good probably 40  or 50  higher than what we were anticipating. And a lot of that was -- some of that was cost synergies, but there was a lot of commercial synergies that are now we're seeing every day as we continue to work through that. And once again, Mackie will expand on that. But I'll comment a little bit on the Lotus.Obviously staying disciplined the same way we did with Enable as to what we're transacting on these acquisitions, at what level we're transacting at. They work for us. They're accretive, and they're deleveraging. And likewise, on that one, we have achieved every bit of the cost savings that we were anticipating on that. But likewise, that one is still new. We just closed in May, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunities on that one also.And Mackie, I'll hand off if you want to add anything more on the commercial side on both of those.Okay. Yes. Chris Hefty and his team have done an unbelievable job. Those acquisitions that Tom just talked about have been incredible. Tom hit on a little bit, Enable. We keep finding things. We were able to move volumes out of Louisiana to Enable down to some of our East Texas assets and just a lot of things that we're finding that are very beneficial. Our WEX acquisition, it is what it is. We bought it at a great multiple, and it's proven out at that multiple or better. So we're very pleased with that one.And then Lotus, gosh, we've just closed it in our crude team gets excited every week about something new. Some new routes, some new blending opportunities, some new additions that we can add to move more throughput on some areas we didn't think about. So as I just mentioned, what great acquisitions that will end up paying off a lot more than we anticipated when we purchased them.And Jeremy, I'd like to just add real quick. When you have the very, very strong talent we do internally, the more tools you can provide to them, it is just truly amazing what we find out of each one of these.Got it, that s helpful. Thank you.The next question comes from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon everyone. Maybe to start off on the long-term annual capital run rate, growth CapEx run rate of  2 billion to  3 billion. I was curious if you could just touch a little bit more perhaps on what these projects could look like, differentiating between perhaps traditional midstream-based business opportunities versus some of these low carbon opportunities that you discussed, LNG, CCUS transport and ammonia  Thanks.Okay. It's Mackie again. Yes, we've got a lot of things already in the works that we've already got FID on. We're moving forward on. And then as we've talked about some of these and there's a lot of other opportunities that we're chasing, we certainly are looking at some renewable opportunities. For example, CapturePoint. As we talked about in the opening remarks, it will be a great project for us, not just because it will be transporting, sequestering CO2, but it also helps us with our upstream contracts on treating and transportation. So there's added benefits to that. And then some of the other projects that we're looking at will also be contributors. But from a capital perspective, it will be pretty minimal compared to a lot of these other projects that we're working on that we've already committed to and a lot of the ones that we think will get to FID over the coming six months and 12-month period.And the only other thing I would add to this, as you know, we do continue to work or look at and spend more time on more of these downstream projects like what Mackie has mentioned. But we are spending some time on the international front likewise in looking at various projects.Great. Thanks. And maybe to follow up on Lake Charles LNG. A lot of HOAs signed during the quarter were some notable E P counterparties that have previously voiced interest in equity ownership in an LNG facility. So just given the tight existing time line that you currently have with the DOE, I was just kind of curious if there's any change in tone or capital structure in your view for Lake Charles in terms of appetite for ET to perhaps own incremental equity and ownership perhaps than a few months ago, just given the fast pace of HOAs that have been signed over the past few weeks. Thanks.Yes, this is Mackie. No, nothing has really changed there. We kind of have a target of around 25  of equity ownership. That hasn't changed. We won't really talk about who the equity partners potentially are. I mentioned a few without naming them, but yes, there's more than that. There are some producers that expressed interest. And so there's a wide range. As we kind of consummate some of the bigger equity commitments, then we'll go to whatever remaining commitments that we need to attain that kind of 75  of partners in the project. So, nothing has changed as far as our strategy around Lake Charles.The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead. I think you may have more exposure to lower gas price in your midstream segment than I had realized. Can you give any more color on how that exposure works  If there's floors  If you hedge out gas price  Is it as simple as if gas price goes back up next year, that segment will improveYes. Jean Ann, this is Tom. The natural gas prices, that's correct, the sensitivity is there, especially in the midstream. But we want to make sure we add in there the ethane component that's included in there. So when you start looking at where those prices were, going on the liquid side, that likewise has rolled into that impact. And that's the reason even in our materials that we put out, we put in that kind of 5  to 10  of sensitivities related to commodity prices. We use spreads at 0 to kind of 5 . But you're seeing us really kind of stay in line with that.I do think it's worth noting that when you do get down to a certain level, that you are able to kind of have floors on some of the contracts that provide kind of a downside protection on these things. But once again, when you get with the whole decisions we make on all the processing we do, when to reject as far as ethane rejection goes and when we extract. But it's really based upon not just the natural gas prices, but the ethane prices also, liquids prices.Got it. Okay. And then just the latest on the up sea  ph  potential. And if you've kind of had any interest from investors that count  ph  on MLPs that they'd be interested in the up seaYes. No, you bet. We do continue to spend time on that and evaluate it. We haven't advanced it to market type studies or anything else. But we do have various discussions with banks, et cetera, on views on the market side of it. Where a lot of the time is really spent on the structuring also. We want to make sure that we get this thing structured in a way that is a win-win for all. So we're continuing to look at that. So it's clearly on the radar screen, something we're going to continue to move forward, move down the field, so to speak, and kind of come out at the right time that makes sense.The next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. Maybe starting with Gulf Run and the compression expansion project. Can you talk to what customers are saying on the timing of needing more takeaway  And I guess, could that project move forward as soon as this year  Are the needs there that quickly  Or the Haynesville needs more time to recoverYes, this is Mackie. No, we don't expect to get the FID on expansion on Gulf Run. As Tom said in the opening remarks, our team has done a great job of selling out the capacity by January of '25. As he mentioned, we're sold out on 1.65 Bcf on the Zone 2 portion of Gulf Run. But no, we'll remain in negotiations. A lot of that depends on some of the LNG facilities to get to FID. A lot of it will depend on some commitments that we're looking at further downstream on markets along the Gulf Coast, even as far away as Florida. And then also, there's some producer push on a lot of that to get down to markets either off Trunkline or potentially even off FGT. So we're still a way away from that, but we'll remain discussions. And there's a great deal of interest to move more volume, of course, from the growing Haynesville and other areas down to the Gulf Coast.Okay. Great. And second question, I just wanted to follow up on the  2 billion to  3 billion long-term CapEx run rate. And it's obviously very manageable within cash flows for the company, but it's a little higher than what you've spent. You did  2 billion last year and targeting  2 billion for this year. So can you just give some big picture comments on why you'd expect CapEx to potentially go a little higher in the future  And does that reflect bigger projects  Does that reflect -- I think, Tom, you mentioned looking a little more at international, just how you're thinking about that and spending potentially going up a littleYou bet. And like I say, a very good question here on this. When you really look at the scale of Energy Transfer now, the size and then you start looking at all the projects that Mackie previously mentioned, with the existing footprint we have, but also continuing to move downstream with some of the other petchem international, so when you really start looking at all that, we do not have projects that are specifically identified within that. This is a number that we're just using based upon the sheer size that we've become, start running over  13 billion a year. So don't have really a whole lot more description at this point, other than just kind of guiding you toward all the various projects that we have on the drawing board, so to speak.Let me add, if I could, one thing is that we are going to be pretty disappointed if we're not pushing against that  3 billion, because the projects that we're chasing are really good rates of return. And everything that we're chasing has synergistic revenues, not part of the IRRs, both upstream and downstream, in many cases. So from the standpoint, from a commercial perspective, I'm going to be disappointed if we -- if our team DOEsn't push closer to  3 billion or even more at the greatest return that we're targeting.The next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Yes, I wanted to ask about the recent really spike in ethane prices. There's definitely been some issues with processing efficiencies and fractionation facilities being impacted. So just wonder if you can just, a, were any of your facilities impacted by the extreme heat we've seen in the South  And then, b, should we think of this as an event that you probably benefited from  Or could this be a drag on Q3Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, there's a lot of noise made around this that we're a little taking aback by because it really had zero impact on us. We're one of the only -- probably the only company in the U.S. that controls the vast majority of our frac products. So we remain long with everything. That's, of course, why we're expanding our export capabilities, et cetera.But we kind of dug into it. Actually, RVM had a pretty good article. You may be alluding to some of that. We believe it's a combination of a lot of things. What RVM mentioned was a little bit what you said. You have cryos that struggling with heat, production struggles in heat. We've seen pretty excessive heats -- I mean, temperatures. That's been 2  to 3  impact. Frac struggle a little bit more, 5  to 7  of what we've kind of seen on matter or others have seen. There's also kind of a shortage of inventory since that's not really tracked. And some rumors got out that the inventories were really short. And so it's kind of a lot of those factors, but a number of companies, unlike us, that were rejecting. It takes some time to start recovering and figuring out a way to get that to Mont Belvieu. So that took a few days. We also heard there were some crackers out there that were actually selling their ethane because prices have gotten so bad. So it was a pretty short-lived run-up in ethane prices. No impact on us whatsoever or our customers. And so it was just a kind of a conglomeration of a lot of different things that happened over a short period of time.Okay. Good. No, that's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about LPG and ethane exports. It seems like your volumes are still very strong through the first half of the year. What are you expecting for the balance of the year on both LPG and ethane volumes  If you could just speak generally to what you're seeing in those end markets right now.Yes. It's Mackie here. As we look at the future and we look at the negotiations we have going on, we talked about this earlier today. We're in discussions with over 500,000 barrels of ethane demand potentially coming online in the next three or four years. Of that, there's probably 150 to 180 that's highly likely we will contract. So there's a huge demand for ethane.On the propane front, as everybody probably knows, there's a lot of PDHs being built. There's five or six already completed in China, and there's another -- a total of another about 12 more. So there's a lot of propane demand out there and a lot of propane being built. So we are very bullish, of course, that's why we're expanding as quickly as we can, very bullish on volumes increasing, especially at Nederland. We'll always have a little pullback at the Marcus Hook. Because of location up there, a lot of those barrels stay locally, how we are able to take a lot of what flows and take it to much higher-priced market from a margin standpoint. But certainly in the South, we remain very optimistic. We're already seeing volumes stronger next month than we saw here in July. So we remain very bullish not only the next quarter or 2, but bullish long term. There is a significant growth on really everything we do for natural gas liquids. And even gosh, we were talking about oil today. There was more oil consumed in the world last quarter than there've ever been. So the run away from oil and the slowdown oils happening. If anything, it's increasing. So that was a long-winded answer to we remain very bullish.Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Neel Mitra from Bank of America.First question, you obviously have some very capable upstream assets that can be expanded with Gulf Run and Trunkline. Are you looking at expanding those separately from the Lake Charles decision  In other words, if you were to twin those pipelines for other facilities, would you still be able to manage to get the gaps down to Lake Charles in an efficient way so that both sets of projects can workYes, this is Mackie again. Our team is looking to move as much gas through our pipeline network and expand our network to whatever markets there are. So yes, simultaneously with making sure that we will have the pipeline and volume support for LNG once it gets to FID. We also have teams working daily on delivering to other LNG facilities and to other markets everywhere, not only in the Gulf Coast, but where anybody is looking for gas. So yes, we'll continue to chase markets and look to expand the Gulf Run, Truckline, other assets to meet any demands that are out there that we end up contracting.Great. And then for the follow-up, just on your commentary around M A, can you be a little bit more specific  Do you have a preference for asset packages versus corporate M A  Any specific commodities  And then how would you look at your leverage profile  Would you look to go above 4.5 times temporarily if there was something that was attractive  Or would that be kind of the governor that you wouldn't want to exceed that from the very beginningYes. Listen, when we look at these various transactions, whether it be on the company side or whether it be on an asset acquisition, either one of them, we always evaluate how the connectivity is to our current assets. And some of it could be moving maybe a little bit further downstream with value add. But a lot of it, we always evaluate as to the connectivity so that we can get more commercial synergies with the footprint we have. And when you start looking at this across all the commodities, natural gas, natural gas liquids and the crude oil, you can see how we've built the franchise here that we have and being able to take product from wellhead all the way through export facilities. So we're going to continue to look at them on that basis as to where the value comes in.So let's go to the metrics, which is the second part, which really relates to the first part of my question, too, on the answer that I just gave you on that piece of it. And that is the accretion piece of it. And that's how we're able to be able to go in with a lot of these and get the accretion is because of the connectivity and what we're able to do with the product all the way downstream. And so when we will kind of walk through these and evaluate them, we're careful. We're disciplined in how we look at these various commercial synergies, but we have a great team that is able to extract a lot at.But the other component, besides just accretion to a DCF per unit basis, is the leverage. That's the other piece of it. And you'll see, with the transactions we're doing, we will always evaluate these things as to what is the combination of equity and cash that we use. So we don't have intention of going back above from a leverage standpoint. And we think we've got a great currency to be able to work with here. But most importantly, we've got a great team that's able to go in and extract the value as we walk through the integration of our acquisitions.Okay, great. Thank you very much. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.This is Mackie real quick before Tom closes out. I was thinking about, we're meeting with Bill Berg and our team kind of preparation for this. And they made some great points is that -- and everybody knows this, I believe. But Tom mentioned this earlier. We believe we have the best team running any midstream in the United States by far, and a lot of them are sitting in this room. We think we have the best base of business, a very strong base with record volumes in several segments every quarter. We're delivering on the projects that we're building with Gulf Run and Gray Wolf at the end of last year. And then, of course, we just brought on Bear. We're having, once again with Chris Hefty's great efforts around M A. We've got Lotus really kind of kicking in, and then we've got the frac going on. That, combined with strong cash flow stability, our disciplined M A strategy, we are incredibly well positioned for growth. So if you can't tell it in our voices, we are very excited about where we sit, the assets that we have throughout the country and what the future holds for our partnership and really for our industry. So we're pretty excited, if you can't tell in our voices.No, I think that's a wrap, Mackie. Thank you. Appreciate it.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",46,2023-08-02T19:37:05.000-04:00
"Refiners PBF Energy, HF Sinclair rate new Outperform ratings at BMO","PBF Energy  and HF Sinclair  are both initiated with Outperform ratings at BMO Capital, but both oil refiner stocks have recovered only a small slice of their recent declines,  and  respectively in Thursday's trading.PBF Energy  has grownAs more of a pure refiner with more coastal exposure and complexity, driving higher costs, PBF  has greater leverage to cracks, the analyst said, expecting refining margins will remain above mid-cycle in 2024, supporting strong free cash flow and capital returns.HF Sinclair  has lagged peers during the current refining upcycle, with the portfolio undergoing significant change, but Jungwirth said he likes the company s greater scale and business diversification, and expects execution will improve across refining and renewable diesel.HF Sinclair's   premium refining markets provide it with top-tier margins, while low leverage enables strong capital returns, and valuation remains inexpensive,  according to Jungwirth.",3,2023-10-05T15:51:14.000-04:00
Vertex Energy: Transition To Traditional Refiner Hasn't Been Smooth,"With Vertex Energy  dealing with some hiccups with its renewable diesel project and crack spreads narrowing for its conventional refining business, it might be best to wait on the sidelines with the stock for now.VTNRVTRN's Black Oil and Recovery segment, meanwhile, is involved in the recycling and re-refining of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products. The company buys used oil from places such as oil change stations and autoVTNR is going through the process of transforming itself from a re-refining company to a refinery company. In May 2021, the company agreed to purchase the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell  RDS.A  for  75 million. At the time, the company said upon the conversion of the refinery's hydrocracking unit to produce renewable diesel that the refinery could produce  3 billion in revenue and  400 million in gross profits in 2023.This project was expected cost an additional  85 million to complete. The project was neither on time nor on budget, with renewable diesel production starting in Q2 of this year and the project costing over  110 million.Shortly after the refinery acquisition, in June of 2021, the company agreed to sell its 69 million gallon a year used oil refining Marrero facility in Louisiana and its 20 million gallon a year Heartland facility in Ohio to Clean Harbors  for  140 million. The facilities were projected to generate more than  100 million in revenue and at least  15 million in EBITDA. That valued the sale at just over 9x EBITDA.However, the deal was scrapped in January of 2022 following a review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. VTRN then turned around and sold its Heartland facility to GFL Environmental  for  in February of this year. Given that his was the much smaller facility of the two that VTRN was originally selling for  140 million less than two years earlier, this looks like a really good price.The company continues to own the Marrero facility and some other legacy assets. We'll see if the company eventually looks to dispose of it or other assets. I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate the value of Heartland into Marrero, but there does appear to be some nice value there. So there is an opportunity the company could lower debt with some additional asset sales.As of now, though, the company's big bet is on renewable diesel with its project now complete and starting to produce the renewable fuel. However, the company has backed off of earlier predictions, and the economics are still up in the air at this point, as the company ran into some economics on the initial feedstock it planned to use. However, the plant was built to support 8 different feedstocks, so it is currently looking to shift feedstocks.When asked if the company still planned to produce 8,000 barrels of renewable diesel a day, CCO Douglas Haugh answered the question on its , sayingAt this point, there should be a lot of potential with renewable diesel, especially with government credits. The company also has a product supply agreement with a California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan. However, given its commentary, things are not going to be quite as smooth as it originally expected.Outside of renewable diesel, crack spreads and dynamics for VGO will also play a big role in the company's results both on the potential upside and downside. Traditional crack spreads were extremely wide last year, and not surprisingly, have come down this year. They were still well above historical norms in the first half of the year, but have come down significantly recently.This is a big risk for the business at this point, as crack spreads are the biggest driver of a refining business. In fact, VTNR had to lower its guidance ahead of its Q2 report as a result of lower crack spreads and a weak capture rate, as a result of volatile fuel prices.The company also carries a fair amount of debt, with net leverage of 3.6x at the end of Q2. For such a cyclical business coming off peak crack spreads last year, this is something to be aware of in the future, especially since the company's operating cash flow through the first six months of this year was - 111.4 million. Now that its renewable diesel unit is running, this should begin to improve. The sale of the Marrero used oil refinery could potentially lower debt as well.VTNR trades at a 17.3x EV EBITDA multiple based on the 2023 EBITDA consensus of  48.6 million. Based off of the 2024 EBITDA consensus of  149.9 million, it trades at around 5.6x.The company is not projected to post positive EPS until 2025.It's projected to see revenue grow 6  in 2023 and 15.5  in 2024.VTNR's stock generally trades at a premium to other refiners and environmental clean-up companies as well. Much of this is due to an expected large contribution from its renewable diesel operations down the road.While VTNR put out a nice blue sky story with its acquisition of the Mobile refinery and subsequent renewable diesel upgrade capacity, it's been a bit stormy for the stock. With crack spreads down in its conventional business and with the company running into some issues with its initial planned feedstock for the plant not currently being at an acceptable conversion rate, the road ahead remains cloudy.The company has found some lower cost feedstock blends to run through its plant and it was built to be able to use 8 different types, but let's see how the plant running on these feedstocks in action first, as the company hasn't had a smooth ride so far with the plant.In addition, the company has a fair amount of leverage, sitting at 3.6x, and the company is currently burning cash. With conventional crack spreads falling, its leverage can quickly rise if its renewable diesel unit does not live up to expectations.As such, I think there are too many question marks around the stock to invest at this time. I'd keep monitoring the name to see how things progress for the company.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Brookfield Infrastructure Has Tumbled - What Is Next,"I have received several requests to revisit Brookfield Infrastructure   that I covered . Initially, I wanted to do it after the Q3 results. But BIP's drop has been too painful for investors to wait.I issued aThroughout the post, I will be talking about BIP but the analysis is equally applicable to BIPC though it is more expensive and less desirable at least for the US investors.I have also to remind my readers that BIP has alwaysDespite the drop, I consider my recent analysis valid and will not repeat it here. For the reasons I explained in that post, BIP becomes attractive when its yield is above 5 . Currently, it is 1.53 26   5.9  and will become higher when BIP increases its dividend in January - I expect at least a 6  increase.BIP has two types of debt - recourse on the corporate level and non-recourse on the asset level. Corporate debt is more dangerous, and so it represents a small fraction of the total debt  3B of  23B  as seen on the slide below that shows the maturity profile for BIP's proportional debt in millions USD. BIP's debt is mostly investment grade  BIP has a BBB  credit rating for its recourse debt  and  90  of it has fixed interest.The next table shows the proportion of BIP's cash flows used to service debtI marked the most important lines in yellow. All dollar figures are in millions.BIP's average interest rate is growing in line with the general trend. It was 4.9  in 2021, 5.5  in 2022, and 5.8  in H1 2023. Proportional net debt is growing as well due to BIP's growth. Both factors led to the growth in interest expense from  755 in 2021 to  623 in H1 2023. But cash flows have grown as well.Measured against EBITDA, interest expense was 31  in 2021, 33  in 2022, and 36  in H1 2023. This figure also keeps creeping higher though not that fast. However, the actual situation is much better than it seems due to HPC.HPC is a part of BIP's Midstream sector. Here is its description from the Q2 Supplementary   525,000 tonnes per year of polypropylene production capacity in Canada . That's it. BIP's annual report barely mentions HPC at all. We can find slightly more information about HPC in the Q2 Letter to ShareholdersWhile this is not the clearest text, it seems that BIP, so far, has not been particularly successful in launching the plant. HPC produced something in Q1, did not work in Q2 at all, and is supposed to operate at full capacity in Q4. But how big is HPC  I could not find any numbers in the current BIP filings.HPC was the main reason BIP acquired Canadian Inter Pipeline precisely two years ago. Based on my notes regarding this acquisition, HPC was supposed to generate about CAD 450-500M of EBITDA, and the total project cost was estimated at   CAD 4B. 70-85  of EBITDA should be based on long-term  10-year duration on average  contracts that are structurally similar to  take or pay  contracts used for pipelines.My numbers might be not up-to-date but they are still showing the importance of the project. HPC alone should increase BIP's EBITDA by 10  at least. If we further assume that the  4B cost is equally split between debt and equity, HPC consumes more than 10  of BIP's invested capital  displayed in the table above  WITHOUT producing any EBITDA in Q2Above is another slide from the Q2 Supplementary showing the performance of the Midstream segment. If you compare results for three and six months, AFFO in Q1 was  173 vs.  113 in Q2. What is the reason for this difference in the segment that consists mostly of stable pipelines  We can attribute a significant part of it to HPC which was operating at partial capacity in Q1 and was not working at all  being under repair  in Q2.CEO Sam Pollock is counting on quick progress towards the end of 2023 as follows from the slide from recent Brookfield's Investor DayWhy is BIP so shy about HPC and does not mention it directly most of the time  My notes of 2021 indicate that HPC was supposed to be commissioned in early 2022. Probably, full capacity towards the end of 2022 was in the offing back then. I.e. BIP is one year late with this project. Ever upbeat and victorious Brookfield should be reluctant to draw attention to this setback and that may be the explanation.Performing at full capacity, HPC is expected to materially increase cash flows and make interest expense as a share of EBITDA lower or at least comparable to 2021 when interest rates were low  In its turn, this should help BIP to refinance whatever maturities are due.If my analysis is correct, so far leverage has not become more dangerous for BIP despite interest rate increases. While the stock has been trading like utilities recently, its growth potential is superior to the latter. I tend to think that BIP's drop is not justified. Eventually valued by the weighing machine of the market  as opposed to the voting machine in charge currently , the stock should trade higher, perhaps close to a 5  yield. Today it means  1.53 0.05    31 or  33 assuming a 6  distribution bump in January. On the bright side, the stock may revisit the high thirties once interest rates change their direction.At the same time, I am very far from stating that BIP is a low-risk stock - its leverage is still high and will not become lower due to its mode of operation. However, this risk may have failed to increase that much over the last year.So far, we have not even seen any signs of support from its parent. But it might be coming in the form of buying by BN. BIP is quite likely to initiate its buybacks on a more modest level as well.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Diesel Supply Concerns Grow With Russian Export Ban," Russia announced that it would be temporarily banning the export of diesel and gasoline in order to try to take some pressure off domestic fuel prices. The ban comes into effect from 21 September, withThe impact on the middle distillate market has been clear  ICE gasoil settled 4.51  higher on the day of the announcement, whilst the November gasoil crack rallied above  37 bbl at one stage, and the prompt ICE gasoil time spread saw its backwardation widen to more than  35 tonne, highlighting the tightness in the middle distillate market. Russia is a crucial supplier of refined products to global markets, with it exporting in the region of 1MMbbls d of diesel. In fact, Russia is the second-largest exporter of diesel, with just the US exporting larger volumes. As a result, this is a key development as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter, a period where we usually see a seasonal pick-up in demand.The export ban is less concerning for the gasoline market, with Russian exports of gasoline and gasoline components averaging around 145Mbbls d so far in 2023, a loss that the global market should be able to absorb more easily.How severe of an impact the loss of Russian diesel has on the global market will really depend on how long the export ban is in place. Although, given the likely domestic stock build we will see as a result of the ban, we would not expect it to be prolonged.The middle distillate market was already seeing significant strength ahead of this ban with inventories tight in the US, Europe and Asia as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter. There were a number of factors behind this tightness, including OPEC  supply cuts, recovering air travel, limited refining capacity growth, and in Europe, the struggle of being able to fully replace Russian middle distillates after the EU ban came into effect in February.The loss of around 1MMbbls d of Russian diesel in the global market will be felt and only  we have held on middle distillate cracks and as a result on refinery margins. This does leave some upside risk to our view that the ICE gasoil crack would average US 30 bbl for the remainder of the year. How much upside really depends on the duration of the ban.We believe that margins will remain elevated in an attempt to get refiners to increase run rates. However, given that part of the issue is due to constraints in refining capacity as well as tightness in the medium sour crude market, the ability to significantly increase run rates and increase middle distillate supply could be difficult.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras  Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call August 4, 2023 9 30 AM ETJean Paul Prates   PresidentSergio Caetano Leite   Chief Finance and Investor Relations OfficerMaurício Tolmasquim   Chief Energy Transition and Sustainability OfficerJoelson Falcão Mendes   Chief Exploration and Production OfficerCarlos Travassos   Chief Engineering, Technology and Innovation OfficerWilliam França   Chief Industrial Processes and Products OfficerClaudio Schlosser   Chief Logistics, Commercialization and Market OfficerMário Spinelli   Chief Governance and Compliance OfficerGood morning everyone. Welcome to Petrobras webcast with analysts and investors regarding our Results for Q2 of 2023. It's a pleasure to be here today. This event will be presented in Portuguese with simultaneous translation into English. The links for both languages can be found on our Investor Relations page. We would like to inform that all participants will follow the broadcast over the internet as listeners. After our intro, we will have a Q A session where you can send your questions to petroinvest petrobras.com.br.Today with us we have Carlos Travassos, Chief Engineering, Technology and Innovation Officer  Clarice Coppetti, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer  Claudio Schlosser, Chief Logistics, Commercialization and Market Officer  Joelson Falcão Mendes, Chief Exploration and Production Officer  Mário Spinelli, Chief Governance and Compliance Officer  Maurício Tolmasquim, Chief Energy Transition and Sustainability Officer  Sergio Caetano Leite, Chief Finance and Investor Relations Officer  and William França, Chief Industrial Processes and Products Officer. To initiate we will watch a video with a message from our President, Jean Paul Prates.Good morning. It is an honored to be here again to share our results with all of you. It has been six months of achievements and accomplishments, which reflect the quality of the work that we are doing within Petrobras. In thisIn the operational side, FPSO's Anna Nery in the Campos basin and Almirante Barroso in the Búzios field started up production. FPSO's Anita Garibaldi and Sepetiba are expected to join them soon, helping us to continue increasing pre-salt production. The utilization factor of our refineries reached 93  with the highest level since 2015, even with several scheduled shutdowns at our refineries, respecting safety, environment and health issues. And we achieved record sales in the first half with 10-ppm diesel accounting for 62  of the total diesel sales of Petrobras.Regarding Diesel R, which is our diesel with 5  of renewable content, we project to increase our processing capacity by 146  later this year. We increased our investments to  5.7 billion in the first half of the year, and we kept our debt under control at a gross debt of  58 billion while our operating generation reached  10 billion. In the first half of 2023, we continued with our total focus on people. We had an unprecedented initiative with the launch of our diversity supplement to reinforce awareness among our internal public and our society at large. All these results were achieved in the first half of this year represent only the beginning of a journey that will take us increasingly further for our benefit and for the benefit of the shareholders and the society.Thank you very much.Now we will initiate our results of Q2 of 2023. And now I will hand it over to Sergio Caetano Leite.Good morning. I am very pleased to be here today to discuss our results for the second quarter. During this quarter   during this quarter our gross recurring EBITDA was BRL12 billion. This our operational cash flow demonstrates the resilience of our company despite an adverse foreign scenario. We have approximately BRL10 billion, BRL9.6 in operating cash flow. Our debt   our net debt over EBITDA also shows the control of our indebtedness and the financial soundness of our company that would be 0.74 times. Now, the return on capital employed is almost 13 . This is 12.8 . Our net profit totaled  5.8 billion, free cash flow  7 billion, and we continue contributing sustainably. We're promoting inclusive developing paving R 56.1 billion in taxes contributing towards social development. Our dividends totaled  6.2 billion and we have a comfortable cash flow of  15.8 billion. So despite external adversities, Petrobras financial soundness is positive and the results take us this. This is why we're   this is one of the ten best years of the company.Now here you can see the foreign environment. There was a drop in Brent. It was significant. We're talking about the second quarter of 2022,  114 in Brent. Now during this quarter,  78 per barrel, this is the drop of the barrel price was highly significant although the exchange rate is in line with last year's quarter. The drop of Brent is another factor that I will comment subsequently. And this is why this dropped our results, although we continue with sustainable development and the company continues resilient. Our EBITDA demonstrates that we are aligned with the drop of the Brent and the appreciation of the dollar, but there is an important interpretation since the beginning of the year. I mean Q1 and Q2, our adjusted EBITDA is very close, almost at the same level of a recurrent EBITDA or recurring EBITDA. This is because there has been a lower disinvestment program because of our asset portfolio. This   so our company continues adjustment presenting very important value. Below you can see the devaluation of Brent, which impacts significantly our operations.There was a lower Brent reduction in exploration and production. Now, refining and marketing captures the foreign scenario factors. If we consider the EBITDA with a stock turnaround, we have a drop of 33  vis-à-vis Q1 with a replenishment cost, we have an EBITDA minus 42 . Gas and power aligned with the refining area. So we have a 33  drop if we consider the first quarter in comparison to Q2. Now, our cash generation, as I mentioned, continue strong and robust. There was a slight contribution of non-recurring results that are because of the sale of Potiguar and Norte Capixaba Complex our debt management from   allowed us to   to amortize  0.7 million and these are data. This is data that is aligned with the market in reality. In oil and gas, Petrobras has presented one with the best results despite an adverse scenario.Now, when we talk about our debt, there was a slight spike in our total indebtedness because of the freight of Anna Nery and Almirante to Búzios, but our financial debt maintains its dropping trajectory. We drop, we ve lowered 0.6  million in debt. Our gross debt is within the limits that we establish and what we announced in our strategic plan.Now our next slide. Now, portfolio management. This is a question   this is a constant question mark from our investments. We have a dynamic portfolio in Petrobras. So, this means that we are going to work with these divestments with investments and with partnerships. There are assets that are of interest and we can do this through partnerships. So, all our portfolio is being reassessed under a different view. This is a long-term view.In addition or aligned with what we announced regarding the signed contracts for divestments, they remain, there are fields Albacora Leste that was sold in Q1. We have Norte Capixaba cluster or complex or Potiguar Complex.Now, in terms of cash inflow generated from these divestments until June of 2023, we are talking about the end of the second quarter, well, this was  3.5 billion.Well, our net results reflect the stringiness of the market, the drop of the Brent and the appreciation of the dollar vis-à-vis the dollar what is important is the crack spread of the diesel. The market is being pressured by the low offering of Russian diesel dropping 40  will hire operating expenses US 0.4 billion. And this has been reduced to   when we compare it to other quarters.Now, what we give back to society  This is part of our ESG program. It is highly consistent and strong. We give back to society in terms of taxes and we gave back R 56.1 billion.Another important fact was we reviewed the shareholders  remuneration policy. In this policy review   we will maintain important aspects that will guarantee the financial soundness of the company, the control of that. We maintained the same periods, we continue with the same guides of indebtedness. We have a reference, we have our gross debt and how we pay out quarterly our dividends. And we ve reformulated our formula going from 60  to 45  of free cash flow designated to dividend pay-out. This level is in line with the major worldwide enterprises. I am here considering independent enterprises and also state companies.Remuneration to shareholders, I would like to highlight the main dates that were already announced to the market here for the second quarter remuneration. The base data will be August 21. The first tranche will be paid of   the person will be paid November 21 and the second December 15. We continue controlling our debt using capital principle that is part of the guidance of the company. And we continue committed to generate and to distribute value.Now our buyback program. Well, Petrobras is one of the companies that communicates most with the market in Brazil and abroad. These are the shares that are mostly traded abroad. What we do have impacts, and this is why we have to be careful, therefore, our buyback program will start in a conservative fashion. We will buy 157.8 million preferred shares. This will be done with preferred shares, which represent a small amount of these Free Float that would be 3.5 . And this is a pilot program will last around 12 months. So, we expect, to conclude this, we believe that this will not cause major price fluctuation and it s the first share buyback program that Petrobras will use to remunerate their shareholders. So, these   so they can be bought in parcels.So what this domain highlights, here, you can see more in our IR sites.And now I will give the floor to Maurício Tolmasquim, Chief Sustainability and Transition Officer.Foreign LanguageBut I am just giving you a general overview. So here we see a lower emission rate of greenhouse gases in refining. Since the beginning of the operation, which was in 2019, we signed the first charter contract for hybrid support vessels, meaning using batteries and marine fuel. This allowed us to reduce emissions by about 15 . We certified our energy production through I-REC, renewable energy certificate guaranteeing that 100  of the electricity purchased in   was generated by renewable sources. And we invested BRL 200 million in a new gas treatment system at REPLAN and REFAP, which reduces emissions in particulate matters, which have a negative health impact. So these are Scopes 1 and 2, meaning decarbonizing the company's processes. In Scope 3 which refers to products with a lower carbon footprint.Our goal is to expand our diesel production capacity with renewable content by 2023, especially through processing. So this was authorized by ANP to operate another unit with REPAR, expanding our production to 12 million liters per day. We signed a cooperation agreement and we began a new test with, for maritime transport with a chartered vessel from Transpetro, which has 24  renewable content, which also allows us to reduce emissions by about 17 . So those were the highlights I had for you, and I'll pass it over to my colleague here, Joelson.Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. We're going to start by discussing the growth of our operated production in the second half, or excuse me, in the first half of 2023, we have seen significant growth. There was a slight reduction from the first quarter to the second, which is expected considering our maintenance operations, which had been programmed and planned. Our own production is also in line with what we had planned. It seems like we are going to finish the year along what we have planned without major issues and in line with what happened in the second quarter of 2022.Our pre-salt owned production as expected had a significant increase, which represents 78  of our own production already with more than 2 million barrel equivalent from coming from pre-salt. Next slide, please.In Buzios, we have a relevant production level. We are producing 800,000 BOEDs total. It's very significant and due to the relevance of this production. In five years only, we have an accumulated production of 1 billion barrels of oil, which was much faster than what we did in Campos Marlim in the 2P field as well. So it's extremely significant how quickly we were able to grow our production from Buzios with these five units, which are the five original units foreseen, we have an additional six that will produce oil in excess to this. Next slide, please.Another important activity that we had during the second quarter was returning all of our production from the Bahia Terra Cluster. We had to adapt our production there according to the new requirements from the ANP. And we had a long contact with them with the risk analysis for all of the activities needed. And it was a new outlook on safety and how our activities are done. So next slide, please.At the end of last year, we also participated in a bid round and we were able to acquire three important blocks in investment of over BRL 700 million in the Norte de Brava field, which is the most significant one in investments. We acquired 100  of it and it's close to an area where we are already in production, which is very important. We want areas where we already have an infrastructure that can be used. Also, Água Marinha, we had some partners there and also Sudoeste de Sagitário with other partners.So this consolidates our exploration strategy with profitable assets close to our activities in borders that we already know very well. There are other frontier areas in Brazil, but these are well-known areas where we can produce with lower extraction costs and certainty of that exploration area. We're very confident that we're going to get good results from these areas, and we're planning to start this exploration next year. Wells are planned for 2024. Next slide, please.Within our strategy of recovering more and getting more value from the assets that we have, we concluded a major seismic survey in Tupi and Iracema through partnerships. So this is a major area. We have very high quality images, which will allow us to plan how this area will be explored. And of course, this is a deep conversation that we're having with the ANP to decide how we can have another production in this area. So it was an extension and we expect this to have a lot of value for Petrobras and for Brazil if we can increase the prediction time in these areas. Next slide.This slide shows the extraction cost for pre-salt, which is in line with what we had during the first quarter in mature areas deep waters and shallow waters. Naturally, we would see lifting costs go up. There's a reduction in production due to the depletion of these fields, and there are also need other associated costs. So the total cost of oil produced is quite significant for our financial results around  35 per barrel, which is in line with what we had been expecting considering all of these production changes that make us very competitive. That's my last slide, so thank you very much and I'll pass it on to Marcos  ph  Travassos. Thank you.Thank you, Joelson. Good morning. So I'm going to start my presentation here by discussing some of the advances that we had in technology. Our company has the highest number of active patents in Brazil, over 110,000. So for the second year in a row, we had a record number of patents licensed. 214 were made available for licensing, so we're made available to the market. During this time, we received some awards related to innovation. We received the MIT Award as one of the most innovative companies in Brazil. There's no ranking, but we are among the top most innovative companies. There we also received the Elite Awards in Nevada and the U.S. for our HAZOP program, and we also received the Valor Inovação Award as the one of the most innovative oil and gas companies in the world and the second most innovative company in Brazil across all industries.It's our best historical result and it's a very relevant and important award for us. It shows that we're really valuing innovation, which is so important for transformation. This is what the company has been doing and has been getting prepared for. The next slide will show some of these innovations.You can see our FPSO all electric. And the next project will include our combined cycle technology. So we're going to use all of the technology that we have in our units to reduce our emissions rate. We also saw some advances in remote operating marine technologies. We have artificial intelligence being used by these drones, onshore monitoring as well. We also advanced through our PEP70 Well Efficiency Program. Our goal is to reduce the cost of each well in pre-salt and PEP70 was our goal, which is to reduce values of about a  100 million to  70 million. So we concluded this program achieving these results.And downstream as Tolmasquim has said, we also had an agreement for industrial scale tests to produce bio-aromatics in Riograndense refinery based on vegetable oils. So we were able to get plant-based products and next year they will be processed and tested, which can be very important for our refineries as we ll increase our FCC load through plant-based oils also generating products with a lower carbon footprint.We advanced in our robotics program. So to the right, you see our Petrobot, which is in testing for equipment inspection. And finally on the right, we have our fire fighting robot created in a partnership with some startups, which is now being tested in a smaller version to be used in our platforms.Next slide, please. This slide discusses some of our projects. At the center, we see Almirante Barroso, which is five, we started our operation there on March 25. Then on  indiscernible  with production ramp up. To the right, we see the auction for the P-32 area to find a sustainable density for this platform. We had 31 new wells in operation in the first half of 2023, an increase of 25  in their interconnection.And you can see the whole of P-78. This is our first project after we revitalized and reinvigorated our hiring strategies. So this is our own area that s going to operate in the Búzios field. We also have FPSO Sepetiba in MERO 2, which is headed towards Brazil. It s close to South Africa and expected to arrive by September. This will be our last unit to go into operation in 2023.And we also have FPSO Anita Garibaldi, and its last few stages to go into production and it will start its operations in August. So Anita Garibaldi is the second unit that will go into operations in the Marlim Sul field. Also, we re announcing that we re publishing today the Barracuda REVIT. So this is a call for bid for a production unit that has the capacity of 100,000 barrels. And this is also a part of our renewal program for Bacia de Campos.The next slide shows some of the advances that we have downstream. We had some significant advances to expand and modernize our refinery. We also published today an auction for the second train for RNEST. We re going to increase our processing capacity for that refinery from 115,000. This revamping will increase it by 15,000 and we expect to have 130,000 more in the second cycle.So the processing capacity will be 260,000 barrels of oil per day and it will generate 30,000 jobs in direct and indirect employment in  indiscernible . We also see our coke drums at RBPC, which is a very challenging project. It was the biggest implementation that they ever had there, and they   it was revitalized and modernized in our coking activity there.Here we have our image of acid water in the REPLAN treatment plant. Here we will add 10,000 cubic meters diesel. The works is according to the deadline. And here we also recently celebrated the deployment of the Reduc HDT work. This was a REVAP work where we added a new reactor. The one that you can see and hit this, we will have more diesel in Reduc. And the last image you can see GASLUB. We resumed the work of GASLUB. I have to register in record time. The last time that there was a shutdown, we needed 30 months for analysis and for a new bid.And now we ve resumed the GASLUB works in only six months with engineering contracts, with building assembling contracts and other contracts. We are here in Itaboraí, in the UPG work in GASLUB. And all GASLUB   and GASLUB, we started the UTE. This is a project that is conditioned to an auction and we will present a proposal throughout 2024. But we ve started the contract. This is a demand for these types of auctions for this thermal plant unit.And here I end my presentation and I will give the floor to the Chief Industrial Processes and Products Officer, William França.Thank you, Travassos. Can you hear me  Can you hear me and see me  Yes. So during this quarter, our results were excellent in terms of operation in our natural gas plants and refining our natural gas plant had high results here the best in the history, the sustainability plant excellent.We also had a burning rate that this measures the quality of decarbonization in our natural gas area. We had very good burning rates. This means that we re evolving in energy efficiency lowering our carbon footprint, which is very positive. Well, I m sorry, I didn t say good morning to everyone. Now, in our refineries, our utilization factor was 93 .This is a result of our planning and logistics and marketing and allowed us to increase the utilization factor guaranteed by the excellent operational availability of our assets. Here you can see our refineries, therefore, this is a very good result. The best result since 2015. This is the best result in the history of refining pre-salt oil in refinery input. We are almost 70  the oil that comes from pre-salt. We are increasing the share of pre-salt in the processing of our unit.We increased gasoline days almost 70  and this result was positive because we ended the REVAP, Reduc, REPLAN shutdown and RPBC although there were shutdowns in the refineries, we achieved this result. This means that we can make even more progress in the utilization factors of our refineries during the second semester.William, your microphone is muted.Our result of oil byproducts highlighting diesel oil, once again, we achieved a record in with 2.11 million cubic meters of produced diesel and we will reach another record in July with 2.38. Here we have 2.38 million and then we will outperform in August because we started at the end of July with the 700. Our unit was readapted. We included another reactor and other offsite accessories says that here we have offsite structure to produce diesel with 4,000 cubic meters a day and due to our operational availability and the trust on the unit, we will outperform and we will outperform July and this is due to the excellent working structure of our commercialization area.This is Tolmasquim mentioned, we have excellent result in gas emission in emission intensity. Here, we had 103.7 results and we reached 102 in region. That is the best historic result in all refining. We're close to the standard number achieved by refineries. There are refineries with something lower than 90 like RefTOP.So emissions intensity Tolmasquim in June, we had the best historic result in terms of CO2 with 37.2. This shows that we are evolving in trust, increasing utilization factor, and lowering our carbon footprint regarding the assets of our refineries. Your microphone is closed once again. Now I would like to broaden refining to implement.So we are studying some robotics sales in our company. We are working firmly in our decarbonization process. So thank you everyone. And I'll now pass it over to my friend, my longtime friend, 36 years Director, Claudio Schlosser.Thank you, William, and everyone else. It's a great pleasure to be here. I'm talking about the highlights of the office and we're going to start with this slide, presenting sales of derivatives in our market. Our oil product sales, which had an increase versus 2022. We had some effects that led to this. One of them was the higher competitiveness for gasoline. We also had LP seasonality   LPG seasonality and diesel. This diesel effect was partially offset   because during this time, we saw a higher rate of diesel mix-ins from 10  to 15 . This happened in mid-April.So if we look at the data from the second half of 2022, we were very aligned despite these divestments in the Reman refinery in Amazonas. One item that was mentioned by William was the excellent result of availability, which led to historical levels in refinery availability, which really supported the sales of these oil products.As a consequence, we had lower margins, but our margins were still above our historical levels. This increase in refinement allowed us to capture this margin across all of our industries. So it reduced oil exports and we allowed the country to process more oil. As another highlight, gasoline sales grew 5  this quarter. It happened, especially due to the higher competitiveness against our main alternatives for clients.And in addition to that, we had an increase in fuels for light vehicles, that is automobiles, motorcycles. Gasoline had more competitiveness versus hydrated ethanol due to tax reasons. This can be explained by tax reasons. And just for your reference, Petrobras Gás participation in the second half of 2022 was 40.3 , and in the second quarter it was 42.3 . And it shows how we have significantly evolved during this cycle.Looking at the foreign market, we had higher exports due to our production of oil products and our availability. Due to the concentration of programmed downtime during the first half of 2023 in refinement. Next slide, please.So this slide discusses oil sales. There was a reduction in exports, which was expected due to this increase in availability in the refinery park and the higher utilization of pre-salt oil in refinery loads. And this adds a lot of value to how these assets are generating value. We had about 150,000 barrels per day produced nationally in comparison to other quarters.Another point that allows us to understand this variation was the inventory in the first quarter. So it was favor in the first quarter, because we were carrying out some ongoing exports from the previous year, which ended up being carried out in the first quarter. So that had an impact of a 100,000 barrels a day.Next slide please. The next topic is the approval of the new commercial strategy. This was widely communicated, and I'd like to take this opportunity to underscore that this was a very positive change for Petrobras. We started having more room to work in our commercial strategy, and of course, this is aligned with the best production conditions, our refinement assets, the use of our logistical assets to have much more competitive prices and to be able to compete in markets that add value to the company.So overall, this measure optimizes our refinement and logistics assets. Another essential value that was reported in this strategy was the mitigation of volatility peaks, which gives our clients a more stable price environment. This allows us to work in balance with the international market in a way that is sustainable and profitable. Next slide, please.This is my last slide in the presentation. It was widely discussed and presented by Tolmasquim, our Director. And I'd just like to underscore our hybrid vessel. Not only does it reduce emissions, but it also reduces costs. And this is a part of our offense a lot program, which is focusing on better reliability and safety, but also in logistics costs.So this was an important effort that was carried out. We are advancing significantly in reducing emissions. And I can also mention the new test that we are performing using 24  biodiesel produced from plant sources. And there's also a pioneer process of green recycling of one line, which is following international ESG best practices.So that's all we had to say. Thank you for your attention and we'll give the floor back to Carlos.Thank you, Schlosser. And we're now going to begin the questions and answer session. The first question we got was from Vicente Falanga from Bradesco BBI. And he asks, Sergio. Sergio, how do you see the company's minimum optimal cash  28 billion  Can you work with less than thatHello, Vicente, I hope you are doing well. Well, we are still creating a strategic plan for 2024 to 2028. As you know, these answers will be addressed in the projections that will happen in this plan. But I'd like to remind you that our   the minimal cash is  5 million in our PO. So our reference is  8 billion. So this is well in line. That's our idea. We want to keep it like that. Thank you.Thank you, Sergio. The next question was also asked by Vicente. It's a question for Schlosser. Schlosser, Petrobras is selling gasoline below marginal levels. For how long does the pricing committee believe that this kind of discount will be sustainable for  Schlosser, you have to turn on your microphone.Thank you, Carlos. Vicente, thank you for your question. As we presented before, the essential value of our commercial strategies based on three points to be competitive, having competitive prices for our clients and generating assets through marginal value. And another very important value is international volatility. So we re providing to our clients price stability. What we re seeing right now is a lot of uncertainty about the global economy. And this affects the demand for energy, how much is expected and the supply of oil and fuel due to these geopolitical issues, the Ukraine war. So this short-term combination of factors led to high volatility in the market. The reference levels adopted by the international market fluctuated wildly.And another important point is an inflow of Russian products to Brazil. Our monitoring shows that in July, Russian diesel was over 80  of our production in Brazil. So we re monitoring the market every day and whenever it s necessary, we ll have readjustments in our commercial strategy. Obviously, we can t advance these decisions yet, so thank you for your question, Carlos.Next question from Gabriel Barra from Citibank for Joelson. Joelson, could you elaborate on the information regarding the government discussions and with the environmental authority regarding the   first Amazonas the margin equatorial development  How much will you invest in exploration and development  Could Suriname and Guyana be an alternative for long-term investmentsThank you, Gabriel, for your question. Well, the portfolio management   margin has five basins that goes from Rio Grande do Norte until the Amazon basin in Amapá. So we initiated our environmental licensing projects in two basins for Amazon and Portuguese in a sequence of wells, one in Amazon and another wells in the Portuguese basin. And we already supplied all the information requested by IBAMA for these two areas, these two licensing processes already from Petrobras  point of view. And we have let the government view the   the government is informed by all of our actions and we have exchanged information with IBAMA that is environmental agency trying to ask questions.In July, we ended this communication. So now this is being analyzed by IBAMA. We have no pending issues and we depend   we don t have to give any more information. Regarding investments, well, we expect in our planning and 16 wells in the five basins in five years, this is an exploratory investment of US 3 billion in these areas. All the areas here in Latin America and also Western Africa are of our interest because they re similar to our activities. We have planned exploratory activities for Columbia next year in Suriname, Uruguay and Africa.Our exploratory team is in communication and is paying attention to auctions and is talking to partners. These are areas where we will possibly invest, but this is still under negotiation and we have to wait for the end of these negotiations. We are reassured that this year we will be able to initiate one of the most advanced basins in terms of licensing process and this would be a first well.So thank you very much Joel. So we have an additional question from Gabriel Barra about Braskem. According to there is a discussion regarding the cell of Braskem and some are interested in buying the control of a company. Could you give us the view of the management regarding the prospects for the oil sector and investment  Should this be a long-term focus for Petrobras, the petrochemical sector  As he s facing technical problems, we will go to the next question and Sergio will answer the question about Braskem.Can you hear me  So thank you. Thank you for the question. Braskem is appearing in the media. The operators are questioning these proposals together with a partner. In our strategic plan, they mentioned the management of the company   I m sorry, we re having sound problems. I would like to apologize. We re receiving very choppy sound. This is a business that makes sense for our company in the mid and the long run.Thank you, Sergio. The next question from Bruno Montanari, Morgan Stanley and it s for Schlosser. Regarding the company s commercial policy, there are questions regarding market international reference with dispersion and parity accounts that go from 10  to 30  currently. Now, naturally each player has a cost structure which hinders the comparison. Now from the Petrobras system point of view, could you mention in average where the price of the company is when we compare to the marginal bands and the cost of the clientBruno, thank you for your question. Here we have the opportunity to reflect on each one of the agents that perform in the Brazilian market. For instance, you are talking about a parity, the dispersion of the educators just demonstrates how the supply alternatives are different or can be different depending on the scale, infrastructure, logistic costs. And this is all reflected on the efficiency of this agent. And when they import certain byproduct in terms of Petrobras, we also have our own costs and productions opportunities and also the import and export fronts of oil or fuel.Our efficiency is significant because we ve implemented this type of logistic. So when we implement this commercial strategy, we already incorporate within it all of these elements. These are the elements, these are differential, a competitive elements of Petrobras. So we have the best production conditions and logistic conditions. And this is one of the elements of our commercial strategy as a competitive price mitigating market volatility as we see currently as we mentioned.Now regarding the current positioning of the price, regarding reference marginal value, we cannot disclose this because we would expose data that is very sensitive for the company from the competition point of view. So this is it.So thank you very much Schlosser. The next question is for you from Bruno Montanari regarding the commercial policy. Assuming that the independent importer is in competitive in terms of price, how can the company believe that the market will balance from here and due to the structural need to import diesel and gasoline  Can import   can Petrobras import with a competitive margins  What about Russian diesel with the company consider importing Russian diesel for the marketWell, now regarding the market balance, it is very important to remember that the greatest diesel importers and gas for Brazil are the distributing companies. They make up their mix with different suppliers nationally, international and this from different origins. This could be Russia. When we analyze the month of July, we can see that over 80  of the imported diesel by third parties to Brazil came from Russia.This is a product that presents certain restrictions from sanctions, but it has flown in the international market. Now from our side, we are meeting the commitments with our customers. We are optimizing our refining complex, broadening the use of our cluster and our logistic assets and complementing our national offering with very specific imports. Petrobras tries to operate   to optimize its operations of foreign trade to use its logistic capacity and analyzing the synergies of its assets with this what happens at the end of the line. With promising results is that we practice competitive margins regarding the margins offered by other players that are not integrated.So regarding opportunities import of Russian diesel, we are constantly assessing the risks and returns. As I said, there are particularities regarding the sanction and this is why we observe closely the sanction loss regarding Petrobras Global activities. So thank you, Schlosser.The next question from Bruno Amorim from Goldman Sachs. And this is geared to Sergio regarding the dividend policy. The new policy was very clear, but this means that all no free cash flow will be for dividend payout and by batch, can you pay an extraordinary dividends at the beginning of next year due intend to draw the net debt of the company.Thank you for your question. In reality, our dividend payout policy is similar to our past policy. We're have   they're having problems with the sound again, can you hear me  Well, your audio is a little bit choppy. Well, unfortunately the sound of my laptop isn't very good. As I said, the current policies anticipate the payout of extraordinary dividends. So yes, we expect to payout these dividends. The decision is going to depend on the technical analysis of the company in the short, mid and long run. And then the analysis of certain adjustments and now these adjustments will be concentrated at the end of the year when we have a general outlook of the results of the company throughout the entire year.Now, regarding the net debt, the financial that is dropping our debt is impacted by the charter, but it's at a comfortable level regarding RPL  ph  and the levels are very, are according to what we expect in our strategic plan. But we also follow up. There could be a fine tuning throughout our next strategic plan. And thank you for your question. Thank you, Sergio.The next question from Lilyanna Yang from HSBC. And she said, in this management, will Petrobras in take their investments to a new level  Can you talk about the strategic view regarding energy transition  Could you elaborate on the rationale in expanding investments in biofuel and negotiations with you Unigel  And when can we expect an announcement about complete strategic plan for 2024 between 2028Now Tolmasquim and William have the floor in order to answer the question.I am going to start talking about energy transition and biofuels and then I will give it back to William that who will talk about fertilizers and Unigel and he will give us necessary information. So thank you very much for this question. There are three main reasons why Petrobras will embark in the biofuel business.Number one, will be that Brazil is one of the countries with the greatest amount of available land water. And so these three factors together, there are very few countries that present these three factors together. Number two, is that despite the electrification of a number of transportation means all the logistic of the country is for liquid fuels. So to use biofuel, well you leverage the existing logistic factor.Number three, is highly connected to Petrobras that is that we can use or we can adapt the existing refining units to produce this biofuel. So Petrobras has a comparative advantage when we compare it to other players, because these are adaptations of existing units and Petrobras has an excellent trajectory in all segments in highway transportation. It's to put the vegetable oil in would be between 5 , 7  together with oil and this is produced through treatment. They produce diesel and therefore this is a patent from  indiscernible  from the research center.Then we have air transportation with the unit that is dedicated where you can only use vegetable oil and then you can produce fuel and there will be a major demand throughout the world as of 2027, because there is a mandate that all companies will have to decarbonize themselves as of this period. There will be SAF, there will be a worldwide demand for SAF and Petrobras has an advantage. Maritime transportation where we mentioned we are carrying out a experience of vessels that combine biodiesel to their   and we also have a biodiesel production and we produce the bunker and that there is an advantage here.And finally, the petrochemical industry, which is a major trend, how to pro   produce plastics. So there is a test that will be performed in the Rio Grande density refinery using bio oil and vegetable oil. Therefore, from the strategic point of view, if there is a country that has to embark in biofuel is Brazil. And if there is a company that has to embark in biodiesel in Brazil, it's Petrobras, because precisely we have all the refining investments and therefore it is possible to adapt their   our refining unit. Now, I will give it back to William that is in charge of refining and he will talk about fertilizers and he will answer the question about Unigel.So thank you very much Lilyanna. Thank you for your question. It is interesting when you ask this number one that the verticalization is important when you see how things compliment themselves. I'm talking refining, petrochemical and the fertilizing production   fertilizer production. So we are studying fertilizers. We are analyzing the return of the company to fertilizers. We are already working with a working troop coordinated by the officers in order to start up this. There is an advantage that it doesn't need natural gas. It could use asphalt residue from Repar. So the refinery from Paraná compliments and lanza  ph  that is right beside the refinery. Therefore we are assessing the economic feasibility as you mentioned to start UFN-III, we have a work, this is a gas plant with 80  that is 80  mechanic. We are studying how we complete UFN-III Três Lagoas that will have capacity of 3,200 tons day of urea of ammonia. So we are also, we compliment   we, gas no where we have, we will have the production of lubricant using oil gas from Reduc. There's a plant that will start in the middle of the year. And in this plant we will have a CO2 plus production. Now the CO2 plus this is rich in raw material to produce a ethane to polypropylene. We have a non-compete with Braskem  ph  but because of this Braskem is very important as Sergio mentioned. So it will be very important here due to the important, the size and the integration of Braskem with this process.So the integration with the refining industries is very important because they supply enough the natural gas, because of our refineries, are right beside our couplets like a Massad Rio de Janeiro  indiscernible  there is a strong integration with raw material petrochemical lubricants, and also fertilizers, well, where gas lube will have remaining of 2 million cubic meters of gas that we will be able to use for fertilizers as well for an addition integration for a Biofine plant using totally green raw material and producing biodiesel. Diesel are 100 and our SAF, our Sustainable Aviation Fuel, what is this  This is the use of a refined hydrogen with green raw material.We will carry out a test in November in the Riograndense refinery with Ultrapar and Braskem. This is a green refinery. We will have 2,000 tons of soybean in our catalytic cracking unit to produce green NAFTA and green propane. We re talking about raw material that comes from renewable sources for petrochemical plants. And this will be successful. This is an international patents. We trust  indiscernible  and this will be the first totally green refinery in the country. So we are complementing petrochemical, biorefining lubricants, fertilizers, and refining. Thank you for the question.Thank you, Tolmasquim. Thank you, William. And the next question will be asked by Rodrigo Almeida from Santander Bank for Schlosser and William again. After nearly three months of the new pricing policy being announced, what advances have you made in gaining competitiveness for the company considering the competition with Russian diesel  How are internal production costs and commercial costs changed with the increase in production  Is there any significant cost dilution  How has the company dealt with a higher production of products that have a limited demand in the domestic marketRodrigo, our entire commercial work as its starting point, a planning process that is quite complex. It involves over a 100,000 variables, 40,000 restrictions. So it s a very complex process, but what I can tell you is that I joined the company 36 years ago and our process was exactly that it was based on that foundation. And not only Petrobras, companies around the world are adopting this planning mechanism and it takes into consideration, for example, the production of each kind of oil per refinery per unit. And it also uses all of the logistics restrictions which are also placed there. And why do we depend on the model  What information do we get from itAs a final result, we optimize our refinement and logistics assets. So what we re seeking are economic assessments for each of our operations and for each production alternative that we have, both taking oil to some refinery or exporting it. Similarly, following this planning model, we have different production fronts from all sorts of oil products. It analyzes changes in quality. So its entire goal is to find a more efficient process. So the utilization of our refineries and increasing production was supported by these economic assessments and they had a very positive result for the company.Considering costs as you mentioned, I would draw your attention to this. Most of the costs or the cost of the product sold is mostly including the entire business, a result of the raw material oil. If we add in the energy it takes for it to be produced, then it s basically over 90 . So the dilution effect is basically in existence. So we don t really take it into consideration in our planning and optimization plans. So in the operational plan, we don t take this into account. A lot of it is connected to the bread I don t know if William has any comments about this, but I ll pass it over to him.Thank you, Claudio. Yes, that was a good question, Rodrigo. Thank you. To add to what Claudio said, our refinery cost has a synergy across all of our refineries. Some of them have a higher cost due to their complexity location, and others have a lower cost. But since there is a synergy across all kinds of refinement, our cost is about  2 or  2.5 per barrel, which is quite reasonable considering our refinement. And even considering the last program to down style   downtime which increased our cost, we were able to keep that stability around  2 to  2.5 per barrel. And I d also like to highlight this. We re getting very good utilization factors around the level of 93  to 95 . In May, we had 95 . In June, we were able to stay at 93 . Obviously, this depends on planning as was said. So planning is what is going to define what load is received in each refinery, the different products of course.And obviously, we have availability, which is a significant factor. Looking at our systems, they have a certain maximum load, but we also have maximum loads that are adjusted and authorized by agencies. So it defines the maximum loads that we have with environmental agencies. So this is due to planning and we hope to work at 95 or even a bit higher, but of course it will depend under the pan demand of our logistics provider. Thank you.Thank you, William. The second question from Rodrigo is from Sergio, and he asks about capital allocation. So Sergio, I d like to understand if the additional project for energy transition being studied are influencing your minimal cash and your reference cash indications that you passed to us before. In theory, the company will conclude 2023 with cash levels above the indications that we have for the minimum and for the reference. And it would be interesting to learn a bit more about what will be done with this excess cash on the short term.Hi, Rodrigo. Thank you for that question. As I said before, we are at a very comfortable position in cash. We don t have on the horizon any sort of radical changes to manage excess cash. And excess cash can be used to pay additional dividends. It can become additional dividends. If the administrators understand that that s the best use for our capital. So thank you very much again.Thank you, Sergio. Still on this topic. We got a question from Pedro Soares from BTG Pactual addressed to you. He would like to know a bit more about extraordinary dividend payouts. We know that this possibility is established in our payout policy, but we would like to hear from you if it would make sense to have a new statutory reserve to use resources to expand the company or if that doesn't make any sense  And if there's an extraordinary payout, will it only be defined when we receive results from the fourth quarterHi, Pedro. Thank you for your question. So some of it has been addressed in the previous answer, but yes, the extra results may be used for payouts extraordinary or additional payouts. But if a reserve is created considering what you said, since it doesn't exist yet, it would need to be approved by an extraordinary shareholders meeting and we would need to have a justification for it but it is feasible. Connected to   but it needs to be connected to shareholders and their interests need to be representedThank you, Sergio. The next question is from Monique Greco from Itaú BBA. And it will be addressed to Spinelli. So Spinelli, can you tell us a bit about the first impressions you've had since you took on this position  And if you can tell us what has been your focus in your officeI'm Mário, thank you. Good morning and thank you for your question. I knew this office because I was an ombudsman for the company for nearly six years. So we have a governance system at Petrobras, which has already been robust but can be strengthened. Our compliance participates in decision making processes. So whatever decisions are received by the Board are examined by our governance department. And when it comes to compliance, we also have a very robust system and this is paying attention to new challenges.So in our compliance department, we have been looking at all acquisitions of sexual harassment in the company, which is very important even for our reputation. So we're going to try to make compliance come closer to the business working with our managers. And similarly, it's important to highlight that when we need to work with a more repressive initiative we just had the 10-year anniversary of the Anti-Corruption Act in Brazil. But you have to know that Petrobras is the company that most uses more   most enforces this Act that most punishes for corruption.Of course, we don't want it to happen when it does   when it does happen we need to punish it. So over  90 million have been applied in fines to companies, there has been a volume of sanction applied to all levels of the government and Petrobras represent 21  of them. So I had the opportunity of working with this Bill, and I'm very happy to see how Petrobras is using it. And the most important part is that 61  of these sanctions or the initiative is being enforced by us, by our Directors. So identifying regularity was done by the manager itself, which shows that our compliance culture is being spread across the company. So these are some of our results and future challenges. Thank you.Thank you, Spinelli. The next question from Monique will be asked to William. William, even with the maintenance carried out in the last quarters, the company has maintained high utilization levels for its refineries. Is there still some space to increase these utilization rates  And what would be the desired level for a refinery or for the entire refinery structureWell, I've answered a similar question to that, but I'll add-in some information. We've been able to get very high utilization factors increasing availability.Sorry, your microphone was closed, William.So as I said, we have higher availability in our refineries considering our commercial and logistical plan, but there's an essential factor here. We need to, well, we have good availability, but we have to ensure that all aspects are respected including safety, environment, integrity and that includes diversity. So we've talked about diversity before and we need to maintain the same levels. So we're very happy to say that we have recordable incident rates in our refinery infrastructure of 037  ph , which is the global benchmark.Of course, we can't rest on those laurels. We know that SMS is a running truck. You always have to pay attention to the brake because if you let go, it will go down. So you always have to keep attention and respect all of the procedures that will ensure that your activities are done safely, respecting the environment, respecting people, their global health and with integrity. Okay, Monique so it's very important to highlight that operational results are important, but they need to be done sustainably. Thank you for your question.Thank you, William. We're going to repeat Gabriel Barra's question about Braskem to Sergio since he had a technical issue. Sergio, there's a discussion on selling Braskem and some people are interested in buying it. So can you give us the management's take on these investments in the petrochemical industry  Should this be one of the company's long-term focusesGabriel, thank you. We didn't get enough sound during the first part of my answer, but around May, we launched a review of the company's strategic directives and this guides a new plan, which is ongoing. It takes one-year to generate these strategic plans, so it's at the end of its conclusion. So with diversification for petrochemicals and fertilizers, this will allow us to look at petrochemicals differently. So it's also important to see that major integrated companies have a strong position in petrochemicals. Petrobras has a strong stake at Braskem because we understood that petrochemicals were important to develop our business as a whole.So this integrion provides value and there's a matter of long-term security here, since the long-term scenario is lower, margins for example, for gasoline. So we will require oil to be used in more noble purposes. So if you consider these three things that Braskem has a strategic compliance, allowing it to or determining it to diversify in the petrochemical industry. If you look at the medium- and long-term perspective and the importance for the resilience of our business, yes, we can consider that petrochemicals are very attractive and aligned to our long-term strategy. Thank you for your question.The next question is from Luiz Carvalho from UBS to Schlosser. He's asking for the national spread of gasoline on Brent was at negative levels. Other local products could export diesel at these levels, but from our understanding both points represent that the company is below the marginal price levels. So how do you understand this  Does this assumption make sense  Can Petrobras be below its pricing interval exporting for a marginal value  Does that make sense for the companyThank you, Luiz for your question. This topic involves marginal values for Petrobras. So as a highlight   I d like to highlight that this is the result of a complex operational plan, as we said before, involving different areas and the alternatives that we have to run our business. What I would add about to what has already been said is that basically refining is a joint process. So when you re refining a bear of oil, you re not producing a single product. You have a basket of gas products, and the relationship between them influences the marginal value of one to the other.So to summarize it for these reasons, the marginal values is not limited to exportation. It involves production, importing the products. So it cannot be only compared to exportation. And the other value that we have to highlight here is the mitigation due to volatility peaks in the market. We have a very volatile market. If we looked at the previous strategy, Petrobras would make these adjustments immediately for this volatility, and would provide stability for their clients. So we were able to overcome this moment and we re still monitoring the domestic and international markets. And when we have to adjust the prices up or down, we will according to technical parameters in our commercial strategy. CarlosThank you, Schlosser. The next question from Luiz Carvalho is for Sergio, and it asks about the strategical plan. Sergio, the strategical plan included diversification. Now, as the plan is being developed, what have been your focus in your internal discussions  Will you make more organic investments, or is there a procedural for mergers and acquisitions  How much diversification is the company considering 6  or 15  of the CapEx direction for low carbon  Would that also include these activities, petrochemicals, renewable developments, or should we see new investments in M AsThis range between 6  and 15  is specific for energy transition in the world. There is a business of low carbon actions and initiatives of low carbon. Today, 6  that we see in the CapEx, the use of 6  of Petrobras CapEx is US 4.4 billion. And it is used, and it is part of our way of operating internally, decarbonizing our operations. And this has been successful. We are amongst the greatest investors in decarbonizing the operations of oil and gas. Now it s obvious that Petrobras has to recover a space that was left behind. We did go toward Scope 3 of decarbonization, and there is this range. We establish this rate between 6  and 15 , specifically for energetic transition, decarbonization of our operations and new investments. Any M A that emerges in the area will fit within the range between 6  and 15 . It has to be within the range of CapEx allocation.Now for these new investments, Petrobras has decided the upper management has decided to embark in partnerships with big companies like Petrobras. Because we do understand that partnerships faster the accelerated   transference of a know-how, and they mitigate are   that is inherent, inherent. When you embark in a new business area, the company may consider an M A or a certain acquisition as long as it is between 6  and 15 . But these M As must meet a number of criteria strategic compliance, whatever is the M A. It has to be accordance with our strategic planning. It has to be in compliance. We are not going to invest in transition for the sake of investing. The economic part is important. We need a return, we need a consistent cost structure. So dimension and a strategic compliance would be the main criteria that we take into account when we think about mergers and acquisitions.Sergio, the next question from Régis Cardoso from Credit Suisse for Schlosser, it s about fuel prices. Can we guarantee a country s supply when there is high volatility and international prices  Could Petrobras be forced to increase it  Import levels taking to, although it can take it can result in economic losses. What is the share of Russian fuel in BrazilWell, the Brazilian market is properly supplied, and there are a number of agents that work in this market. So in addition to Petrobras, there are other national companies. We have distributing companies, we have diesel and gas importers, independent importers, and even distributors are the main importers. And in addition, there is an alternative of biofuels. Now, when we talk about Russian diesel, there has been an evolution since the beginning of the year reaching values above 80  in July. And this environment results in great competitiveness. Petrobras six is a market share that allows us to use our assets, our logistics structure, and our refining as is creating value in a sustainable fashion and also part of our commercial strategy.So thank you Schlosser. We have a last question that is for you for Rodolfo Angele, JPMorgan. In May Petrobras published a new policy prize seeing opportunity cost for clients and opportunities for Petrobras. How can the Russian diesel dynamic and the refining capacity will impact the second semester  Could you talk about the range of gasoline prices currentlySo thank you, Rodolfo. I would just like to highlight the commercial strategy and its evolution. In the past there was a reference that was the price of import parity. Ours has been implemented, it is underway. We have two market references. One is the alternative cost of the client, and the other one is the marginal cost. The Russian diesel is an additional alternative for supply, and we already mentioned this now simultaneously, the essential part of our commercial strategy is volatility of prices. Nonetheless, we continuously are seeking the optimization of a refining assets and seeking other opportunities like import and the export of oil and byproducts to create more value for the company.Now, regarding margins and positioning because of the competition, we cannot disclose our position vis-à-vis the internal references, but we want to clarify that each agent has its own characteristics for production, for import. Here we have, we have a logistics system for supply and even with other alternatives. And this results in commercial strategies that are totally different from these agents with diversity, that results in a new dynamic for the market. So now I give it back to you.So thank you very much, Schlosser. So now we bring our Q A session to an end. Should you have additional questions, they can be sent to our IR team. And the presentation of the event is available in our site. And in brief, we will make available the audio. Thank you very much and have a very good day.",20,2023-08-04T14:39:09.000-04:00

Chevron Is Better Than Cenovus,"I had to stretch to rate Cenovus  a  Hold  in my last Seeking Alpha article  see . But I shouldn't have  I should have gone with what IThe investment thesis for the oil sands producers is relatively simple and straightforward  Before the era of shale oil  i.e., light-sweet crude , U.S. refiners assumed that they would be heavily dependent on heavy crude imports from Venezuela and OPEC for many years into the future in order to meet domestic demand for gasoline, diesel, and distillates. As a result, they reconfigured their refineries to run a larger slate of heavy crude. That slate included Canadian oil sands crude, which were effectively landlocked with pretty much all export capacity going south to its energy-hungry neighbor, the US. Indeed, Phillips 66  imports more Canadian oil sands crude than any other company and, as a result, has a generally higher distillates yield vs. its peers.Today, of course, growing U.S. shale production has overwhelmed domestic light-sweet refining capacity and pretty much all the incremental production increases of shale are now being exported. Indeed, according to RBN Energy  see , U.S. crude oil exports are currently running at  4 million bpd with the vast majority being shale barrels and a relatively small percentage originating from Canada in the form of WCSThis is that many  analysts  - and especially politicians on the right - don't understand when they say  America is no longer energy independent.  They point to U.S. foreign oil imports and somehow reach the conclusion that  America is not energy independent  when just the opposite is true  America is the largest oil producer on the planet, became the No. 1 LNG exporter on the planet last year, and is the No. 1 overall petroleum producer in the world. What these politicians and analysts don't seem to understand is that the American refining industry is all about efficiencies and optimizing your feedstock to run as profitably as possible given the configuration of your refinery.So, Canada has a ready market for a large portion of its heavy crude production, and any leftover can potentially be exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast, as most all of it shown in the graphic above  in pink  was. However, U.S. refiners pretty much have all they want and need. So it's not a big growth market. For growth, the oil sands producers - including Cenovus - have put all their organic production growth hopes in the Trans Mountain pipeline, which last I knew is scheduled to go online early next year with an extra 590,000 bpd of badly needed  and long overdue  oil sands exit capacity  see .Meantime, Cenovus' best asset might well be the WRB 50-50 refining joint venture it has with Phillips 66.  WRB  stands for Wood River Borger, two refineries that are owned and operated by Phillips 66. The distributions from this partnership are likely what kept Cenovus out of bankruptcy back when the oil sands glut in western Canada had the CEO - the one they hired after the one they fired  for making the big oil sands acquisition from ConocoPhillips  - running to the government for production cut mandates. In retrospect, it's quite humorous to consider what a novel idea that was  A CEO of a North American energy company asking the government for a production  mandate. Regardless, the point is - as I have been saying on Seeking Alpha for years - the best way to play the oil sands is not through the oil sands producers  It's through the refinersFrom a big picture perspective, the slide below from Cenovus'  summarizes the company's assetsAs you can see from the graphic, Cenovus is very much an oil sands centric producer  76  of production  and has upgrading  i.e., to WCS  and refining capacity that's roughly in line with its production  248,000 bpd with WRB alone . The company has a very large oil sands 3P asset base  i.e., bitumen  with a reserves' life of three-plus decades.Chevron, on the other hand, has a global asset base that's much more diversified and includes excellent exposure to the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the global LNG markets via Australia  Gorgon and Wheatstone  and Angola, a growing and impressive footprint in the Eastern Mediterranean natural gas market, and . In Q3 Chevron pumped  from the Permian Basin alone. That was up 11  year-over-year and was almost as much as Cenovus' total production. Chevron plans to ramp Permian production to over 1 million bpd by 2025 and keep it there for at least a decade.Chevron also has 1.7 million bbls of refining capacity  primarily in the U.S. and Asia  and a strong presence in the global chemicals market via its 50-50 joint venture with Phillips 66, which is called CPChem, i.e., the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.The following chart summarizes the free-cash-flow profiles of the two companies over the first six months of 2023Clearly this is a short-term comparison, and free cash flow can be greatly impacted by a variety of factors from quarter to quarter. However, in general, what you see above is a major reason why Chevron has greatly outperformed Cenovus over the past decade  It's a much more efficient and profitable company with, in my opinion, a superior asset base.And this is why Chevron has delivered much better dividend growth as well. The chart below shows the 10-year track record of Chevron vs. CenovusAs you can see in the chart, Chevron's quarterly grew by  50  over the past decade to the current  6.04 share on an annual basis. On the other hand, Cenovus' quarterly dividend actually declined by 41  over the past 10 years and the current payout is only  0.56 share annually. Indeed, during 2020, Cenovus suspended its dividend completely  i.e.,  0.00  for three quarters in a row.From a debt perspective, to my knowledge no leading O G company has a better balance sheet than Chevron  if you think one does, please let me know . CVX ended Q2 with  9.6 billion in cash, long-term debt of , and a net debt to equity ratio of only 7 .Cenovus had  1.6 billion in cash at the end of Q2 and long-term debt of . With a recent ratings upgrade, Cenovus is rated  by Fitch. Chevron has an .Being an oil sands producer that is still dependent on the U.S. export market, and the fact that Cenovus is competing with other big oil sands producers  i.e., Suncor  Suncor Energy Inc. , Imperial Oil , Canadian Natural Resources , etc.  for pipeline exit capacity to reach that market, the discount of WCS  Western Canadian Select  to WTI is important. And, as we have seen in the past, the WCS-to-WTI discount can swing wildly. Indeed, sometimes the price of WCS can reach near  0 during glutsCurrently, the discount is   WTI 79.20 bbl, WCS 62.14 bbl . As they say,  all barrels are not created equal.Lastly, what would you rather own in the era of ESG and global warming  Oil sands assets like Cenovus, or a company like Chevron that produces a ton of light-sweet crude and cleaner burning  natural gas  LNGChevron has a superior and diversified global asset production portfolio as compared to Cenovus, which is still a primarily and oil sands producer. That said, Cenovus has expanded its refining capacity which today roughly equals its total production. Still, Chevron is a much more efficient company with a higher free cash flow margin and a much better long-term track record of delivering dividend growth. That being the case, any investor thinking of buying Cenovus stock should consider buying Chevron instead. And any investor that holds Cenovus in a qualified retirement account  i.e., won't face any tax-selling consequences  should sell CVE and put the proceeds into Chevron.I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart of the major oil sands producers as compared to some major shale oil producers and the S P 500. As you can see, Cenovus - along with peer Suncor - is at the very bottom. Shale oil producers like EOG, COP, and CVX significantly outperformed the oil sands producers  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Valero Energy: A Solid Q3 With A Powerful Buyback In Place,"Shares of Valero  have essentially tread water over the past year, lagging the broader market gain. After reporting Q3 results on Thursday, shares fell about 1 , in what has been a down day for the overall market. WithIn the company s , Valero earned  7.49, which beat  by  0.17. The first thing to highlight is that net income fell from  2.8 to  2.6 billion but EPS rose by  0.30 from  7.19. That is the power of the company s capital return policy. With earnings particularly high, VLO has been aggressively buying back stock. It returned  2.2 billion to shareholders last quarter with a  360 million quarterly dividend and the balanceOver time, VLO targets a capital return policy of 40-50  of operating cash flow. Last quarter though, it returned 60  of operating cash flow to investors. This is not because cash flow has fallen to a troubling degree, rather cash margins have been so strong that VLO has been generating excess cash well beyond its investment needs, which it then is returning. That 40-50  is intended to be a cycle average. However, the dramatic share count reduction will mean EPS will outperform net income as we saw last quarter. Since 2012, VLO has bought back nearly 40  of the company.Looking at Q3 results, refining operating income was down  400 million to  3.4 billion. Its refineries ran at a solid 95  utilization, even with some maintenance work. With that work complete, management is expecting to run at a 96.5  utilization rate in Q4 as product demand has stayed strong with diesel inventories being relatively tight still. With investments to modernize refineries over the past ten years, VLO has been able to increase utilization and lower operating costs, leaving it with a cost advantaged system and boosting margins.Valero earned a margin per barrel of oil of  19.47 from  21.43 last year. On a percentage basis, refining margins actually expanded to 9.4  from 9  as crude oil prices were lower, but that decline in dollar margin per barrel is what caused earnings from this unit to fall from last year. We will discuss refinery margins further in a moment.Briefly though, VLO has two smaller units. Its renewable diesel unit generated operating income of  123 million from  212 million last year. While sales were up a third as expansion projects came online, diesel margins compressed from last year. While still healthy, diesel markets were extremely tight last year as Europe scrambled for fuel after turning away from Russian oil. This unit is operating at more of a normal level now.On the other side, ethanal operating income rose to  197 million from  1 million last year, with production up over 20 . Corn prices are lower than a year ago, outpacing the decline in crude oil, which has helped to widen margins. While these renewable energy businesses provide some earnings, 90-95  of Valero s results come from its core refining business. Refining margins, more so than renewable diesel or ethanol, are what will drive the stock.It has been a bull market for refining since shortly after COVID. 3 2 1 spreads, which measure how much refiners get for their refined products  gasoline, diesel  relative to the crude oil input soared. This is why Valero s profits surged and it has been able to buy back so much stock. Now, these margins have been to normalize. A reason VLO trades at such a low multiple is markets are viewing some of its  20 barrel margin as a one-time windfall rather than a recurring source of income. The one-time windfall is definitely good for shareholders, but VLO will never get a 15x multiple on peak earnings.A question then is where do margins go over time  in other words, what is Valero s true run-rate earnings power. At the current share count and with its  23  tax rate, if we cut Valero s refining margins in half, it would have run-rate earnings of  3.75 share or about  14-15 year. That would leave the stock with just an  8.5x multiple. Right now, per the analyst consensus, earnings are  to decline to  15.51 next year. Given the share count will continue to fall next year, the consensus is essentially in-line with a halving of refining margins.In , VLO was earning  9.65 a barrel, and in 2018, it earned  10.32 a barrel. So this halving would be in-line with the pre-COVID norm, which was a good but not record setting environment for refiners. I see the risks skewed to the future being a bit brighter than this on average, for the simple reason that the world does not have much refining capacity. As you can see below, after rising steadily in the 2000s, refining capacity growth has really slowed down. There has essentially been no new refining capacity over the past four years. Oil demand is still rising though given ongoing economic growth and development in emerging markets. This increasingly means refining, even more so than production, is the bottleneck in the supply chain. That should mean wider margins on average.This is particularly true in the US. As some smaller refineries have shuttered, our refining capacity is down about 6  from pre-COVID levels. While these markets are global to a large extent, there is shipping cost, so local market dynamics do matter. The relative underperformance of US refining capacity to global capacity is likely to further insulate US refining margins, all else equal.Now, as economics 101 student can tell you, the reason bottlenecked, or supply-constrained, markets have wider margins is to encourage investment and the development of new supply to meet the demand. The last significant refinery in the US was built in the , though. Given the regulatory environment and the fact a brand-new refinery could cost well in excess of  8 billion, it simply is not feasible to build one. Indeed, the cost could be even greater with Mexico s plans to build a refinery potentially spiraling to . Western governments are also focused on investing in renewable energy not supporting increased supply of crude oil refining capacity. There is no investment supply-side reaction function to wide refining spreads given this backdrop.This has left existing refinery owners in a strong position to enjoy wider margins. Indeed, we can see the lack of interest in investing in Valero s financials. Last quarter, it spent  303 million of sustaining cap-ex and just  91 million on growth spending, mostly in its smaller renewables businesses. Barring something truly unforeseen, the US has as many refineries today as it ever will. The same is likely true of Europe. As such, it will be difficult for global refining capacity to match, let alone exceed, underlying product demand. That means margins will be structurally wider, maybe not as wide as today, but wider than 2018 2019 on average.I would write that Valero has 14 refineries and will never grow beyond that. However, while that is true in terms of its not organically building more, there is the possibility of M A. Finally, the Citgo  is starting and expected to last until next summer, though there is likely to be further legal arguments over it, which could end the auctions altogether. I could see Valero bidding for some of Citgo s assets which are quality refineries able to process cheap, heavy crude. Whether Citgo will be sold and to what parties is impossible to know, but if Valero does win, that would likely cause a temporary slowing in its buybacks to fund the purchases. If Citgo is sold, I expect different firms would buy different assets, limiting VLO s potential purchase to a manageable  5-8 billion.Overall, I view  15-17 as a reasonable estimate for VLO s earnings power the next year given a likely 5  share count reduction and where refining spreads are. However at 8.5x earnings, markets seem to be discounting that even this lessened margin is unsustainably high. Given the reasons discussed, that is where I disagree. I see run-rate earnings holding at least at the  15 level. It is a low margin, capital intensive business but I believe 10x run-rate earnings is reasonable, pointing to a fair price of  150. That is 20  of upside.I believe investors should begin accumulating VLO stock. In the meantime as it trades below its fair value, that just means the buyback reduces the share count even more quickly, further increasing run-rate earnings power and long-term value for shareholders. Refining is a supply constrained business, and it is likely to remain so. That is good news for Valero and its shareholders.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Wayne Gretzky Investing: Modeling Calumet Specialty Products,"Wayne Gretzky ,  I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.  Understanding  the where  isn't simple nor perfect, such that investors might view this as art rather than science. Our focus using CalumetOn the surface, Calumet's June quarter disappointed until discovery opened the internals defining the puck's direction.  summarizing the results.Again, at first glance, disapointments abounded with low Specialty and the extremely low MRL results. Digging deeper, the weather around Shreveport forced a plant shutdown again resulting in a loss of profit equaling  20 million, the difference plus the actual equaling our prior estimate. Management wisely decided to manage through an unscheduled turnaround with an unexpected outage, eliminating a future oneAn ultra disappointment came also with MRL generating a smidgen of profit. More very relevant details follow later in the article. So, let's head onto the ice for close up viewing beginning with this next table on interest and debt. Notes associated with Specialty   Performance Only .  MRL carries approximately  550 million debt which we discuss later. Management has stated that it plans to delever by  400- 500 million from cash flows or otherwise. We estimate all refinances at 9.5 .The puck on these two important factors slides smoothly toward another goal.The next table summarizes . Half of the capital has been spent.The long-term capital expenses stated by management equals approximately  60 million, but additional opportunities exists with returns of greater than 20 . We aren't totally confident of the actual capital expenses past 2024 except that it won't exceed  60 million without the operational cash generation to support it.This completes the expenditure pucks. Now lets head to revenue.Several factors influence performance including demand within the economy and refining capacity. With economies forever cycling, our focus targets capacity.The performance for specialty relies heavily upon crack spreads in particular the Gulf Coast 2-1-1. American refining capacity plus demand influences this factor immensely, which now  barrels per day. It has dropped from near 19 million in 2020. An increase of 250K per day is expected during 2023. The EIA continues  or effectively full-capacity maintaining upward price pressures. This was true even in the lower usage non-summer periods. Without plans for significant capacity increases, crack spreads can be expected to continue higher. The EIA also forecasts  with fossil sources still growing modestly. We don't expect any major shift downward in crack spreads under normal economic conditions.Our table outlining performance follows. Specialty suffered from several weather related events which materially lowered recent results in the  20- 30 million per quarter range. Used our formula with the September and June quarters as the base plus the adjustment stated in a previous article,  Again, in our ,  we noted that every  10 increase in GC 2-1-1 spreads adds approximately  30 million of EBITDA per quarter. Average results for  and  quarters. Crack spread were  50 in June and  40 in September. Performance Brands results suffered miserably from critical feed stock availability plus weather outage issues. Results prior to the March 2023 quarter aren't reflective of the business. Includes a one time insurance payment of  5 million.The Specialty puck might range in the  80- 110 million range long-term with the existence of this constant market-place pricing pressure. Performance Brands appears poised for growth, significant growth into the  20 million per quarter region.A final remark from management concerning specialty,  We try to stay out of the commoditized markets and focus more on the high-value applications, Group 1, Group 2.  This is a critical note in understanding where the puck is headed in that this practice adds to profitability stability.Now, next, MRL positioning is addressed. Thus far, the Great Falls performance for both the older refining business plus the new renewables has been reported together. The results for June were surprising low until a detailed look revealed the true story. We begin with the June results equaling  13 million. A table showing the critical parameters follows. Feed times 91 days times margins times 0.70. WCS plus GC 2-1-1 taken from our own data. Our guess. Management reported this average feed rate. Back calculated from the data given and the asphalt assumption. The feed stock was a mixture of treated, very expensive, and untreated. Back calculated margin equaled  1 plus the difference between treated, last quarters primary feed and untreated of  1.The state of the business at quarters end can be summed with Also, from the ,At the mid-point using the above statement, MRL generates  65M per quarter in EBITDA. By another calculation presented in the above table, MRL clips along at approximately a  70M per quarter rate. We summarize September with a little more detail in the next table. With 2 3s of the feed untreated at the quarters beginning, we used  1.6 for the average margin. This number is likely low.In addition, the Great Falls fossil portion at 12,500 b d feed rate and  50 crack spreads likely generated  20- 30M, asphalt revenue being unknown, but guessed at  10- 20M.The puck is still moving. The company continues an evaluation for MaxSAF refining. From the June quarter remarks,  W e believe that with MaxSAF, we can more than double our current EBITDA run rate in 2025.  And work is progressing on using a natural cover crop, Camelina oil. Management noted,With respect to MRL, the quarterly EBITDA is likely to range from  65M to  140M depending on the final decision for SAF.A question still remains, how are investors going to reap lucrative returns  The only hint we have is that the company noted its desire to begin an IPO approach in the early part of 2024.Let's relationize the pucks in whole. A summary follows with totals from the 2026 location.The capital expenses for next year equals approximately  140M. Debt repayment equals  500M for the older Calumet business and  500M- 700M for MRL depending on whether the MaxSAF project moves forward.Yearly, cash flow from businesses equals approximately  100M per quarter into 2026. Yes, all of this changes if or when an MRL IPO occurs, but until then, Calumet could pay off debt for each entity after 2024, MRL or Specialty, in approximately one year, for each. After 2025, the net cash flow per quarter could increase to  200M or  800M per year. This is where the puck is headed and the coach pulled the goalie. With approximately 80 million units issued, a  10 per unit yearly result is possible.Successful investing requires an accurate vision of the future followed by a comparison of the market's vision at today. The question, is or does the market have the price mismatched. In our view, with Calumet, it has. A unit earning  10 yr. is totally and completely mismatched at the recent prices of  17, completely.Yes, risks exist. Over the past few years, the company experience three major storms which materially affected results. Also, another lockdown might occur for a quarter or so, drastically lowering sales. But, in our view, this compelling mismatch continues with a strong buy. In essence, this look at Calumet skates us into greater understanding. This approach offers meaning far past Calumet. Each winner we have held was determined by following this pattern. We haven't been always correct having had to bail a few times with significant losses. Yes, we missed  But the results from the winners has been a several orders of magnitude higher than the losses. We, again, rate Calumet a strong buy without apologizing.  It is our 2nd largest position. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,"  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of one-time expenditures.  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins. Therefore, there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business. That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders. Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard. Therefore, the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies. This should be expected when there is no formal standard. That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an  apples to apples  comparison.Obviously, the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made. But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown above.Rising prices of commodities should help that forward progress. But so will the transition of cash-using assets to cash generating assets.Longer term, the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company. That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products. Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances, this demands a flexible manufacturing process.The  be thought of as a starting point. The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitability.The main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity. Some products like asphalt, could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted product.Others, like gasoline, can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that  holds up better  during times of weak commodity prices  during a cyclical business downturn cycle .This process will likely take years  rather than happen overnight . That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions. Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time, this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happening.The other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production. This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary. Sometimes, the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required. Therefore, using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply source.Long term, there is still a very clear need for more refining capacity.As can be seen above, there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production. Clearly, management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing, or they would not produce it in the first place.But long-term, enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities. Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities. But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organization.While the company has made considerable progress, there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits process.In addition to the previous discussion, management plans to grow upstream production. While that makes downstream production expansion capabilities a priority as well, it does mean that this management has a full plate of future growth projects  on the table.An integrated company often means that growth in place often implies growth elsewhere to optimize profits.What this appears to point towards is high single-digit growth rates for the company well into the future. Now that the company is far larger than it was when I first initiated coverage, the initial frantic growth rate will give way to a growth and income strategy for the foreseeable future.That means total annual returns from growth will likely decline. But the increased safety of an enhanced downstream division will remove some of the corresponding risk to achieve what management likely believes is an acceptable proposition to Mr. Market.There are other possibilities in the offshore and overseas business. But probably the most attractive idea is for the unconventional business  or conventional depending upon the area  to find condensate that can be used by the company to make the oil produced flow through the pipelines. If this happens and is successful, then it would eliminate a major purchase from outside suppliers.Management has at times mentioned the need for condensate and wants to explore the acquired acreage for more products than the current natural gas production. But there is no guarantee of success. The speculative upside for shareholders would be company supplied condensate as a major cost reduction.Cenovus Energy Inc. management has done very well, as quarterly cash flow is up something like 16 to 32 times  depending upon commodity prices for the quarter  since I began coverage of this company about 5 years ago. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done.There is also a potential foray into the Chemicals business that many diversified giants have.The very low stock price valuation protects against the threat of downside principal loss over the long term. It should be noted that Mr. Market really has yet to give the company any credit for the larger downstream operation. This company is a strong buy consideration because the upside potential from all those acquisitions far exceeds any downside potential at the current price.As long as Cenovus Energy Inc. grows, I intend to hold the stock until the story changes materially. However, the volatile trading price does allow for a lot of trading opportunities along the way. So, there are likely to be a lot of ways to make money. With the currently low market valuation, the odds are in your favor.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Exxon Mobil: It Is Only Another Billion,"There has long been an argument that   is large enough that  a billion here and a billion there  is not significant. So many just did not  of theNow admittedly, one cannot tell whether each discovery that is commercial will need an FPSO or whether they will need to combine a few discoveries to justify an FPSO. has probably a  line of sight  to spend at least  100 billion of partnership money as shown above. The fact that they are going for still more expenditures demonstrates the optimism of the future production of what is quickly turning into the largest basin find in modern times.While it can be argued that current progress is too slow to be meaningful to a company like Exxon Mobil, I would argue that anyone putting the kind of money down now and lining up the commitment shown above, is going to sooner, rather than later, have a material addition to current production.Management already has four FPSOs approved as shown above and the partnership has a reasonable way to get to 6 more FPSOs. Clearly, if the company has plans for the partnership to continue to explore, then the likelihood of still more FPSOs in the  certain  future is going to be climbing.Investors need to remember that the partnership retains something like 5 million acres after the  giveback  to Guyana.  has been delayed one year, it will still happen. This is still a whole lot more acreage than many basins make available for bids at any given time. What you are likely seeing is the operator trying to convert as many acres as possible to producing and therefore not subject to future givebacks. But that is a pretty standard race against time that I have reported on many times over the years.The other thing to consider here is that Exxon Mobil is getting a lot of attention for just one of the blocks held in Guyana and really no attention at all for any holdings in Suriname. Yet all of this provides still more upside potential if a commercial discovery is determined to justify producing.One of the things that Hess Corporation  management has mentioned several times is how Exxon Mobil manages an FPSO through the approval process while another FPSO is in the development or building phase, and still another one in the hookup and initial production phase. With all the holdings in the area, that scenario could eventually multiply several times over depending upon which partnership and lease holdings have commercial discoveries.Point Thompson is one of  that is producing liquids up in Alaska. This project is also one of the largest natural gas fields in North America. There has been talk about finding ways to export this gas to markets to take advantage of what is anticipated to be a strong natural gas market. However, so far anything solid has not yet really emerged. Still, with liquids production already in place, it would be probably economically attractive to at some point produce the gas for use elsewhere. This would likely be a long-term speculative upside potential project at this time.Production growth has been rather robust for a company of this size. There were some one-time items that hid the progress. But sooner or later the growth will show through. is already heading towards 10 . Now taking into account the one-time items volume was actually below the previous quarter  sequentially speaking . Even though volume was down sequentially, the volume reported was still very strong compared to the year before. Management has still more projects that will accelerate the growth rate besides Guyana.There is a robust production growth guidance for the Permian operations and additional refining capacity was built to handle that volume. The company earnings will not only benefit from the additional production but also should benefit from the refining upgrade to more valuable products.This pattern points to a likely future scenario for Guyana. Right now, the Guyana partnership produces oil. But there certainly would be a market for refined products should the company follow its usual pattern of adding the capability to produce value added products from the production.This is just a summary of the major 2023 projects that will begin to add to cash flow in the near future.The  are the result of billions in expenditures over a multi-year budget. But they are all scheduled to start up and contribute to cash flow either this fiscal year or not long after this fiscal year.Since , Exxon Mobil announced the acquisition of Denbury Inc. . This acquisition will add yet another major project to the group shown above.Management has more of these projects underway and still more in the planning stage. Some like Point Thompson are more likely in the talking or wishing stage.But the key is that this company is now on a growth trajectory. For a long-time, this company  tread water  and the stock price largely reflected that. Now, clearly that is changing to a growth trajectory.That means that future dividend increases are likely to be larger than what has happened in the past. It takes time to transition to a new growth strategy  and money . So, dividend increases are currently lagging behind the profitability progress. But in the long run, dividend increases will catch up the pace of corporate growth.The result of all of this is that Exxon Mobil is slowly turning into a growth and income play. For the last decade or so, it was primarily an income play with growth as an afterthought. As the growth part increases in importance, the company is likely to receive a higher valuation in the market long-term to recognize that growth.Even without that consideration, the oil and gas industry is historically cheap and relatively out-of-favor. Just returning to some normal valuations should result in some decent appreciation pretty much across the board. Any premium growth projects would add to that. As a result, Exxon Mobil remains a strong buy consideration for those looking for a growth and income vehicle.The oil and gas industry has cycles. But this company is safe enough to hold through those cycles. That appeals to a lot of risk averse investors.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience. He has been focusing on this industry for years. He is a retired CPA, and holds an MBA and MA.

"YPF Sociedad Anónima: A Speculative Trend Play With Record Profits, Low Multiples, And Deleveraging","YPF Sociedad Anónima  NYSE is an energy company that mostly operates in Argentina, deriving the bulk of its revenues  66  in FY2022  from sales of fuels and natural gas. As its  filing explainsIn addition to its operations in Argentina, YPF also sells lubricants and oil derivatives in Chile and Brazil.Revenue  LTM  has been in an uptrend since Q1-2021 and has more than doubled since, now at a post-2014 record of  9.23b, according to . The firm s EBIT  LTM  is close to a record level, a significant recovery from its Q4-2019 - Q1-2021 rough patch. Net income  LTM  is at a record high.YPF s net margin  LTM  is at a record high, now at 11.9 . Operating margin  LTM  is approaching record levels. Its operating cash flow margin  LTM  is fairly healthy, hovering around 30  since Q3-2020, however that margin has been slightly downtrending since its earlier peak in Q3-2019.YPF has been deleveraging. Its net debt  quarterly  peaked in Q4-2018 and has fallen 36  to a level of  6.31b. Its debt equity and debt asset leverage ratios have been in downtrends since Q2-2020 and now sit at 0.7 and 29 , respectively.The company s number of book-entry shares of common stock in Q1-2023 was 393,312,793, the same as it was in Q1-2022 and Q1-2021.YPF s P S, P B, and EV EBITDA multiples are all close to record lows since 2014. For the past several quarters, P S and P B have been expanding, meaning that investor sentiment appears to have recently rebounded  investors are repricing their estimate of firm value upwards.In the recent quarter, YPF s refinery processing levels reached a 13-year record high, growing 9  YoY, per the . Management attributes this to its recent update of a topping unit at the firm s refinery in La Plata. The firm saw substantial growth in its shale oil and gas production, climbing 31  and 9  YoY, respectively. Also, the recent quarter saw domestic fuel demand rise 4  YoY.Since 51  of YPF s shares are owned by the Argentine Republic  AR , that AR determines the outcome of all decisions that are put to a shareholder vote and require a majority approval.The firm notes in its  that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected YPF s performance in the past. If the pandemic s trajectory worsens or a new health threat emerges, YPF s financial results could suffer.A large part of YPF s success depends on favorable economic conditions in Argentina, a country with a history of substantial economic volatility and debt crises such as those in 2001, 2005, 2015, and 2020. If inflation intensifies or another factor impairs the country s ability to refinance, economic growth could suffer and pull down company revenues. If Argentina has trouble meeting its future debt obligations from foreign borrowers, it may lead to retaliatory measures that could impede YPF s ability to do business in those countries.About 7   as of FY2022  of the firm s total debt is sensitive to fluctuations in bond yields. Adverse rate movements could increase the firm s debt servicing costs and lead to a drop in margins.Import and export restrictions that apply to YPF could change and become less favorable. At one time, the AR forced the firm to redirect some of its natural gas to domestic customers as opposed to export clients, resulting in customer disputes. Luckily, YPF is not currently facing restrictions on its natural gas exports  permitted under  Plan GasAr , but future restrictions are possible and could hurt its results.YPF is exposed to currency fluctuations. The recent devaluation of the Argentine peso has hurt Argentina s economy and accelerated inflation. All else equal, those factors tend to increase key costs like wages and materials and pull down customer demand.Finally, the AR government has outstanding claims which are before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  ICSID . The outcome of those claims may be unfavorable to the AR and impede economic growth.Buying a stock is a bet on where its price goes, not necessarily the fundamentals of the business. Since there is statistical evidence of trends in equity markets, investors who apply a scientific mindset may benefit from focusing on companies with trending share prices.YPF s stock price broke above its 200-day trend in August 2022 and has been in an uptrend since, rising more than 200  since that time, per .Zooming out, the stock is 46  below its peak in 2017 and 62  its peak in 2014, indicating significant potential upside if mean reversion takes effect.Note that YPF s website states it reports Q2-2023 earnings on August 11. Investors could consider holding the share into earnings and betting on a favorable quarter and market reaction, or they could consider waiting to see what price action looks like afterwards. The latter approach might be more suitable for investors who want to avoid gap risk.YPF s record margins, depressed valuation multiples, recent deleveraging, and trending share price make it an interesting opportunity for investors. While its share price continues to trend, the stock could be a reasonable bet for investors with a momentum-inspired strategy to consider.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks  Archer-Daniels-Midland . The company, which just reported its quarterly numbers, is doing extremely well. It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds, including strong secular growth in biofuels.In thisSo, let's get to itRoughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I highlighted the company's massive footprint in the agriculture industry.Listed in 1924, the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42,000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations, allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview, the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery stores.This includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions, which account for the biggest part of the company's revenue.In the United States, Archer-Daniels-Midland is the third-largest producer of ethanol, according to .With this in mind, earlier this week, major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good position.The bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth, driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policies.As one can imagine, this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers, who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sector.As biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation, various biobased feedstocks, including agricultural crops and animal-derived products, are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and net-zero emissions by 2050.Like many people, I am not a fan of using  food  to produce fuel, but in light of global energy policies, my opinion doesn't matter.Furthermore, while corn-based ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  and Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS  in the mid-2000s, there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks, driven by the growth of renewable diesel production.Meanwhile, increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil, as well as soybean and canola oil, further used in renewable diesel.This shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023.Adding to that, the new Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  provides tax credits to the biofuels industry, extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuels.In this light, during last year's JP Morgan All-Stars Conference, the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels, with strong biodiesel margins, high demand for ethanol, and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants, which confirms the trends noticed by ING.The company also mentioned the start-up of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota, which will add 1.5 million tons of capacity, focusing on low-carbon intensity feedstocks.Furthermore, the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide low-carbon emissions power.In the third quarter, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of  1.63, accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of  1.5 billion.Notably, this quarter's results contributed to an outstanding year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of  5.62, making it the second-best EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally, ADM's trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 13.2 , which reflects the company's consistent strength in this environment.ADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market, where opportunities and challenges coexist, which makes it challenging for traders and investors.Consumer behavior trends vary across categories, impacting spending.Issues also include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and fluctuating commodity supply and demand.Despite these challenges, ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved year-to-date, with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total company.With that in mind, ADM's different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwinds.During its earnings call, the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork, which is something I already briefly mentioned.In 2023, ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network, partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable, sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo , Nestle, and Carlsberg.The company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025, equivalent to powering over 100,000 homes annually.ADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project, contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for  greener  fuels.The company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9x, which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their long-term strategic agenda and return capital to shareholders.It enjoys a credit rating of  A .ADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates full-year EPS in excess of  7 per share.Based on that context, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently pays a  0.45 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to  1.80 per year. It implies a 26  2023E earnings payout ratio, which is extremely healthy.The dividend yield is 2.5 .ADM is attractively valued. As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below, the normalized P E ratio is 14.6x, which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decades.Now, the company is trading at 9.5x earnings. That's the lowest valuation since the great financial crisis.Even if earnings moderate in the next few years  analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years , the stock is significantly undervalued.A return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18  annual returns through 2025.The current consensus price target is  97, which is 38  above the current price.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. I believe that ADM has a fair value between  100 and  110, which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four years.Archer-Daniels-Midland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector. The booming biofuel industry, supported by evolving government policies, presents a significant growth opportunity for ADM.Their diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sources.ADM's strong financial performance, improved earnings outlook, and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment. With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation, ADM could offer investors an 18  annual return through 2025.Hence, I maintain my belief in ADM's fair value between  100 and  110, which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four years.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

My Portfolio Q3 2023 Results: Cautiously Positioned Heading Into Q4,"In Q3 I returned  versus  for the S P 500 . In 2023, I've returned  versus  for the index. I've gone from a fairly large underperformance to a sizable outperformance.My performance inWith the benefit of hindsight, I closed this too early, selling in late July for  47.50. But, I used the proceeds to buy more Cenovus at  18.8, so it's been a wash.I'm bearish on refiners right now. Gulf CoastAdd to this any risk of a global slowdown and further demand destruction via EVs, and I'm happy to take the win here and move on. I'm more bullish on integrated producers or pure E P's here.This was a miss and with the benefit of hindsight, a reactionary sell.I sold out around  9.3, which was my cost basis. I still like the story here, but my disappointment in the Q2 results, coupled with how overweight energy I already am made me decide to cut this position. The overarching part of my investing strategy is  don't lose money  and I have less conviction in Genesis now than I did previously.Still holding the most cash I ever have held, while opportunistically deploying it for trades. I still believe this is a time to be defensive.Still holding my position in Cenovus, and remain bullish on the company long term. Cenovus returning 100  of capital in dividends and repurchases is getting closer.I'm considering selling calls against this position. Above  20, I think Cenovus management opts for more dividends over repurchases, and the premiums on the call options look enticing.I added a small amount of common units in the low  12's, and added more of the Series E  under  23 back in Q2.I still believe Energy Transfer offers a lot of value, but we may start hitting some near-term resistance after such a strong run. I think the common units are worth between  18- 20 and the prefs offer a lot of value for floating rate securities. The Series E prefs start trading at LIBOR   5.161  starting in May  nearly 11Berkshire Hathaway   remains an anchor in my portfolio, though its valuation is certainly on the  high end  of fair. After repurchasing the Jan24  350 call at a 20  profit, I recently sold a Jan24  380 call with the stock at  365.This was a 12  position up until a few days ago. I said it was  at  33.50, and when shares hit  43.50 late last week, I decided to ring the cash register on the 30  gain in two months.Still have a significant position that I don't plan on selling.Still patiently waiting for the  to close. FCF will inflect when it does.I still hold a small JPMorgan Chase  position from my original  90 purchase price. I'm considering selling this. I don't love buying banks in general, and I'm negative on the sector. My dislike of the sector is mostly driven by spiking interest rates.That said, JPM is the best of the banks and the valuation is very reasonable.These get safer by the quarter as the company continues to redeem the privately held class D Prefs, and Nustar's common units have had a good run this year. I'll continue to hang on to these 12  floating rate prefs.In , with the S P500 above 4500, that it was a poor time to be chasing stocks, especially when you can earn 5  in Treasuries. With the S P around 4300, I still think the risk reward in stocks is poor, with the bond market flashing warning signs.We are running close to a  2 trillion dollar deficit and just ran past  33 trillion in national debt. We are adding this much to the debt during a non-recessionary period with rates resetting higher. I'm old enough to remember when the  National Debt  was a big concern for far more people than it is today, and it's a far bigger problem today than it was back then.This gets solved through a combination of 3 thingsThey are all major negatives for the economy and US stocks. I'd be wary of owning anything that has a reliance on the government as a major customer. I know that trying to time things like this are difficult, but I'm also reminded of 2008 when the bond market started flashing warning signs far before the stock market.I don't know what's going to happen, but everything I see makes me think that Capital Preservation is the name of the game right now. I'll continue to look for trading opportunities, but otherwise, I remain defensive.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Magellan Midstream: Overvalued, But Hold For Solid Dividend Yield","Magellan Midstream Partners  deals in crude oil and refined petroleum products. The company has a remarkable history of consistent dividend payouts which makes it an attractive stock to hold in a portfolio to reduce theMMP is a partnership firm that mainly engages in the storage, transportation, and distribution of crude oil   refined petroleum products in Tulsa, Okla. The company conducts its business in two operating segments  . The Refined Products segment consists of a pipeline system of around 9,800-mile refined petroleum products including 54 terminals and 2 marine storage terminals. This pipeline covers a 15-state area starting from the Texas Gulf Coast and also linked with other interstate pipelinesMMP has recently reported its financial results for the . The company reported revenue of  877.2 million which is increase of 11.23  from  788.6 million in Q2FY22. This growth was mainly fueled by a decent increase in both transportation and product sales revenues. Refined Products segment revenues surged by 11.65  and Crude Oil segment revenues declined by 5.02  compared to the previous year's same period. MMP reported net income of  238.7 million which is dramatic decrease of 32.55  compared to  353.9 million in the Q2FY22. Decreased net income resulted in diluted net income per share of  1.18 compared to  1.67 in the same quarter of the previous year. It reported distributable cash flows of  312 million, up 36.84  compared to  228 million in Q2FY22. Free cash flows stood at  271 million. The firm reported cash and cash equivalents of  128.4 million.The energy industry experienced a significant downturn during the pandemic and the growth was later hampered by the supply chain obstacles arising from the geo-political issues of Russia and Ukraine. However, it is observed that the industry is rebounding significantly and experiencing rapid growth in demand. estimates for 2023 and 2024 have been raised by 130 kb d and 90 kb d, respectively, to 82.5 mb d and 83.5 mb d which reflects a positive growth factor for the participants operating in this industry. Identifying these growth opportunities, the company is highly focused on expanding its refined products pipeline which can significantly help it to cater to the rapidly growing demand and capture the additional market share by expanding its profit margins. The company is working extensively to complete the 30,000 barrel-per-day expansion of its refined products pipeline to El Paso, Texas. The new 16-inch, 30-mile pipe between Odessa and Crane, Texas, has been completed, with enhanced operational storage to meet incremental shipments presently under construction. I think that this development can considerably assist the firm in establishing a strong position in a competitive market and increasing its access to the country's refining capacity. I believe these expansions can potentially help the company to increase its cash flows and further increase its dividend payout. The company's future growth may be anticipated to be stable due to favorable industry trends and its expansion plans. It has also provided its guidance for the third quarter and FY23, which represents an optimistic outlook for the company's growth. It forecasts the annual EPS to be around  5.05. In addition, it projects the third quarter can be  1.15 per share. Distributable cash flow is estimated to reach  1.26 billion in the current fiscal year. I think the company's estimates are correct looking at the current growth factors.The firm has experienced 21 years of continuous dividend growth which indicates its healthy market position. The company paid a cash dividend of  1.0375 in each of the first three quarters of 2022 and  1.0475 in the fourth, which accounted for a total annual payout of  4.16 per share and a dividend yield of 6.48 . It distributed a  1.0475 dividend in each of the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, and given the company's strong cash positions and growth prospects, I believe it can maintain its quarterly dividend of  1.0475 in the last quarter as well, representing a high dividend yield of 6.53 . I think this attractive dividend can help investors to mitigate the risk arising from recessionary pressures.The company highly depends on refineries, gathering systems, and petroleum pipelines owned by third parties to supply its assets. If the quantity or quality of this crude oil production changes or if there are any disruptions in the throughput on these pipelines and gathering systems due to reasons such as line repair, testing, competitive forces, and other weather-related causes, it can negatively affect the company's operations and reduce its shipments. These disruptions might also limit its cash flows by further contracting its profit margins.The demand has rebounded in the industry in the current year and I believe the company is also well-position to cater to the growing demand as it is constantly focused on expanding its pipeline system. After considering all the above factors, I am estimating EPS of  5.07 for FY2023 which gives the forward P E ratio of 12.64x  share price   64.10 . After comparing the forward P E ratio of 12.64x with the sector median of 11.50x, we can say that the company is overvalued. ONEOK is planning to acquire MMP at  67.50 per unit which is a 5.3  premium compared to the current share price. However, the company's impressive dividend payout makes it an attractive opportunity for investors to protect their portfolios in these recessionary times. The company has tremendous growth potential due to favorable industry trends and its vigorous expansion activities. It is exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions which can further contract its profit margins. The stock is overvalued at the current share price, however, its attractive dividend yield makes it an attractive stock to hold in the portfolio to mitigate the recessionary impacts on the portfolio. After considering, all the above factors, I assign a hold rating to MMP.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Phillips 66: Crack Spread Decline Lowers EPS Estimate By Over Two-Thirds (Rating Downgrade),"Over the past year, I have held a bullish view of refinery stocks, specifically Phillips 66 . Refineries have outperformed the energy sector due to the rise in the price of gasoline and other refined products comparedMy  the  crack spread  will be permanently elevated compared to pre-2020 levels until gasoline is phased out of  vehicles, potentially giving Phillips 66 over a decade of significant returns. This long-term outlook is based onOf course, potential profit margins on oil refining have declined dramatically since August. Philips 66 and its peers have hardly declined in value. Thus, refinery stocks may be significantly overvalued on a short-term basis. To better determine that, we must look more closely at the core causes of the crack spread's volatility and how it may impact Phillips 66 on a short-term basis.Since 2020, oil production and refinery capacity utilization volatility have led to immense crack spread changes. The crack spread is often measured as the difference between a barrel of two-thirds RBOB gasoline plus one-third Heating Oil minus one barrel of crude oil. There are 42 gallons per barrel. To simplify, I will show both on a 1 1 basis  however, the spread between RBOB and oil is generally more critical for Phillips 66's profits than the heating oil spread. See belowThe gasoline spread is back in its 10-year average range, falling by over 50  over the past three months. Conversely, the heating oil spread, which, as a distillate, is more telling of diesel fuel, is back at its high range. Overall, the  3 2 1  crack spread, which measures both together, is down by over one-third over  the initial 2022 spike. Accordingly, aside from hedging and other sources of income, this data implies Phillip 66's EPS will soon be back near its 2021 levels.There are multiple causes for the boom and bust in the crack spread. For one, refinery capacity utilization was generally low earlier this year but strengthened dramatically over the summer, improving the gasoline supply. The manufacturing PMI has slipped over the past two years, indicating a slowdown and contraction in industrial activity. Further, refinery capacity utilization has also fallen, pointing toward a potential decline in gasoline demand. See belowNotably, the US  miles traveled is still around 2.5  below the pre-COVID peak, similar to 2018. Vehicle usage has increased throughout 2023 but remains just below pre-COVID levels, while gasoline production and products supplied are generally at 2019 levels. These data indicate a small glut may have developed in the gasoline market over the past two months.That said, total stocks of both gasoline and distillate fuels remain below average today. Total petroleum product exports are also very high, though they have declined marginally over the past two months. See belowWith fuel exports high and inventories low, there remains the significant possibility that gasoline will fall back into a shortage. The price of crude oil has also risen dramatically over the past two months due to  that market, creating higher costs for Phillips 66. The short-term outlook for the company's refining margins is bearish due to the low crack spread today. However, there have been no evident fundamental supply changes, such as  dramatically  improved refining infrastructure investments or a sharp increase in inventories that would point toward a prolonged glut. Most likely, the current small surplus is caused by a decline in gasoline demand associated with the economic trend.From a longer-term standpoint, we're also seeing a massive increase in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles. Interestingly, there is a relatively strong correlation between the sales of these types of cars and the price of gasoline. As gasoline becomes more expensive, more people buy these more efficient vehicles to save costs. See belowStrong EV sales are also promoted by a marked  19 -  vehicle prices over the past year, partly due to overproduction and growing competition. Of course, as more companies build EV infrastructure, they're becoming more competitive with conventional vehicles  which are  expensive . Additionally, battery prices are falling due to the overproduction of  which may continue over the coming years.Admittedly, the core reason for my bullish perspective on Phillips 66 has been that I do not believe EV adoption will be as quick as many investors expect. I think barriers include higher prices, technological constraints, utility infrastructure needs, and greater exposure to economic shifts  due to higher prices . That said, the fundamental trend does not support my previous outlook as improved battery prices and immense infrastructure investments are making electric vehicles more competitive, which has dramatically accelerated in 2023.The recent sharp decline in EV prices has caused some analysts to expect that  be electric by 2030. Such an outlook appeared to be extreme in the past, but given the increase in fuel prices and the decline in EV production costs, it is becoming far more reasonable. In my view, the primary remaining barrier is  infrastructure and poor investment patterns by significant utilities. Still, if that barrier is overcome, electric vehicles may be adopted accelerated, potentially limiting gasoline demand significantly. Roughly two-thirds of crude oil is used for transportation,  for some fuel products. Given that, Phillips 66 does far relatively significant long-term risk associated with a potentially complete decline in transportation gasoline demand.Around one-half to two-thirds of Phillip's  is derived from its refining segment. Other vital segments include downstream marketing and midstream transportation, which should be stable due to the current volatility in crack spreads. The overall crack spread is now back at similar levels to its 2021 and 2019 range but above its 2020 range. Between 2021 and 2019, Phillips 66 had an average  segment income of - 282M. Its refining income was over  5B annually during the first half of 2023, indicating immense exposure to changes in crack spreads.Since the company  crack spreads, I will estimate its future income using the - 282M average for 2019 and 2021, given the crack spread is now back in that range. However, I will extrapolate its income for its other segments based on their six-month profits during Q1 and Q2 of this year. Total segment profits from non-refining segments were  2.15B during the first half of 2023, giving us a  4.3B non-refining annualized profit outlook. Combined with expected losses on refining, its annual profit outlook is  4.03B. Those  each segment's interest, depreciation, and other operating and non-operating costs, excluding taxes. At a 25  tax rate, my income target for PSX is  3.02B, or  2.87B, after accounting for noncontrolling interests.With a twelve-month profit outlook of  2.87B, I expect PSX to deliver an EPS of around  6.45. This figure is well below the consensus EPS estimate from other analysts . However, most of those estimates were likely made before the very recent crack spread crash, erasing the most significant portion of Phillips 66's usual income. Of course, my method for estimating its segment income may differ from others, so there is a wide range in potential variation to its income, with  -  1B not being unreasonable. Further, based on low gasoline stocks, the crack spread could certainly rebound over the coming months should the minor glut reverse. That said, I prefer to make estimates based on current commodity prices.PSX has traded at an unreasonable low  P E  over recent years due to immense profits in its refining segment. Since the data has shifted against refining profits, its EPS will likely decline,  back to around  6.45. Before 2020, PSX traded at a  P E  of around 12.5X during most of the 2010s decade, which were more stable years for crack spreads  but not oil prices . Using my EPS target at a 12.5X valuation, I value PSX at  80 per share today, just over 25  below its current share price.As such, I am slightly bearish on the stock today but would not bet against it because the crack spread could rebound and dramatically improve its outlook. Obviously, my new target for PSX is quite bearish compared to my bullish outlook seven months ago. I continue to believe that PSX could have ample long-term upside due to a lack of total refining capacity, as previously discussed. However, as investors, we must also remember the immediate reality, which is bearish for Phillips 66 due mainly to the sharp increase in oil prices and stagnate gas prices.Further, my long-term view is based on the rate of adoption of electric vehicles. If adoption is slow, then Phillips 66 could benefit from abnormally high crack spreads as it has over recent years. However, if adoption is faster, as  to see this year, then marginally lower gasoline demand could easily cause crack spreads to become lower than usual. At this point, I will not admit that EV demand is so high that the bulk of the refining business model will soon be antiquated. However, it is admittedly more elevated than I previously assumed, mainly due to improvements in battery costs and greater EV price competition. If that pattern continues through 2024, Phillips 66 could face more significant issues as gasoline demand falters. Even then, I believe the company should have enough time to alter its investments to cater to a post-gasoline future, which could be anywhere from one to three decades away.

Marathon Petroleum: Elevated Crack Spreads And Share Repurchases Make This Attractive,"Marathon Petroleum  was started in 1887 with the combining of several smaller oil companies in the Lima, Ohio region. When the company combined, the new company was called the Ohio Oil Company and was foundedBy 1888, Standard Oil already controlled most of the Lima Oil Field and was the primary company that transported oil from the Lima Oil Fields to Chicago and other cities. In 1889, like it did with so manyFast forward to 1911, when the Standard Oil Company was broken up thanks to the anti-trust laws at the time. The separation finalized in 1913 and The Ohio Oil Company was once again an independent company.In 1930, The Ohio Oil Company acquired the Transcontinental Oil Company which had a brand name called Marathon with a slogan that stated,  The best in the long run.  The 1940s and 1950s was a very innovative time period for oil and gas companies and The Ohio Oil Company was one of the leading companies in innovation and then in 1962, the company officially changed its name to the Marathon Oil Company.Up until 2011, the Marathon Petroleum Company operated upstream assets as well as downstream assets. However, in 2011, the company chose to spin off its upstream assets into a separate company called the Marathon Oil  and became named the Marathon Petroleum Company. Therefore, Marathon Petroleum Company only consists of downstream assets such as refineries and pipelines, today.The outlook for the refining business remains very strong through 2023. In 2022, the business experienced some of the highest crack spreads in recent history. You can see below that the spreads jumped over  1.20 when historically, they hover around  .40.The EIA, for what it is worth,  that crack spreads will normalize once again over the coming years. Their forecast for after 2023 is shown after the gray dotted line. Will this happen  I would be skeptical if this can return to what it was prior to the pandemic but time will tell.Here is what crack spreads have actually done throughout 2022. Throughout 2023, crack spreads have remained elevated in the range of  .80 per gallon.The EIA forecasts that refinery utilization will remain in the 90 percent range in the future, just as it has in the past. In other words, the industry is operating at full capacity and there isn't going to be any meaningful new refining capacity coming online any time soon. In 2022, Biden approved a large export terminal for the Gulf Coast, but it doesn't appear there is new refining capacity, only the ability to .The last, large scale refinery to come online was in 1977 and was the Marathon refinery in Garyville, Louisiana. It came online with 200,000 barrels of capacity and has around 600,000 barrels per day of capacity today. Since then, no new refineries have opened that produce greater than 50,000 barrels per day. New refining capacity does not appear to be a threat to Marathon's business.Marathon's business remains strong. I would say the industry and Marathon are well-positioned for the future. Given the regulatory environment that is engulfing the oil and gas industry, it should provide large refiners like Marathon with a competitive moat for years to come.Since spinning off the Marathon Oil Company, MPC has operated with anywhere between 500 to 600 million shares outstanding. For the past two years, the company has been aggressively buying back shares. This is going to continue to be a bullish signal for Marathon. In 2019, the company had about 664 million shares outstanding. Today, the company has reduced that by over a third, down to roughly 400 million shares outstanding. They were able to reduce shares since the end of 2022 from above 500 million, to where it is today. Year-to-date, as of this writing, the company's shares are up over 30 percent.This has been a good strategy for the growth of the share price. However, with interest rates continuing to rise, I would think that capital deployed towards share repurchases becomes a much less effective use of capital and that at some point, it will become more strategic to either strengthen the balance sheet, or find stronger capital projects to invest into.That said, Marathon has a relatively strong balance sheet as most of their debt comes from their holdings of their midstream company, MPLX . They own 64 percent of the shares in MPLX.Here is Marathon's debt-to-asset ratios over the past 5 years. With some senior notes coming due in 2024 through 2026  slide above , it will present good opportunities to deleverage the balance sheet, especially if interest rates continue to rise.Here you can see that Marathon is able to operate at a 93 percent utilization rate indicating strong demand remains for refining and that Marathon is operating efficiently despite having significant maintenance downtime in the quarter. This dovetails with the industry outlook above, demonstrating that despite the regulatory monster, demand remains strong.Strong crack spreads combined with Marathon's established refining and marketing business creates a strong position for Marathon. Much of how their stock will perform will depend on crack spreads going forward, but with their midstream assets providing some level of diversification, I believe Marathon represents a good value. Crack spreads have remained elevated through 2023 so far and so it represents a risk of buying while crack spreads are high. However, they have remained elevated since 2022 and perhaps this is the  new normal  as many things have remain changed since 2021.That said, Marathon's shares have had a very good run in 2023 and it might be prudent to wait for a pull-back in the share price, or dollar-cost average.Overall, Marathon is a good way to gain access to downstream assets if you believe this is the best way to position yourself to the energy industry. However, I also prefer upstream assets   as they represent greater  in my opinion. The downstream refinery business' source of growth will be more at the mercy of crack spreads as it is difficult to bring new refining capacity online in this regulatory environment. And with a dramatic shift continuing in the transportation industry towards electric vehicles, greater refining capacity may not be an extremely prudent investment. There are a lot of variables to consider at the moment but nothing is going to change so quickly to take away Marathon's current and long-term strategic position inside the energy industry.

Exxon Mobil: Superior Asset Base And Execution To Fuel Returns Throughout The Cycle,"Looking at Exxon Mobil's financials and operations, the company is undeniably in a better spot than it was 10 years ago. Following the decline in oil prices due to US shale overproduction and especially since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent crash in oil prices, management has shifted its strategic focus away from an expansion-at-all-costs mode, to aThis shift becomes evident when looking at the proportion of CAPEX to total cash generated by operating activities  CFO . Especially the years 2013 and 2014 saw a CAPEX to CFO ratio more than 3x that of 2022 and 2023 in a comparable oil price environment. Another key point to highlight is the spike during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 which is part of management s countercyclical spending approach as despite the sharp decline in cash flow, it did not cut CAPEX to the extent that peers did. This spending was to a large degree concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico as capital spending was redirected from supporting producing assets due to low oil prices to the buildup of new assets as countless new idle wells were drilled. While presenting a risk to the company s debt position in the short run, this strategy reaped huge benefits for the Exxon Mobil as those wells could be quickly setup for full operations during the subsequent recovery and spike in oil prices with CFO growing more than more than 4x from FY20 to FY22 opposed to peer s average of 2.3x.Alongside the Permian Basin, XOM currently focuses its capital and exploration expenditures on developing its operations in the Starbroek Block off the coast of Guyana which, together with the company s assets in the Permian, yielded a combined production of c.0.9 Mboed or 24  of total as of FY22. These key strategic growth projects, which also include Exxon s LNG and Brazilian operations account for c.70  of total CAPEX and are initiated at 10  and 15  respective IRR hurdle rates at  35 bbl Brent while capital spending on other, legacy assets is largely comprised of maintenance to keep production stable with targeted divestments of high-cost projects. As part of its Q2 23 earnings call, management stated that the company s wells in the Permian and Guyana deliver 2x of unit earnings compared to divested ones, highlighting the effect this decision will have on Exxon s productions costs per barrel in the long run.With management s production targets of c.1.2 Mboed in Guyana, c.1 Mboed in the Permian and around 405 kboed of Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG   author estimated growth at 3  p.a.  as well as an assumed decline in non-strategic asset s production of c.5  CAGR over the period, I estimate Exxon s total output to grow at 4.3  CAGR to c.4.6 Mboed by FY27. Management has also included Brazil s Bacalhau field in their strategic growth projects, estimating it to add c.220 kboed, however, as Exxon has  a failure to find oil there I have excluded it from my forecasts. This shift towards higher-return and lower-cost assets which I estimate to comprise more than 50  of total production by FY27 is the first pillar of management s business plan to bring down breakeven costs to an industry-leading  30 bbl from  37 bbl as forecasted for FY23.In my opinion this will not only benefit Exxon in terms of pure costs, but also make the company more agile and flexible to react to changes in oil demand and price. Especially in the Permian, the production of these  short-cycle-barrels  can be brought up quickly in a favorable price environment and equally quickly be shut down in an unfavorable environment. Management estimates that by FY27 28  of the company s total production base will be comprised of such assets which I view as a key advantage in times where oil cycles seem to get shorter and shorter with oil trading as low as  20 bbl to as high as  120 bbl in the span of less than 3 years.As second pillar of its plan to produce oil at  30 bbl by FY27, management has also undertaken several internal initiatives to streamline the company s operations and help reduce overhead and corporate costs beginning in 2019. Exxon is fully on track to deliver the targeted  9bn of structural and sustainable savings in operating expenses as compared to FY19 baseline with around  8.3bn realized as of Q2 2023, the majority of which achieved through operational efficiencies in production and marketing as well as reductions in workforce with total FTE down from 74,900 to 62,000.The combination of a lower-cost asset base and structural cost savings has resulted in recent margin levels being almost 50  higher than in oil price comparable years 2013 and 2014 with most of the expansion happening post FY20 after the company had initiated its new savings strategy. With the increasing ramp-up of low-cost production in Guyana and the Permian and further reductions in headcount and operational inefficiencies due to continuing technology adoption across the value chain, I estimate this margin expansion to continue and allow Exxon a significant degree of operating flexibility throughout the oil price cycle going forward.Another metric that highlights the much stronger position that Exxon Mobil is currently in when compared to prior high oil price environments, is the increase in return on capital employed  ROCE  which measures earnings as an output relative to the company s asset base less financial debt as an input. This is where both aforementioned key points come together with earnings growing at a higher pace than capital employed through an expansion in margins while capital spending remains disciplined. Plotting XOM s achieved returns on capital against the annual average  bbl Brent for FY13 to FY22 and estimating a regression between the two variables for a benchmark FY13-19 period, it becomes evident how much Exxon has been able to improve its capital efficiency when operating at similar oil price levels. While FY21 has largely performed in line with the benchmark prediction, FY22 and the LTM period generated 1.58x and 1.67x that of benchmark estimated ROCE levels respectively, highlighting the stellar operational improvements the company has achieved in recent times, irrespective of underlying oil prices.This trajectory has also placed the company well ahead of European oil majors and closest US competitor Chevron with XOM generating 1.3x of peer average ROCE over the LTM period further supporting the company s strong investment case ahead of peers.I view Exxon Mobil s downstream business which is the largest among peers at c.38  of total earnings as of FY22  vs peer average of 20  as a key competitive advantage due to the diversification it provides the company with, with refining and chemical production as a partial hedge against cyclicality in crude oil prices. When compared to peers, Exxon has shown a lower correlation in YoY  EBITDA to YoY  oil prices over the period from FY14 to FY20  for FY21 and FY22 the correlation would take into account Exxon s much faster recovery as shown earlier  which in my view highlights the  at least partial  downside hedge a large downstream business can provide for an integrated oil company as refining and chemical production margins benefit from lower crude oil input prices all else equal.As part of its business plan to improve efficiency in the segment and grow earnings 3x by FY27 to FY19 baseline, XOM has divested a set of underperforming and older refineries in recent years, focusing human and physical capital on high return complexes with large scale and tight knit integration of refining and chemical production. This should allow the company high flexibility in adjusting production output and mix to a changing energy landscape. On the other hand, Exxon is actively growing the business with expansions at the Baytown, TX and China facilities, the second of which scheduled to start operations in FY24 and produce an estimated 1.7mt of polyethylene per year. With the majority the company s refining capacity located on the US Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana, I estimate the increasing share of production coming from the Permian to offer additional upside to margins.The second pillar of management s strategy is a shift in production mix in the chemicals segment towards higher value-add performance products which offer higher margins and growth with sales of performance chemicals having grown at 2x the rate of commodity chemicals. With those key projects on the ground and the aforementioned company-wide structural cost reduction programs, I estimate Exxon to further lead its peer group in downstream, in both scale and operating efficiency with earnings margin already around 1.5x that of peer average  5.9  vs 4.1 .This segment is also one of the key factors in Exxon s preparations for an eventual post-oil period, rapidly building up its capacities in biofuels with management estimating them to add  700MM in annual earnings by FY27. Next to carbon capture technology, biofuels have become XOM s strategic focus in the renewable energy space as the company seeks to draw from its strengths in molecules and refining instead of diverging operations into adjacent fields such as power and electricity production, as some of the European oil majors have done in recent years. Management has also clearly communicated its commitment to keep renewable and fossil energy products competing for capital with IRR hurdle rates around 10  applied across the entirety of the company s operations. This is a direct differentiator to the strategy employed by European competitors which invested, and continue to invest heavily in power generation through wind or solar which from an IRR perspective, significantly dilutes profitability and capital efficiency with i.e. Shell aiming for IRRs of 6-8  in this field.As of Q2 23, Exxon has around  41.5bn of debt and  29.5bn of cash on its books, equating to a net debt position of  12bn. Since a peak of 21  net debt to total assets in FY20 as crashing oil prices forced to company to take on debt to fund management s counter cyclical spending and dividend payout  Exxon did not cut its dividend during the pandemic , the company had gradually delevered to a current net debt ratio of 3 , a 10-year record low. This is remarkably low when compared to peers with Chevron at 4.7  and European majors at around 10 .At such low debt levels and with oil prices projected to remain elevated in the near term, this should greatly benefit shareholders as management can fully allocate FCF to grow dividends and buy back shares instead of using parts of it to pay down debt. This is further benefitted by Exxon s capital discipline with lower CAPEX increasing conversion of CFO to FCF. XOM shares currently yield 3.3  with dividends having grown at 2.74  CAGR over the last 5 years and being increased consistently since 24 years. Current yield is lower than peers, however I do estimate significant upside here as aforementioned factors will benefit Exxon s ability to grow shareholder payouts above industry-average for the coming years.Next to dividends, management has long let shareholders participate in the company s profits by buying back outstanding shares, lowering share count and thus increasing earnings and dividends per share. Since FY13, Exxon has bought back approx.  70bn in shares or around 16  of current capitalization along with paying out  148bn in dividends. At a cumulative CFO of  446bn for the period this equates to a total shareholder payout ratio of c.53 . When compared to Chevron at 48  and especially the European majors which have averaged a payout ratio of 36 , this in my view highlights Exxon s superior commitment to its shareholders with management recently announcing an   annual  17.5bn for FY23 and FY24 with  15bn of purchases in FY22 , up 15  from its previous guidance for  30bn to FY23  15bn annualized . At current share prices, this could retire up to 319MM shares and lower total share count by a further 8  to help stabilize EPS with profits coming down from record FY22 levels.Due to the Oil   Gas industry s long-lived nature, I value Exxon using a 5-Year DCF model with a WACC of 9.5   derived from XOM equity beta of 1.04 and assuming a post-tax cost of debt of 5  and a perpetual growth rate of -2  which in my view reflects the overall prospects of the industry as fossil fuels will eventually be phased out despite the transition period likely lasting until at least 2050. For oil prices I assume a base scenario of  75 bbl Brent over the projection period from FY23 to FY27 which I estimate as a good proxy given OPEC s commitment to keep prices elevated and removal of Russian crude from  Western  oil markets. For cash flows I follow the company s official guidance as of its Investor Day 2022, aiming to bring breakeven cost per barrel to  30 and a CFO of  60bn  2x vs FY19 at  60 bbl Brent benchmark . This yields a CFO per  bbl above breakeven price sequentially rising from  1.6bn to  2bn through FY27. CAPEX is assumed at midpoint of company guidance of  23-25bn for FY23 and  20-25bn for FY24-FY27.Using these inputs with October 16 as valuation date, I obtain an Enterprise Value of c. 610bn  of which 64  accounting for Terminal Value  which, adjusted for Q2 23 Net Debt of  12bn and Minority Interests of  8bn, yields a Fair Equity Value of c. 590bn or  149 per share, giving an approx. upside of 35  to current trading levels. Accounting for different scenarios with oil prices from  70 bbl on the lower end and  90 bbl on the upper end as well as perpetual growth rates of -1  to -3 , total upside potential ranges from 9  to 67 , highlighting an upwards skewed current risk-reward profile for XOM shares.Following the reasoning laid out above, I view Exxon as a best-in-class play on structural tailwinds in the energy sector given ongoing cost-reduction programs leading to increased margins and capital efficiency as well as management s strategic decision making to limit capital spending on high-return, lower-cost assets and products across both up- and downstream. Coupled with Exxon s strong position in the Permian and leading position in Guyana as well as management s industry-leading commitment to shareholders, I see significant upside to current trading levels which in my view do not accurately reflect the stellar trajectory and operating performance the company has managed to deliver in recent times.Risk to my thesis include a stronger than expected economic slowdown with the US and Europe entering recession and China s post-covid recovery not materializing which could drag oil prices materially lower despite OPEC supply cuts as well as more extreme shifts in political and social climate towards hydrocarbons.Exxon is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings at October 27. Given my very long-term view on the stock I do not expect any significant changes in my investment thesis arising from the call, however, I advise current and prospective investors to pay specific interest to management s quarterly reporting of its progress in cost-reduction vs 2019 as well as any news regarding the Exxon s Brazilian operations after recently announcing a continuation of its E P activities in the Bacalhau field despite failing to find oil there earlier in the year.

Petrobras: Q2 Earnings Confirm Deteriorating Outlook,"In  on Petrobras  , I took a neutral view of the stock due to several yellow flags surrounding the company, particularly concerning the appointment of a former politician as Petrobras' new CEO and stateThe flow of negative news for Petrobras, especially with the company being influenced by political measures, such as subsidizing the price of gasoline in Brazil, has led me to maintain my cautious stance. Despite the company's attractive valuation compared to private and state-owned peers, the lack of clarity regarding its future direction makes me skeptical about entering into Petrobras shares.The recent Q2 results were disappointing, and the trend suggests that Q3 performance may be even worse due to the company's subsidies on fuel prices. The gasoline subsidies have already resulted in nearly R  10 billion in losses, with an average subsidyAlthough Petrobras has been considered a robust dividend payer, I believe this positive outlook could now be in jeopardy. As a result, I struggle to adopt any stance other than being bearish about the company's future.Petrobras recently reported that its board of directors had approved a new , reducing the percentage of free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous 60  to 45 .The company's investment cash flow for the upcoming years is still uncertain. Petrobras has not yet released its investment plan, which is expected to be disclosed along with the strategic plan 2024 and beyond in the coming months.Over the last five years, Petrobras achieved an average operating cash generation of approximately R  160 billion annually, while the average cash flow from investments was R  40 billion. Half this amount was allocated to maintaining operations, while the other half went to growth and new business lines  approximately R  20 billion each .Based on this historical data, the average free cash flow in recent years was around R 120 billion, suggesting that Petrobras would have distributed R 54 billion under the new dividend policy. This would result in an average dividend yield of 12.8 . Consequently, those who received super dividends of over 20  in the past year may not expect a similar payout this year.Looking ahead, I believe that Petrobras will probably continue to maintain yields in the double digits. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the company's investment program for the coming years.Petrobras has recently undertaken an extensive divestment program, selling refineries to private companies to increase cash flow and promote competition. However, with the current Worker's Party government in Brazil, there are indications that this process could be reversed, potentially pausing sales to expand refining capacity.Furthermore, increased spending and past management under the Worker's Party  President Lula's party  have raised concerns about irregular investments, as  by  Operation Car Wash  and the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts.I believe Petrobras' Q2  left something to be desired, primarily due to the company's new commercial orientation, despite presenting reasonable operational impacts.Regarding the company's financial performance, there were notable highlights. Revenues dropped by 18  YoY to R 113 billion due to the fall in Brent prices, lower export revenues, and reduced refining margins. The Exploration   Production segment also saw a decline in revenues, totaling R 72.9 billion, down 32.5  YoY, primarily influenced by the drop in oil prices.EBITDA in the second quarter amounted to R 49.9 billion, compared to R 78.5 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Recurring consolidated EBITDA stood at R 56.7 billion, and recurring free cash flow  operating cash flow minus investments  reached R 33 billion, with R 7.8 billion related to non-recurring divestments.Investments increased to  3.2 billion in Q2 2023 compared to  2.1 billion in Q2 2022, with 80.2  of this amount directed towards the Exploration   Production segment, aligning with the company's current business plan. This value will likely continue to rise for other segments in absolute and relative terms.Considering a net debt of R 203 billion reported in the quarter, the company's net debt EBITDA ratio stood at 0.74x, resulting in R 28.7 billion of net income compared to R 54 billion in Q2 2022.While the financial figures, such as revenues, EBITDA, and dividends, appeared at reasonable levels and were attractive in size, specific points stood out and required closer examination moving forward. Notably, gross debt's evolution increased from  53 billion in Q1 2023 to  57.9 billion in Q2 2023. It's important to note that the dividend policy, based on 45  of operating cash flow minus the company's investments, is subject to a clause that applies only if the gross debt remains . This condition challenges the bullish thesis based on dividends' strength.However, it would be premature to assert that the debt will reach its limit, considering the potential effects of fuel price adjustments. The  of 23  and 20  in gasoline and diesel prices, respectively, representing around 70  of revenue, coupled with the exchange rate effect and an 8.1  fall in the value of Brent, a 1.6  drop in volume, and a further 16.5  reduction in prices in BRL, all contributed to approximately R 10 billion extra losses QoQ.Petrobras' import parity prices policy  IPP , adopted in 2016, was  in May. Despite the expectations of a significant decline in the company's shares, the impact was not as severe as anticipated. The new pricing policy was not drastically different from the IPP and did not substantially affect the company's profits and dividends.However, recent concerns resurfaced when Petrobras introduced a new price-cutting measure, which seemed poorly timed. On June 30, the company  a price cut on gasoline and cooking gas, leading to a 5  decline in its share price. This decision surprised many investors, and some fear that Petrobras is intervening in gasoline prices to protect President Lula's image. Monitoring the evolution of discounts applied to the nominal value concerning parity during the third quarter of this year will be essential to assess the situation further.These factors add complexity to Petrobras' financial outlook, and careful analysis will be crucial to assess the company's ability to manage its debt levels and maintain its dividend policy in the future.Despite the uncertainties, Petrobras announced a dividend payment of R 1.14 per share, totaling about R 15 billion, scheduled to be paid in two installments in the last two months of this year with a cutoff date of August 21.Currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio  P E  multiples of 3.8x its earnings, Petrobras is still trading at a significant discount compared to its peers. So it is challenging to argue that the company does not have an attractive valuation looking purely at the multiples.Take the example of larger petrol companies in market capitalization Exxon , which trades 11.9x its forward earnings, and Chevron  12.1x. Historically, both companies trade at a 40  discount to Petrobras  today, that discount is about 70 .Unlike the two American companies mentioned earlier, Petrobras is a state-owned company with a history of governance heavily influenced by political interference. The company's  is a former Brazilian politician from the Worker's Party.The presence of state risk and the company's past use as a political tool are concerning factors that, in my view, are already materializing. This is evident in the recent price-cutting measures and the discontinuation of the international price parity policy, with the company now subsidizing fuel prices.Given these risks, Petrobras would need exceptionally attractive multiples to be considered a good investment. A slightly stretched multiple, such as the company's , may be enough to raise a yellow flag. Petrobras trades at multiples of 1.1x, representing a premium of about 9.6  compared to its average over the past five years.The graph below illustrates that the period between 2020 and early 2022, when the share price significantly deviated from the P B ratio, is now in the past. The decline in the P B ratio from 1.6x in 2021 to 1.1x may indicate that the share price has decreased relative to the company's book value. This could result from investors reducing their expectations regarding the company's future performance and the decreased , such as its refineries, relative to its share price.While Petrobras maintains solid fundamentals and is expected to pay good dividends for some time, I perceive it as highly unlikely that the company will replicate the exceptional results of the last two years.Following the second-quarter results, I have identified significant uncertainties that cast doubt on a bullish thesis for Petrobras. These uncertainties include the discounts applied to the nominal value concerning international parity prices, the potential risks associated with investments in new refineries given the company's controversial past in this area, and the company's increased use to support national content policies. The latter may exert additional pressure on the company's investment line, and there is also a possibility that the company may  assets that were sold in the past.As a result of these concerns, I currently maintain a bearish stance on the company's prospects for the third quarter, and I foresee at least a 10  downside potential from the current  13.50 share price. Such movement would be supported by the company's forward P B premium. Additionally, considering the substantial decline of over 40  observed throughout this year, it seems probable that further downward movement will occur.

Sigma Lithium: Emerging Producer In A Volatile Lithium Market (Rating Downgrade),"For several months now, Sigma Lithium  has been the subject of takeover speculation. Numerous media reports have been , discussing how Sigma was being shopped around to companies both inside and outside the mining world. I But despite being at the center of all this media noise, the company's mining operations have kept chugging right along. Sigma started commercial production this year and has very ambitious plans to grow total production in the years to come. Its managementSo, given all of these positive factors, one would expect to see Sigma's stock price trading at or very near all-time highs. But, as most investors are probably well aware, that's not the case. Sigma has been unable to escape the effects of broader macroeconomic trends that have been impacting the whole industry. In this article, we'll discuss why Sigma's stock price has been trending downward since mid-July.Sigma's Grota do Cirilo Project has had a rather smooth ride over the last few years. The company has been able to bring the project to completion without any major operational, jurisdictional, legal, or financial challenges slowing down the process. And although Sigma's recently released Q1 numbers, for the quarter ended March 31st, don't yet show any revenue, that should all change when Q2 numbers are eventually released.In May, the company  its first revenue when it sold 15k tonnes of tailings and 15k tonnes of 5.5  battery grade lithium concentrate to Yahua International Investment and Development Co., Ltd., a China-based company which is one of the largest lithium chemical refiners for EVs in the world. Sigma also announced that it had signed an offtake agreement with Yahua to cover the sale of up to 300k tonnes of tailings per year for 3 years. These will be upcycled into battery grade lithium concentrate for use in electric vehicle battery production.Since then, the company has continued to ramp and expects 2023 total production to be 130kt and to hit an annualized run rate of 270kt by Q3 of this year. And, as discussed in , this is only the first of a multi-phase project that will eventually see production grow to 766ktpa when Phases 2 and 3 are eventually added on. Sigma filed a PFS this past January and is currently working on the Definitive Feasibility Study for both Phases 2 and 3. It hopes to complete both phases sometime next year, a very ambitious target indeed.Sigma's management often points out the disconnect between its current  3.7 billion market capitalization and the market caps of other large producers when each companies' total production is taken into account. Intuitively this makes sense  if Sigma, which is now guiding to a production number of 130kt this year, produces as much as Livent  and Allkem  combined and half as much as Albemarle , should it really be valued at a fraction of what these companies are valued atHowever, that valuation method takes an overly simplistic view. Sigma has yet to show a profitable quarter, has one property, operates in one country, has no refining capacity, and is a relatively young company. Albemarle and Livent on the other hand, have been around for decades, have been profitable for quite some time, have well-developed downstream capacity, have numerous properties in many countries giving them geographical diversity and long production lives, have diversified revenue streams  in the case of Albemarle , have both hard rock and brine experience  in the case of Livent Allkem , and have deep and long-standing relationships with clients. Investors are clearly assigning some value to these factors and that seems very reasonable.If Sigma can continue to ramp up production without any major problems and if it can bring its other projects online successfully it will eventually be able to somewhat narrow the price gap between itself and other senior producers. But given Sigma's current stage of development, it seems fairly valued at these prices relative to the others. But its price, however, may continue to pull back in the short term due to factors that are completely out of its control.Over recent years, the lithium narrative has become very well known. The rise of EVs has prompted many investors to wonder how auto OEMs will ever be able to source the battery metals required for the assembly of all these new vehicles. Graphs projecting the growth in lithium carbonate demand, such as the one below, have become very common and can be found all over the Internet.Amongst many investors the lithium thesis has become received wisdom, and, in my opinion, it is 100  correct. Barring some revolutionary technological breakthrough which allows for the assembly of effective batteries without lithium, lithium consumption will continue to increase for many years to come. However, it is also highly unlikely that growth in demand will be as smooth as the graph above suggests. Lithium, like all other commodities, will be subject to the ebbs and flows of the global economy.China currently accounts for the lion's share of the global EV market. In June, EVs held a  of the Chinese passenger car market and China accounted for 57  of global plug-in car sales. And, as can be seen in the exhibit below, year-over-year sales growth continues at a very healthy clip. The North American and European markets are also growing quickly but it's clear that, at present, the global EV industry is quite dependent on the Chinese market. And that's a problem.It's becoming increasingly clear that China's economy is in real trouble. Over recent years, the Chinese government has had to lower its GDP growth target from 8-9  per year a decade ago to 5  this year, and that's just the target, the real number is probably much, much lower. Youth joblessness in the country has become such a problem that the government now  to publish youth jobless data. And the real estate crisis that began several years ago has also grown much worse and now threatens to engulf some of the country's largest developers such as Country Garden Holdings .It appears that the deteriorating economic situation has not yet reached the car market, but, in all likelihood, it eventually will as long-term unemployment and plunging property values are not conducive to a buoyant car market. And if that occurs, the impact is likely to be felt all the way up the EV supply chain, causing lithium prices, which over recent months had already begun pulling back, to fall even further.The Chinese car market will eventually recover from any pullback, and even if it were to enter a long and dawn out economic recession, growth in the US and European EV markets would eventually offset any long-term loss of demand in China. But the current rapid deceleration of the Chinese economy may mean that lithium prices are in for a bumpy ride over the next couple of quarters. Sigma Lithium is being downgraded to  for those reasons.Sigma is a solid, well-run company, and its share price will probably get some support from the takeover speculation currently swirling around it. Over the long term the stock may have promise, but over the next few months it will probably have limited upside due to the macro factors impacting the lithium space as a whole.

"Phillips 66 Vs. Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not","In the last 60 days, the refining segment has seen strong gains. So much so, that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface. After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads, the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels. However, all refiners are not created equal. In fact, when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US  Marathon, Valero, and Phillips 66 , you will find three different business structures.In this article, I will discuss two refiners, Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole, the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic. Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry . We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic. The pandemic's sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop, and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat. This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners. These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 12-18 months.Since greenfield refineries aren't exactly appealing in the public eye, and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry, the industry has shifted its investment focus. The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefits.To that end, several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits  more on that later  for producing renewable diesel. Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the works.As with most things, the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes. Currently, the EIA projects the 3-2-1 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024.Does all of this point toward the demise  or at least regression  of the refinery sector  Let's dive in to VLO and PSX to find out.VLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of  46 billion, just a bit smaller than PSX  50 billion . VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7,000 gas stations nationally. VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment. The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plants.When I look at Valero's , I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology, the Green Diamond Diesel brand, and ethanol production. These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal  possibly negative  economic value. As with any renewable initiative in an investing format, the measuring stick will always be how much 'green' it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineries.Below you will find Valero's Q2 10-K report. You can see that after impressive growth from 2022's numbers, the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12  of the companies operating income, up from approximately 5  in 2022. While not an overwhelming number, it is certainly a contributing factor to the company's bottom line.In my opinion, the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels' potential. To get our facts straight, I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves. The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data, is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining, although at much smaller volumes. Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon, we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involved.Diamond Green Diesel is VLO's brand for renewable diesel. In the 4th quarter of 2022, VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port Arthur. The premium generated by this product results from the multiple credit sources the government has established to spur its production. As shown below the price of RINs, LCFS credits, and BTC credits all play into the margin generated by DGD.It is important to note that currently LCFS credits are only offered in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington and thus the addressable market is relatively small. The pricing mechanism for these credits is affected by the number of 'credits' produced by low carbon sources and the number of credits 'consumed'  i.e. penalized  by high carbon sources. Therefore, this pricing mechanism could deteriorate as more renewable projects come online and replace high carbon fuel sources.More detail can be found at the The remaining price mechanisms for renewable diesel are the  and the   BTC . Both of these programs are administered at the federal government level. Similar to LCFS credits, RIN credits fluctuate based on supply and demand that is created by government established criteria.From the graph below  right side  you can see that the entire monetary value of renewable diesel is based purely on government subsidies with the feedstock costs significantly exceeding the selling price of the basic diesel commodity  Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD . Ultimately, dollars are dollars so I choose not to judge the source. It is important however, to understand the origination of profit.The ethanol group is by far the smallest of the three segments. But Valero has big plans for the small unit, again intending to capitalize on the government's various incentive mechanisms. It intends to do this via the combination of LCFS credits and by connecting the ethanol plants to a CO2 sequestration pipeline.VLO plans to connect eight of its 12 ethanol plants to a common pipeline to support CO2 capture. This entitles the company to the  invoked by the Biden administration. The 45Q tax credit is expected to contribute an additional  0.25 per gallon uplift when the pipeline enters service in late 2024. This credit, combined with the LCFS credits pose to significantly boost the profitability of the ethanol group by roughly  100 to  300 million on a quarterly basis.Given all the above data there is certainly opportunity for Valero to continue to boost overall profitability based on various government incentives. However, given the general size of both the DGD and ethanol segments, this most likely will not be sufficient to sustain the company's current performance should crack spreads decline as we enter 2024.Therefore, I believe VLO will face downward pressure in the medium term. This is based on two assumptions.1. Additional renewable projects come online that reduce the value of government incentives. RBN Energy has a very detailed discussion of this risk in its series, .2. The gradual adoption of electric vehicles will erode demand  or at least hamper meaningful growth  for conventional transportation fuels. This will gradually reduce crack spreads over time. I don't believe the pace of the EV transition will be sufficient enough to pose any near term risk. I view this transition as gradual, becoming more impactful over the course of a decade.PSX has a slightly smaller capacity and retail presence than VLO, coming in at just shy of 2 billion BPD refining capacity with around 2,500 gas stations. What I like about PSX is its diversification and not relying solely on refining. In the chart below you can see that refining only accounts for about 50  of its income. The remainder is spread amongst its midstream segment, marketing, and chemical businesses.Globally, the transition to cleaner burning fuels centers around the use of natural gas  methane  and or similar natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, and ethane. Europe and Asia are consuming these fuels at an accelerating rate, with a large percentage of it being sourced from the United States. This is where PSX's midstream business shines.PSX recently completed the transaction to boost its  in DCP midstream to 86.8  at the end of Q2 of this year. Following the DCP acquisition, the company owns or operates 72,000 miles of pipeline to transport products such as crude oil, refined products, NGLs, or Natural Gas to its export terminals. This allows the company to extract profits at every phase of the value chain from the wellhead to the docks, making it ideal for energy producers to transport using the PSX system.I am extremely bullish on LNG and NGL exports beginning to ramp significantly over the next 12-18 months.  for liquefied natural gas is expected to come online by the end of 2024 with additional projects still in the pipeline. This initial wave of projects accounts for nearly a 75  increase in US exports.Increased demand for midstream services will allow for margin expansion. This will enable PSX to have a thriving secondary business that provides solid and dependable cash flows. More importantly, since midstream businesses are generally fee based with only slight commodity exposure, they can hedge against declining refining margins.In the first quarter of 2024, PSX is expected to start up the Rodeo Renewed unit which is a conversion of the original refinery into a renewable diesel unit. As mentioned earlier, in the current market this carries significant potential for high margin production. PSX targets an annual EBITDA of  700 million from this project once it is operational.This project will be important for PSX to meet its stated projection to return  4.5 billion to  6.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024. , I showed that even taking conservative numbers for the Rodeo Renewed project and factoring in a 40  decline in refining margins, PSX should still be able to beat the high end of their return package guidance.PSX has overall less exposed to pure refinery risks than VLO. This is mostly attributed to the presences of its midstream business in DCP which provides a powerful diversification tool.Additionally, PSX is on track to complete an extremely large renewable diesel project in Rodeo Renewed. As mentioned earlier this has the potential for very high margins in the near term. As with VLO, I do feel the renewable diesel industry may see margin contraction due new supplies coming online.Another important comparison point would be the overall health of each company's balance sheet. The table below shows a stark difference in debt cash profiles between the two.PSX clearly will have some debt obligations to tend to over the next several years that could rob meaningful cashflow unless refinanced out into the future. Conversely, VLO is sitting in a very solid position, with more than enough cash on hand to meet all debt obligations for the next three years with ease. VLO certainly has the edge in this regard.Source  VLO PSX Quarterly and Annual 10-K reportsObviously, the common risk to both of these companies is declining crack spreads. With several incremental projects coming online in the next several quarters it is possible crack spreads drop in response to the supply increase. In this scenario, the overall profitability of both companies would drop back to more historical levels.I believe PSX's current business structure helps preclude much of this risk by having alternative forms of income from its midstream business that is inherently stable. Further, the midstream business focuses on natural gas resources that is in high demand around the globe. This attribute is key to my thesis that PSX is a more stable long term investment than VLO.A secondary risk to both companies is declining government incentives to produce renewable diesel as several new projects come online. A reduction in incentives will clearly impact these high margin products as they are not economically viable without this aid due to high feedstock costs. Due to the relatively small volumes of renewable diesel, neither company has sufficient exposure at this time to dramatically alter the course of the business. However, any anticipated growth aspects would be muted in this scenario.In this article, we reviewed the operational differences between VLO and PSX. Despite both being large scale refiners, their business structure is significantly different with VLO almost entirely focused on refining and PSX diversified with midstream, and chemical segments. However, VLO does have an upper hand in its balance sheet and near term debt requirements.The BoA thesis surely has merit, but is more applicable to VLO than PSX due to the latter's diversification from refining. This diversification provides for a safety net should crack spreads drop over the medium to long term. I therefore, in spite of the comparably inferior balance sheet, find PSX to be a more desirable long term investment than VLO. Further, PSX should have sufficient cash flows to manage its near term debt obligations. I previously included PSX in my  for a look into how I view its purpose in a dividend portfolio.

Enbridge Is A Core Retirement Portfolio Holding,"Enbridge  is one of the largest midstream companies, focused in Canada, with a market capitalization of more than  70 billion. The company has a dividend yield of more than 7 . As we'll see throughout this article, the company's recent dip in share priceEnbridge has an impressive portfolio of assets.The company's core business involves several major pipelines such as the Mainline pipeline, one of the most significant pipelines on the North American continent. The pipeline had record volumes of 3.1 million barrels day with the open season upsized and extended. The company has access to 75  of the refining capacity access in the U.S. and this pipeline will remain essential.The company expects escalators to start next year and is working to fixThe company also has a substantial gas transmission LNG asset it's built that connects to the major Rio Grande LNG asset. The company has a  1.2 billion cost for Phase I, as it supplies 100  of the feedstock gas to Rio Grande LNG. LNG plants have a multi-decade lifespan, and that'll provide reliable cash flow on the asset for the company.The company is also building up Canadian Gas transmission in the West, essential as Middle Eastern LNG goes to Europe and Canada has high premiums for transporting assets outside of its core asset bases. The Woodfibre LNG has 60  engineering on track for the second half of the year, and it's building up relevant gas storage assets.The company has worked to build up a strong utility business, highlighting its financial strength.The company has a massive number of renewable projects under development. A substantial   of these are wind projects, especially offshore wind which is growing rapidly. In North America, the company has more than 4.5 GW worth of projects in development, across a number of wind and solar projects.These renewable projects will enable the company to substantially expand its reliable long-term revenue.The company is building up a strong utility business in parallel with its renewable business, which provides substantial reliability to its cash flows. The company has grown from 3.5 million to 3.9 million connects, and expects 42k more connections in 2023. As the urban Canadian population grows, the company's strength will improve.The company has continued to achieve strong ROE on its assets, and we expect its growth to continue.The company's cash flow strength is becoming increasingly reliable.The company's asset base is more than 50  liquids pipelines earnings from EBITDA. The company has 47  regulated cash flow and 51  take-or-pay cash flow. 80  of the company's EBITDA has inflation protections with minimal commodity risk and a high   investment grade customers. The company maintains a high credit rating.That reliable cash flow will help future returns.The company's financial picture continues to enable strong shareholder returns.The company's adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to hit  16.2 billion as the company's DCF share increases to  5.45  4 USD . The company is impacted by hefty interest rates, and we'd like to see it roll down its debt yield, but its financials remain incredibly strong. Versus the company's  36 share price, it has a 12  DCF yield, showing its financial strength.The company's adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly coming from rising tolls on its liquids pipelines. The rest of the company's business has actually seen some weakness. The company's financing costs remain hefty and increased by double-digits YoY, but the company's incredibly strong EBITDA has continued to support its financials and earnings.Versus the company's  16.2 billion target EBITDA, its debt is  75 billion CAD. That's a massive  56 billion USD debt versus its  73 billion market cap USD. The company plans to continue using its cash flow for growth. Its debt to EBITDA can stay fixed as its EBITDA grows, enabling additional debt capacity for the company.The company's financial strength and continued growth make it a valuable investment.The largest risk to the company's thesis is the impact of continued debt raises in a rising interest rate, along with protests against the company's operations. Specifically, efforts to get rid of Line 5 or make it difficult to replace. That could dramatically hurt the company's ability to maintain its cash flow and shareholder returns.Enbridge has seen its market cap trend down by more than 20 . That has pushed the company's yield up to 7.5  and pushed its market capitalization down to just over  70 billion. The company has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years, which only uses up roughly 70  of the company's DCF. That allows the company to have additional cash for other needs.Going forward, the company has a robust pipeline of development assets as it continues to build out its renewable business and utility operations. Out of the company's  14 billion USD capital program,  1.3 billion USD is renewables, and more than 50  is gas. That will enable the company's returns to diversify and grow.The Retirement Forum provides actionable ideals, a high-yield safe retirement portfolio, and macroeconomic outlooks, all to help you maximize your capital and your income.

Marathon Petroleum: Investing In The Fossil Fuel 'Supernova',"The US oil and gas sector has faced significant volatility, with little-to-no correlation to the S P 500 over most of the past three years. The sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2021, led by production cuts the year prior, caused most inMarathon Petroleum has significantly outperformed the general energy ETF The crack spread has been abnormally high in recent years for various reasons. It also rose rapidly over recent weeks due to refinery outages and a and diesel stockpiles. Accordingly, those two energy commodities have risen in value compared to crude oil, which has also increased in recent weeks. See belowThe gasoline spread has been generally elevated since the initial refinery issues in 2020, but has never returned to its pre-COVID levels due to ongoing refinery capacity shortfalls. The diesel spread was high last year due to the acute shortage of diesel fuel. Although that spread declined considerably after, it has begun to rise again due to signs that the deficit will likely return.In my view, the situation facing refining margins and profits on other downstream energy segments makes companies like Marathon particularly interesting today. MPC is hovering around its peak value but trades at a lower forward  P E  of 6.9X, indicating it could be discounted today. Of course, the downstream sector also faces economic, technological, and regulatory risks, which could offset its significant pricing power and tremendous moat. The company faces numerous complex factors  however, I believe its short-term outlook is solid, with decent potential over the coming years. Of course, the company will likely need to make more significant green energy transition investments in the long run. Still, those may never drive substantial profits for well over a decade. Accordingly, I expect MPC will benefit tremendously from the lack of investment in  legacy  oil and gas until then.Marathon's earnings  to lower refining margins that quarter, primarily driven by the low diesel crack spread. In Q3, its earnings outlook is much stronger due to the recent spread improvement, with both showing a strong upward trend. However, one of the company's major refinery plants will be  due to a recent fire, pushing its capacity utilization down to 93  from 100 . Of course, this issue is a double-edged sword because it contributes to the lack of available refining capacity pushing the crack spread higher. Across the industry, refinery capacity utilization is around 93  today  a standard level , but total capacity is still significantly depressed. See belowThe decline in total refinery capacity is the primary reason for the increase in refining profits, creating a chronic shortage of refined products due to a lack of production and high demand. This was triggered by a large wave of refinery . Refinery shutdowns or production issues will likely continue to grow as no new refineries have . As the country looks to shift toward electric vehicles,  due to the immense costs, low projected lifespan of refining projects, and increased regulatory burden outlook.One company is looking to build a , which will be completed in 2027  however, it will not add much to total production  129 refineries . I expect that project   and shortages . The labor and materials shortage is a significant secondary issue limiting capacity expansion and utilization. After that, the sharp increase in interest rates limits these companies' willingness to borrow money to expand and strongly encourages a return of invested capital. This trend is evident in Marathon Petroleum, which has slashed the CapEx budget  despite high profits , and substantially increased its cash-flow returns. See belowCash from financing  are net cash-flows from dividends, stock buybacks, debt repayments  being negative , and stock and debt sales  being positive . When compared to Enterprise Value  79B for MPC , it gives us a  true  dividend yield for the company as a whole  not just its equity . That figure is currently a staggering 19  for MPC, meaning at its current pace, it could buy back all of its debt and equity in about five years. Of course, MPC's ability to return cash highly depends on its refining margins, as that is the most variable part of its . More importantly, the sharp change in Marathon's focus from capital investing to return on capital shows the company is not looking to expand and is instead paying back its investors - a great sign for investors. The same trend is seen across the oil and gas sector, with virtually all larger companies halting most CapEx instead of capital returns, indicating a widespread unwillingness to expand into the  theoretically  limited lifespan environment  given the rise of electric vehicles .If the refinery market continues to see low production levels, which I strongly suspect, then there is a significant probability of a sharper increase in gasoline and diesel prices. One major catalyst is the lower inventories of these commodities and the rising fuel export level. Many other countries face similar issues to the US, mainly Europe, which was previously dependent on Russian fuel. As demand for US exports grows amid depressed refinery production, fuel inventories may fall to critically low levels and cause another significant price spike like that seen in diesel last year. See belowOverall, I believe the current situation points to a potentially large increase in refining profits, led by a sharp rise in diesel and gasoline prices compared to crude oil. Low inventories of those two critical commodities, volatile production after summer, and rising export demand could bring a more considerable shortage than last year's diesel shortage. As hurricane season nears, the potential for a black-swan decline in is very high, possibly creating a larger temporary production decline that pushes the shortage to an extreme.I believe MPC is an excellent way for investors to bet on increased gasoline prices. Indeed, it is also a means to hedge against a rise in fuel costs, a significant ongoing risk for most companies and the economy today. Marathon offers thepotential of a sharp acute rise in refining profits, which I suspect could occur over the coming months. The stock also appears attractive over the 3-7 year horizon, as fuel demand may be substantially higher than supply over that timeframe due to underinvestment across the industry. Eventually, the associated increase in fuel costs should accelerate the transition toward electric vehicles, likely causing MPC to lose. After that, the company can still sell chemical products, around 10-15  of total oil consumption today  however, its total profits should be much lower after the transition.I believe MPC's most significant long-term value opportunity is the possibility that the energy transition will take longer than expected. Marathon, and its major peers, are acting as if it will occur very quickly, rapidly reducing investments and returning capital today. However, should fossil fuel demand , the chronic shortage today could become far more significant. In my view, this situation makes MPC a  Supernova  investment, where it could see extremely high cash flows for years before its eventual demise  of its fossil fuel segment, but not its much smaller chemical segment . Given the US power grid must be expanded significantly before a  combined with utility , fossil fuels may dominate for longer than expected, extending the size of this  supernova.The difference between Marathon and its peers Valero  and Phillips 66  is insignificant. MPC's valuation is between the two, with a forward  EV EBITDA  of 4.7X vs. PSX at 5.8X and VLO and 3.9X. However, their three-year out-forward valuations are closer, with three-year forward  P E  of 12.3X compared to MPC at 12X. That indicates Valero's EPS will likely decline faster than MPC and PSX. Marathon is larger and has a higher operating margin of 10.4  compared to both of its peers. Thus, I believe Marathon has the best potential to maintain production over the coming years and reinvest  after the energy transition is complete. As such, MPC is my favorite stock in the group, but I am also bullish on PSX and VLO.The most significant long-term risk for Marathon is a more rapid increase in the utilization of electric vehicles. Currently, the EV market is a bit cold, with sales lower than likely due to economic strains on  workers. For the EV transition to occur more quickly, interest rates on consumer loans would need to be lower, discretionary income higher  or EV prices much lower , and fossil fuel prices would likely need to be higher. All those factors are possible, but today's specific environment does not encourage a rapid EV transition. Indeed, I believe the transition may be slower than most expect.Marathon also faces short-term risks, particularly with the stock reaching a new record peak. While I am moderately bullish on MPC, a short-term pullback may occur simply due to its recent breakout. A sharp economic slowdown could also harm gasoline consumption, pushing crack spreads and refining profits back down. That is a distinct possibility today  however has been highly resilient despite economic and price strains since late 2021, so a recession may not harm gasoline consumption as much as it did in the past. A recession would likely further break refinery capacity, probably increasing the sector's total  supernova  potential. While MPC faces distinct short- and long-term risks, it also offers tremendous immediate value and is a strong hedge against today's most considerable inflationary strains.

HF Sinclair Appears Fairly Valued Right Now,"Just like all the refiners,   has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis. Thanks to the sky-high refining margins that have resulted from the war in Ukraine, the company posted record earnings last yearJust like all the U.S. refiners, HF Sinclair incurred excessive losses in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis, which caused a collapse in the global demand for oil products. However, thanks to the reopening of the global economy, the company recoveredEven better, HF Sinclair has greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis. Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine in early 2022, the U.S. and the European Union imposed strict sanctions on the exports of refined products from Russia. As this country provided 10  of global oil output and an even greater share in the global markets of diesel and gasoline, refining margins skyrocketed to unprecedented levels last year. As a result, HF Sinclair posted record earnings per share of  14.73 last year. To provide a perspective, the previous record of the company was earnings per share of  6.44 in 2018.Refining margins somewhat moderated off blowout levels in the first half of this year but they remained far above normal levels. As a result, HF Sinclair reported earnings per share of  in the first half of the year and is expected by analysts to achieve earnings per share of  10.06 in the full year. If the refiner meets the analysts  consensus, it will post the second-best earnings per share in its history.It is also important to note that HF Sinclair is one of the highest-quality refiners in the country thanks to its exemplary management. Some oil companies, such as Exxon Mobil , curtailed their growth projects in 2018-2021 in order to keep offering generous dividends. On the contrary, HF Sinclair suspended its dividend for one year and issued some shares in order to fund two highly profitable acquisitions.In late 2021, the company acquired the Puget Sound Refinery from Shell  for  350 million. In addition, in early 2022, the company acquired Sinclair Oil and thus it added two refineries, a renewable diesel business, and a branded marketing business to its business portfolio. It is needless to say that the timing of these acquisitions was ideal, as refining margins skyrocketed shortly after the deals and have remained above average since then. Therefore, these two deals have offered outsized returns on investment so far.On the other hand, investors should not expect the exceptionally high refining margins to remain in place for years. The refining industry is infamous for its dramatic cyclicality. During periods of wide margins, some refineries invest in the expansion of their capacity while some new refineries are built as well. Consequently, global refining capacity increases, and thus it leads refining margins to lower levels, especially if the global economy decelerates or falls into a recession.Notably, the U.S. refining margins  by approximately 30  during the last month, from about  29 per barrel to  20.2 barrel. This is their lowest level since January 2022, just before the onset of the war in Ukraine. The current refining margins are somewhat higher than the average refining margins of about  18 per barrel in 2018 and 2019, but the tailwind from the Ukrainian crisis seems to have abated. The steep correction is somewhat surprising, given the heavy seasonal maintenance activity of refiners, which normally provides support to refining margins. Moreover, as the sharp correction of refining margins is very recent, it is hard to forecast at what level margins will stabilize.Overall, the tailwind from the sanctions of western countries on Russia seems to be fading. Indeed, analysts expect the earnings per share of HF Sinclair to decrease by 31  next year and by another 15  in 2025, from  10.06 this year to  5.91 in 2025.HF Sinclair is offering a 3.3  dividend yield. The stock has a payout ratio of only , and hence its dividend has a wide margin of safety, despite the cyclical nature of its business.It is also important to note that HF Sinclair has one of the strongest  in the energy sector. Its net interest expense consumes just  of its operating income, and its net debt  as per Buffett, net debt   total liabilities   cash   receivables  is standing at  3.3 billion. This amount is less than twice the annual earnings of the company and only 32  of its market capitalization, and hence it is easily manageable.The strong balance sheet of HF Sinclair is paramount, as it helps the company easily endure the fierce downturns of the refining industry that occur every few years. It also enables the company to perform highly profitable acquisitions during opportune times, such as the two acquisitions mentioned above.HF Sinclair is currently trading at an extremely low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 5.4x due to its blowout earnings this year. As the earnings of the company are abnormally high this year, they are not suitable for the evaluation of the stock.The earnings per share of  5.91, which are expected by analysts for 2025, can be considered much more sustainable and hence they can be used in the evaluation of the refiner. The stock is currently trading at 9.2x times its expected earnings in 2025. This valuation level is somewhat lower than the 10-year average of 10.3x of the stock. Therefore, the stock appears slightly undervalued right now.On the other hand, it is prudent to keep in mind that refiners are facing a long-term threat due to the exponential growth of the sales of electric vehicles and the unprecedented number of green energy projects that are being developed in response to the energy crisis experienced last year. Whenever all their renewable energy projects come online, they will probably take their toll on the global consumption of fossil fuels and hence on refining margins. Overall, HF Sinclair appears fairly valued around its current stock price.HF Sinclair has been thriving in the last two years, primarily thanks to the tailwind from the sanctions of western countries on Russia. In addition, the company is characterized by exemplary management, which does its best to enhance long-term shareholder returns by focusing on the factors of the business it can control. However, the refining business is highly cyclical, with its cycles being out of the control of the company. Therefore, it is prudent for investors to expect refining margins to revert to normal levels in the upcoming quarters. Overall, HF Sinclair Corporation stock appears fairly valued right now.

"New refineries set to come online could cut refiner stocks, gas prices - Barron's","Refining stocks have run higher this year, thanks to soaring demand for gasoline and diesel and a relative shortage of the products around the world, but next year could be different, according to Avi Salzman of .Two long-delayed refineriesThe two new refineries alone would add more capacity than the average year during 2015-19, when 800K bbl day of new capacity was added each year, Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Blair .The VanEck Oil Refiners ETF  is up 16  YTD, and refining stocks have performed even better  PBF Energy  , Marathon Petroleum  , Valero Energy  , Phillips 66  , HF Sinclair  .The new capacity in Nigeria and Mexico could hurt existing oil refiners, even in the U.S., since oil is a global market, and Blair predicted cracks - a measurement of margins used for refiners - will drop to  12 bbl for gasoline and  28 bbl for diesel in 2024, compared to  19 and  32 respectively this year.But in the short term, refiner stocks and gasoline prices could keep climbing, as already low fuel inventories have come under increased pressure from a  so far this year combined with higher planned maintenance after a long run of operating near full-bore.As of September 15, U.S. gasoline inventories were 4  below the five-year average for this time of year, while diesel and other distillates were 14  lower, the Energy Information Administration reported this week.Russia's announcement this week of a temporary ban on gasoline and diesel exports has tightened an already stressed global fuel market, but the severity of its impact will .Analysts at TD Cowen estimate the ban may last a little more than a month and could offer further upside for U.S. refiners.",132,2023-09-23T20:30:00.000-04:00
Marathon Petroleum Q2 Earnings: Why This Stock Is An Attractive Investment," is one of the refinery stocks that has been on my radar for many years and the biggest peer of my own refinery investment, Valero Energy .The company just reported its Furthermore, the company is expanding its business as it captures opportunities related to renewable fuel and its superior network of assets.In this article, we'll discuss all of this and assess the risk reward after the stock's 50  rally off its 52-week lows.So, let's get to itMarathon's second quarter was a success. The   36.8 billion in revenue, which was  2.94 billionThat said, sales were down 32.1  year-on-year, which might seem like a stunning number - it is. However, it's caused by last year's unusual developments. The war in Ukraine and refinery shortages caused gasoline prices to explode, leaving companies like MPC with favorable margins.Now, the environment is still strong, but not as strong as it was in 2022, which is a good thing for the economy.Having said that, in the Refining   Marketing segment, refining utilization increased by 4  to 93 , despite significant turnaround activity.An incident at one of the refineries' catalytic reformers in Galveston Bay reduced crude throughput by approximately 2.5 million barrels and its capture by about 1 .Please note that margin capture refers to the actual realized margin compared to a market-based benchmark margin.Sequentially, per barrel margins, were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions due to lower crack spreads and sour crude differentials.Refining operating costs decreased to  5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, primarily due to higher throughput and lower energy costs.As the overview above shows, the refining and marketing margin capture for the quarter was 97 , with the company's commercial team performing well despite planned and unplanned refinery downtime.The company expects fluctuating capture results based on market dynamics but believes its capabilities will provide a sustainable advantage.I have to agree with that, as fundamentals remain favorable.For example, at the end of July, Bloomberg  that gasoline prices are having a strong revival, causing refinery margins to jump.According to Bloomberg  emphasis addedThis is the chart Bloomberg usedWhen zooming out - using my chart - we see two things.Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum has a Midstream segment, which is its majority ownership of midstream giant MPLX LP .This Midstream segment delivered strong second-quarter results, with adjusted EBITDA remaining flat sequentially but 5  higher year-over-year.The business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows, with high-return growth projects progressing in the Marcellus and Permian basins.As a result of these tailwinds, MPC returned nearly  3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, representing a 100  payout of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.The company had approximately  6.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization and held roughly  11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.After all, one of the key reasons why the company is so aggressive when it comes to buybacks and dividends is its healthy . Not only did the company have roughly  11.5 billion in cash  10.7 billion excluding MPLX , but its gross debt-to-capital ratio is just 21 . Even including MPLX's  20.4 billion in debt, that number is below 50 .It also has no maturities in 2023.Since May 2021, MPC has repurchased 264 million shares, accounting for approximately 40  of the shares outstanding.The current dividend yield is 2.3 , which enjoys a payout ratio of just 9  and 10.5  average annual dividend growth over the past five years.Like Valero, Marathon Petroleum did not cut its dividend during the pandemic but used its balance sheet to take on more debt. Luckily, the years after the pandemic allowed the company to quickly reduce debt again.Having said all of this, the company is upbeat as it looks into the future.For the third quarter of 2023, MPC expects crude throughput volumes of approximately 2.7 million barrels per day, which would translate to a utilization rate of 94 .The utilization rate is expected to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, incentivizing high refining utilization.The company's guidance also assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter.Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter is expected to be  5.10, benefiting from higher throughput and lower costs due to completed turnaround and project activities.Distribution costs are expected to be approximately  1.4 billion, and corporate costs are expected to be  175 million, reflecting sustained reductions.Additionally, the company is investing in growth.For example, MPC completed the STAR project at its Galveston Bay refinery, which enhanced the competitive position of the refinery. The project increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing capacity and improved distillate recovery.MPC boasts two premier 600,000 barrel-per-day refineries on the US Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity, supporting its global commercial strategy.Additionally, construction activities at the Martinez renewable fuels facility are ongoing, with pretreatment capabilities set to come online in the second half of 2023.This facility is expected to reach its full capacity of producing 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.According to MPC, the Martinez facility will become one of the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a strong operating profile, logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate, supported by a strategic relationship with Finish refinery giant Neste.With that said, let's look into the valuation.When looking at the analysts' free cash flow estimates, we see a steep downtrend. However, it's not as bad as it looks. Essentially, what we're seeing is an expected long-term normalization in margins. 2022 was truly exceptional. Unless a miracle happens, we will continue to see normalization.However, bear in mind that in 2019, the company generated  3.3 billion in free cash flow. Even the expected result of  4.1 billion in 2025 would be far above that.Having said that, I do not believe that the decline will be this steep. Analysts continue to underestimate the earnings power of this company and its peers, which was confirmed by 2Q23 numbers.Nonetheless, sticking to analyst numbers and using 2024 estimates, the company is trading at 9.1x 2024E free cash flow.Not only does an 11.0  free cash flow imply a lot of room to maintain aggressive dividend growth and buybacks it also indicates a favorable valuation.Given the health of MPC's business and ability to capture long-term growth, I would make the case that the company should not trade below 12x free cash flow.This would indicate a fair price 32  above the current price.The current consensus price target is  144, which is 7  above the current price.Based on this context, I still do not urge anyone to jump into MPC. The economy is not in a good spot, and given the recent uptrend in the market and MPC, I would only buy this company after a 10-15  correction.My rating is bullish to reflect the fact that my longer-term target is well above the current stock price.In conclusion, Marathon Petroleum has shown impressive resilience and earnings power, despite economic weakness.The company's recent quarterly earnings report revealed strong refinery demand, setting the stage for aggressive buybacks and consistent dividend growth.With MPC's expansion into renewable fuels and its superior network of assets, the company is well-positioned for future growth. Despite a dip in sales compared to the exceptional numbers of the previous year, the company remains in a favorable spot.Furthermore, MPC's Midstream segment, through its ownership of MPLX, continues to generate strong cash flows and offers high-return growth opportunities.The company's healthy balance sheet allows for aggressive buybacks and dividends, making it a sound long-term investment with an attractive valuation.Overall, I rate MPC as bullish for the long term, considering its ability to weather market fluctuations and deliver sustained growth.However, given the prevailing economic conditions, it may be prudent to wait for a 10-15  correction before considering an entry into this promising refinery stock.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Exxon Mobil: Likely Higher For Longer,"The only time I    was on December 22, 2023, when the stock was trading at  107.9 and many investment banks began to revise their forecasts for the stock's future growth potential. AtThe balance of supply and demand in the oil market was predicted approximately correctly by most experts, and XOM stock ultimately proved to be the beneficiary, gaining 10.6  since the publication of my bullish article.As XOM's share priceExxon Mobil  a significant drop in its 2Q23 earnings, with adjusted net profit at  7.874 billion  1.94 per share , down from  17.551 billion  4.14 per share  in the prior year. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, weaker refining margins, and increased capital spending contributed to the decline. The firm's revenue decreased by 27  to  80.795 billion  the income from equity affiliates and other income are excluded , so it also missed the market's expectations.In April 2022, the company restructured, forming Exxon Mobil Product Solutions and centralizing certain groups. It now reports results in 4 segments  Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products.The Upstream segment's profit fell to  4.577 billion due to lower commodity prices and reduced oil-equivalent production. U.S. Upstream profit dropped to  920 million, while non-U.S. Upstream earnings declined to  3.657 billion. The Energy Products segment's profit decreased to  2.310 billion, primarily due to lower refining margins. Chemical Products reported a profit of  828 million, reflecting weaker industry conditions. In Specialty Products, profit improved to  671 million, driven by higher pricing.Capital and exploration expenses rose to  6.166 billion  Exxon Mobil aims to invest in promising projects, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain a sustainable dividend, with an expected 2023 CAPEX between  23- 25 billion.Oil prices got a boost as Saudi Arabia and Russia  voluntary production cuts until year-end, tightening the market. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in their recent note  September 20, 2023 - proprietary source , that Brent Crude exceeding  100 per barrel seems stretched, despite strong signals of market tightness, such as rising prices, robust demand, and falling inventories. The market is currently undersupplied by about 1 million barrels per day, mainly due to OPEC's 1 mb d cut, led by Saudi Arabia. The analysts expect that Saudi Arabia will maintain its cuts well into FY2024, keeping the market tight until at least early 2024. However, significant price increases are unlikely, with Brent expected to range between  85 to  95 per barrel by the end of 2024.So, based on the tight market situation until early 2024, XOM has an excellent background for its operational activities, which should become even more efficient in the foreseeable future.As another group of Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote a few days ago  proprietary source , the company aims to triple its earnings by FY2027 compared to FY2019, mainly thanks to strategic projects. XOM sets records for oil production in the Permian and achieved record production rates in Guyana. They also completed a significant chemical expansion project in the Gulf Coast. Exxon Mobil anticipates bringing on 2 new projects in the second half of the year, Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further enhancing earnings potential.After opportunistically rationalizing and divesting lower-margin refineries over the past few years, Exxon Mobil's Energy Products portfolio is now 85  integrated with its chemical facilities. In the long term, Exxon Mobil has positioned itself well to take advantage of opportunities in product reconfiguration, particularly in the biofuels, lubricants, and chemicals sectors as the energy transition continues to evolve.At the same time, we see that the valuation of the company currently looks quite modest  The market sees EV EBITDA for next year at the  6.7x level, although the EBITDA margin  TTM by quarter  is currently 21.5 , which is 57 basis points higher than last year for the same period. From a historical perspective in terms of EV EBITDA multiples, XOM is valued at the low end of the norm but has a very strong FCF that is likely to be even higher due to higher oil prices and is currently over 10  of market cap, indicating serious undervaluation.In recent weeks, refining margins have improved due to low clean product inventories, strong demand, facility outages, and geopolitical uncertainties, such as reduced Russian exports. Exxon Mobil, with its global refining capacity of about 4.5 million barrels per day, is expected to benefit significantly from these higher margins. Based on current price expectations, there is a  7  potential upside to Energy Products  downstream  consensus earnings in the second half of 2023 and a  15  upside to 2024 previous estimates, Morgan Stanley analysts added.Let's do the math together  If the above forecasts come true, or if actual earnings are close to these levels, then at 7.5x of EV EBITDA we should get a market cap of  533 billion after adjusting for net debt. Then the upside potential from the current price would be 14.38 , excluding   FWD . The expected total return exceeds 15 , so I reiterate my previous buy recommendation.I should mention that Exxon faces several significant risk factors in its operations, so everyone should be cautious when buying its stock.First, the company operates in a commodity-driven industry, where it has limited control over the prices of its products. This vulnerability to fluctuating commodity prices can impact its profitability and financial performance, as was the case throughout its entire history.Second, Exxon is engaged in major capital projects, and cost overruns on these projects can pose financial challenges. These overruns can strain the company's financial resources and potentially affect its ability to meet its investment goals and deliver expected returns to shareholders.Additionally, geopolitical risks are a concern for Exxon. Operating in countries with a history of corruption and political instability can expose the company to uncertainties that may impact production volumes and returns. However, Exxon's global presence helps mitigate some of these risks by diversifying its operations across different regions.Despite many obvious risks, Exxon Mobil stock is a  Buy  today even at the high end of its multi-week price range becausea  the oil market is still tight,b  refining margins are improving,c  management is taking some strategically sound steps to improve the company's operational efficiency  andd  the stock is quite cheap given the strong FCF levels,As a result, I expect XOM to be higher for longer - at least until something fundamentally changes.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Strong 3rd Quarter For Commodities,"Commodity indexes hadThe energy sector rallied sharply during the quarter led by strong gains in gasoil and heating oil. There is a global shortageThe industrial metals sector was up a little over 3  for the quarter and CMCITR s larger exposure to the sector allowed for slightly improved relative performance versus BCOM. Gains in the sector were led by aluminum  8  and zinc  12 . Disappointing growth in China continues to be a concern for the sector as China is the largest consumer of industrial metals by a wide margin.The agriculture sector was mixed with large gains for sugar, cocoa, and cotton, while wheat fell around 15 . Soybeans, soy meal and bean oil all fell marginally. Curve positioning of CMCITR for the agriculture sector added to relative performance versus BCOM.The livestock sector gained 2.5  during the quarter, led by continued gains in live cattle. It is currently trading at all-time historic highs. Lean hogs steered BCOM s outperformance in the livestock sector ahead of CMCITR  however, the small sector weight in both indexes  CMCITR  4.5  BCOM  6.15  contributed minimally to absolute performance. This is evidenced in the Roll Yield chart below.The precious metals sector was the only sector down during the quarter, falling around 3.6 . This was led by a 4  drop in gold prices. CMCITR s smaller exposure to this sector versus BCOM added to the relative outperformance.The near-term outlook for commodities continues to be uncertain as U.S. interest rates and the U.S. Dollar continue to rise. The sharp rise in 10-year U.S. treasury yields late in the 3rd quarter was a headwind for growth and commodity demand. Over the longer term, we still believe commodity supplies will be tight, which will likely lead to higher prices and continued positive roll yield.

Biofuel Demand Strengthens The Business Case For U.S. Agribusiness,"Farmers are often both food producers and suppliers of a range of raw materials, with the latter now becoming more important than everThere are a number of feedstocks that the US biofuels industry uses to produce biofuels. Corn is by far the largest, representing over 90  of the volume, with most corn being processed into conventional ethanol. The second largest feedstock for biofuels is soybean oil, making up around 3  of the total feedstock used. Animal fats used cooking oil  UCO  and vegetable oils like soybean oil are generally turned into biodiesel orUsing corn to produce ethanol initially took off following the Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  in the mid-2000s and California s Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS . We've written about these policies in a bit more detail previously . The number of corn bushels used for ethanol has been relatively stable in the last decade.We're now seeing strong growth in the use of other feedstocks, which is mainly the result of . The expansion in refining capacity has led to additional demand for animal fats and UCO, but we also see more soybean and canola oil from oilseed crushers and corn oil from distillers being turned into renewable diesel. Increased production of renewable diesel is mainly taking place at the expense of biodiesel, and total renewable diesel production volume has overtaken biodiesel production for the first time in 2023.Both animal fats and UCO are rapidly approaching their supply limits, according to the International Energy Agency. The US already has high UCO collection rates, so it s also looking abroad for additional supply   and this means that competition between the US and the EU for Asian UCO supply is heating up. The future supply picture for animal fats is mixed. US cattle inventory is following a downward trend, limiting the growth potential for beef tallow, the most important animal fat used in biofuels. Larger supplies from the poultry industry can partly offset this due to the growth in the number of broilers.The biofuel market continues to evolve, and we see varying demand outlooks for different feedstocks. Since corn ethanol demand from the road transportation sector has likely peaked already, overcoming hurdles to enter the market for sustainable aviation fuels remains a key concern. Given the ongoing growth in renewable diesel capacity, there is clearly more growth potential for fats and vegetable oils. Ethanol producers and oilseed crushers are also busy with upgrading the protein content in their other products to tap into higher value-added feed and food applications.Corn is the most widely used feedstock when it comes to biofuel production in the US, specifically for ethanol production. The ethanol sector accounts for around 38  of total corn consumption, which is up significantly from just 6  in the early 2000s. Historically, the view has been that there is a blending wall for the US ethanol industry, with the widely accepted barrier being at 10 . However, it's become more apparent in recent years that this blend wall does not appear to be as impenetrable as previously thought, with the ethanol blending rate in the US exceeding 10  since 2016. The growing availability of E15 and the capacity for a larger share of the vehicle fleet running on it would have helped to break above 10 . Any car with a model year 2001 or newer is approved to run on E15, which is basically almost 96  of the car fleet.A further increase in blending rates will likely drive any growth in US ethanol demand from the road transportation sector. However, given efficiency gains in cars with combustion engines and the growing share of electric vehicle  EV  sales, road fuel demand in the US is likely to decline in the coming years. In turn, this will reduce the amount of ethanol that will be needed.In the next decade, we expect downward pressure to emerge on the demand for biofuels in road transportation   especially in the latter part of this decade. Because current biofuel production for cars is primarily driven by the federal Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  mandate to blend biofuels into fossil gasoline,  will replace both fossil gasoline and biofuel demand. Weaker-than-expected RFS biofuels blending mandates for 2023 to 2025 add further constraints to demand growth.We estimate that, mainly because of EV development, current levels of ethanol demand are likely to decrease by 7.6  to 14  by 2030 based on different scenarios of gasoline consumption and ethanol blending rates. In the scenario of rapid reduction in gasoline consumption without increased blending, the 14  decline in ethanol demand works out at around 700 million bushels less in corn demand. This is equivalent to losing around four million acres of corn.A potential key outlet for the corn and ethanol industry is the aviation sector, driven by soaring commitments from airlines to use Sustainable Aviation Fuels  SAFs  to power their fleets. The aviation sector is more difficult to decarbonise, and biofuels will likely have to play a more significant role in this. Biofuels still make up a marginal share of jet fuel. Feedstock availability and costs mean it is more challenging compared to road transport. However, given the large-scale and stable production of ethanol in the US, and with ethanol-to-jet technology becoming more widely available, we could expect the contribution of ethanol-to-jet fuel  EtJ  in total SAF production to increase.US jet fuel demand is currently around 1.55m b d  24 billion gallons , and the EIA expects it could approach close to 1.75 mb d  27 billion gallons  by 2030. . With current regulations allowing SAF blending rates of up to 50  with jet fuel, the demand potential is significant, particularly when considering that current blending rates are less than 1 . Assuming the aviation sector fully absorbs the 14  reduction in ethanol demand from road transportation, it would only take SAF blend rates up to around 4  by 2030, all else being equal. So, pressure on ethanol demand means the stakes are high for ethanol producers to open up new markets in aviation.When it comes to biodiesel in the US, soybean oil is the largest feedstock. Around 11.6 billion pounds of soybean oil goes towards biofuels, which is almost 44  of total soybean oil demand. This is up significantly from less than 1  in the early 2000s. In order to produce the necessary amount of soybean oil, around 991m bushels of soybeans are needed  assuming 1 bushel of soybean produces 11.7 pounds of soybean oil .The EIA forecasts that US diesel demand will fall from around 3.67m b d  56 billion gallons  in 2022 to 3.31m b d  51 billion gallons  in 2030. At face value, this suggests that the outlook for biodiesel is for demand to edge lower, which theoretically would mean that the demand for soybean oil from the biofuels industry would also trend lower over time. Obviously, this can be offset by higher blending rates of biodiesel into petroleum diesel.However, the more significant factor which is likely to support soybean oil demand  along with other vegetable oils  from the biofuels industry is the growth in renewable diesel capacity. Renewable diesel can be used as an alternative to petroleum diesel so the potential demand growth is significant, given it can fully displace petroleum diesel rather than just be blended with it.There has been significant investment in recent years in renewable diesel capacity and the demand for renewable diesel is less likely going to be negatively impacted by the adoption of EVs. This is because renewable diesel serves trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles, and these vehicles are less well positioned to use batteries because of their large sizes and consequent long time to charge.By the start of 2021, the US had around 791 million gallons of renewable diesel capacity, which grew to around 3 billion gallons by the start of 2023. Meanwhile, some forecasts suggest this capacity could reach as much as 6 billion gallons by 2025, and from 2026 onwards, capacity could total 7.4 billion gallons with a number of projects still in the pipeline. Looking at EIA numbers, we can derive that almost 30  of US renewable diesel was produced using soybean oil as a feedstock. If we were to assume a similar proportion was used for renewable diesel in future and total capacity of 7.4 bn gallons between 2026 and 2030, there would be additional demand for 16.9b pounds of soybean oil, which would equate to around 1.2b bushels of soybeans.But, if we were to assume all new capacity was to use soybean oil as feedstock, this would increase the need for additional soybeans to almost 4.1b bushels. In reality, future demand needs will likely be somewhere in between this, with plenty of uncertainty over the feedstock mix, given availability issues. In addition, there are questions over whether all this planned capacity will actually come about.That said, it is clear that the longer-term demand prospects for soybean oil are constructive. The US would need to see a combination of increasing soybean acreage, reducing soybean exports and increasing the domestic crush to meet future demand. Significantly stronger demand for soybean oil would mean the need to invest in domestic crushing capacity. Under this scenario, the US would move away from being a significant exporter of soybeans to a larger producer and exporter of soybean meal. The surplus meal produced could prove challenging for the industry in terms of logistics, whilst clearly weaker meal prices would mean that soybean oil prices will have to do most of the work to ensure margins remain attractive for crushers.The Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  is providing generous tax credits to the biofuels industry. Firstly, the IRA extends the previous biomass-based diesel blender s tax credits from December 2022 to December 2024. With biodiesel, renewable diesel, and some other kinds of alternative fuels eligible for application, these credits will continue to boost the production of biofuels for road transportation. Secondly, the IRA creates new tax credits for SAFs at  1.25- 1.75 per gallon until the end of 2024. This will strongly encourage the production of SAFs, especially when fuel production faces high upfront investment and still needs technological advancement. The clean fuel production credit will replace both sets of tax credits starting 2025 through 2027.While the current SAF tax credits sound attractive to producers and investors, several areas deserve special attention. First, produced SAFs must achieve emissions reduction of at least 50  to be qualified for the tax credits under the IRA and this is not easily the case for every SAF. For instance, different producers may have different life-cycle intensities even for the same SAF production pathway, but on average, producing SAF through the ethanol-to-jet fuel  EtJ  pathway with corn grains as the feedstock can emit as much as 66 gCO2e MJ according to a research paper published on Journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. This is not enough to meet the 50  emissions reduction threshold to be eligible for IRA SAF tax credits.So, the case for corn-based EtJ is less straightforward from a carbon reduction perspective unless corn-based ethanol producers are able to reduce carbon emissions, such as through on-farm measures and by applying carbon capture and storage  CCS  at production sites. Whilst plans for several pipelines are in place, they also face opposition. If only corn-based SAF that is equipped with carbon reduction technologies can meet the IRA tax credits  requirements, it will be put it at a more disadvantaged position when competing with other kinds of SAFs in the market.Secondly, to receive the highest levels of tax credits, the prevailing wage requirement will need to be fulfilled. Biofuel producers need to pay their workers the minimum wage set by the Department of Labor and use at least 12.5  of the labour hours from workers registered under the federal apprenticeship programme or a state-level equivalent. There were roughly 600,000 active registered apprentices in the US in 2021, but large discrepancies exist across geography and industry. Therefore, it is not by default that companies can meet this requirement, and producers may find themselves in a position of needing to raise wages or recruit more qualified workers to take full advantage of the IRA.Growing demand for cleaner fuels offers companies along the agricultural value chain an opportunity to extract more value from their crops and by-products. Policy continues to play a key role in setting the pace. Recently updated Renewable Fuel Standards for 2023-2025 will likely slow down some of the anticipated expansion of soybean processing capacity. Markets are expecting more clarity from policymakers on the conditions for using corn ethanol in jet fuel by the end of this year.That said, future biofuel demand will greatly influence farmers  planting decisions. Prices will need to do the work to ensure that farmers adjust plantings, which implies sowing more soybeans at the expense of corn. However, the potential opportunities for Ethanol to Jet  EtJ  in sustainable aviation fuels may complicate this.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Oil Won't Hit $300 But Chevron Is Still A Buy,"Lately it has become fashionable for writers to predict that WTI crude oil will go to . Several commentators floated this price target in recent months, and countless news outlets repeated their claims. It all got started back in theTo lay my cards on the table, I don t think that oil is going to  300 per barrel any time soon. Oil consumption has been rising lately, but the pace of increase over theFor this reason, we can expect the supply of oil to stay close to its historical range in the near term. The Saudis may cut or boost output briefly for political reasons, but their long run incentives argue for selling the profit-maximizing output.It s for this reason among others that I think   stock is a good value today. We are likely not going to see oil prices reach a level where CVX will stage a monster rally, but prices should remain healthy enough for the company to pay its dividend, and maybe even deliver modest capital gains. This is significant because the stock s current dividend yield--is far above average. If investors just realize a modest 10  capital gain on their CVX shares over the next five years, then their total returns will be substantial. In this article I make the case that CVX stock is a decent buy today not because oil will go to  300 or any other ultra-high target, but because it can make very good money at the oil prices we re seeing now.Chevron is an energy company involved in the oil industry in a number of . It sells oil, natural gas, diesel and jet fuel. It operates a natural gas business, which includes LNG transportation services. It s one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian Basin, which Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger consider one of the best oil fields in the world. It has 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity. Finally, it has a chemicals business, which transforms crude oil into chemicals needed for heavy industry.Chevron is a pretty diversified, full-service oil and gas business. That's a good thing, because it allows the company to make money in different market conditions. Pure play E P companies tend to make the most money in oil bull markets, because they sell oil and gas on the open market. Refiners on the other hand can make good money even when the price of oil is fairly low, because their business involves in order to refine it into gasoline, diesel or some other usable fuel. Compared to a pure play E P like  , CVX won t gain as much from rising oil prices, but it won t suffer as much when oil prices go down either.This diversified business model is a major competitive advantage for Chevron.Being involved in exploration, production, refining and sales, the company can capture profit at many different points along the oil   gas supply chain. Whereas a pure play E P can only make money selling crude oil, Chevron can extract, refine and sell  in the form of gasoline , the same barrel of crude. This ultimately enables Chevron to earn higher margins than many of its competitors.In order to gauge how well Chevron will do in its upcoming third quarter release, we need to look at previous earnings releases from periods when oil was at about the level it s at now. According to , WTI Crude was hovering around  90 in the fourth quarter of 2022, much like it is today. So, Q4 of 2022 could be a good indicator as to how 2023 s third quarter will turn out.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Pretty decent results. The second quarter of 2023 on the other hand was not as good. Its  includedAs we can see, Chevron s results for the most recent quarter were worse than those seen two quarters prior. However, the price of oil today is closer to that seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the second quarter of 2023. So, there is a decent probability that the company s upcoming earnings will look more like the Q4 2022 release than the Q2 2023 release. If that s the case, then CVX will beat on revenue, as analysts are only expecting  in salesHaving looked at Chevron s recent earnings, we can now turn to its valuation. At today s prices, CVX stock Speaking of free cash flowChevron does pretty well in terms of discounted cash flows. If you take the  14.5 in TTM free cash flow per share, and discount it at the current treasury yield , assuming no growth, you get a  322 fair value estimate. If you incorporate a risk premium of 6 , you get a  138 fair value estimate. The average of these is  230, which implies 38  upside to Friday s closing price.As we ve seen, Chevron stock certainly does not need  300 oil, or anything close to it, in order to have upside at today s prices. To my mind, that makes it a buy. However, there are many risks and challenges facing chevron stock today, including the followingThe bottom line on Chevron is this  it s cheap, it s profitable, and it s likely to post renewed growth in its third quarter earnings release. We re probably not going to see  300 oil anytime soon, but it doesn t matter. CVX stock is a buy anyway.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Making My Own Super Major Oil Company - Version 2.0,"Super major oil companies like Exxon Mobil  or Chevron  are household names. There isn't a person you could ask who hasn't at least heard of these companies. These companies are worth more than the In this article, I will compare the performance of a  10,000 investment in Chevron to the same investment spread amongst smaller sized companies that operate in the same upstream and downstream markets of the oil and gas industry in search of higher returns. This is my second installment of my experiment. In , I definitively concluded there were better investment options than Exxon Mobil. Now ITo draw a definitive answer, the following questions must be answered.I'll define certain criteria I used to framework this comparison.1. The smaller component companies are still large companies. A market cap of  10 billion is the minimum to be considered.2. The second investment will be spread as evenly as possible to match Chevron's production mix. For example, if 60  of Chevron's earnings  EBITDA  was from refining,  6,000 would be invested in a refiner. The remaining  4,000 invested in an oil and gas producer.3. All results will be based on Q2's returns and annualized for a full year. Returns during 2022 will not be considered since energy prices were largely an outlier from the past 10 year average due to the Russian Ukraine conflict. This has been done to not over inflate the projected numbers. I view Q2 commodity prices as a good barometer for below mid-cycle pricing.To facilitate this experiment, I have chosen to compare CVX against a blend of companies in the refining and E P spaces. These companies will be totally separate than those selected to compete against Exxon Mobil in the previous experiment.In the refiner space, I have selected Valero  and HF Sinclair . To shake up the producer section, I have selected Diamondback Energy  and Occidental Petroleum .CVX is a global producer, with major oil and gas projects all over the world. Conversely, the competitors, FANG and OXY, mainly produce out of the Permian Basin of the US. Therefore, there will clearly be operational differences between the companies and this is not necessarily an apples to apples comparison.Typical Permian production is in the range of 50  oil, 25  NGLs, and 25  natural gas. CVX's production profile is geared more to the natural gas segment, producing nearly  from natural gas. As one would expect, the shear size of volumes produced are also significantly different. In Q2, CVX's total daily output . This dwarfs the output of  and  for FANG and OXY respectively.Aside from these operational differences, the shareholder return packages are structured very differently. CVX employs more of a standard format with a moderate dividend and buyback program. FANG and OXY have altered their programs to match the ebbs and flows of the commodity cycle.FANG utilizes a base plus variable dividend strategy that is based off 75  FCF  inclusive of base dividend and buybacks . OXY aims to return as much as possible to shareholder through share buybacks and redemption of preferred shares with only a small dividend. So right off the bat, investors should be aware of that important difference between the companies.Chevron's refinery segment is on the smaller size for a company with a market cap of almost  300 billion. CVX brings home a total capacity of . This is on par with the capacity of Valero, which produces 1.42 million barrels per day. The smallest producer of the bunch is HF Sinclair  Market Cap of only  10 billion  which has 716,000 barrels per day of refining capacity.The competitors in the refinery space have a similar dividend program to CVX but have been pouring an unparalleled amount of cash into buybacks. Record crack spreads have allowed these companies to capitalize on the rapid influx of cash without creating a future liability by ramping up the dividend excessively.Before we get started, let us discuss the indicators we will be using to grade performance.1. Total Shareholder Returns - This includes dividends and buybacks to demonstrate which investment has superior returns to investors.2. Valuation - This will evaluate free cash flow generation per share, cash, and debt levels to demonstrate which investment has a superior value.3. Historical Price Performance - Understanding where we've been can help us get an idea of where we are headed.Through these points, I will look to draw conclusions if there is a superior alternative investment vehicle to CVX.To evaluate our return options, I first had to calculate the percentage of earnings related to each given segment. For CVX,  of Q2 earnings came from the upstream segment, leaving 18  spread across the different downstream segments, which can largely be lumped under a refining title.Below is an annualized summary of dividend payouts and share buybacks from the peer group. It is easy to see that CVX is near the bottom of the group, only beating out OXY by a 1  improvement in total returns.I used the following table to calculate the number of shares that would alternatively be purchased. Note that two different companies were selected for both the upstream and downstream segments to give some diversity to the results.Taking the number of shares in the above table against an equivalent  62.77 shares of CVX  at  159.31 share  generated the following investment options. Using this method, you can see that CVX is competitive with investments 2 and 3 and solidly outperforms investments 4 and 5.An important factor to note is that the return method is shifted more toward equity than dividend payments with these alternative investment options.From a valuation standpoint, it is pretty reasonable to expect that investors will be paying a premium to own a slice of the Chevron brand. But exactly how much of a premium are we paying and how much is that brand value worthThe first item we will look at is Price to FCF, or investment dollars spent for cash produced. Using the chart below CVX looks to be valued at a fair price for a pure producer. The refiners, however, are generating significantly more cash per share. Both VLO and DINO cost less than half that of CVX for every dollar of free cash flow produced suggesting that the refiner stocks are a better overall value.The second item to evaluate will be the cash and debt profiles for CVX. I have taken the net debt position of all five companies and represented that on a per share basis and a percentage of share price.CVX is a clear front runner in this area. CVX has a miniscule net debt position for a company of its size, setting it up to have a healthy balance sheet for the foreseeable future. This will ensure profits are either directed toward productive endeavors like capital projects or into shareholder's pockets.For our last valuation metric, we will look at historical price performance of a  10,000 investment. In this area, CVX is the bottom feeder for share price appreciation over the last 3 years. This is where the risk reward discussion needs to be weighed. From the chart below you can see the relatively smooth price curve of CVX versus the more volatile curve of FANG OXY. If investors are prepared to stomach the increased volatility, higher appreciation is possible with the smaller peer group.The comparison performed here has focused purely on stock performance and does not take into account any operational characteristics such as quality of assets, growth aspects, or management performance. As a result, it does not give credit to CVX for its incredibly diverse set of projects that span the globe.The resources at Chevron's disposal are unparalleled. The shear amount of cash flow and cash reserves give the company the capability to find and develop the world's next major reservoir. Simply put, CVX has the capability to be an industry trail blazer.Conversely, the smaller peer set does not have this ability. In the big picture, they are optimizers, seeking to be as efficient as possible in the Permian, while CVX is out scouring the globe for big pay days.There are both pros and cons to this approach. Even though big pay days excite investors and can drive record profits, this is also the status quo for a super major. It is a tall bar to constantly live up too.In this article we compared the stock performance of Chevron against a variety of both independent oil and gas producers as well as leading US based refiners. To draw conclusions from our comparison, we tried to answer three questions.Conclusion  Conclusion  Conclusion  CVXAnother downside to selecting the smaller peer group will preclude investors from benefiting from CVX's excellent balance sheet as well as the diversity of its world class assets. From a long-term vantage point, CVX's vast resources almost guarantee it will be at the forefront of the industry for the foreseeable future. These two factors can provide an ample amount of security that an investor may wish to consider.When selecting an option, both age and financial goals come into play. After weighing both options, my personal preference would be to select any of the alternative investment options. My personal preference would be to select Investment Option 2 or 3 thanks to FANG's variable dividend policy which could dramatically boost returns should oil continue its upward trend. This would also allow for the opportunity to capitalize on market volatility and share appreciation.Does this require additional work us as investors  Absolutely. However, in principal, we can be rewarded with both higher returns. CVX still has merit as potentially a more secure and less volatile investment while still producing moderate income, should that be a goal for the current season of your life.If this thought process has caught your interest, I have written individual analyses on all four of the  alternative  companies discussed in this space .Happy Investing.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently , I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash   in the  crack spread.  As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around  87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The  crack spread  is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of  32 barrel to  19 barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this  12 barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of - 12.96 annualized  3.24B quarterly .  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See belowHistorically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around  15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around  1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative   seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage . Its refining segment EBITDA was  3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as - 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected  1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at  1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about  5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a  1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of  5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around  830M, and its interest is currently around  142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra  972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at  4.67B, or  3.7B after taxes  21  historically . The company usually has  350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of  3.35B or an EPS of  8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at  7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at  1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of  448M, or  353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest  4M, or a  0.01 EPS . The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at  4.53 EPS  however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA  however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to  7.5 and a Q4 nearer to  1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4 , indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 , that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See belowAgain, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade  and today in particular  would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential ,  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves  both strategic and commercial , could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC  production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See belowAs the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around  -1 to  2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward  P E  of  30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a  highly sensitive   environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Energy Transfer LP (ET) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Energy Transfer LP  Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call August 2, 2023 4 30 PM ETTom Long - Co-CEOMackie McCrea - Co-CEOSpiro Dounis - CitiJeremy Tonet - JPMorganBrian Reynolds - UBSJean Ann Salisbury - BernsteinKeith Stanley - Wolfe ResearchMichael Blum - Wells FargoNeel Mitra - Bank of America Merrill LynchGood day, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  Operator Instructions  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded.I now like to turn the conference over to, Tom Long. Please go ahead.Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer s second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website.As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which we expect to file tomorrow August, the 3. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website.I'd like to start today by going over our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. We generatedOur volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower quarterly average natural gas and NGL prices, which declined 70  and 45  respectively over the second quarter of last year. DCF. Approval to the partners of Energy Transfer as adjusted was  1.55 billion, compared to  1.88 billion for the second quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of  579 million. On July 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of  0.31 per common unit, or  1.24 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from  0.23 paid in the second quarter of 2022. We continue to target a 3  to 5  annual distribution growth rate, while balancing our leverage reduction, increasing equity returns and maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest and our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. As of June 30, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities was approximately  2.36 billion. Now turning to results by segment for the second quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was  837 million, compared to  763 million for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher transportation, storage and terminal services margins related to increased volumes and higher rates, partially offsetting this with a  51 million negative impact, due to timing of the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory during the current period. We expect to fully realize the offsetting gains over the next two quarters. Adjusting for this non-cash timing matter around hedging, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter would have been  888 million. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13  to a record 2.2 million barrels per day, compared to 1.9 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region, and on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland terminal, as well as on the Mariner East pipeline system. Average fractionated volumes increased 5  to a record 989,000 barrels per day, compared to 938,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2022. For the month of April, throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day, which was a new monthly record. NGL export volumes grew 15  over the second quarter of 2022, driven by record NGL exports out of both our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellites contract going into effect on July 1, 2022, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. Year-to-date, we have loaded more than 30 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. And we are also exporting record volumes of ethane out of Marcus Hook. In total, we continue to export more NGLs than any other company and maintain approximately 20  market share of worldwide NGL exports as well as nearly 40  of U.S. exports. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was  579 million, compared to  903 million for the second quarter of 2022. We saw record throughput as a result of growth in the majority of our operating regions. The strong volume growth was more than offset by significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as increased operating expenses. Gathered gas volumes increased 8  to 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 18.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was  674 million, compared to  562 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to higher volumes on several of our pipelines increased throughput at our Gulf Coast and Permian terminals, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Crude oil transportation volumes were a record 5.3 million barrels per day, compared to 4.3 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems, the Bakken pipeline, and the Bayou bridge pipeline, as well as the acquisition of the Lotus assets in May of this year. Excluding the Lotus assets, crude oil volumes were still up approximately 10  compared to the same period last year, which was also a record. Integration of the Lotus assets is going as planned, and we continue to discover additional commercial synergies that are in excess of our original forecast. In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was  441 million, compared to  397 million for the second quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 17  over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, Tiger, Pebble and Trunkline. For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was  216 million, compared to  218 million in the second quarter of last year. Benefits from new contracts in Texas and the Haynesville as well as lower operating expenses were offset by decreases in retained fuel revenues resulting from lower natural gas prices, and fewer pipeline optimization opportunities. Utilization on our EOIT and rig systems increased due to higher demand for gas takeaway, and increased production in the Haynesville Shale. Now turning to our growth projects, and we'll start with our Lake Charles LNG project. In May of 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the DOE for an extension of the DOEs deadline for the commencement of exports. As many of you are now aware, in April of this year, the DOD denied our request for this extension, and in June, the DOE denied our request for rehearing of this decision. We have had discussions with the DOE subsequent to this decision and we believe the best path forward with the DOE is to file an application for a new export authorization. We expect to file this application in August and during the DOEs review of this application, we intend to continue to work with our existing customers, prospective equity investors and other stakeholders to progress the development of this project. In this regard in July, we entered into three non-binding HOAs related to the long term LNG offtake from this project for an aggregate of 3.6 million metric tons per annum. One of the HOAs is with Chesapeake and Gunvor for 1 million metric tons per annum. A second HOA is with EQT for 1 million metric tonnes per annum. And the third HOA is with a Japanese customer for 1.6 metric tons per annum. The HOAs are subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. Now turning to our Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. These terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers. We remain bullish that there will be significant long term growth in international demand for ethane and LPG products, as we are well positioned to benefit from that demand. Last quarter, we FID-ed an expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland in order to address this demand. We expect this expansion which is projected to cost approximately  1.25 billion to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This project is expected to be in service in mid-2025, and will give us flexibility to load various products based on based upon customer demand. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future. We also continue to pursue FID on an optimization project at our Marcus Hook terminal that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. At Mont Belview, we expect frac 8 to be mechanically complete in the next couple of weeks, which would put it into full service around September the first. This addition will bring our total Mont Belview fractionation capacity to over 1.1 5 million barrels per day. Out in the Delaware basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. And in June, we placed the Bear plant into service, which is our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware basin. These plants are supported by new commitments and growth from our existing customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential timing of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin.Turning to the Gulf Run pipeline, which we placed into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville shale for delivery to the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the United States with the LNG export market as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We continue to utilize a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run. And during the second quarter, we added additional long-term customer volume commitments through Zone 2, which are being delivered into our Trunkline Pipeline.We have very limited available capacity in the near term and are fully subscribed beginning January of 2025. As a result, we are in discussions to add approximately 1 Bcf of capacity via compression, which will require minimal capital investment. Depending on demand, we also have the ability to loop the system to another approximately 2 Bcf of capacity.On the alternative energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with Capture Point that is related to our North Louisiana treating plants. An application for a Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was followed by Capture Point with the EPA in June of last year.Also we are working with Oxy related to its Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, North of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex. We are working together to obtain long-term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers to Oxy sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. We are also continuing to have discussions with third parties related to the development of ammonia facilities at sites along the Gulf Coast, where we have docks with Deepwater access.Now looking at our growth capital spend for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Energy Transfer spent  794 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and interstate segments, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we continue to expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately  2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL refined products, interstate and crude segments. As a reminder, this capital outlook includes the NGL export expansion projects at Nederland as well as expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition.A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are already online or are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of this year at very attractive returns, including Frac A, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Additionally, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that we hope to bring to FID. As we look forward to this potential backlog of high-returning growth projects, we now expect our long-term annual growth capital run rate to be approximately  2 billion to  3 billion.Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance. As we get further into the year, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately  13.1 billion to  13.4 billion, which slightly tightens our range while keeping the midpoint the same. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022.Our base business continues to perform well, generating strong volumes and providing stable cash flows, which demonstrates our ability to operate through a volatile macro environment. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products, and our assets are strategically positioned to take advantage of new growth opportunities to meet this demand. As such, we continue to pursue strategic optimization and expansion projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. Our financial position remains strong. And we remain committed to our targeted distribution growth rates and the lower end of our leverage target, which we continue to balance while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lineup for our first question.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis from Citi. Please go ahead. Guys, first question, maybe just go to Lake Charles quickly. Two-part question there. So one, do you have any sense on the DOE timing at this point to approve a new non-FDA authorization  And Tom, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I believe you mentioned working with equity investors on the project. You actually identified potential equity counterparties yet  Or was that just more of a general statementYes, this is Mackie. Let me start, and Tom may add to it. Yes, for confidentiality reasons, we can't talk about who our equity partners. Maybe we can say that we have two very significant partners at a minimum, one that is one to step up for a large amount of the equity as well as a lot of the offtake.And I'll just make a quick comment. We've worked pretty hard on this project. We slowed down during the pandemic. Mason and his team did a great job picking this back up when Ukraine war started. We had tremendous momentum, signed up a lot, 8 million or 9 million tonnes developed relationships all around the world, really good relationships. A lot of those folks I've met over the last three or four months that really believe in our project, and then lowering the whole DOE cut the legs out from under us kind of by surprise without us even expecting it. So we kind of read gearing. We've spent a great deal of time with the DOE over the last several weeks. We have a real important meeting next week with them. And we're being optimistic that they'll work with us to exponentially go down this new path that we're going down to try to get an export authorization approved by them. But in the meantime, as Tom said, we are continuing to work with not only existing customers, but with new customers. And as I said, we have some equity partners that really believe in this project, and we'll be excited to have them part of the team as we work diligently towards FID.Great. That's helpful color, Matt. Second one is going to switch gears a bit here, but just in thinking about TTM. I think it was maybe two quarters ago, it sounded like you were hoping to be able to be in a position to announce something later in '23, but it also sounded market dependent, basically, I think, sort of looking for things to get better. And I guess we haven't seen that yet. So just curious, where are you in that process  How much is that delayed and maybe new sort of timing  I'm thinking about an announcement thereYes, I'll give a little background first. So we're talking about that earlier today. Nederland is such a gem for any partnership, but especially for ours. If you look at what sits at Nederland, in all of our connectivity to all the refineries, we actually are connected to over 25  of refining capacity from that area in South Texas. We have the ability to move large volumes of feedstocks to that facility. We've got four pipelines from Mont Belvieu with ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that can feed the petchem facility. And as I just mentioned, there's a lot of belief over the next 5 or 10 years by some, that there's going to be an issue of getting -- of finding a home for gasoline components, which would also feed -- or could be very good feedstocks for our petchem project. And then you add that to our ability to deliver to ethylene and propylene downstream of this project as well as the export markets, we couldn't be more excited. This is a very unique world-class facility, and we have an extreme amount of interest. We are focused with one equity partner today, who's very interested in a significant portion of ownership and also a significant portion of takeaway capacity. They actually have assembled a very large team working with us. And at the appropriate time, we'll be able to talk more about it. But yes, just like a lot of our projects, it is going to take time. It's a very unique cracker like nothing else in the world, not only because of what it can crack and what it can do, but also logistically with the advantages it has over any other crackers. So we're very excited about it, and we have a great team led by Raj and others working that project. And we do believe at some point in the road, we'll get to FID, but it is going to be down the roadways.The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Just want to pick up with, I think, some of the comments towards the end there with regards to capital allocation priorities. And now that the leverage has come in a bit, just wondering how you balance, I guess, capital at this point, be it distribution growth seems like it's a focus there, but also kind of tuck-in M A has been something that ET has done over time. And it seems like there might be larger industry consolidation of foot right now. At the same time, buybacks has been topical in the industry. So just wondering if you could kind of walk us through the latest thoughts on capital allocationYes, Jeremy, this is Tom. Still a very, very good question. So I always appreciate it. As you know, we have focused on the debt. We're very, very obviously pleased to have it down into our 4 -- kind of 4.5 range kind of at the top of it. So we'll continue to look at moving down maybe towards the lower end of that like we mentioned in the prepared remarks. But moving on past the debt side, the balance sheet side of it, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the projects that we've talked about here. I know we've got a fantastic team that's coming up with a lot of really, really good investment opportunities that continue to expand the great footprint that we've built. And we're just very, very excited about a lot of these and excited about the returns that we're getting on them. So you're going to see us continue to do that.But the distribution growth is the other piece of it. Moving on to that one, where we've put out that guidance of 3  to 5 , and we feel very good each quarter as each quarter goes by is to where we are on that. So we're going to continue to allocate toward that. The unit buybacks still remain on the radar screen. But I will say that right now, we're continuing to focus on investing in the company as well as the balance sheet and of course, the distribution growth to given back to our equities.But I do want to go ahead and expand a little bit on one other item you brought up in there, and that was the M A side of it. We do still remain very optimistic that you're going to see consolidation in the midstream space, and that's something that we feel like we're very, very good at. You can see from all the acquisitions that we've done, we can always make them very accretive. And they've got us to where we are today as well as within the organic growth projects that come along with each one of these. So we're going to continue to stay very focused on that side of it and allocate a lot of time toward that piece of it, too.Got it. That's helpful. And maybe picking up with that, some of the recent acquisitions, be it Lotus or even looking back at Enable, if you could kind of walk us through synergy capture, where it stands now versus expectations at that time  Just curious how things have materialized.Okay. Listen, why don't you let me start with that a little bit, especially on the cost side. And then Mackie will -- he's got a lot of great things to talk about there. So if you look at really both of those, and we'll start with the Enable one. That one just continues to exceed anything that we ever expected on that. So even if you go back to the S4 and you look at what forecast we had in there, we're significantly higher, a good probably 40  or 50  higher than what we were anticipating. And a lot of that was -- some of that was cost synergies, but there was a lot of commercial synergies that are now we're seeing every day as we continue to work through that. And once again, Mackie will expand on that. But I'll comment a little bit on the Lotus.Obviously staying disciplined the same way we did with Enable as to what we're transacting on these acquisitions, at what level we're transacting at. They work for us. They're accretive, and they're deleveraging. And likewise, on that one, we have achieved every bit of the cost savings that we were anticipating on that. But likewise, that one is still new. We just closed in May, but we're still seeing a lot of opportunities on that one also.And Mackie, I'll hand off if you want to add anything more on the commercial side on both of those.Okay. Yes. Chris Hefty and his team have done an unbelievable job. Those acquisitions that Tom just talked about have been incredible. Tom hit on a little bit, Enable. We keep finding things. We were able to move volumes out of Louisiana to Enable down to some of our East Texas assets and just a lot of things that we're finding that are very beneficial. Our WEX acquisition, it is what it is. We bought it at a great multiple, and it's proven out at that multiple or better. So we're very pleased with that one.And then Lotus, gosh, we've just closed it in our crude team gets excited every week about something new. Some new routes, some new blending opportunities, some new additions that we can add to move more throughput on some areas we didn't think about. So as I just mentioned, what great acquisitions that will end up paying off a lot more than we anticipated when we purchased them.And Jeremy, I'd like to just add real quick. When you have the very, very strong talent we do internally, the more tools you can provide to them, it is just truly amazing what we find out of each one of these.Got it, that s helpful. Thank you.The next question comes from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon everyone. Maybe to start off on the long-term annual capital run rate, growth CapEx run rate of  2 billion to  3 billion. I was curious if you could just touch a little bit more perhaps on what these projects could look like, differentiating between perhaps traditional midstream-based business opportunities versus some of these low carbon opportunities that you discussed, LNG, CCUS transport and ammonia  Thanks.Okay. It's Mackie again. Yes, we've got a lot of things already in the works that we've already got FID on. We're moving forward on. And then as we've talked about some of these and there's a lot of other opportunities that we're chasing, we certainly are looking at some renewable opportunities. For example, CapturePoint. As we talked about in the opening remarks, it will be a great project for us, not just because it will be transporting, sequestering CO2, but it also helps us with our upstream contracts on treating and transportation. So there's added benefits to that. And then some of the other projects that we're looking at will also be contributors. But from a capital perspective, it will be pretty minimal compared to a lot of these other projects that we're working on that we've already committed to and a lot of the ones that we think will get to FID over the coming six months and 12-month period.And the only other thing I would add to this, as you know, we do continue to work or look at and spend more time on more of these downstream projects like what Mackie has mentioned. But we are spending some time on the international front likewise in looking at various projects.Great. Thanks. And maybe to follow up on Lake Charles LNG. A lot of HOAs signed during the quarter were some notable E P counterparties that have previously voiced interest in equity ownership in an LNG facility. So just given the tight existing time line that you currently have with the DOE, I was just kind of curious if there's any change in tone or capital structure in your view for Lake Charles in terms of appetite for ET to perhaps own incremental equity and ownership perhaps than a few months ago, just given the fast pace of HOAs that have been signed over the past few weeks. Thanks.Yes, this is Mackie. No, nothing has really changed there. We kind of have a target of around 25  of equity ownership. That hasn't changed. We won't really talk about who the equity partners potentially are. I mentioned a few without naming them, but yes, there's more than that. There are some producers that expressed interest. And so there's a wide range. As we kind of consummate some of the bigger equity commitments, then we'll go to whatever remaining commitments that we need to attain that kind of 75  of partners in the project. So, nothing has changed as far as our strategy around Lake Charles.The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead. I think you may have more exposure to lower gas price in your midstream segment than I had realized. Can you give any more color on how that exposure works  If there's floors  If you hedge out gas price  Is it as simple as if gas price goes back up next year, that segment will improveYes. Jean Ann, this is Tom. The natural gas prices, that's correct, the sensitivity is there, especially in the midstream. But we want to make sure we add in there the ethane component that's included in there. So when you start looking at where those prices were, going on the liquid side, that likewise has rolled into that impact. And that's the reason even in our materials that we put out, we put in that kind of 5  to 10  of sensitivities related to commodity prices. We use spreads at 0 to kind of 5 . But you're seeing us really kind of stay in line with that.I do think it's worth noting that when you do get down to a certain level, that you are able to kind of have floors on some of the contracts that provide kind of a downside protection on these things. But once again, when you get with the whole decisions we make on all the processing we do, when to reject as far as ethane rejection goes and when we extract. But it's really based upon not just the natural gas prices, but the ethane prices also, liquids prices.Got it. Okay. And then just the latest on the up sea  ph  potential. And if you've kind of had any interest from investors that count  ph  on MLPs that they'd be interested in the up seaYes. No, you bet. We do continue to spend time on that and evaluate it. We haven't advanced it to market type studies or anything else. But we do have various discussions with banks, et cetera, on views on the market side of it. Where a lot of the time is really spent on the structuring also. We want to make sure that we get this thing structured in a way that is a win-win for all. So we're continuing to look at that. So it's clearly on the radar screen, something we're going to continue to move forward, move down the field, so to speak, and kind of come out at the right time that makes sense.The next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. Maybe starting with Gulf Run and the compression expansion project. Can you talk to what customers are saying on the timing of needing more takeaway  And I guess, could that project move forward as soon as this year  Are the needs there that quickly  Or the Haynesville needs more time to recoverYes, this is Mackie. No, we don't expect to get the FID on expansion on Gulf Run. As Tom said in the opening remarks, our team has done a great job of selling out the capacity by January of '25. As he mentioned, we're sold out on 1.65 Bcf on the Zone 2 portion of Gulf Run. But no, we'll remain in negotiations. A lot of that depends on some of the LNG facilities to get to FID. A lot of it will depend on some commitments that we're looking at further downstream on markets along the Gulf Coast, even as far away as Florida. And then also, there's some producer push on a lot of that to get down to markets either off Trunkline or potentially even off FGT. So we're still a way away from that, but we'll remain discussions. And there's a great deal of interest to move more volume, of course, from the growing Haynesville and other areas down to the Gulf Coast.Okay. Great. And second question, I just wanted to follow up on the  2 billion to  3 billion long-term CapEx run rate. And it's obviously very manageable within cash flows for the company, but it's a little higher than what you've spent. You did  2 billion last year and targeting  2 billion for this year. So can you just give some big picture comments on why you'd expect CapEx to potentially go a little higher in the future  And does that reflect bigger projects  Does that reflect -- I think, Tom, you mentioned looking a little more at international, just how you're thinking about that and spending potentially going up a littleYou bet. And like I say, a very good question here on this. When you really look at the scale of Energy Transfer now, the size and then you start looking at all the projects that Mackie previously mentioned, with the existing footprint we have, but also continuing to move downstream with some of the other petchem international, so when you really start looking at all that, we do not have projects that are specifically identified within that. This is a number that we're just using based upon the sheer size that we've become, start running over  13 billion a year. So don't have really a whole lot more description at this point, other than just kind of guiding you toward all the various projects that we have on the drawing board, so to speak.Let me add, if I could, one thing is that we are going to be pretty disappointed if we're not pushing against that  3 billion, because the projects that we're chasing are really good rates of return. And everything that we're chasing has synergistic revenues, not part of the IRRs, both upstream and downstream, in many cases. So from the standpoint, from a commercial perspective, I'm going to be disappointed if we -- if our team DOEsn't push closer to  3 billion or even more at the greatest return that we're targeting.The next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Yes, I wanted to ask about the recent really spike in ethane prices. There's definitely been some issues with processing efficiencies and fractionation facilities being impacted. So just wonder if you can just, a, were any of your facilities impacted by the extreme heat we've seen in the South  And then, b, should we think of this as an event that you probably benefited from  Or could this be a drag on Q3Mike, this is Mackie. Yes, there's a lot of noise made around this that we're a little taking aback by because it really had zero impact on us. We're one of the only -- probably the only company in the U.S. that controls the vast majority of our frac products. So we remain long with everything. That's, of course, why we're expanding our export capabilities, et cetera.But we kind of dug into it. Actually, RVM had a pretty good article. You may be alluding to some of that. We believe it's a combination of a lot of things. What RVM mentioned was a little bit what you said. You have cryos that struggling with heat, production struggles in heat. We've seen pretty excessive heats -- I mean, temperatures. That's been 2  to 3  impact. Frac struggle a little bit more, 5  to 7  of what we've kind of seen on matter or others have seen. There's also kind of a shortage of inventory since that's not really tracked. And some rumors got out that the inventories were really short. And so it's kind of a lot of those factors, but a number of companies, unlike us, that were rejecting. It takes some time to start recovering and figuring out a way to get that to Mont Belvieu. So that took a few days. We also heard there were some crackers out there that were actually selling their ethane because prices have gotten so bad. So it was a pretty short-lived run-up in ethane prices. No impact on us whatsoever or our customers. And so it was just a kind of a conglomeration of a lot of different things that happened over a short period of time.Okay. Good. No, that's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about LPG and ethane exports. It seems like your volumes are still very strong through the first half of the year. What are you expecting for the balance of the year on both LPG and ethane volumes  If you could just speak generally to what you're seeing in those end markets right now.Yes. It's Mackie here. As we look at the future and we look at the negotiations we have going on, we talked about this earlier today. We're in discussions with over 500,000 barrels of ethane demand potentially coming online in the next three or four years. Of that, there's probably 150 to 180 that's highly likely we will contract. So there's a huge demand for ethane.On the propane front, as everybody probably knows, there's a lot of PDHs being built. There's five or six already completed in China, and there's another -- a total of another about 12 more. So there's a lot of propane demand out there and a lot of propane being built. So we are very bullish, of course, that's why we're expanding as quickly as we can, very bullish on volumes increasing, especially at Nederland. We'll always have a little pullback at the Marcus Hook. Because of location up there, a lot of those barrels stay locally, how we are able to take a lot of what flows and take it to much higher-priced market from a margin standpoint. But certainly in the South, we remain very optimistic. We're already seeing volumes stronger next month than we saw here in July. So we remain very bullish not only the next quarter or 2, but bullish long term. There is a significant growth on really everything we do for natural gas liquids. And even gosh, we were talking about oil today. There was more oil consumed in the world last quarter than there've ever been. So the run away from oil and the slowdown oils happening. If anything, it's increasing. So that was a long-winded answer to we remain very bullish.Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Neel Mitra from Bank of America.First question, you obviously have some very capable upstream assets that can be expanded with Gulf Run and Trunkline. Are you looking at expanding those separately from the Lake Charles decision  In other words, if you were to twin those pipelines for other facilities, would you still be able to manage to get the gaps down to Lake Charles in an efficient way so that both sets of projects can workYes, this is Mackie again. Our team is looking to move as much gas through our pipeline network and expand our network to whatever markets there are. So yes, simultaneously with making sure that we will have the pipeline and volume support for LNG once it gets to FID. We also have teams working daily on delivering to other LNG facilities and to other markets everywhere, not only in the Gulf Coast, but where anybody is looking for gas. So yes, we'll continue to chase markets and look to expand the Gulf Run, Truckline, other assets to meet any demands that are out there that we end up contracting.Great. And then for the follow-up, just on your commentary around M A, can you be a little bit more specific  Do you have a preference for asset packages versus corporate M A  Any specific commodities  And then how would you look at your leverage profile  Would you look to go above 4.5 times temporarily if there was something that was attractive  Or would that be kind of the governor that you wouldn't want to exceed that from the very beginningYes. Listen, when we look at these various transactions, whether it be on the company side or whether it be on an asset acquisition, either one of them, we always evaluate how the connectivity is to our current assets. And some of it could be moving maybe a little bit further downstream with value add. But a lot of it, we always evaluate as to the connectivity so that we can get more commercial synergies with the footprint we have. And when you start looking at this across all the commodities, natural gas, natural gas liquids and the crude oil, you can see how we've built the franchise here that we have and being able to take product from wellhead all the way through export facilities. So we're going to continue to look at them on that basis as to where the value comes in.So let's go to the metrics, which is the second part, which really relates to the first part of my question, too, on the answer that I just gave you on that piece of it. And that is the accretion piece of it. And that's how we're able to be able to go in with a lot of these and get the accretion is because of the connectivity and what we're able to do with the product all the way downstream. And so when we will kind of walk through these and evaluate them, we're careful. We're disciplined in how we look at these various commercial synergies, but we have a great team that is able to extract a lot at.But the other component, besides just accretion to a DCF per unit basis, is the leverage. That's the other piece of it. And you'll see, with the transactions we're doing, we will always evaluate these things as to what is the combination of equity and cash that we use. So we don't have intention of going back above from a leverage standpoint. And we think we've got a great currency to be able to work with here. But most importantly, we've got a great team that's able to go in and extract the value as we walk through the integration of our acquisitions.Okay, great. Thank you very much. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for any closing remarks.This is Mackie real quick before Tom closes out. I was thinking about, we're meeting with Bill Berg and our team kind of preparation for this. And they made some great points is that -- and everybody knows this, I believe. But Tom mentioned this earlier. We believe we have the best team running any midstream in the United States by far, and a lot of them are sitting in this room. We think we have the best base of business, a very strong base with record volumes in several segments every quarter. We're delivering on the projects that we're building with Gulf Run and Gray Wolf at the end of last year. And then, of course, we just brought on Bear. We're having, once again with Chris Hefty's great efforts around M A. We've got Lotus really kind of kicking in, and then we've got the frac going on. That, combined with strong cash flow stability, our disciplined M A strategy, we are incredibly well positioned for growth. So if you can't tell it in our voices, we are very excited about where we sit, the assets that we have throughout the country and what the future holds for our partnership and really for our industry. So we're pretty excited, if you can't tell in our voices.No, I think that's a wrap, Mackie. Thank you. Appreciate it.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",46,2023-08-02T19:37:05.000-04:00
"Refiners PBF Energy, HF Sinclair rate new Outperform ratings at BMO","PBF Energy  and HF Sinclair  are both initiated with Outperform ratings at BMO Capital, but both oil refiner stocks have recovered only a small slice of their recent declines,  and  respectively in Thursday's trading.PBF Energy  has grownAs more of a pure refiner with more coastal exposure and complexity, driving higher costs, PBF  has greater leverage to cracks, the analyst said, expecting refining margins will remain above mid-cycle in 2024, supporting strong free cash flow and capital returns.HF Sinclair  has lagged peers during the current refining upcycle, with the portfolio undergoing significant change, but Jungwirth said he likes the company s greater scale and business diversification, and expects execution will improve across refining and renewable diesel.HF Sinclair's   premium refining markets provide it with top-tier margins, while low leverage enables strong capital returns, and valuation remains inexpensive,  according to Jungwirth.",3,2023-10-05T15:51:14.000-04:00
Vertex Energy: Transition To Traditional Refiner Hasn't Been Smooth,"With Vertex Energy  dealing with some hiccups with its renewable diesel project and crack spreads narrowing for its conventional refining business, it might be best to wait on the sidelines with the stock for now.VTNRVTRN's Black Oil and Recovery segment, meanwhile, is involved in the recycling and re-refining of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products. The company buys used oil from places such as oil change stations and autoVTNR is going through the process of transforming itself from a re-refining company to a refinery company. In May 2021, the company agreed to purchase the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell  RDS.A  for  75 million. At the time, the company said upon the conversion of the refinery's hydrocracking unit to produce renewable diesel that the refinery could produce  3 billion in revenue and  400 million in gross profits in 2023.This project was expected cost an additional  85 million to complete. The project was neither on time nor on budget, with renewable diesel production starting in Q2 of this year and the project costing over  110 million.Shortly after the refinery acquisition, in June of 2021, the company agreed to sell its 69 million gallon a year used oil refining Marrero facility in Louisiana and its 20 million gallon a year Heartland facility in Ohio to Clean Harbors  for  140 million. The facilities were projected to generate more than  100 million in revenue and at least  15 million in EBITDA. That valued the sale at just over 9x EBITDA.However, the deal was scrapped in January of 2022 following a review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. VTRN then turned around and sold its Heartland facility to GFL Environmental  for  in February of this year. Given that his was the much smaller facility of the two that VTRN was originally selling for  140 million less than two years earlier, this looks like a really good price.The company continues to own the Marrero facility and some other legacy assets. We'll see if the company eventually looks to dispose of it or other assets. I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate the value of Heartland into Marrero, but there does appear to be some nice value there. So there is an opportunity the company could lower debt with some additional asset sales.As of now, though, the company's big bet is on renewable diesel with its project now complete and starting to produce the renewable fuel. However, the company has backed off of earlier predictions, and the economics are still up in the air at this point, as the company ran into some economics on the initial feedstock it planned to use. However, the plant was built to support 8 different feedstocks, so it is currently looking to shift feedstocks.When asked if the company still planned to produce 8,000 barrels of renewable diesel a day, CCO Douglas Haugh answered the question on its , sayingAt this point, there should be a lot of potential with renewable diesel, especially with government credits. The company also has a product supply agreement with a California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan. However, given its commentary, things are not going to be quite as smooth as it originally expected.Outside of renewable diesel, crack spreads and dynamics for VGO will also play a big role in the company's results both on the potential upside and downside. Traditional crack spreads were extremely wide last year, and not surprisingly, have come down this year. They were still well above historical norms in the first half of the year, but have come down significantly recently.This is a big risk for the business at this point, as crack spreads are the biggest driver of a refining business. In fact, VTNR had to lower its guidance ahead of its Q2 report as a result of lower crack spreads and a weak capture rate, as a result of volatile fuel prices.The company also carries a fair amount of debt, with net leverage of 3.6x at the end of Q2. For such a cyclical business coming off peak crack spreads last year, this is something to be aware of in the future, especially since the company's operating cash flow through the first six months of this year was - 111.4 million. Now that its renewable diesel unit is running, this should begin to improve. The sale of the Marrero used oil refinery could potentially lower debt as well.VTNR trades at a 17.3x EV EBITDA multiple based on the 2023 EBITDA consensus of  48.6 million. Based off of the 2024 EBITDA consensus of  149.9 million, it trades at around 5.6x.The company is not projected to post positive EPS until 2025.It's projected to see revenue grow 6  in 2023 and 15.5  in 2024.VTNR's stock generally trades at a premium to other refiners and environmental clean-up companies as well. Much of this is due to an expected large contribution from its renewable diesel operations down the road.While VTNR put out a nice blue sky story with its acquisition of the Mobile refinery and subsequent renewable diesel upgrade capacity, it's been a bit stormy for the stock. With crack spreads down in its conventional business and with the company running into some issues with its initial planned feedstock for the plant not currently being at an acceptable conversion rate, the road ahead remains cloudy.The company has found some lower cost feedstock blends to run through its plant and it was built to be able to use 8 different types, but let's see how the plant running on these feedstocks in action first, as the company hasn't had a smooth ride so far with the plant.In addition, the company has a fair amount of leverage, sitting at 3.6x, and the company is currently burning cash. With conventional crack spreads falling, its leverage can quickly rise if its renewable diesel unit does not live up to expectations.As such, I think there are too many question marks around the stock to invest at this time. I'd keep monitoring the name to see how things progress for the company.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Brookfield Infrastructure Has Tumbled - What Is Next,"I have received several requests to revisit Brookfield Infrastructure   that I covered . Initially, I wanted to do it after the Q3 results. But BIP's drop has been too painful for investors to wait.I issued aThroughout the post, I will be talking about BIP but the analysis is equally applicable to BIPC though it is more expensive and less desirable at least for the US investors.I have also to remind my readers that BIP has alwaysDespite the drop, I consider my recent analysis valid and will not repeat it here. For the reasons I explained in that post, BIP becomes attractive when its yield is above 5 . Currently, it is 1.53 26   5.9  and will become higher when BIP increases its dividend in January - I expect at least a 6  increase.BIP has two types of debt - recourse on the corporate level and non-recourse on the asset level. Corporate debt is more dangerous, and so it represents a small fraction of the total debt  3B of  23B  as seen on the slide below that shows the maturity profile for BIP's proportional debt in millions USD. BIP's debt is mostly investment grade  BIP has a BBB  credit rating for its recourse debt  and  90  of it has fixed interest.The next table shows the proportion of BIP's cash flows used to service debtI marked the most important lines in yellow. All dollar figures are in millions.BIP's average interest rate is growing in line with the general trend. It was 4.9  in 2021, 5.5  in 2022, and 5.8  in H1 2023. Proportional net debt is growing as well due to BIP's growth. Both factors led to the growth in interest expense from  755 in 2021 to  623 in H1 2023. But cash flows have grown as well.Measured against EBITDA, interest expense was 31  in 2021, 33  in 2022, and 36  in H1 2023. This figure also keeps creeping higher though not that fast. However, the actual situation is much better than it seems due to HPC.HPC is a part of BIP's Midstream sector. Here is its description from the Q2 Supplementary   525,000 tonnes per year of polypropylene production capacity in Canada . That's it. BIP's annual report barely mentions HPC at all. We can find slightly more information about HPC in the Q2 Letter to ShareholdersWhile this is not the clearest text, it seems that BIP, so far, has not been particularly successful in launching the plant. HPC produced something in Q1, did not work in Q2 at all, and is supposed to operate at full capacity in Q4. But how big is HPC  I could not find any numbers in the current BIP filings.HPC was the main reason BIP acquired Canadian Inter Pipeline precisely two years ago. Based on my notes regarding this acquisition, HPC was supposed to generate about CAD 450-500M of EBITDA, and the total project cost was estimated at   CAD 4B. 70-85  of EBITDA should be based on long-term  10-year duration on average  contracts that are structurally similar to  take or pay  contracts used for pipelines.My numbers might be not up-to-date but they are still showing the importance of the project. HPC alone should increase BIP's EBITDA by 10  at least. If we further assume that the  4B cost is equally split between debt and equity, HPC consumes more than 10  of BIP's invested capital  displayed in the table above  WITHOUT producing any EBITDA in Q2Above is another slide from the Q2 Supplementary showing the performance of the Midstream segment. If you compare results for three and six months, AFFO in Q1 was  173 vs.  113 in Q2. What is the reason for this difference in the segment that consists mostly of stable pipelines  We can attribute a significant part of it to HPC which was operating at partial capacity in Q1 and was not working at all  being under repair  in Q2.CEO Sam Pollock is counting on quick progress towards the end of 2023 as follows from the slide from recent Brookfield's Investor DayWhy is BIP so shy about HPC and does not mention it directly most of the time  My notes of 2021 indicate that HPC was supposed to be commissioned in early 2022. Probably, full capacity towards the end of 2022 was in the offing back then. I.e. BIP is one year late with this project. Ever upbeat and victorious Brookfield should be reluctant to draw attention to this setback and that may be the explanation.Performing at full capacity, HPC is expected to materially increase cash flows and make interest expense as a share of EBITDA lower or at least comparable to 2021 when interest rates were low  In its turn, this should help BIP to refinance whatever maturities are due.If my analysis is correct, so far leverage has not become more dangerous for BIP despite interest rate increases. While the stock has been trading like utilities recently, its growth potential is superior to the latter. I tend to think that BIP's drop is not justified. Eventually valued by the weighing machine of the market  as opposed to the voting machine in charge currently , the stock should trade higher, perhaps close to a 5  yield. Today it means  1.53 0.05    31 or  33 assuming a 6  distribution bump in January. On the bright side, the stock may revisit the high thirties once interest rates change their direction.At the same time, I am very far from stating that BIP is a low-risk stock - its leverage is still high and will not become lower due to its mode of operation. However, this risk may have failed to increase that much over the last year.So far, we have not even seen any signs of support from its parent. But it might be coming in the form of buying by BN.

Diesel Supply Concerns Grow With Russian Export Ban," Russia announced that it would be temporarily banning the export of diesel and gasoline in order to try to take some pressure off domestic fuel prices. The ban comes into effect from 21 September, withThe impact on the middle distillate market has been clear  ICE gasoil settled 4.51  higher on the day of the announcement, whilst the November gasoil crack rallied above  37 bbl at one stage, and the prompt ICE gasoil time spread saw its backwardation widen to more than  35 tonne, highlighting the tightness in the middle distillate market. Russia is a crucial supplier of refined products to global markets, with it exporting in the region of 1MMbbls d of diesel. In fact, Russia is the second-largest exporter of diesel, with just the US exporting larger volumes. As a result, this is a key development as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter, a period where we usually see a seasonal pick-up in demand.The export ban is less concerning for the gasoline market, with Russian exports of gasoline and gasoline components averaging around 145Mbbls d so far in 2023, a loss that the global market should be able to absorb more easily.How severe of an impact the loss of Russian diesel has on the global market will really depend on how long the export ban is in place. Although, given the likely domestic stock build we will see as a result of the ban, we would not expect it to be prolonged.The middle distillate market was already seeing significant strength ahead of this ban with inventories tight in the US, Europe and Asia as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter. There were a number of factors behind this tightness, including OPEC  supply cuts, recovering air travel, limited refining capacity growth, and in Europe, the struggle of being able to fully replace Russian middle distillates after the EU ban came into effect in February.The loss of around 1MMbbls d of Russian diesel in the global market will be felt and only  we have held on middle distillate cracks and as a result on refinery margins. This does leave some upside risk to our view that the ICE gasoil crack would average US 30 bbl for the remainder of the year. How much upside really depends on the duration of the ban.We believe that margins will remain elevated in an attempt to get refiners to increase run rates. However, given that part of the issue is due to constraints in refining capacity as well as tightness in the medium sour crude market, the ability to significantly increase run rates and increase middle distillate supply could be difficult.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

"Texas Instruments look-ahead: Watching China demand, capacity expansion and margin pressure","Analog chipmaker Texas Instruments  is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with investors focusing on the company's gross margins as management invests heavily in capacity expansion, status of demand recovery in China, and the impact of price cuts.Wall Street analysts expect Texas Instruments  to post earnings per share of  1.85 on revenues of  4.58 billion, which would mark a drop of 12.6 .The Dallas, Texas-based company has seen significant cuts to its estimates in the past few months. Earnings per share forecasts have been revised downward 8 times, compared to 3 upward revisions, while revenue estimates have been revised down 13 times vs. 7 upward moves.Shares of the chipmaker have  YTD.Observers remain concerned about weak demand trends in China, macro-economic headwind, and high inventory levels. Due to TXN's exposure to China, incremental pricing pressure, and the expected pressure on gross margins due to capacity ramp up, Street sentiment on Texas Instruments  is negative.Additionally, investors will look out for key metrics like booking trends, lead times, inventory levels. The company's industrial segment, which accounts for roughly 40  of revenue, and automotive, which is 25  of revenue, are expected to be negatively impacted.Seeking Alpha analyst ,  In the last few quarters, semiconductor sales have been declining - not only for Texas Instruments.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras  Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call August 4, 2023 9 30 AM ETJean Paul Prates   PresidentSergio Caetano Leite   Chief Finance and Investor Relations OfficerMaurício Tolmasquim   Chief Energy Transition and Sustainability OfficerJoelson Falcão Mendes   Chief Exploration and Production OfficerCarlos Travassos   Chief Engineering, Technology and Innovation OfficerWilliam França   Chief Industrial Processes and Products OfficerClaudio Schlosser   Chief Logistics, Commercialization and Market OfficerMário Spinelli   Chief Governance and Compliance OfficerGood morning everyone. Welcome to Petrobras webcast with analysts and investors regarding our Results for Q2 of 2023. It's a pleasure to be here today. This event will be presented in Portuguese with simultaneous translation into English. The links for both languages can be found on our Investor Relations page. We would like to inform that all participants will follow the broadcast over the internet as listeners. After our intro, we will have a Q A session where you can send your questions to petroinvest petrobras.com.br.Today with us we have Carlos Travassos, Chief Engineering, Technology and Innovation Officer  Clarice Coppetti, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer  Claudio Schlosser, Chief Logistics, Commercialization and Market Officer  Joelson Falcão Mendes, Chief Exploration and Production Officer  Mário Spinelli, Chief Governance and Compliance Officer  Maurício Tolmasquim, Chief Energy Transition and Sustainability Officer  Sergio Caetano Leite, Chief Finance and Investor Relations Officer  and William França, Chief Industrial Processes and Products Officer. To initiate we will watch a video with a message from our President, Jean Paul Prates.Good morning. It is an honored to be here again to share our results with all of you. It has been six months of achievements and accomplishments, which reflect the quality of the work that we are doing within Petrobras. In thisIn the operational side, FPSO's Anna Nery in the Campos basin and Almirante Barroso in the Búzios field started up production. FPSO's Anita Garibaldi and Sepetiba are expected to join them soon, helping us to continue increasing pre-salt production. The utilization factor of our refineries reached 93  with the highest level since 2015, even with several scheduled shutdowns at our refineries, respecting safety, environment and health issues. And we achieved record sales in the first half with 10-ppm diesel accounting for 62  of the total diesel sales of Petrobras.Regarding Diesel R, which is our diesel with 5  of renewable content, we project to increase our processing capacity by 146  later this year. We increased our investments to  5.7 billion in the first half of the year, and we kept our debt under control at a gross debt of  58 billion while our operating generation reached  10 billion. In the first half of 2023, we continued with our total focus on people. We had an unprecedented initiative with the launch of our diversity supplement to reinforce awareness among our internal public and our society at large. All these results were achieved in the first half of this year represent only the beginning of a journey that will take us increasingly further for our benefit and for the benefit of the shareholders and the society.Thank you very much.Now we will initiate our results of Q2 of 2023. And now I will hand it over to Sergio Caetano Leite.Good morning. I am very pleased to be here today to discuss our results for the second quarter. During this quarter   during this quarter our gross recurring EBITDA was BRL12 billion. This our operational cash flow demonstrates the resilience of our company despite an adverse foreign scenario. We have approximately BRL10 billion, BRL9.6 in operating cash flow. Our debt   our net debt over EBITDA also shows the control of our indebtedness and the financial soundness of our company that would be 0.74 times. Now, the return on capital employed is almost 13 . This is 12.8 . Our net profit totaled  5.8 billion, free cash flow  7 billion, and we continue contributing sustainably. We're promoting inclusive developing paving R 56.1 billion in taxes contributing towards social development. Our dividends totaled  6.2 billion and we have a comfortable cash flow of  15.8 billion. So despite external adversities, Petrobras financial soundness is positive and the results take us this. This is why we're   this is one of the ten best years of the company.Now here you can see the foreign environment. There was a drop in Brent. It was significant. We're talking about the second quarter of 2022,  114 in Brent. Now during this quarter,  78 per barrel, this is the drop of the barrel price was highly significant although the exchange rate is in line with last year's quarter. The drop of Brent is another factor that I will comment subsequently. And this is why this dropped our results, although we continue with sustainable development and the company continues resilient. Our EBITDA demonstrates that we are aligned with the drop of the Brent and the appreciation of the dollar, but there is an important interpretation since the beginning of the year. I mean Q1 and Q2, our adjusted EBITDA is very close, almost at the same level of a recurrent EBITDA or recurring EBITDA. This is because there has been a lower disinvestment program because of our asset portfolio. This   so our company continues adjustment presenting very important value. Below you can see the devaluation of Brent, which impacts significantly our operations.There was a lower Brent reduction in exploration and production. Now, refining and marketing captures the foreign scenario factors. If we consider the EBITDA with a stock turnaround, we have a drop of 33  vis-à-vis Q1 with a replenishment cost, we have an EBITDA minus 42 . Gas and power aligned with the refining area. So we have a 33  drop if we consider the first quarter in comparison to Q2. Now, our cash generation, as I mentioned, continue strong and robust. There was a slight contribution of non-recurring results that are because of the sale of Potiguar and Norte Capixaba Complex our debt management from   allowed us to   to amortize  0.7 million and these are data. This is data that is aligned with the market in reality. In oil and gas, Petrobras has presented one with the best results despite an adverse scenario.Now, when we talk about our debt, there was a slight spike in our total indebtedness because of the freight of Anna Nery and Almirante to Búzios, but our financial debt maintains its dropping trajectory. We drop, we ve lowered 0.6  million in debt. Our gross debt is within the limits that we establish and what we announced in our strategic plan.Now our next slide. Now, portfolio management. This is a question   this is a constant question mark from our investments. We have a dynamic portfolio in Petrobras. So, this means that we are going to work with these divestments with investments and with partnerships. There are assets that are of interest and we can do this through partnerships. So, all our portfolio is being reassessed under a different view. This is a long-term view.In addition or aligned with what we announced regarding the signed contracts for divestments, they remain, there are fields Albacora Leste that was sold in Q1. We have Norte Capixaba cluster or complex or Potiguar Complex.Now, in terms of cash inflow generated from these divestments until June of 2023, we are talking about the end of the second quarter, well, this was  3.5 billion.Well, our net results reflect the stringiness of the market, the drop of the Brent and the appreciation of the dollar vis-à-vis the dollar what is important is the crack spread of the diesel. The market is being pressured by the low offering of Russian diesel dropping 40  will hire operating expenses US 0.4 billion. And this has been reduced to   when we compare it to other quarters.Now, what we give back to society  This is part of our ESG program. It is highly consistent and strong. We give back to society in terms of taxes and we gave back R 56.1 billion.Another important fact was we reviewed the shareholders  remuneration policy. In this policy review   we will maintain important aspects that will guarantee the financial soundness of the company, the control of that. We maintained the same periods, we continue with the same guides of indebtedness. We have a reference, we have our gross debt and how we pay out quarterly our dividends. And we ve reformulated our formula going from 60  to 45  of free cash flow designated to dividend pay-out. This level is in line with the major worldwide enterprises. I am here considering independent enterprises and also state companies.Remuneration to shareholders, I would like to highlight the main dates that were already announced to the market here for the second quarter remuneration. The base data will be August 21. The first tranche will be paid of   the person will be paid November 21 and the second December 15. We continue controlling our debt using capital principle that is part of the guidance of the company. And we continue committed to generate and to distribute value.Now our buyback program. Well, Petrobras is one of the companies that communicates most with the market in Brazil and abroad. These are the shares that are mostly traded abroad. What we do have impacts, and this is why we have to be careful, therefore, our buyback program will start in a conservative fashion. We will buy 157.8 million preferred shares. This will be done with preferred shares, which represent a small amount of these Free Float that would be 3.5 . And this is a pilot program will last around 12 months. So, we expect, to conclude this, we believe that this will not cause major price fluctuation and it s the first share buyback program that Petrobras will use to remunerate their shareholders. So, these   so they can be bought in parcels.So what this domain highlights, here, you can see more in our IR sites.And now I will give the floor to Maurício Tolmasquim, Chief Sustainability and Transition Officer.Foreign LanguageBut I am just giving you a general overview. So here we see a lower emission rate of greenhouse gases in refining. Since the beginning of the operation, which was in 2019, we signed the first charter contract for hybrid support vessels, meaning using batteries and marine fuel. This allowed us to reduce emissions by about 15 . We certified our energy production through I-REC, renewable energy certificate guaranteeing that 100  of the electricity purchased in   was generated by renewable sources. And we invested BRL 200 million in a new gas treatment system at REPLAN and REFAP, which reduces emissions in particulate matters, which have a negative health impact. So these are Scopes 1 and 2, meaning decarbonizing the company's processes. In Scope 3 which refers to products with a lower carbon footprint.Our goal is to expand our diesel production capacity with renewable content by 2023, especially through processing. So this was authorized by ANP to operate another unit with REPAR, expanding our production to 12 million liters per day. We signed a cooperation agreement and we began a new test with, for maritime transport with a chartered vessel from Transpetro, which has 24  renewable content, which also allows us to reduce emissions by about 17 . So those were the highlights I had for you, and I'll pass it over to my colleague here, Joelson.Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. We're going to start by discussing the growth of our operated production in the second half, or excuse me, in the first half of 2023, we have seen significant growth. There was a slight reduction from the first quarter to the second, which is expected considering our maintenance operations, which had been programmed and planned. Our own production is also in line with what we had planned. It seems like we are going to finish the year along what we have planned without major issues and in line with what happened in the second quarter of 2022.Our pre-salt owned production as expected had a significant increase, which represents 78  of our own production already with more than 2 million barrel equivalent from coming from pre-salt. Next slide, please.In Buzios, we have a relevant production level. We are producing 800,000 BOEDs total. It's very significant and due to the relevance of this production. In five years only, we have an accumulated production of 1 billion barrels of oil, which was much faster than what we did in Campos Marlim in the 2P field as well. So it's extremely significant how quickly we were able to grow our production from Buzios with these five units, which are the five original units foreseen, we have an additional six that will produce oil in excess to this. Next slide, please.Another important activity that we had during the second quarter was returning all of our production from the Bahia Terra Cluster. We had to adapt our production there according to the new requirements from the ANP. And we had a long contact with them with the risk analysis for all of the activities needed. And it was a new outlook on safety and how our activities are done. So next slide, please.At the end of last year, we also participated in a bid round and we were able to acquire three important blocks in investment of over BRL 700 million in the Norte de Brava field, which is the most significant one in investments. We acquired 100  of it and it's close to an area where we are already in production, which is very important. We want areas where we already have an infrastructure that can be used. Also, Água Marinha, we had some partners there and also Sudoeste de Sagitário with other partners.So this consolidates our exploration strategy with profitable assets close to our activities in borders that we already know very well. There are other frontier areas in Brazil, but these are well-known areas where we can produce with lower extraction costs and certainty of that exploration area. We're very confident that we're going to get good results from these areas, and we're planning to start this exploration next year. Wells are planned for 2024. Next slide, please.Within our strategy of recovering more and getting more value from the assets that we have, we concluded a major seismic survey in Tupi and Iracema through partnerships. So this is a major area. We have very high quality images, which will allow us to plan how this area will be explored. And of course, this is a deep conversation that we're having with the ANP to decide how we can have another production in this area. So it was an extension and we expect this to have a lot of value for Petrobras and for Brazil if we can increase the prediction time in these areas. Next slide.This slide shows the extraction cost for pre-salt, which is in line with what we had during the first quarter in mature areas deep waters and shallow waters. Naturally, we would see lifting costs go up. There's a reduction in production due to the depletion of these fields, and there are also need other associated costs. So the total cost of oil produced is quite significant for our financial results around  35 per barrel, which is in line with what we had been expecting considering all of these production changes that make us very competitive. That's my last slide, so thank you very much and I'll pass it on to Marcos  ph  Travassos. Thank you.Thank you, Joelson. Good morning. So I'm going to start my presentation here by discussing some of the advances that we had in technology. Our company has the highest number of active patents in Brazil, over 110,000. So for the second year in a row, we had a record number of patents licensed. 214 were made available for licensing, so we're made available to the market. During this time, we received some awards related to innovation. We received the MIT Award as one of the most innovative companies in Brazil. There's no ranking, but we are among the top most innovative companies. There we also received the Elite Awards in Nevada and the U.S. for our HAZOP program, and we also received the Valor Inovação Award as the one of the most innovative oil and gas companies in the world and the second most innovative company in Brazil across all industries.It's our best historical result and it's a very relevant and important award for us. It shows that we're really valuing innovation, which is so important for transformation. This is what the company has been doing and has been getting prepared for. The next slide will show some of these innovations.You can see our FPSO all electric. And the next project will include our combined cycle technology. So we're going to use all of the technology that we have in our units to reduce our emissions rate. We also saw some advances in remote operating marine technologies. We have artificial intelligence being used by these drones, onshore monitoring as well. We also advanced through our PEP70 Well Efficiency Program. Our goal is to reduce the cost of each well in pre-salt and PEP70 was our goal, which is to reduce values of about a  100 million to  70 million. So we concluded this program achieving these results.And downstream as Tolmasquim has said, we also had an agreement for industrial scale tests to produce bio-aromatics in Riograndense refinery based on vegetable oils. So we were able to get plant-based products and next year they will be processed and tested, which can be very important for our refineries as we ll increase our FCC load through plant-based oils also generating products with a lower carbon footprint.We advanced in our robotics program. So to the right, you see our Petrobot, which is in testing for equipment inspection. And finally on the right, we have our fire fighting robot created in a partnership with some startups, which is now being tested in a smaller version to be used in our platforms.Next slide, please. This slide discusses some of our projects. At the center, we see Almirante Barroso, which is five, we started our operation there on March 25. Then on  indiscernible  with production ramp up. To the right, we see the auction for the P-32 area to find a sustainable density for this platform. We had 31 new wells in operation in the first half of 2023, an increase of 25  in their interconnection.And you can see the whole of P-78. This is our first project after we revitalized and reinvigorated our hiring strategies. So this is our own area that s going to operate in the Búzios field. We also have FPSO Sepetiba in MERO 2, which is headed towards Brazil. It s close to South Africa and expected to arrive by September. This will be our last unit to go into operation in 2023.And we also have FPSO Anita Garibaldi, and its last few stages to go into production and it will start its operations in August. So Anita Garibaldi is the second unit that will go into operations in the Marlim Sul field. Also, we re announcing that we re publishing today the Barracuda REVIT. So this is a call for bid for a production unit that has the capacity of 100,000 barrels. And this is also a part of our renewal program for Bacia de Campos.The next slide shows some of the advances that we have downstream. We had some significant advances to expand and modernize our refinery. We also published today an auction for the second train for RNEST. We re going to increase our processing capacity for that refinery from 115,000. This revamping will increase it by 15,000 and we expect to have 130,000 more in the second cycle.So the processing capacity will be 260,000 barrels of oil per day and it will generate 30,000 jobs in direct and indirect employment in  indiscernible . We also see our coke drums at RBPC, which is a very challenging project. It was the biggest implementation that they ever had there, and they   it was revitalized and modernized in our coking activity there.Here we have our image of acid water in the REPLAN treatment plant. Here we will add 10,000 cubic meters diesel. The works is according to the deadline. And here we also recently celebrated the deployment of the Reduc HDT work. This was a REVAP work where we added a new reactor. The one that you can see and hit this, we will have more diesel in Reduc. And the last image you can see GASLUB. We resumed the work of GASLUB. I have to register in record time. The last time that there was a shutdown, we needed 30 months for analysis and for a new bid.And now we ve resumed the GASLUB works in only six months with engineering contracts, with building assembling contracts and other contracts. We are here in Itaboraí, in the UPG work in GASLUB. And all GASLUB   and GASLUB, we started the UTE. This is a project that is conditioned to an auction and we will present a proposal throughout 2024. But we ve started the contract. This is a demand for these types of auctions for this thermal plant unit.And here I end my presentation and I will give the floor to the Chief Industrial Processes and Products Officer, William França.Thank you, Travassos. Can you hear me  Can you hear me and see me  Yes. So during this quarter, our results were excellent in terms of operation in our natural gas plants and refining our natural gas plant had high results here the best in the history, the sustainability plant excellent.We also had a burning rate that this measures the quality of decarbonization in our natural gas area. We had very good burning rates. This means that we re evolving in energy efficiency lowering our carbon footprint, which is very positive. Well, I m sorry, I didn t say good morning to everyone. Now, in our refineries, our utilization factor was 93 .This is a result of our planning and logistics and marketing and allowed us to increase the utilization factor guaranteed by the excellent operational availability of our assets. Here you can see our refineries, therefore, this is a very good result. The best result since 2015. This is the best result in the history of refining pre-salt oil in refinery input. We are almost 70  the oil that comes from pre-salt. We are increasing the share of pre-salt in the processing of our unit.We increased gasoline days almost 70  and this result was positive because we ended the REVAP, Reduc, REPLAN shutdown and RPBC although there were shutdowns in the refineries, we achieved this result. This means that we can make even more progress in the utilization factors of our refineries during the second semester.William, your microphone is muted.Our result of oil byproducts highlighting diesel oil, once again, we achieved a record in with 2.11 million cubic meters of produced diesel and we will reach another record in July with 2.38. Here we have 2.38 million and then we will outperform in August because we started at the end of July with the 700. Our unit was readapted. We included another reactor and other offsite accessories says that here we have offsite structure to produce diesel with 4,000 cubic meters a day and due to our operational availability and the trust on the unit, we will outperform and we will outperform July and this is due to the excellent working structure of our commercialization area.This is Tolmasquim mentioned, we have excellent result in gas emission in emission intensity. Here, we had 103.7 results and we reached 102 in region. That is the best historic result in all refining. We're close to the standard number achieved by refineries. There are refineries with something lower than 90 like RefTOP.So emissions intensity Tolmasquim in June, we had the best historic result in terms of CO2 with 37.2. This shows that we are evolving in trust, increasing utilization factor, and lowering our carbon footprint regarding the assets of our refineries. Your microphone is closed once again. Now I would like to broaden refining to implement.So we are studying some robotics sales in our company. We are working firmly in our decarbonization process. So thank you everyone. And I'll now pass it over to my friend, my longtime friend, 36 years Director, Claudio Schlosser.Thank you, William, and everyone else. It's a great pleasure to be here. I'm talking about the highlights of the office and we're going to start with this slide, presenting sales of derivatives in our market. Our oil product sales, which had an increase versus 2022. We had some effects that led to this. One of them was the higher competitiveness for gasoline. We also had LP seasonality   LPG seasonality and diesel. This diesel effect was partially offset   because during this time, we saw a higher rate of diesel mix-ins from 10  to 15 . This happened in mid-April.So if we look at the data from the second half of 2022, we were very aligned despite these divestments in the Reman refinery in Amazonas. One item that was mentioned by William was the excellent result of availability, which led to historical levels in refinery availability, which really supported the sales of these oil products.As a consequence, we had lower margins, but our margins were still above our historical levels. This increase in refinement allowed us to capture this margin across all of our industries. So it reduced oil exports and we allowed the country to process more oil. As another highlight, gasoline sales grew 5  this quarter. It happened, especially due to the higher competitiveness against our main alternatives for clients.And in addition to that, we had an increase in fuels for light vehicles, that is automobiles, motorcycles. Gasoline had more competitiveness versus hydrated ethanol due to tax reasons. This can be explained by tax reasons. And just for your reference, Petrobras Gás participation in the second half of 2022 was 40.3 , and in the second quarter it was 42.3 . And it shows how we have significantly evolved during this cycle.Looking at the foreign market, we had higher exports due to our production of oil products and our availability. Due to the concentration of programmed downtime during the first half of 2023 in refinement. Next slide, please.So this slide discusses oil sales. There was a reduction in exports, which was expected due to this increase in availability in the refinery park and the higher utilization of pre-salt oil in refinery loads. And this adds a lot of value to how these assets are generating value. We had about 150,000 barrels per day produced nationally in comparison to other quarters.Another point that allows us to understand this variation was the inventory in the first quarter. So it was favor in the first quarter, because we were carrying out some ongoing exports from the previous year, which ended up being carried out in the first quarter. So that had an impact of a 100,000 barrels a day.Next slide please. The next topic is the approval of the new commercial strategy. This was widely communicated, and I'd like to take this opportunity to underscore that this was a very positive change for Petrobras. We started having more room to work in our commercial strategy, and of course, this is aligned with the best production conditions, our refinement assets, the use of our logistical assets to have much more competitive prices and to be able to compete in markets that add value to the company.So overall, this measure optimizes our refinement and logistics assets. Another essential value that was reported in this strategy was the mitigation of volatility peaks, which gives our clients a more stable price environment. This allows us to work in balance with the international market in a way that is sustainable and profitable. Next slide, please.This is my last slide in the presentation. It was widely discussed and presented by Tolmasquim, our Director. And I'd just like to underscore our hybrid vessel. Not only does it reduce emissions, but it also reduces costs. And this is a part of our offense a lot program, which is focusing on better reliability and safety, but also in logistics costs.So this was an important effort that was carried out. We are advancing significantly in reducing emissions. And I can also mention the new test that we are performing using 24  biodiesel produced from plant sources. And there's also a pioneer process of green recycling of one line, which is following international ESG best practices.So that's all we had to say. Thank you for your attention and we'll give the floor back to Carlos.Thank you, Schlosser. And we're now going to begin the questions and answer session. The first question we got was from Vicente Falanga from Bradesco BBI. And he asks, Sergio. Sergio, how do you see the company's minimum optimal cash  28 billion  Can you work with less than thatHello, Vicente, I hope you are doing well. Well, we are still creating a strategic plan for 2024 to 2028. As you know, these answers will be addressed in the projections that will happen in this plan. But I'd like to remind you that our   the minimal cash is  5 million in our PO. So our reference is  8 billion. So this is well in line. That's our idea. We want to keep it like that. Thank you.Thank you, Sergio. The next question was also asked by Vicente. It's a question for Schlosser. Schlosser, Petrobras is selling gasoline below marginal levels. For how long does the pricing committee believe that this kind of discount will be sustainable for  Schlosser, you have to turn on your microphone.Thank you, Carlos. Vicente, thank you for your question. As we presented before, the essential value of our commercial strategies based on three points to be competitive, having competitive prices for our clients and generating assets through marginal value. And another very important value is international volatility. So we re providing to our clients price stability. What we re seeing right now is a lot of uncertainty about the global economy. And this affects the demand for energy, how much is expected and the supply of oil and fuel due to these geopolitical issues, the Ukraine war. So this short-term combination of factors led to high volatility in the market. The reference levels adopted by the international market fluctuated wildly.And another important point is an inflow of Russian products to Brazil. Our monitoring shows that in July, Russian diesel was over 80  of our production in Brazil. So we re monitoring the market every day and whenever it s necessary, we ll have readjustments in our commercial strategy. Obviously, we can t advance these decisions yet, so thank you for your question, Carlos.Next question from Gabriel Barra from Citibank for Joelson. Joelson, could you elaborate on the information regarding the government discussions and with the environmental authority regarding the   first Amazonas the margin equatorial development  How much will you invest in exploration and development  Could Suriname and Guyana be an alternative for long-term investmentsThank you, Gabriel, for your question. Well, the portfolio management   margin has five basins that goes from Rio Grande do Norte until the Amazon basin in Amapá. So we initiated our environmental licensing projects in two basins for Amazon and Portuguese in a sequence of wells, one in Amazon and another wells in the Portuguese basin. And we already supplied all the information requested by IBAMA for these two areas, these two licensing processes already from Petrobras  point of view. And we have let the government view the   the government is informed by all of our actions and we have exchanged information with IBAMA that is environmental agency trying to ask questions.In July, we ended this communication. So now this is being analyzed by IBAMA. We have no pending issues and we depend   we don t have to give any more information. Regarding investments, well, we expect in our planning and 16 wells in the five basins in five years, this is an exploratory investment of US 3 billion in these areas. All the areas here in Latin America and also Western Africa are of our interest because they re similar to our activities. We have planned exploratory activities for Columbia next year in Suriname, Uruguay and Africa.Our exploratory team is in communication and is paying attention to auctions and is talking to partners. These are areas where we will possibly invest, but this is still under negotiation and we have to wait for the end of these negotiations. We are reassured that this year we will be able to initiate one of the most advanced basins in terms of licensing process and this would be a first well.So thank you very much Joel. So we have an additional question from Gabriel Barra about Braskem. According to there is a discussion regarding the cell of Braskem and some are interested in buying the control of a company. Could you give us the view of the management regarding the prospects for the oil sector and investment  Should this be a long-term focus for Petrobras, the petrochemical sector  As he s facing technical problems, we will go to the next question and Sergio will answer the question about Braskem.Can you hear me  So thank you. Thank you for the question. Braskem is appearing in the media. The operators are questioning these proposals together with a partner. In our strategic plan, they mentioned the management of the company   I m sorry, we re having sound problems. I would like to apologize. We re receiving very choppy sound. This is a business that makes sense for our company in the mid and the long run.Thank you, Sergio. The next question from Bruno Montanari, Morgan Stanley and it s for Schlosser. Regarding the company s commercial policy, there are questions regarding market international reference with dispersion and parity accounts that go from 10  to 30  currently. Now, naturally each player has a cost structure which hinders the comparison. Now from the Petrobras system point of view, could you mention in average where the price of the company is when we compare to the marginal bands and the cost of the clientBruno, thank you for your question. Here we have the opportunity to reflect on each one of the agents that perform in the Brazilian market. For instance, you are talking about a parity, the dispersion of the educators just demonstrates how the supply alternatives are different or can be different depending on the scale, infrastructure, logistic costs. And this is all reflected on the efficiency of this agent. And when they import certain byproduct in terms of Petrobras, we also have our own costs and productions opportunities and also the import and export fronts of oil or fuel.Our efficiency is significant because we ve implemented this type of logistic. So when we implement this commercial strategy, we already incorporate within it all of these elements. These are the elements, these are differential, a competitive elements of Petrobras. So we have the best production conditions and logistic conditions. And this is one of the elements of our commercial strategy as a competitive price mitigating market volatility as we see currently as we mentioned.Now regarding the current positioning of the price, regarding reference marginal value, we cannot disclose this because we would expose data that is very sensitive for the company from the competition point of view. So this is it.So thank you very much Schlosser. The next question is for you from Bruno Montanari regarding the commercial policy. Assuming that the independent importer is in competitive in terms of price, how can the company believe that the market will balance from here and due to the structural need to import diesel and gasoline  Can import   can Petrobras import with a competitive margins  What about Russian diesel with the company consider importing Russian diesel for the marketWell, now regarding the market balance, it is very important to remember that the greatest diesel importers and gas for Brazil are the distributing companies. They make up their mix with different suppliers nationally, international and this from different origins. This could be Russia. When we analyze the month of July, we can see that over 80  of the imported diesel by third parties to Brazil came from Russia.This is a product that presents certain restrictions from sanctions, but it has flown in the international market. Now from our side, we are meeting the commitments with our customers. We are optimizing our refining complex, broadening the use of our cluster and our logistic assets and complementing our national offering with very specific imports. Petrobras tries to operate   to optimize its operations of foreign trade to use its logistic capacity and analyzing the synergies of its assets with this what happens at the end of the line. With promising results is that we practice competitive margins regarding the margins offered by other players that are not integrated.So regarding opportunities import of Russian diesel, we are constantly assessing the risks and returns. As I said, there are particularities regarding the sanction and this is why we observe closely the sanction loss regarding Petrobras Global activities. So thank you, Schlosser.The next question from Bruno Amorim from Goldman Sachs. And this is geared to Sergio regarding the dividend policy. The new policy was very clear, but this means that all no free cash flow will be for dividend payout and by batch, can you pay an extraordinary dividends at the beginning of next year due intend to draw the net debt of the company.Thank you for your question. In reality, our dividend payout policy is similar to our past policy. We're have   they're having problems with the sound again, can you hear me  Well, your audio is a little bit choppy. Well, unfortunately the sound of my laptop isn't very good. As I said, the current policies anticipate the payout of extraordinary dividends. So yes, we expect to payout these dividends. The decision is going to depend on the technical analysis of the company in the short, mid and long run. And then the analysis of certain adjustments and now these adjustments will be concentrated at the end of the year when we have a general outlook of the results of the company throughout the entire year.Now, regarding the net debt, the financial that is dropping our debt is impacted by the charter, but it's at a comfortable level regarding RPL  ph  and the levels are very, are according to what we expect in our strategic plan. But we also follow up. There could be a fine tuning throughout our next strategic plan. And thank you for your question. Thank you, Sergio.The next question from Lilyanna Yang from HSBC. And she said, in this management, will Petrobras in take their investments to a new level  Can you talk about the strategic view regarding energy transition  Could you elaborate on the rationale in expanding investments in biofuel and negotiations with you Unigel  And when can we expect an announcement about complete strategic plan for 2024 between 2028Now Tolmasquim and William have the floor in order to answer the question.I am going to start talking about energy transition and biofuels and then I will give it back to William that who will talk about fertilizers and Unigel and he will give us necessary information. So thank you very much for this question. There are three main reasons why Petrobras will embark in the biofuel business.Number one, will be that Brazil is one of the countries with the greatest amount of available land water. And so these three factors together, there are very few countries that present these three factors together. Number two, is that despite the electrification of a number of transportation means all the logistic of the country is for liquid fuels. So to use biofuel, well you leverage the existing logistic factor.Number three, is highly connected to Petrobras that is that we can use or we can adapt the existing refining units to produce this biofuel. So Petrobras has a comparative advantage when we compare it to other players, because these are adaptations of existing units and Petrobras has an excellent trajectory in all segments in highway transportation. It's to put the vegetable oil in would be between 5 , 7  together with oil and this is produced through treatment. They produce diesel and therefore this is a patent from  indiscernible  from the research center.Then we have air transportation with the unit that is dedicated where you can only use vegetable oil and then you can produce fuel and there will be a major demand throughout the world as of 2027, because there is a mandate that all companies will have to decarbonize themselves as of this period. There will be SAF, there will be a worldwide demand for SAF and Petrobras has an advantage. Maritime transportation where we mentioned we are carrying out a experience of vessels that combine biodiesel to their   and we also have a biodiesel production and we produce the bunker and that there is an advantage here.And finally, the petrochemical industry, which is a major trend, how to pro   produce plastics. So there is a test that will be performed in the Rio Grande density refinery using bio oil and vegetable oil. Therefore, from the strategic point of view, if there is a country that has to embark in biofuel is Brazil. And if there is a company that has to embark in biodiesel in Brazil, it's Petrobras, because precisely we have all the refining investments and therefore it is possible to adapt their   our refining unit. Now, I will give it back to William that is in charge of refining and he will talk about fertilizers and he will answer the question about Unigel.So thank you very much Lilyanna. Thank you for your question. It is interesting when you ask this number one that the verticalization is important when you see how things compliment themselves. I'm talking refining, petrochemical and the fertilizing production   fertilizer production. So we are studying fertilizers. We are analyzing the return of the company to fertilizers. We are already working with a working troop coordinated by the officers in order to start up this. There is an advantage that it doesn't need natural gas. It could use asphalt residue from Repar. So the refinery from Paraná compliments and lanza  ph  that is right beside the refinery. Therefore we are assessing the economic feasibility as you mentioned to start UFN-III, we have a work, this is a gas plant with 80  that is 80  mechanic. We are studying how we complete UFN-III Três Lagoas that will have capacity of 3,200 tons day of urea of ammonia. So we are also, we compliment   we, gas no where we have, we will have the production of lubricant using oil gas from Reduc. There's a plant that will start in the middle of the year. And in this plant we will have a CO2 plus production. Now the CO2 plus this is rich in raw material to produce a ethane to polypropylene. We have a non-compete with Braskem  ph  but because of this Braskem is very important as Sergio mentioned. So it will be very important here due to the important, the size and the integration of Braskem with this process.So the integration with the refining industries is very important because they supply enough the natural gas, because of our refineries, are right beside our couplets like a Massad Rio de Janeiro  indiscernible  there is a strong integration with raw material petrochemical lubricants, and also fertilizers, well, where gas lube will have remaining of 2 million cubic meters of gas that we will be able to use for fertilizers as well for an addition integration for a Biofine plant using totally green raw material and producing biodiesel. Diesel are 100 and our SAF, our Sustainable Aviation Fuel, what is this  This is the use of a refined hydrogen with green raw material.We will carry out a test in November in the Riograndense refinery with Ultrapar and Braskem. This is a green refinery. We will have 2,000 tons of soybean in our catalytic cracking unit to produce green NAFTA and green propane. We re talking about raw material that comes from renewable sources for petrochemical plants. And this will be successful. This is an international patents. We trust  indiscernible  and this will be the first totally green refinery in the country. So we are complementing petrochemical, biorefining lubricants, fertilizers, and refining. Thank you for the question.Thank you, Tolmasquim. Thank you, William. And the next question will be asked by Rodrigo Almeida from Santander Bank for Schlosser and William again. After nearly three months of the new pricing policy being announced, what advances have you made in gaining competitiveness for the company considering the competition with Russian diesel  How are internal production costs and commercial costs changed with the increase in production  Is there any significant cost dilution  How has the company dealt with a higher production of products that have a limited demand in the domestic marketRodrigo, our entire commercial work as its starting point, a planning process that is quite complex. It involves over a 100,000 variables, 40,000 restrictions. So it s a very complex process, but what I can tell you is that I joined the company 36 years ago and our process was exactly that it was based on that foundation. And not only Petrobras, companies around the world are adopting this planning mechanism and it takes into consideration, for example, the production of each kind of oil per refinery per unit. And it also uses all of the logistics restrictions which are also placed there. And why do we depend on the model  What information do we get from itAs a final result, we optimize our refinement and logistics assets. So what we re seeking are economic assessments for each of our operations and for each production alternative that we have, both taking oil to some refinery or exporting it. Similarly, following this planning model, we have different production fronts from all sorts of oil products. It analyzes changes in quality. So its entire goal is to find a more efficient process. So the utilization of our refineries and increasing production was supported by these economic assessments and they had a very positive result for the company.Considering costs as you mentioned, I would draw your attention to this. Most of the costs or the cost of the product sold is mostly including the entire business, a result of the raw material oil. If we add in the energy it takes for it to be produced, then it s basically over 90 . So the dilution effect is basically in existence. So we don t really take it into consideration in our planning and optimization plans. So in the operational plan, we don t take this into account. A lot of it is connected to the bread I don t know if William has any comments about this, but I ll pass it over to him.Thank you, Claudio. Yes, that was a good question, Rodrigo. Thank you. To add to what Claudio said, our refinery cost has a synergy across all of our refineries. Some of them have a higher cost due to their complexity location, and others have a lower cost. But since there is a synergy across all kinds of refinement, our cost is about  2 or  2.5 per barrel, which is quite reasonable considering our refinement. And even considering the last program to down style   downtime which increased our cost, we were able to keep that stability around  2 to  2.5 per barrel. And I d also like to highlight this. We re getting very good utilization factors around the level of 93  to 95 . In May, we had 95 . In June, we were able to stay at 93 . Obviously, this depends on planning as was said. So planning is what is going to define what load is received in each refinery, the different products of course.And obviously, we have availability, which is a significant factor. Looking at our systems, they have a certain maximum load, but we also have maximum loads that are adjusted and authorized by agencies. So it defines the maximum loads that we have with environmental agencies. So this is due to planning and we hope to work at 95 or even a bit higher, but of course it will depend under the pan demand of our logistics provider. Thank you.Thank you, William. The second question from Rodrigo is from Sergio, and he asks about capital allocation. So Sergio, I d like to understand if the additional project for energy transition being studied are influencing your minimal cash and your reference cash indications that you passed to us before. In theory, the company will conclude 2023 with cash levels above the indications that we have for the minimum and for the reference. And it would be interesting to learn a bit more about what will be done with this excess cash on the short term.Hi, Rodrigo. Thank you for that question. As I said before, we are at a very comfortable position in cash. We don t have on the horizon any sort of radical changes to manage excess cash. And excess cash can be used to pay additional dividends. It can become additional dividends. If the administrators understand that that s the best use for our capital. So thank you very much again.Thank you, Sergio. Still on this topic. We got a question from Pedro Soares from BTG Pactual addressed to you. He would like to know a bit more about extraordinary dividend payouts. We know that this possibility is established in our payout policy, but we would like to hear from you if it would make sense to have a new statutory reserve to use resources to expand the company or if that doesn't make any sense  And if there's an extraordinary payout, will it only be defined when we receive results from the fourth quarterHi, Pedro. Thank you for your question. So some of it has been addressed in the previous answer, but yes, the extra results may be used for payouts extraordinary or additional payouts. But if a reserve is created considering what you said, since it doesn't exist yet, it would need to be approved by an extraordinary shareholders meeting and we would need to have a justification for it but it is feasible. Connected to   but it needs to be connected to shareholders and their interests need to be representedThank you, Sergio. The next question is from Monique Greco from Itaú BBA. And it will be addressed to Spinelli. So Spinelli, can you tell us a bit about the first impressions you've had since you took on this position  And if you can tell us what has been your focus in your officeI'm Mário, thank you. Good morning and thank you for your question. I knew this office because I was an ombudsman for the company for nearly six years. So we have a governance system at Petrobras, which has already been robust but can be strengthened. Our compliance participates in decision making processes. So whatever decisions are received by the Board are examined by our governance department. And when it comes to compliance, we also have a very robust system and this is paying attention to new challenges.So in our compliance department, we have been looking at all acquisitions of sexual harassment in the company, which is very important even for our reputation. So we're going to try to make compliance come closer to the business working with our managers. And similarly, it's important to highlight that when we need to work with a more repressive initiative we just had the 10-year anniversary of the Anti-Corruption Act in Brazil. But you have to know that Petrobras is the company that most uses more   most enforces this Act that most punishes for corruption.Of course, we don't want it to happen when it does   when it does happen we need to punish it. So over  90 million have been applied in fines to companies, there has been a volume of sanction applied to all levels of the government and Petrobras represent 21  of them. So I had the opportunity of working with this Bill, and I'm very happy to see how Petrobras is using it. And the most important part is that 61  of these sanctions or the initiative is being enforced by us, by our Directors. So identifying regularity was done by the manager itself, which shows that our compliance culture is being spread across the company. So these are some of our results and future challenges. Thank you.Thank you, Spinelli. The next question from Monique will be asked to William. William, even with the maintenance carried out in the last quarters, the company has maintained high utilization levels for its refineries. Is there still some space to increase these utilization rates  And what would be the desired level for a refinery or for the entire refinery structureWell, I've answered a similar question to that, but I'll add-in some information. We've been able to get very high utilization factors increasing availability.Sorry, your microphone was closed, William.So as I said, we have higher availability in our refineries considering our commercial and logistical plan, but there's an essential factor here. We need to, well, we have good availability, but we have to ensure that all aspects are respected including safety, environment, integrity and that includes diversity. So we've talked about diversity before and we need to maintain the same levels. So we're very happy to say that we have recordable incident rates in our refinery infrastructure of 037  ph , which is the global benchmark.Of course, we can't rest on those laurels. We know that SMS is a running truck. You always have to pay attention to the brake because if you let go, it will go down. So you always have to keep attention and respect all of the procedures that will ensure that your activities are done safely, respecting the environment, respecting people, their global health and with integrity. Okay, Monique so it's very important to highlight that operational results are important, but they need to be done sustainably. Thank you for your question.Thank you, William. We're going to repeat Gabriel Barra's question about Braskem to Sergio since he had a technical issue. Sergio, there's a discussion on selling Braskem and some people are interested in buying it. So can you give us the management's take on these investments in the petrochemical industry  Should this be one of the company's long-term focusesGabriel, thank you. We didn't get enough sound during the first part of my answer, but around May, we launched a review of the company's strategic directives and this guides a new plan, which is ongoing. It takes one-year to generate these strategic plans, so it's at the end of its conclusion. So with diversification for petrochemicals and fertilizers, this will allow us to look at petrochemicals differently. So it's also important to see that major integrated companies have a strong position in petrochemicals. Petrobras has a strong stake at Braskem because we understood that petrochemicals were important to develop our business as a whole.So this integrion provides value and there's a matter of long-term security here, since the long-term scenario is lower, margins for example, for gasoline. So we will require oil to be used in more noble purposes. So if you consider these three things that Braskem has a strategic compliance, allowing it to or determining it to diversify in the petrochemical industry. If you look at the medium- and long-term perspective and the importance for the resilience of our business, yes, we can consider that petrochemicals are very attractive and aligned to our long-term strategy. Thank you for your question.The next question is from Luiz Carvalho from UBS to Schlosser. He's asking for the national spread of gasoline on Brent was at negative levels. Other local products could export diesel at these levels, but from our understanding both points represent that the company is below the marginal price levels. So how do you understand this  Does this assumption make sense  Can Petrobras be below its pricing interval exporting for a marginal value  Does that make sense for the companyThank you, Luiz for your question. This topic involves marginal values for Petrobras. So as a highlight   I d like to highlight that this is the result of a complex operational plan, as we said before, involving different areas and the alternatives that we have to run our business. What I would add about to what has already been said is that basically refining is a joint process. So when you re refining a bear of oil, you re not producing a single product. You have a basket of gas products, and the relationship between them influences the marginal value of one to the other.So to summarize it for these reasons, the marginal values is not limited to exportation. It involves production, importing the products. So it cannot be only compared to exportation. And the other value that we have to highlight here is the mitigation due to volatility peaks in the market. We have a very volatile market. If we looked at the previous strategy, Petrobras would make these adjustments immediately for this volatility, and would provide stability for their clients. So we were able to overcome this moment and we re still monitoring the domestic and international markets. And when we have to adjust the prices up or down, we will according to technical parameters in our commercial strategy. CarlosThank you, Schlosser. The next question from Luiz Carvalho is for Sergio, and it asks about the strategical plan. Sergio, the strategical plan included diversification. Now, as the plan is being developed, what have been your focus in your internal discussions  Will you make more organic investments, or is there a procedural for mergers and acquisitions  How much diversification is the company considering 6  or 15  of the CapEx direction for low carbon  Would that also include these activities, petrochemicals, renewable developments, or should we see new investments in M AsThis range between 6  and 15  is specific for energy transition in the world. There is a business of low carbon actions and initiatives of low carbon. Today, 6  that we see in the CapEx, the use of 6  of Petrobras CapEx is US 4.4 billion. And it is used, and it is part of our way of operating internally, decarbonizing our operations. And this has been successful. We are amongst the greatest investors in decarbonizing the operations of oil and gas. Now it s obvious that Petrobras has to recover a space that was left behind. We did go toward Scope 3 of decarbonization, and there is this range. We establish this rate between 6  and 15 , specifically for energetic transition, decarbonization of our operations and new investments. Any M A that emerges in the area will fit within the range between 6  and 15 . It has to be within the range of CapEx allocation.Now for these new investments, Petrobras has decided the upper management has decided to embark in partnerships with big companies like Petrobras. Because we do understand that partnerships faster the accelerated   transference of a know-how, and they mitigate are   that is inherent, inherent. When you embark in a new business area, the company may consider an M A or a certain acquisition as long as it is between 6  and 15 . But these M As must meet a number of criteria strategic compliance, whatever is the M A. It has to be accordance with our strategic planning. It has to be in compliance. We are not going to invest in transition for the sake of investing. The economic part is important. We need a return, we need a consistent cost structure. So dimension and a strategic compliance would be the main criteria that we take into account when we think about mergers and acquisitions.Sergio, the next question from Régis Cardoso from Credit Suisse for Schlosser, it s about fuel prices. Can we guarantee a country s supply when there is high volatility and international prices  Could Petrobras be forced to increase it  Import levels taking to, although it can take it can result in economic losses. What is the share of Russian fuel in BrazilWell, the Brazilian market is properly supplied, and there are a number of agents that work in this market. So in addition to Petrobras, there are other national companies. We have distributing companies, we have diesel and gas importers, independent importers, and even distributors are the main importers. And in addition, there is an alternative of biofuels. Now, when we talk about Russian diesel, there has been an evolution since the beginning of the year reaching values above 80  in July. And this environment results in great competitiveness. Petrobras six is a market share that allows us to use our assets, our logistics structure, and our refining as is creating value in a sustainable fashion and also part of our commercial strategy.So thank you Schlosser. We have a last question that is for you for Rodolfo Angele, JPMorgan. In May Petrobras published a new policy prize seeing opportunity cost for clients and opportunities for Petrobras. How can the Russian diesel dynamic and the refining capacity will impact the second semester  Could you talk about the range of gasoline prices currentlySo thank you, Rodolfo. I would just like to highlight the commercial strategy and its evolution. In the past there was a reference that was the price of import parity. Ours has been implemented, it is underway. We have two market references. One is the alternative cost of the client, and the other one is the marginal cost. The Russian diesel is an additional alternative for supply, and we already mentioned this now simultaneously, the essential part of our commercial strategy is volatility of prices. Nonetheless, we continuously are seeking the optimization of a refining assets and seeking other opportunities like import and the export of oil and byproducts to create more value for the company.Now, regarding margins and positioning because of the competition, we cannot disclose our position vis-à-vis the internal references, but we want to clarify that each agent has its own characteristics for production, for import. Here we have, we have a logistics system for supply and even with other alternatives. And this results in commercial strategies that are totally different from these agents with diversity, that results in a new dynamic for the market. So now I give it back to you.So thank you very much, Schlosser. So now we bring our Q A session to an end. Should you have additional questions, they can be sent to our IR team. And the presentation of the event is available in our site. And in brief, we will make available the audio. Thank you very much and have a very good day.",20,2023-08-04T14:39:09.000-04:00
Repsol: Appealing Valuation And Double-Digit Shareholder Distributions,"We present our note on Repsol , a Spanish multinational energy and petrochemicals company. We are drawn by Repsol s strong execution, rising refining margins, prowess in the low-carbon businesses, and cheap valuation combined with double-digit capital returns to shareholders. In this note, we will provide is a Spanish oil and gas company with activities in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America, and the US. Repsol contains more than 300 companies incorporated in more than 40 countries, across the Exploration   Production, Industrial, Customer, and Renewables businesses. The group produces 550 Kboe day and has 1909 Mbep of proven reserves. It owns six refineries with more than one day refining capacity. Repsol owns 4,651 service stationsRepsol has announced an ambitious  aiming to decarbonize the portfolio, moving into a new operating model towards net zero, all while generating strong financial results and remunerating shareholders. By 2030 Repsol aims to have ca. 45  of its capital employed in the low-carbon business. This transition is self-financing with oil at  50 bbl. and gas at  2.5 HH.Repsol is listed on the BME  Madrid Stock Exchange  and has a current market capitalization of  18.3 billion.On July 27, Repsol printed adequate  numbers, with adjusted income coming in around 1  below the . With recovering underlying commodity prices and increasing refining margins, we believe these results represent a trough for Repsol. Execution in Upstream was stronger than expected, with a low double digits production increase powered by higher production in Venezuela and Libya, the commissioning of new wells at US shale assets, and scope . The performance of the Industrial business was in line, while Commercial and Renewables underperformed consensus expectations.Repsol reiterated its upstream production guidance for the year at 590 610 day and continues to expect a refining margin of  9 bbl. for the year. Reflecting lower gas prices and other contributing factors, Repsol lowered its CFFO  Cash Flow from Operations  guidance by  1 billion to  7 billion per year. This was expected by the markets and did not come as a surprise. Moreover, the company guided to 30  of CFFO being distributed to shareholders implying a cumulative amount of  2.4 billion of dividends and buybacks. Moreover, a new capital reduction program aiming for the redemption of 60 million shares by year-end was announced. This should result in mid-single digits accretion.After the last oil and gas downcycle, Repsol has materially improved its cost structure in Upstream. It has reduced exposure to high-cost production areas by  assets and has a pipeline of lower-cost production assets. We are constructive on the latest explorations in , , and the Gulf of Mexico.In the Refining business, Repsol is among the European leaders and owns one of the most complex and largest refining networks in the continent. We have a positive view on margin progression in the following quarters driven by robust seasonal demand combined with a variety of issues affecting supply such as strikes, fires, etc.Repsol is navigating the Green Transition deftly and we believe it will emerge as a winner. It currently has ca. 1.8 GW of renewable capacity and has an ambitious goal of reaching 20 GW by 2030. The  in 2022 will add ca. 7.7 GW of additional capacity mainly in Southern Europe. In June 2022, Repsol  to Credit Agricole Assurances and EIP at an implied total Enterprise Value of  4.4 billion against a much lower capital employed of  2 billion, a 2x MOIC, demonstrating impressive value creation capabilities.Moreover, Repsol has a considerable presence in EV charging and Biofuels, positioning itself as the European oil   gas player most exposed to the Green Transition relative to its size. Repsol has set a target of 1.9 GW renewable  capacity by 2030, and 0.55 GW by 2025. Given Spain s solar power generation capabilities and positioning, we believe Repsol is well-positioned to benefit from the emergence of green hydrogen technology in the long run. However, given the low visibility, this is not part of our investment case.In FY 2024, we forecast  59 billion of revenue,  6.8 billion of EBIT, and  3.7 billion of reported net income, implying an EPS of  3.0. With a market capitalization of  18.3 billion, a net financial debt position of  2.0 billion, and an enterprise value of  20.3 billion, Repsol is trading at 3x forward EBIT and at 4.6x forward EPS. Assuming  2.4 billion of distributions, 13  of the market cap will be returned this year. Assuming  0.70 DPS, Repsol offers a 5  dividend yield.Repsol is currently cheaper than peers BP, TotalEnergies, Eni, Shell, etc. that trade at 25  higher forward PE multiples. Repsol also trades at a discount to its historical multiples. This discount does not reflect the underlying fundamentals of the company. We believe Repsol should trade at least at 5.5x forward EPS or at a share price of  16.5 or  18.2, implying at least 20  upside. Catching up to other leading European oil majors implies upside north of 20 . We find this very attractive especially combined with the double-digit level of shareholder distributions.Risks include but are not limited to lower than expected oil and gas prices, lower than expected production, production risk in countries such as Venezuela or Libya, asset impairments, operational problems higher than expected costs, higher than expected capital expenditures, poor project execution, lower than expected refining margins, higher taxation and one-off windfall taxes, more restrictive environmental regulations, foreign exchange movements, natural disasters and weather events, accidents, value destructive M A, suboptimal allocation of capital to low IRR renewable projects, etc.Given the valuation discount to peers combined with high dividends and buybacks, supported by strong fundamentals, refining tailwinds, and a smooth navigation of the green transition, we recommend building a long position on Repsol shares. Repsol is among our favorite names in the Big Oil space.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Why Petrobras Is A Great Alternative To Other Oil Majors,"Petrobras, officially known as   , is a  90-billion market cap Brazilian oil and gas company with operations both domestically and internationally. Petrobras is involved in various aspects of the energy industry, including exploration, production, refining, transportation, marketing, andIt is one of the world's  oil producers and one of the top 5 exporters of crude oil. Petrobras plays a dominant role in the Brazilian energy market,  of the country's oil and gas production. The firm is divided into  Exploration and Production, Refining, Transportation and Marketing, and Gas and Power  Corporate excluded . Petrobras released its Q2 FY2023 financial results, and theyIn addition, Petrobras achieved a net profit of  5.8 billion and generated an FCF of  6.7 billion. The company's distribution of dividends totaling  6.2 billion amid a comfortable OCF of  9.6 billion underscores PBR's financial strength, in my view.Operationally, Petrobras reported growth in production, especially in the pre-salt region, which now accounts for 78  of their overall production. Key projects like the FPSO Almirante Barroso and the acquisition of new exploration blocks highlight their determination to expand production capacity. In downstream activities, Petrobras showcased its refinery modernization efforts, including revamping projects, carbon footprint reduction initiatives, and technological innovations.On October 2nd, 2023, we found out that Petrobras  by Brazil's top environmental agency, Ibama, to conduct research in the Potiguar basin, part of the Equatorial Margin offshore region in Brazil's Northeast. This comes after months of negotiations and setbacks. Petrobras now plans to begin drilling in the area next month to assess the economic viability and extent of oil discoveries made in 2013 at the Pitu well. is a promising oil exploration opportunity in Brazil, potentially holding reserves similar to those in Guyana, where Exxon Mobil  is developing multibillion-barrel discoveries. Ibama  Petrobras from drilling in the Foz do Amazonas basin due to environmental concerns, leading to this alternative exploration plan.Petrobras now plans to drill 16 exploratory wells between 2023-2027 with an estimated investment of 15 billion reais  3 billion dollars  in sedimentary basins such as Foz do Amazonas, Pará-Maranhão, Barreirinhas, and Potiguar.In addition, PBR has other projects that will be put into operation very soonPerhaps the only thing that has kept PBR stock from impressive growth in recent months - besides the falling oil price - is geopolitics. But in my opinion, the fears surrounding Petrobras related to the election of Brazilian President Lula now appear to be exaggerated. Petrobras  nationalized or forced to cut dividends entirely. Since Lula's presidency began, there has been less aggressive intervention in the company's affairs than many people thought. The change in dividend policy, reducing the distribution to 45  of FCF, as we may see now, does not significantly impact Petrobras's dividend attractiveness, in my view, especially when compared to other international oil and gas majors.In late September, Goldman Sachs analysts slightly improved Brazil's real GDP growth expectations  proprietary source  for FY2023 due to a higher-than-expected Q2 2023 print, with a projection of 2.92 . Expectations for FY2024 GDP growth stand at 1.50 . So in general, the macro situation in Brazil looks good - it should create a favorable background for the future growth of the Brazilian stock market, where PBR should be one of the market leaders.On the global macro front, taking into account recent events in Israel, another group of Goldman Sachs analysts sees two potential impacts that could affect global oil supplies over time  proprietary source, paraphrased by the authorThe issue of high oil prices in the world market is a major concern for inflation expectations, but not for energy companies like PBR - recent events are clearly bullish for the company.Thanks to the still current rumors of a possible nationalization of the company, as well as a number of other risks related to the region in which it operates, Petrobras is, in my opinion, one of the most favorable alternatives to Western oil and gas companies such as Exxon or Chevron . PBR currently trades at 2.2 times next year's EV EBITDA, 43  less than the peer group averageMoreover, Petrobras' return on capital employed  ROCE  and EBITDA margin  TTM  are significantly better than those of the peer groupOf course, my thesis is full of different risks that I may underestimate  but you shouldn't . Many investors have concerns including neglected cost management, unclear pricing policies, and potentially unprofitable investments  recall the most recent news of more drillings anticipated for the next few years . Petrobras is considering offshore wind, which is fraught with regulatory and financial uncertainties, and critics  that the company should focus on its core activities. The new dividend policy could also lead to dividend cuts, which are currently priced in and explain the company's cheap valuation levels.However, taking into account recent events  both geopolitical and microeconomic , I believe that the PBR stock today has more upside potential than downside risks. Of course, anything can happen - no one is immune to equity market risk, certainly not especially so in an emerging market. But when an asset is trading so cheaply and its valuation is based in part on years of fears that still haven't been borne out, that's food for thought for me personally. And unlike Chinese stocks, the Brazilian stock market, oddly enough, seems more understandable to me.That's why I rate PBR stock as a  Buy  this time around.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tesla Q3 Earnings Anticipation: Tracking Megapack's Progress And Pricing,"  is set to report third-quarter earnings  on October 18, 2023. The company's recently disclosed Q3  figures disappointed some investors, as units grew annually butDespite Tesla maintaining full-year guidance, markets seemed unimpressed as the stock barely moved on the delivery news. With Tesla's upcoming earnings on the horizon, looking back at its historical stock performance can provide perspective on the current opportunity. Though Q3 deliveries underwhelmed, examining how the stock has previously reacted to results can reframe how investors evaluate Tesla heading into the print.With a market cap approaching  800 billion, Tesla's valuation has long sparked debate. Prominent short-seller , whoLooking back reveals four key valuation leaps tied to Tesla's strategic product launches  20- 30 billion market cap valued Tesla as a luxury automaker based on high-priced Models S and X targeting the upper market. This positioned Tesla similarly to premium brands like BMW  and Mercedes  based on its focus on sleek, high-end electric sedans and SUVs during this period. Launching the mass market Model 3 in July 2017 marked a pivotal moment, fueling the first major jump in Tesla's valuation. By demonstrating its ability to produce an affordable, mid-range electric vehicle, Tesla showed its potential to disrupt the broader auto market through electrification. The Model 3 opened Tesla up to a much wider audience beyond just luxury buyers. Introducing the mid-size Model Y SUV in early 2020 expanded Tesla's addressable market, propelling a second steep valuation rise. Adding a more affordable electric SUV enabled Tesla to compete in the hugely lucrative crossover segment, the most popular vehicle type in the U.S. market. This moved Tesla beyond just cars into the leading product category. The Model Y helped push Tesla's valuation to around  400 billion, surpassing the market cap of industry leader Toyota , which was around  200 billion. The third major surge in Tesla's valuation began in September 2020, as the company  its Full Self-Driving  FSD  beta test program and detailed plans for a robotaxi network. Bullish analysts like Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas propelled the stock higher by valuing Tesla's software and services business, including the potential for an autonomous ridesharing platform, at nearly the same level as its automotive operations. This pushed Tesla's market cap from around  400 billion up to  800 billion by late 2020. The prospect of Tesla evolving into a leader in autonomous taxi services, powered by AI and software, led many investors to significantly expand the company's total addressable market and opportunity beyond just electric vehicles.Our analysis below revealed that despite the FSD efforts' modest success, they would not be able to maintain their  400 billion valuation boost.Tesla disclosed that  owners in the United States and Canada now have access to the FSD beta, representing high penetration among existing owners given Tesla has sold over  vehicles globally. With around 400,000 customers in North America alone on the autonomous platform, Tesla has reached material scale in its installed base of FSD users. For context, Uber  had a market cap of  60- 100 billion at the time based on its ridesharing network. Tesla's base of FSD beta users highlights the company's leadership in autonomous driving technology among consumer vehicles.However, gaps remain in justifying Tesla's valuation based on its total addressable markets. Another surge occurred in August 2021 after the announcement of a 100,000-vehicle  from Hertz . But the global rental car market is only around , far below the over  1 trillion valuation Tesla reached. Even combining rental cars and the  heavy truck market, the combined total addressable market, or TAM, is dwarfed by Tesla's peak  1 trillion valuation.This helps explain Tesla's 50  pullback from over  1 trillion to around  400 billion, as the upside from autonomous driving, rental cars, trucks, etc. could not sustain such an elevated valuation. The upper limit of Tesla's immediately addressable markets remains well below its recent valuation highs.In our  article, we discussed how Tesla's energy business, specifically its Megapack product, could be the primary driver of future valuation growth.Our  4.2 trillion total addressable market estimate for Tesla Energy is based on simple assumptions around global energy storage needs. According to Tesla, the global energy market is 165,000 terawatt-hours  TWh  per year. If we assume only 5  of this capacity will need storage long-term, that equates to 8,250 TWh of storage required.Tesla's Megapacks have a capacity of 3.9 megawatt-hours  MWh . So to store 8,250 TWh would require around 2.1 million Megapacks at  2 million each - resulting in a  4.2 trillion market opportunity. With the massive  addressable market for energy storage, this segment offers far more upside potential than Tesla's car business or even full self-driving capabilities.While the 5  energy storage assumption is subjective, the math illustrates the sheer magnitude of storage investments needed to support grid reliability and renewables growth. Energy storage may potentially be in higher demand, for example, in data centers as AI develops.According to  report, energy storage is becoming essential for data centers to reduce costs through peak shaving and valley filling. Electricity is 60-70  of data center operating costs, so facilities utilize storage to arbitrage cheaper off-peak power.Operators are also connecting edge data centers to provide low latency, localized computing at the network edge. Per Huawei, over 10,000 mobile edge computing nodes will be deployed by 2030. This brings content closer to users, reduces latency, and enables localized data processing.Additionally, clean energy usage will rise as data centers target 100  green power by 2030. Wind, solar and other renewables will displace fossil fuels.As the Megapack is key to realizing the energy storage opportunity, we wanted to check in on recent progress as a potential indicator ahead of Tesla's Q3 earnings. We uncovered data points around Megapack pricing and delivery timelines that are worth monitoring as possible signs of slowing demand, though they could alternatively reflect supply ramping up.On August 18, 2023,  reported the earliest Megapack delivery date available on Tesla's website was Q2 2025, with pricing set at  12 million for a 5-megapack system. When we checked the website on October 2, 2023, the earliest delivery date had moved up to Q3 2024, while pricing had dropped to  10 million.Lower pricing and faster delivery could point to weaker demand. However, Tesla has a history of cutting prices as production scales, so this could also stem from the manufacturing ramp allowing cost reductions and shorter lead times.In Tesla's Q2  letter, the company noted its dedicated Megapack factory in Lathrop, CA had successfully scaled production, though still with room to reach full capacity. Energy storage deployments grew 222  annually but did see some sequential slowing  due to project timing.This ramp-up seemed to support the case that accelerated delivery timelines and lower costs reflect expanding supply rather than weakening demand. And in June and July 2023, Tesla continued landing major Megapack orders like a  Belgium project and deal in Massachusetts.As Tesla gets set to report Q3 results, progress on the Megapack rollout remains an important catalyst for investors to watch. Strong continued growth in deployments and orders would reinforce Tesla's long-term energy storage upside. But any signs of slowing traction could raise concerns about realizing its immense potential in this critical market. We will be closely monitoring energy segment metrics this earnings season for the latest Megapack demand signals. We keep our buy rating.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.

MAG Silver: Juanicipio Reaches Nameplate Capacity,"Just over ten months ago, I  , noting that while it had an exciting year ahead, the better course of action was waiting for a steep pullback vs. chasing the rally above US 16.70. This isMAG Silver reported its production results from Juanicipio  44  ownership  this week with Fresnillo  as the operator, noting that nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day was reached in Q3, a development that shareholders have been anxiously waiting for after the slower than planned tie-in to the national power grid. This is positive news as it has de-risked operations given that MAG Silver no longer has to rely on excess capacity being available at Fresnillo's Fresnillo and Saucito plants in the district. However, it did impact Q3 production with no material heading to these mills in August and September, resulting in tonnes processed declining by over 14  to  322,200 tonnes. So, while grades were higher sequentially at 523 grams per tonne of silver  Q2 2023  498 grams per tonne of silver , production slid to  4.78 million ounces of silver and 9,400 ounces of gold, translating to a  2  decline in silver and gold production.Looking at the production on an attributable basis above, MAG's share of production  44  came in at  2.1 million ounces of silver and  4,100 ounces of gold before adjustments, translating to over  50 million in attributable revenue despite the lower metals prices in the period. However, we should see an even better year in 2024 with the benefit of lower transportation costs at Juanicipio  no need to toll-mill material , and annual attributable production to MAG Silver of 8.5  million ounces of silver, translating to equity income of at least  75 million in 2024  FY2022   40.8 million . These proceeds will top up MAG Silver's already strong cash position  54 million, with no debt  which can be directed towards drilling at Juanicipio, Deer Trail, and Larder Lake.Speaking of exploration, investors continue to await results from its new Larder Lake Project, and Deer Trail has continued to see exploration success, which I detailed briefly in my . However, the most significant opportunity is in the Fresnillo District at Juanicipio, even if things have been quiet with the last major updated being in Q2 2022. This is because just 5  of the entire property has been explored to date and directly beneath the Bonanza Zone that's currently being mined  10.2 million tonnes of resources at 550  grams per tonne of silver  are multiple additional zones, with the Deep Zone having significantly more tonnes and higher base metal and gold grades, offset by lower silver grades, as well as high-grade veins like Venadas  discovered in 2019  that run opposite to the typical northwest orientations, with highlight intercepts of 2.1 meters true width at 489 grams per tonne of silver and 0.94 grams per tonne of gold, 1.4 meters at 491 grams per tonne of silver and 2.69 grams per tonne of gold, and 2.5 meters at 918 grams per tonne of silver and 1.8 grams per tonne of gold.Since the 2019 drill program that uncovered Venadas I and II and the Pre-Anticipada Vein, MAG Silver has continued to complete infill drilling at the much larger Deep Zone, with highlight intercepts in 2020 including several thick intercepts that includedAnd as of the 2022 update, MAG noted that most of its intercepts are comparable to neighboring holes, which confirm its expectations of grade and thickness and is now confident that Valdecanas sits on top of an upwelling zone that is contributing to this considerable mineral endowment. In addition, the company believes that it may have multiple upwelling zones on its property, and the previous discovery of dilatant zones is certainly an exciting development. This is significant because the market may be underestimating the economic potential of Juanicipio, which is an asset that could ultimately remain in production past 2050 if we can continue to see exploration success. Plus, with MAG Silver being the minority partner of this world-class asset, which allows it to maintain a lean organizational structure, it should command a premium vs. other single-asset silver producers.While MAG Silver has become more reasonably valued after its  55  correction, the stock never belonged above  23.00 in the first place, which makes the magnitude of the correction less relevant. And with Mexico's investment attractiveness losing points after the major strike at a neighboring mine  Penasquito  in Zacatecas and recent mining law reforms, it's less desirable than it was when MAG Silver made its all-time highs in June 2021 to be a single-asset miner in Mexico. So, I think a more conservative multiple for the stock today is 1.30x P NAV, translating to a fair value of  1.50 billion or US 14.30 based on  105 million fully diluted shares. And given that I am looking for a minimum 35  discount to fair value, I continue to see the ideal buy zone for the stock coming in at US 9.30 or lower. As shown above, this lines up with a strong support zone for the stock near the US 9.00 level.MAG Silver should see a year full of catalysts as it continues to drill three properties and will benefit from the highest years of production at Juanicipio now that it's an independently producing asset, with MAG likely to be at least a  8.5 million ounce silver producer in 2024  attributable basis . This will push the company ahead of peers like Endeavour Silver , SilverCrest Metals , with peak production of 20  million ounces of silver  8.8 million ounces attributable to MAG or  11 million attributable silver-equivalent ounces  SEOs . And with any worries finally in the rear-view mirror with Juanicipio operating independently, the stock should be able to re-rate once positive sentiment returns to the sector. That said, I prefer to buy hated stocks with a massive discount to fair value, and while MAG is out of favor and cheap, I see only a moderate margin of safety here. For this reason, I continue to focus elsewhere and would only get interested below US 9.30 with more attractive opportunities elsewhere.

Comstock Has A Strategic Advantage For Filling LNG Export Capacity,"Comstock , like all natural gas E Ps is facing tough comps going through 2023. I firmly expect this to be a short-term challenge as new LNG export capacity will be coming online through the QatarEnergy-Exxon JV for theOne of the strongest values Comstock brings to the table is their low cost of production. Their cost to operate a well sits at  1.14 Mcfe, 29  lower than their peer average. This low cost of production provides Comstock with a tremendous amount of safety when compared to their competitors, especially in times of low gasDespite the challenging gas market, Comstock is proactive and hedges roughly 40  of their book with an average floor of  2.99. This provided Comstock tremendous breathing room as gas prices dipped down to  2.06 mcf in April 2023, its lowest price since August 2020.As far as operations and capital investment, Comstock has been investing significantly into exploratory drilling and completion. As they re enhancing their properties in the Haynesville Bossier region, they ve invested  104mm into exploratory D C for the first 6 months of 2023, nearly 2.5x the investment from 2022. Unproved property acquisition more than doubled for the same time frame, suggesting further development is on the horizon in the coming years. This absolutely coincides with the expansion of LNG terminals in the Gulf Coast from 12MTPA to the additional 9Bcfe day of LNG export capacity to get to the 21Bcf day capacity by 2027.Until new capacity comes online, I m expecting Comstock s production volumes to remain relatively flat as natural gas . I think this is a strong strategy to build up their lease book now as prices are relatively low and complete new higher tier gas wells as new export capacity comes online. This will allow Comstock to fully capitalize on their property development as opposed to producing just to produce.Of course, the one aspect Comstock will need to keep in consideration is lease expiration, which could hinder their plan if pricing doesn t gravitate higher.Near-term, the next LNG terminal to come online is the QatarEnergy-Exxon   which should be coming online in late 2024. According to , Exxon will have rights to 30  of the export capacity once online. This project will add an additional 32mtpa in which Exxon will have rights to 8mtpa. Free capacity should come out to something like 3.20bcf day.Comstock is navigating through 2023 with challenging comps as their realized price for natural gas dropped 74  Y Y for Q2 23. Though natural gas has the tendency to have highly volatile prices, I believe Comstock s hedge book through 2024 should keep them relatively protected in the instance of a continued challenging market. Revenue for natural gas sales declined by -21  on a year-to-year basis using TTM figures. One asset that should bring more stability to Comstock s operations is their 145-mile pipeline service that they acquired FY22. Though this pipeline was acquired to transport their own natural gas out of the Haynesville Bossier basin, this pipeline gave Comstock the flexibility to market and transport other E P s natural gas. Overall, this feature accounts for 20  of the firm s revenue generation. EBITDA generated from gas service came out to be  44mm for Q2 23 on a TTM basis with an 8  margin.EBITDAX margin compressed a few points to 68  for Q2 23 on a TTM basis, down from 77  two quarters ago. Given the direction of natural gas from the start of q3 23 to where it presently sits, comps will remain challenging but look better on a sequential basis. I m not expecting much excitement in the natural gas E P space until the Golden Pass export terminal comes online in 2H24 or if a severe winter were to occur this year. Otherwise, it will be a waiting game.One of the values management brought to the table was the initiation of a quarterly dividend at the end of FY22. At this present price, the dividend pays an annual rate of  0.50 share for a yield of 4.75 . Though we cannot presume an increase to the dividend rate this next year, we may be able to expect a higher rate as LNG export additional capacity comes online, potentially leading to a stronger domestic natural gas market. Only time will tell if it makes sense for management to increase the dividend. The dividend payout ratio is a mere 14  which will provide management the cushion to maintain the dividend and potentially pay down debt.Speaking of debt, Comstock has a very low debt EBITDAX ratio of 1.11x with no maturities prior to 2029. Liquidity is strong at  1.5b so there should be minimal expectation of any cuts to the dividend. Given that management s leasing target is 90  full, this should also provide the flexibility for them to be opportunistic in acquiring additional leases in the Haynesville bossier basin. Management also voiced that their pipeline will run its necessary capacity throughout 2024 before any expansions are necessary. Personally, I like their conservative approach to growth  this gives me comfort in making an investment in the firm during a challenging market.On a comparable basis, CRK is pretty well priced with a 7  upside to meet the market average valuation. Though this upside is relatively limited today, the stock at my price target will still yield 12 , giving it a strong value for a value-oriented portfolio. My recommendation is a BUY with an  11.02 share price target going into the end of 1H24. I believe there is a lot more value to be unlocked with the additional LNG export capacity coming online in years to come.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

First Solar: Growing Capacity And A Growing Backlog Equals Growth,"First solar  was founded in 1990 and was incorporated in 1999. In 2002, they finished their first commercial production facility in Perrysburg, Ohio with the capacity to create 1.5 megawatts per year. Today, First Solar is the largest producer of solar panels inFirst Solar will be building their  for a cost of  1.1 billion located in Louisiana. Funding for this new facility is partly due to the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in August 2022. It is expected to come online in 2026 bringing 3.5 more gigawatts of manufacturing capacity per year adding to its existing 11.5 GW. Just this year alone, the company has made plans to spend an additional  1.7 billion at a new site in Alabama and by expanding a facility in Ohio.At current production levels, and with no new orders, the company has a backlog that will last until at least 2030. The slide below shows their backlog at different dates in the blue bars. And the green demonstrates how their backlog is growing throughout 2023. In other words, their order backlog is outpacing their ability to produce solar panels. This is an encouraging sign for investors.The following slide demonstrates the total opportunities that are available in the solar industry for First Solar to go out and get. This demonstrates that even though they have a backlog that will last until 2030, the potential to extend that backlog is also there.Currently, the subsidies that individuals can receive for installing  are up to 30  of the cost of the panels according to some sources. This is set to continue from 2023 all the way until 2032. This provides some strong visibility into the future demand for solar panels.In addition, First Solar was able to begin building a fifth plant using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act. And so we can see that the solar industry is subsidized on the capital funding side as well as on the demand side.I am not going to evaluate what percentage of First Solar's profit is dependent on subsidies in this article, but it is important to know that a certain percentage of both First Solar's demand and their capital investments are subsidized.I rarely like to invest in a business that requires subsidies from the US government or any government, however, many people have become fabulously wealthy by investing into government tax breaks, whether that be local or federal tax breaks. And so while I might shy away from companies like this, others might see this as an opportunity.Going forward, the question I will be interested in, is what will the economics of solar panels be when the subsidies run out in 2032  Will they be able to produce panels economically enough for subsidies to not be necessary  I don't know the answer, but I think that based on First Solar's backlog, they will have plenty of opportunities to find ways to make the panels more economical and with the full force of the climate-change narrative and the government funding backing the industry, I wouldn't expect First Solar's backlog to experience any kind of decline. So I would love nothing more than for the solar industry to be able to create energy that no longer requires subsidies. Time will tell.As of this writing, First Solar has a  20 billion market capitalization. So is this cheap or is this expensive relative to the performance of their current business  Let's measure this relative to operating cash flow.Here are the cash flows from operations for the past four years. With a  20 billion market cap, I believe First Solar is a little over-valued relative to these cash flows. I won't discuss their balance sheet in this article, but First Solar also has a strong balance sheet. The question is, will First Solar's cash flows grow dramatically over the coming years  They certainly have potential growth catalysts in that they are expanding their manufacturing facilities. For argument s sake, let's extrapolate that in 2024, First Solar will have Cash Flows From Operations of  1 Billion. Even then, at today's prices, you will be paying 20x for operating cash flows.Another question one might ask is, why is cash flow from operations so  lumpy  For example, through the first half of 2023, cash flows from operations were negative. Why  One of the reasons cash flows are so lumpy is because any time an industry is subsidized, cash flows will continue to be sporadic because receivables will tend to stack up and then get paid all at once.For example, through the first half of 2023, First Solar's net income was  213 million. However, on their cash flow statement, they have the following deductions which caused cash flow from operations to be negative. Most of these are receivables and although I didn't do a deep dive into the footnotes to understand what these receivables precisely are, we can clearly see that some of it is related to subsidies in the form of  grants.  This is one of the caveats to investing in this industry. First, cash flow as well as capital costs are, to a certain extent, subsidized and therefore, cash flows might behave in a staggered fashion.For further guidance, here is the company's guidance through the end of 2023.Simply put, First Solar is going to grow larger than they are right now. I know that is a profound statement but the point I want to make is that I wouldn't invest in something just because it's going to grow. Yes, the business is on solid footing thanks to a really strong backlog of work that at its current production capacity will last to 2030 and likely beyond. There are a lot of new projects that they have the potential to win by 2030 as well. And with  3 billion in capital projects in process in order to expand their manufacturing capacity, this creates opportunities for growing income. And last but not least, the United States government has chosen to heavily subsidize their industry.However, the subsidization that this industry receives is also one of the drawbacks. I expect their cash flows to continue to be lumpy, until their industry is self-sustaining without so many subsidies. Do I think it will eventually get there  Yes, I do, but it isn't there right now. And perhaps one can make the argument that for that reason, this presents a good time to buy.Lastly, when deciding what to invest in, it must be a relative comparison. In other words, to invest in one thing is to say NO to investing in another. And so although I think your capital can grow by investing in First Solar today, there are other investments that I believe present a better opportunity. And therefore, I can only rate First Solar a HOLD.In case you haven't read my other articles, I am . My bullish timeline is for at least the next 6-7 years, as I believe the industry is positioned much better than the solar industry. The oil industry is much more established and the net gains from the energy provided by hydrocarbons is greater than that provided by solar. Because of this, many of the oil and gas companies pay attractive dividends with strong balance sheets and predictable cash flows. Not to mention, companies like   are valued more fairly relative to operating cash flows.And when comparing one form of energy  solar  to another form of energy  oil   gas , I want to position myself with the one that performs the best without government subsidies. In an inflationary or stagflationary environment, I do not believe solar will perform as well as hydrocarbons.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Should You Be Worried About Medical Properties Trust's Liquidity Profile?,"  is expected to have a tough liquidity position in the coming quarters, plus its refinancing needs in the next three years are quite worrisome.As I've , I have been bearish on MPW overWhile MPW has recently cut in half its dividend, I still see its dividend as unsustainable and expect a liquidity crunch in the near future, if management don't take actions to improve its cash position. Regarding this last issue I've received some pushback, thus in this article I analyze in moreAs I've , I see MPW's investment case highly geared to its high-dividend yield, but this represents a cash burn that the company does not have capacity to sustain over the long term. , its cash outflow related to dividend payments amounted to nearly  700 million, and after its dividend cut its annual outflow is around  360 million.While this represents a lower cash burn for MPW, its organic cash flow over the past six months was rather weak, given that its cash flow from operations was only  212 million and capital expenditures amounted to some  180 million. Therefore, free cash flow was only  32 million in the first half of 2023, clearly not enough to cover its historical dividend payments  350 million in H1 2023  and outflows expected in the coming quarters  some  75 million per quarter .Looking at the company's cash flow statement, MPW has financed its dividend in the past few quarters through asset sales and borrowings, an unsustainable situation over the long term. While its cash position at the end of last June enables it to pay the reduced quarterly dividend from cash on hand, this situation will change dramatically next December.Indeed, MPW's cash balance was  329 million , while its quarterly dividend payment amount to some  75 million. Therefore, its next quarterly dividend expected to be paid next October is not an issue, but MPW has a significant cash outflow next December related to a sterling bond.Its  400 million bond matures on December 5, 2023, which at current exchange rate leads to an outflow of nearly  500 million. While MPW does not have enough cash to pay this debt, this doesn't mean it will go bankrupt next December, given that it can continue to borrow from its revolving credit facility with  .According to Bloomberg data, this revolving credit facility has a total approved amount of  1.8 billion, of which MPW already has used more than  1.2 billion. Therefore, MPW will need to borrow an additional amount during Q4 to pay down its sterling bond and maintain some cash on hand, more likely will borrow the remaining amount of  589 million available.I think this is the most likely outcome to refinance this bond because MPW's current bonds are trading with very high credit spreads, leading to current yields between 12-14  depending on the maturity date. Even for more short-dated bonds, with maturities in 2026 and 2027, current yields are around these levels, which make it practically impossible to refinance in the capital markets due to prohibitive costs and likely low appetite of credit investors for new bonds.Taking into account that MPW's organic cash flow generation after dividend payments has been negative in recent quarters, I expect MPW's cash position at the end of the year to be around  300 million, assuming that it will use its revolving credit facility in full to refinance the upcoming bond maturity.In 2024, MPW had a significant loan reaching maturity in Australian dollars, but it has reached a few months ago a deal to sell some assets, enabling it to repay in full the related AUD loans. Therefore, during 2024, the company now only has a sterling term loan to pay, amounting to some  130 million.Assuming a cash position of  300 million by end-2023, this means MPW will run out of cash during 2024, if management does not take action to improve its liquidity profile. Moreover, while during 2024 debt maturities are not really concerning, during 2025 it has more than  1.4 billion in loan and bond maturities, being a big issue to address. In 2026, it has loans and bonds maturing with a total amount of about  2.8 billion, being even more worrisome.This means that MPW can handle its short-term liquidity issues by doing asset sales, plus raising some borrowings even if at a high cost, but in the next three years it has some  4.2 billion to refinance, which is a considerable amount, representing some 41  of its total debt.Therefore, while its liquidity position is not great and I expect it to face some issues in the coming quarters, if it does not find alternative financing sources, this does not necessarily means it will enter bankruptcy in the near term.For instance, if MPW uses in full its revolving credit facility, JPMorgan will have an exposure at default of some  1.8 billion, which is relevant even for a large bank like JPMorgan. To give some context, JPMorgan's provisions for loan losses amounted to nearly  6.4 billion in 2022, thus having a single exposure defaulting by  1.8 billion is a significant hit for the bank. Therefore, if MPW gets into a tight liquidity position, JPMorgan may have some incentive to continue financing MPW instead of letting it fail.Nevertheless, at this point, MPW much likely will only be able to get secured loans from the bank, for which it will use its properties as collateral. This should not be a problem given that MPW has about 440 properties valued at more than  19 billion, more than enough to use as collateral for new loans.Taking into account MPW's expected cash outflows over the next few quarters related to dividends and loan maturities, plus the fact that is operations are generating enough cash flow to finance this outflows, raising new loans or selling assets will be key for MPW to show that it will not face a liquidity crunch over the next six to nine months. Until the company does that, I think investors should stay away of its shares, as further decline is possible when the market starts to really worry about MPW's liquidity issues.Medical Properties Trust's organic cash flow generation after dividend payments is quite limited and its available financing sources are running out, putting the company in a potential difficult liquidity position over the next six to nine months. While MPW's share price has declined significantly over the past eighteen months and its  is low compared to its peers, this seems to be justified by the company's fundamental issues and remains a stock to avoid.

Better High Yield Buy: Enterprise Products Partners Or Energy Transfer?,"Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners  are some of the most popular midstream stocks on Seeking Alpha and for good reason. Both offerIn the past, we have held both of these securities, but since launching our portfolio in December 2020 we have greatly preferred  and outsized  ET given its much cheaper valuation. That move has paid off tremendously as ET has delivered phenomenal total returns that have significantly outpaced EPD's over that period of timeEPD is often considered to have a better business model than ET has, especially when factoring in management. After all, EPD's returns on invested capital have consistently outpaced ET's by several hundred basis points over the yearsMoreover, EPD boasts a quarter century track record of growing its distribution each year whereas ET halved its distribution three years ago.As a result, it may come as a bit of a surprise to find that ET has actually outperformed EPD over the period of time that they both have been publicly tradedThat being said, let's look at the underlying asset portfolios of each of these MLPs.EPD boasts a highly diversified portfolio of assets spread across a broad geographical footprint. It also benefits from economies of scale with an enterprise value of nearly  87 billion. This scale and diversification give EPD numerous avenues for lucrative investments in organic growth projects and potential acquisitions.EPD provides midstream energy services to both natural gas and natural gas liquids producers and consumers, as well as those in the crude oil, petrochemical, and refined products industries. The company is structured into four distinct segments  NGL Pipelines   Services, Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, and Petrochemical   Refined Products Services.Within the NGL Pipelines   Services segment, Enterprise offers natural gas processing services and related NGL marketing services. They operate natural gas processing facilities in various locations, including Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming. Additionally, this segment manages NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, storage facilities for NGLs and related products, and NGL marine terminals.The Crude Oil Pipelines   Services segment handles the operation of crude oil pipelines and storage facilities, including a fleet of 245 tractor-trailer tank trucks used for crude oil transportation. This segment is also involved in crude oil marketing activities.The Natural Gas Pipelines   Services segment focuses on operating natural gas pipeline systems for the gathering, treatment, and transportation of natural gas. It also leases underground salt dome natural gas storage facilities in Napoleonville, Louisiana, owns an underground salt dome storage cavern in Wharton County, Texas, and engages in natural gas marketing.In the Petrochemical   Refined Products Services segment, EPD operates facilities for propylene fractionation, butane isomerization, deisobutanizer operations, octane enhancement, and high purity isobutylene production. This segment is also responsible for managing refined products pipelines and terminals, ethylene export terminals, and provides services related to refined products marketing and marine transportation.ET, meanwhile, also has a very diverse and geographically well distributed portfolio of midstream infrastructure assets and businesses. It also has enormous scale and is in fact even larger than EPD, with a nearly  106 billion enterprise value.ET owns and operates around 11,600 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines, five natural gas storage facilities in Texas and Oklahoma, and 19,945 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines. Furthermore, ET manages natural gas gathering, natural gas liquid pipelines, processing plants, and treatment facilities across multiple states, including Texas, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Louisiana. Additionally, it oversees natural gas gathering systems and oil pipelines in South Texas, a natural gas gathering system in Ohio, and provides water transportation to natural gas producers in Pennsylvania. ET also owns and operates approximately 5,650 miles of NGL pipelines, NGL fractionation facilities, NGL storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 58 million barrels, along with other NGL storage assets and terminals totaling about 25 million barrels in storage capacity.ET also has a track record of making fairly substantial acquisitions in an effort to accretively scale its business and strengthen its competitive positioning. Most recently, it announced that it would be acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners , which should be immediately accretive to DCF per unit upon closing, be credit neutral, drive future synergies to further enhance the DCF per unit accretion, extend ET's value chain in key basins, increase its exposure to fee-based margin businesses, and add additional long-term contracted assets with investment grade counterparties. As the graphic below illustrates, ET's portfolio is very large, reaching the key basins across the United States while also benefiting significantly from the growth in LNG exports.Both businesses also generate the vast majority of their income from commodity price resistant fee-based contracts, with ET generating  90  of its adjusted EBITDA from fee-based contracts and  80  of EPD's adjusted EBITDA coming from fee-based contracts. This makes them very stable cash flow generators regardless of broader market conditions and explains why EPD in particular has been able to grow its distribution so consistently in the face of major economic downturns and oil price crashes.A final important note is that EPD insiders own nearly one-third of their partnership while ET insiders own  11  of their partnership. While EPD's insiders are even more aligned with unitholders than ET insiders are, it suffices to say that both firms are closely aligned with unitholders, especially because ET's founder and Executive Chairman - Kelcy Warren - holds the majority of his net worth in ET units and continues to buy more quite aggressively over time. Moreover, ET's two co-CEOs are required to hold 6x their annual base salary in ET units.When it comes to balance sheet, EPD is the clear winner here.ET has made significant progress in recent years on its balance sheet, paying down billions of dollars in debt, bringing the leverage ratio down to within management's target range of 4.0x-4.5x, and even earning a credit rating upgrade to BBB from S P. Clearly, ET's balance sheet is quite solid and in little risk of near-term financial challenges.That being said, EPD has also brought its leverage ratio down to  3.0x - one of the lowest marks in the entire industry - and earned a credit rating upgrade from S P this year to A-, which is the best credit rating in the entire midstream industry. It also has  4 billion in total liquidity, nearly enough to cover all maturities between now and 2027. Moreover, its weighted average term to maturity of 19.7 years  82  of its debt matures in 10 years or more and 51  of its debt matures in 30 years or more  and the fact that 96.7  of its debt is at fixed rates  4.6  weighted average interest rate  means that it is set up to compound unitholder equity at high spreads to its cost of capital for decades to come.Moving forward, both EPD and ET have attractive distribution outlooks.First and foremost, despite their hefty payouts, both distributions look to be very safe. Based on consensus analyst estimates, ET's 2023 distributable cash flow is expected to cover its distribution by 1.95x while EPD's 2023 distributable cash flow is expected to cover its distribution by 1.74x.Through 2027, analysts expect ET to grow its distribution at a 4.3  CAGR, which is in-line with management's 3-5  CAGR guidance range. Meanwhile, analysts are guiding for a  5  CAGR in EPD's distribution in the coming years, which is in-line with management's recent distribution growth rate over the past few years.While ET's coverage ratio is currently stronger than EPD's, EPD's stronger balance sheet gives it more flexibility in returning capital to unitholders, helping to drive its stronger anticipated growth rate in the coming years. Moreover, ET's management is likely going to be spending more aggressively on growth projects than EPD will be. Given EPD's historically superior returns on invested capital relative to ET's, this should not be a problem for them as they do not need to invest as much capital in order to generate similar growth rates as ET.When it comes to valuation, both stocks look undervalued right nowBoth ET and EPD trade at meaningful discounts to their historical average EV EBITDA ratios, with both ET and EPD trading at a 7.4  discount to their respective historical EV EBITDA ratio. ET, meanwhile, trades at a steep P DCF discount to EPD, reflecting its substantially greater leverage as well as its lower EV EBITDA valuation. As a result, it is unsurprising to see it trading at a higher distribution yield.Both of these midstream businesses are high quality, operating well right now, and enjoy strong balance sheets after several years of prudent deleveraging efforts as well as moves to improve distribution coverage ratios. Both are also moving into a phase where steady distribution growth should be the norm.Yet, despite these obvious strengths and their defensive quality in a weakening economic environment, they both continue to appear undervalued. While ET offers the greatest total return potential given its greater leverage and cheaper valuation, EPD has considerably less risk given its lower leverage, higher credit rating, and superior long-term returns on invested capital.Overall, we like both of these midstream infrastructure businesses equally from a risk-reward standpoint and rate them both Buys right now.

Kinder Morgan: A Premium Worth Paying,"If you are looking for an incredibly diverse energy play with a solid dividend that is also increasing each year the KMI looks very good right now. The share price has had a couple of bumpy lastThe long-term looks bullish for commodities like both oil and natural gas as the percentage of energy generated from them is still very large. Even if investments increase each year into renewables I think KMI can deliver a significant ROI for investors still. Despite trading at a premium to the sector based on earnings, I find the premium worthwhile to pay given the quality of the dividend and the asset base KMI has. This of course results in me rating KMI a buy currently.Kinder Morgan  stands as a prominent energy infrastructure giant within North America, holding the distinction of being the largest energy infrastructure company in the S P 500 index. The company operates within the midstream energy sector, boasting a substantial network of approximately 82,000 miles of pipelines, 140 terminals, and a significant storage capacity of 700 billion cubic feet for working natural gas. This extensive infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the energy supply chain, facilitating the efficient transport and storage of crucial resources.The company has managed to gather a massive amount of which has made them a leader and almost market mover in the natural gas space. KMI's vast pipeline network transports a diverse range of essential products, including natural gas, refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil condensate, CO2, and various other valuable commodities. Furthermore, the company's versatile terminals play a crucial role in storing and managing a wide spectrum of goods, encompassing gasoline, diesel fuel, renewable fuel feedstocks, chemicals, ethanol, metals, and petroleum coke.This diverse set of exposure is perhaps where some investors are discouraged but some are also encouraged. What I mean by this is that KMI may not see the same immediate and rapid impact of rising commodity prices as a more pure-play natural gas company may. On the other hand, though, KMI is more protected against downside risk in my opinion as the diversified nature of the business lends itself to some price hedging.One of the key features of KMI is its setup with cash flows. The company has an FCF margin of 8.87  right now which is right around where the 5-year average has been as well. As seen in the picture above, KMI has managed to establish a predictable set of cash flows as 61  of it is made of take-or-pay.The for KMI continues to be a highlight in my opinion. The company has an FWD yield of 6.62  and that is sufficient to yield a strong ROI for investors, especially when combined with general share appreciation from growing the EPS of the business. The natural gas prices have come down quite a lot as we know, but I think the trend forward is upwards. The of Mexico's imports of natural gas is adding momentum to the price I think. Even though KMI has a very high payout ratio the company still managed to improve its financial position. Back in 2016, the company had a net debt position of  38 billion, but this has since decreased to  31 billion instead.The world population is continuously increasing and this is putting pressure on the energy outputs as well. Natural gas and oil remain to be very viable sources of it. In the coming couple of decades, I think that they will remain in a dominant position in energy generation. The capital necessary to switch them out to renewables is incredibly high and the material costs and amount of work are too high to make possible in a short period. This means the market is still appealing to invest in as demand will be persistent.Looking at hydrocarbons in applications like cement, steel, and fertilizer they are irreplaceable. Seeing as these are materials and commodities widely used in our societies they will likely remain in high demand. A rising population is also bringing a higher need for housing. That should bring up demand for commodities like cement and steel, which in turn raises demand for hydrocarbons, ultimately benefiting companies like KMI.Some investors may perceive a challenge with KMI due to its diversified business portfolio. This diversification means that KMI may not be able to concentrate its efforts on a specific sector or region for focused expansion. For those seeking a more specialized or pure-play investment, KMI might not be the most suitable option.Significant risks for KMI include the potential impact of low commodity prices, which can lead to reduced oil and gas drilling activity. Moreover, persistently high-interest rates can increase the cost of undertaking new projects, impacting KMI's operations. Additionally, competition from foreign markets for LNG and refined exports poses another risk factor for the company's profitability. I think however that as we are heading into the colder months of the year, the prices of these commodities will rise as they often due. In terms of natural gas prices, I think it's unlikely we see a rapid return to where they were in 2022. The war in Ukraine made the gas market incredibly vulnerable and there were a lot of uncertainties which resulted in the price shooting up the way it did.I think this article has made it quite clear that I like KMI and the value that can be extracted right now. The share price is trading at a 47  premium based on earnings. On a p b basis though, KMI has a discount of 25  right now. I find the dividend possible to be maintained and the long-term fundamental demand for natural gas should drive higher earnings for KMI.The share price is down on a 12-month basis and I think investors compounding a position in KMI right now will do very well over the long term, possibly yielding a return far higher than the rest of the markets. If it's not clear, I am rating KMI a buy right now and look positively on the next several decades of operations for it   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"This Is No Time For Celebration, The Oil Rally Is Just Getting Started","In our WCTW this Monday, we wrote that the oil market  is not prepared for what's coming. The U.S. has, in essence, bailed out the rest of the world from an oil supply shortage, but that is about to comeWe are already seeing eye-popping backwardation, and there's more to come.If you thought March April 2022 was bad, you haven't seen the real thing yet. We are talking about real supply cuts this time, not some fantasy potential supply drop.What makes this time even more beautiful is that theAnd similar to the path the IEA took when Russia invaded Ukraine telling the world that Russian oil production would fall by  3 million b d, this time around, it is preaching the exact opposite  ample supply.But as the title of this OMF suggests, this is no time for celebration, this is no time for pats on the back, because this is only just getting started.Our latest U.S. crude storage forecast shows non-existent crude builds during refinery maintenance season. We have one last rush of U.S. crude exports and that's it. U.S. crude storage will likely stay flat to higher into year-end because U.S. crude exports will fall. This is what we expect and the end result is a much tighter global oil market environment.So for readers trying to stay ahead of the curve, please do not expect U.S. commercial crude storage to fall well below  400 million bbls. We are already tight and so the market will force relief one way or another.One of the bear factors was demand, but demand is holding up well. Unlike some of the bulls argue, we don't see demand as being robust, but it's not terrible like the bears are claiming. Refining margins will continue to remain under pressure as crude tightness gets even tighter. Bears will point to falling refining margins as a sign of demand weakness, when in reality, it's just crude tightness.Oil, in the meantime, will continue to climb the wall of worries. Recession, high interest rates, lower refining margins, OPEC  spare capacity, all of these things will prevent people from seeing the bigger picture, and that's that the marginal supply has all but peaked.And the U.S., being the largest growth in supply over the last decade, is all but on its last leg. The oil market is firmly in the hands of the Saudis and they can do however they please going forward.So this is no time for celebration because it's only just getting started. Buckle up, extreme tightness in the physical market is coming.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, .  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks.

Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,"  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States, boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nation.This has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently, however. As regular readers may recall, we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices, although that is almost certainly a factor. As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks, the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience. Investors are no longer willing to wait years  or decades  to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios. In today s high-rate environment, their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now. Energy Transfer currently boasts an 8.84  yield, so it certainly meets this requirement. In fact, this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the S P 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index .This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves, however. Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense today.As stated in the introduction, Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States, boasting a network of pipelines, storage facilities, natural gas liquids fractionators, natural gas processing plants, and terminals. The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant. Overall, its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states, although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific Coast.This is not especially surprising, as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California. This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state. As a result, there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state, and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a result.As mentioned earlier, it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfer s units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices. This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfer s unit price since August 3, 2023We can obviously see a correlation here, as the two charts move almost in lockstep. However, Energy Transfer s cash flows have very little to do with oil prices. As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90  of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA  a proxy for pre-tax cash flow  will come from these volume-based contractsThus, the company s financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers, not their value. As such, its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices. We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the company s adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years. In particular, the average price of West Texas Intermediate was  39.68 per barrel in 2020,  68.17 per barrel in 2021, and  94.53 per barrel in 2022. The year-to-date average for 2023 is  77.90 per barrel and Energy Transfer s annualized adjusted EBITDA is  13.110 billion. Thus, we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the company s adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believe.With that said, there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do. After all, there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices. However, as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Profits in Dividends, it is unlikely that this will be the case. As the Wall Street Journal I pointed this out in a few articles published over the past two years in various shale companies as well. Basically, due to investor complaints about the industry s underperformance over most of the past decade, shale companies are largely opting to simply keep their production stable and pay out the majority of their cash flows to investors. Thus, it is unlikely that Energy Transfer s volumes will increase substantially due to shale producers increasing their output along with energy prices.This does not mean that Energy Transfer has no near-term to mid-term growth opportunities, just that the company will probably not see the volume growth that the market expects. For example, there are still significant growth opportunities in the natural gas space, as energy producers are constructing an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas production capacity over the next few years. Indeed, the nation s consumption of natural gas is expected to increase by 20 billion cubic feet per day by 2027, approximately 14 billion cubic feet of which comes from new liquefied natural gas production facilities that are scheduled to come online over the periodEnergy Transfer is engaged in some growth projects to take advantage of this situation. For example, the company stated recently that it is investigating the possibility of constructing a new natural gas processing plant in the Permian Basin due to strong customer demand.This is in addition to the 200 million cubic feet-per-day Bear processing plant that the company brought online in June. The company also has a number of natural gas pipelines under construction that are meant to increase its ability to meet the growing demand for natural gas domestically, as numerous utilities are replacing coal power plants with renewables supplemented by natural gas plants.After all, wind and solar are not capable of meeting electric demand on their own with current technology  and batteries are nowhere near sufficient to provide sufficient backup capacity . It is fortunate that Energy Transfer is reasonably well diversified and has long had a substantial presence in the natural gas space to allow it to take advantage of this growth potential. Indeed, as we can see here, the company s cash flows are quite well diversified between crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquidsMost of its forward growth will almost certainly come from the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments, but that is okay as the company should still have much greater growth potential than some other midstream companies that exclusively focus on crude oil or refined products.Energy Transfer could soon increase its presence in the natural gas space significantly by acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners . The company  on August 16, 2023, that it is planning to acquire Crestwood Equity Partners in an all-stock deal. From the press releaseAs of right now, Crestwood Equity Partners  common units are trading at  28.60 each and Energy Transfer s units are at  14.06 per share. Thus, the proposed ratio assigns a value of  29.10 to Crestwood s common units. That is a 1.75  premium today, which is not really much, but the premium was higher when this deal was announced.This deal will certainly enhance Energy Transfer s capabilities in the Bakken Shale, as Crestwood Equity Partners is one of the largest midstream operators in that region. Crestwood Equity Partners also has a gathering and processing business in the Powder River Basin, which is an area in which Energy Transfer currently has no presence at allEnergy Transfer, meanwhile, has the takeaway capacity and long-haul pipelines that Crestwood Equity Partners lacks. Overall, I can certainly understand why Energy Transfer wants to do this deal. Ultimately, it could work out quite well for the company as it allows the combined firm to offer a  one-stop service  for customers in the Bakken Shale. Crestwood s substantial gathering and processing operation in that region can handle that need for the customers and then Energy Transfer s long-haul pipelines can move it to where it is needed.As separate entities, neither company can offer both services to customers. Crestwood Equity Partners is also more natural gas-focused than Energy Transfer, so this acquisition should weight Energy Transfer s business a bit more towards gas. As that is where the strongest growth is, that is certainly a positive thing.Unlike my rather scathing  on ONEOK s  acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners, this one has some clear synergy and will probably benefit Energy Transfer. The only real downside for Crestwood Equity Partners unitholders is that Energy Transfer has a lower yield so they could lose some income. Hopefully, Energy Transfer s growth will be stimulated enough by this acquisition that it can raise its distribution to compensate for the loss, but that is not certain. For the most part, though, this deal should work out to the benefit of both parties.As I pointed out in my previous article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer has been slowly seeing its interest expenses tick up recently, although it has not been nearly as bad as companies in some other areas of the economy. We can see this hereAs we can clearly see, the company s training twelve-month interest expenses have been gradually ticking up over the past few years, although it has only been a relatively slow increase. Certainly, this is a less worrying trend than we have seen among utilities or a few other sectors. One of the biggest reasons for this is that the market has not been friendly towards midstream companies for quite some time, and Energy Transfer started focusing on strengthening its balance sheet following the COVID-19 pandemic. We still see that the company s interest expenses have been trending up, however. Thus, we should not ignore the company s balance sheet.One metric that we can use to evaluate a company s financial structure is its net debt-to-equity ratio. As of June 30, 2023, Energy Transfer had a net debt of  48.632 billion compared to  41.457 billion of partners  equity. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.17. Here is how that compares to some of the company s peersAs we can see here, Energy Transfer compares quite well to its peers in this respect. In particular, MPLX, which has long been one of the best-financed companies in the midstream sector, actually employs more leverage than Energy Transfer. This is a clear sign that Energy Transfer is not employing too much leverage right now.As I have pointed out in various articles, a midstream company s ability to carry its debt is much more important than its overall financial structure. The usual way that we judge that is by looking at the company s leverage ratio, which is also known as the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. During the twelve-month period that ended on June 30, 2023, Energy Transfer had an adjusted EBITDA of  13.080 billion.This compares to a total debt of  48.962 billion as of June 30, 2023. That gives the company a leverage ratio of 3.74x, which is very reasonable. As I have pointed out before, Wall Street analysts usually consider anything below 5.0x to be reasonable. However, most companies have been working to reduce their leverage since the crash in energy prices in 2020. As such, most midstream companies now have a leverage ratio that is below 4.0x, which is the maximum level that I typically like to see. As we can clearly see, Energy Transfer easily meets this criterion.When we consider that the company s net debt-to-equity ratio compares reasonably well to its peers and that its leverage ratio is very attractive, we can quickly see that the company enjoys a very strong balance sheet. There is really not very much for us to worry about here. The company s finances are quite strong.In conclusion, Energy Transfer continues to be a good holding for those investors who desire to earn a high level of income from their portfolios while still enjoying some growth potential. Admittedly, it is somewhat unlikely that the nation s upstream energy producers will deliver growth that is anywhere close to what some market participants expect, but there are still sufficient opportunities in the natural gas space for Energy Transfer to deliver volume growth.The pending acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners is interesting, and it should significantly enhance Energy Transfer LP s potential to deliver natural gas midstream growth to the unitholders. The company continues to maintain relatively strong finances and pays a very attractive 8.84  distribution yield. Overall, this company looks like a very solid purchase today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Exxon Mobil: Artificially Inflated,"As   takes on the all-time highs from earlier this year, investors need to remember that oil is at far lower prices now and the world has plenty of supply. The energy giant just printed aWTI crude  CL1.COM  spent most of Q2 trading in the mid- 70 range. When looking at the 5-year chart, oil is trading far above the levels prior to the Russian invasion in early 2022.The Saudis have led an OPEC charge this year to raise prices by cutting oil production. The country just announced plans to keep the  of 1 million barrels per dayThis cut was on top of additional cuts of 1.66 million barrels per day by OPEC members. According to  from Platts and J.P. Morgan, the current spare oil capacity from OPEC  countries tops 4 million barrels per day and nearly matches the highest levels since at least 2000 outside of the initial Covid demand dip in 2020.With Brent back to  94, our view is that oil prices have an upside to possibly  100. At a triple-digit price, the Saudis are likely pressured back onto the market after publicly stating a need for only  85 b in order to fund the government.As the above chart highlighted, the world doesn't lack spare capacity. Oil prices are only surging due to OPEC  keeping supply artificially low.Exxon Mobil reported  just over a month ago, providing investors key insights to what normalized earnings look like now after the Russian invasion of Ukraine no longer impacts prices. In addition, the energy giant has cost cuts amounting to an estimated  9 billion since 2019.The company only earned  1.94 per share during the June quarter. The EPS missed analyst estimates by  0.08 and was nearly  1 per share below the prior quarter's level of  2.83 and far below the peak profits.Exxon Mobil provides this handy chart highlighting how Q2 margins were more within the norm of the 10-year average margins, especially for crucial crude and natural gas prices and refining margins. The only segment with below historically normal margins is the Chemical segment.The key dilemma is how to value the stock going forward. Exxon Mobil has an annualized EPS below  8 per share, making a  120 stock price very expensive at over 15x earnings run rate.Analysts have a 2024 EPS target at nearly  9 for a forward P E multiple of 13x. This EPS target appears more in line with current market prices for oil and natural gas.The real risk to investors is that oil prices have been elevated for 18 months now. The risk is for a cycle of lower oil prices, similar to natural gas now.Considering the spare capacity, oil prices could fall below  70 b and into at least the low  60 b similar to back in 2019. Exxon Mobil would start reporting even lower earnings, knowing the 2019 EPS was only  2 per share.The company has  4 billion shares outstanding, suggesting the  9 billion in cost savings would in theory add another  2 to EPS potential from the 2019 EPS level. Exxon Mobil would have a  4 earning potential based on 2019 energy prices, assuming all of the cost cuts weren't replaced by additional spending in other categories.The key investor takeaway is that  120 appears the peak price for Exxon Mobil Corporation. The stock is fully valued for elevated oil prices and the risk is now to the downside knowing that oil ultimately ends up at much lower prices over the next cycle.Investors should cash out at current levels and look for a better entry level when OPEC  no longer has the ability to freely cut output to push oil prices higher.Stone Fox Capital  aka Mark Holder  is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

Sibanye Stillwater Hopes To Offer A Metal Mosaic,"Sibanye Stillwater  is a South African metals company with hopes of significant expansion in the next 5 years. Through investment in both recycling and production initiatives globally, SBSW hopes to become a linchpin in the global metals market.Given its rising demand, significant investments in battery metals, especially Lithium, are critical for future growth. While electric vehicles are gaining popularity, a mix, including hybrids, will dominate the next decade, still providing tailwinds to PGM recycling and PGM mining businesses. SBSW will spend an estimated  500 million in FY23 on these expansion initiatives.Despite the challenges faced by SBSW in the short term, the company shows promising potential for long-term growth.EFV  Estimated Fair Value    E24 EPS  Earnings Per Share  times PE  Price EPSEFV   E24 EPS X P E    1.0 X 9.7   9.70P 2E PGM, containing Pt  Platinum  and Pd  Palladium , 3PGM contains Pt  Platinum  Pd  Palladium  and Rhodium  Rd . 3E is 2E plus gold. 4E is 3PGM plus gold.PGMs are not rare-earth metals, but are critical in numerous industrial components, particularly in the hydrogen and emissions management space. While fully-electric battery EVs receive the most attention, a mix of EVs, including hybrids, are needed to fulfil demand within the next decade. Light vehicle production climbs to 82.5 million units per year in FY23. The PGM market is expected to see significant demand recovery linked with the Chinese auto sales rebound expected in FY23. still originate from Russia, and there is still some uncertainty about Russia's place in the global economy. While much of Russia's PGM capacity remains unsanctioned, that could change and further affect the supply and demand dynamics of the market.American PGM operations are still ramping up, with SBSW ramping production to 700koz of 2E PGM by 2027. Short-term sustaining costs have surged amid regional flooding and a shaft collapse which caused a work stoppage, which will resume in 2H23. SBSW states this is temporary and expects leveling off of AISC by FY26 of under  990 oz. SBSW expects the American PGM segment to return to full profitability in late FY23 or in FY24 when all in sustaining costs return to normalized levels.The South African PGM operation is the largest segment by revenue and is considered mature. Currently, the segment has 4 active mines and 3 exploration operations. Expansion in this segment includes the K4 expansion to Marikana, South Africa facility. This will add 50 years of output, at an estimated 250koz per year, once full capacity is reached in FY29.SBSW PGM cost relative to peers. SBSW is highlighted in Blue.Before the acquisition of Stillwater, Sibanye was an exclusive gold producer. SBSW still seeks to streamline its operations in this area, acquiring a controlling stake in DRDGOLD   a tailings management company. SBSW will close underperforming mines to reduce capital costs and make room for new greenfield expansion. After FY23, SBSW expects the capital requirements to significantly decrease for the Gold segment, amounting to  54.7 million annually in savings due to these streamlining actions.Gold production for FY23 is expected to produce 756-788koz at an all-in sustaining cost of  1826 oz. The average realized price for 2Q23 for gold was  1864 oz.Expansion in this area is the Burnstone project, believed to be able to output 141koz per year at full capacity in FY25. Existing local infrastructure significantly reduces startup costs, with the first production output expected in 2H23. DRDGOLD is a tailings management company recovering residue metals from waste from the mine. It has a far lower sustaining cost of  1,528 oz with an annual output of 179koz. This portfolio addition could increase cash flow by  55 million per year at full production capacity in FY25.The battery metals segment encompasses Nickel, Copper, and Lithium operations. SBSW seeks to create a raw materials presence closest to regional United States and Europe ecosystems.In Finland, a concentrated 7 mine facility has been approved for mining and broke ground in March of FY23. SBSW has a 79  controlling interest in the operation and hopes to achieve 15,000 metric tons annually in FY25. The facility is concentrated on a deposit of Lithium Hydroxide which demands a price premium compared to Lithium Carbonate. The reason is extracting and refining Lithium Hydroxide is much more expensive. The current price assumption for the 15-year life of the mine is  26,034 per metric ton, with an average operating cost of  7,423 per metric ton in all in sustaining costs. Total capital expenditure, less sustaining capital, is expected to be  650 million. This has the chance to be a highly profitable venture in a strategic area close to numerous battery factories in Europe.The Sandouville Nickel Refinery was acquired with 100  controlling interest in FY22. The facility is designed to refine 16,000 tons of nickel and 600 tons of Cobalt. This location is strategically close to a site set to be France's first gigafactory, built and operated by Verkor in a partnership with Renault. SBSW invested  27.5 million in the gigafactory as well.Rhyolite Ridge in the United States is a lithium-boron project in Nevada. The project has a nameplate capacity of 22,000 metric tons annually, assuming an average price of  13,000 per metric ton for Lithium and  710 per metric ton for Boron. SBSW has pledged to contribute funding in exchange for 50  interest conditional to permitting approval. The permitting environment for lithium exploration has become more favorable in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, with the Department of Energy offering a loan of  700 million. The project has attracted large names, including the Toyota and Panasonic JV, Ford, and South Korean battery maker Eco Pro. Ford has committed to take 35  of production from FY25-FY30.The top two risks facing SBSW in the short term are labor disputes and South African power infrastructure.Numerous disruptions in FY22 caused by South African workers protesting poor working conditions and low wages. While these have settled, SBSW could be at risk of disruption again once the contract is up for renegotiation in FY25.The South African power company ESKOM has been plagued with fuel supply problems, sabotage, and aging components. This has caused them to embark on a program of  load shedding,  turning off power after peak hours. Mining, smelting, and refining consume roughly 30  of ESKOM's net power output. Thus, ESKOM, on top of load shedding, has increased power prices by 20 . In the medium term, ESKOM will remain a primary power supplier to the SA Mining segments. ESKOM expects load shedding to ramp up through FY23, which could result in 15  production losses. At the end of FY24, SBSW expects enough private-sector electricity generation to eliminate load shedding for the mining industry. To this effect, SBSW has acquired the largest solar farm in South Africa, set to enter initial production in FY25 with 89MW in nameplate capacity.Underpinning these is ongoing political instability in South Africa. While SBSW is quickly diversifying out of South Africa, it is still a South African company. We will likely see some form of price action after the .Lithium demand will grow by . There will be a 55  gap between supply and demand for Lithium at the current global capacity. The story is similar but not as grim for nickel, with an 8  gap between supply and demand. This fact will put upward pressure on the prices of nickel and Lithium as the decade continues. Additionally, PGM metals in use with existing non-battery EVs and traditional ICE vehicles will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Even at an aggressive growth assumption, EVs of all types are not expected to pass 40  market share Despite lower-than-expected output in FY22 and 1H23, the foundations for significant long-term growth are in place. SBSW has a very strong balance sheet, with only a reported 0.14x debt to adjusted EBITDA and around  630 million in free cash flow. Additionally, it pays out a sector high 8.54  yield targeting 35  of earnings paid out to shareholders.SBSW is undergoing a transformative effort to broaden global holdings and cut stalling operations. For this reason, we think it is attractive at its current price for the dividend investors.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Costs And Investment Implications Of Reshoring,"For the past three decades  and in some ways stretching back up to five decades , the U.S. has been in a relative industrial decline.More specifically, the share of the U.S. economy that has been involved with manufacturingWe can see this manifested in our structural trade deficitAnd we can see it in our industrial production per capitaTo some extent this is to be expected  as a country grows in wealth it tends to shift a bit more towards services, and begins to rely on developing countries to supply it with physical goods. However, a number of countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and  at least until their recent energy problems  Germany have been successful at maintaining largeThe challenge with de-industrialization is that an economy can become hollowed-out, and or it can face national security issues during a cold war type of environment or during various logistical emergencies. In other words, it's just not just about access to plastic trinkets  it's about access to critical things we don't think about like medical dyes, military components, or even just basic tools that we use for everything else.So, the themes of  onshoring  or  reshoring  or  nearshoring  have become a hot topic lately, to some extent on the corporate level but especially on the federal level. It refers to the idea of moving manufacturing facilities back to the U.S. or to nearby countries, so that supply chains in general are shorter, less complex, and more resilient. And along these lines, various stimulus efforts have gone into encouraging a boom in domestic manufacturing.And it  showing up in the data. This chart shows annualized spending on the construction of manufacturing facilitiesThe U.S. used to run sub- 100 billion per year in manufacturing construction expenditure, and now it has more than doubled. That's tangible, even after adjusting for inflation.However, to provide context to the situation, the U.S. is currently heavily reliant on China's industrial base that is worth many trillions of dollars. So, this extra  100  billion just puts us in the first inning here, if this is indeed to be the start of a reversal.For decades, the United States was a larger trading partner than China for most countries. However, by the late 2010s, China had flipped the U.S. in this regard, and it has only tilted further in China's favor since thenThe ability to be the world's largest trading partner requires both making stuff and having the logistics to organize and ship that stuff. Along those lines, among the , seven are in China, one is in Korea, one is in Singapore, and one is in the Netherlands. To find the U.S. on the list we have to dig down into the top 20 and top 30 container ports.China now produces more steel than the rest of the world combined  and more than 12x as much as the U.S.China is by far the world leader in solar panels. In terms of market share, they are more important for the global solar market than Saudi Arabia is for the global oil market.For rare earth elements broadly, which are widely used throughout the electronics industry including the alternative energy industry, China produces more than the rest of the world combined. In recent years, the rest of the world  ex-U.S.  has been regaining a minority share. Rare earth elements are not particularly rare, but they are found in low concentrations and thus tend to be environmentally destructive to extract and refine. Most wealthy regions don't want to deal with that.Just within the past three years, China's auto exports have hockey-sticked in terms of growth. Last year China surpassed Germany and this year they are  as the world's largest auto exporter. We don't see them in the United States but if you travel around the world, you'll see a lot more Chinese cars on the road than just a few years ago.Here in 2023, China also officially put their first commercial airplane  into service. The world now has the ABC's of commercial aviation  Airbus  of Europe, Boeing  of the U.S., and Comac of China, which was an  on their part to show their ambitions to compete on that level. Currently the main two are Airbus and Boeing, with Embraer of Brazil at a distant third  with less than a tenth of the revenue of either Airbus or Boeing .The introduction of Comac has been a 15-year development process that began in 2008 and is now live in 2023, and I suspect that over the next 5-10 years their commercial aviation capacity will ramp up like their auto production capacity has.When people describe the reshoring effort to bring some of that industrial capacity back to the United States, they usually just focus on the first order details  the manufacturing facilities themselves.  It won't be old heavy industry , they say.  It'll be automated, additive manufacturing. This can all run much cheaper now.And some of that is indeed true. 21st century manufacturing will trend in a more automated and additive direction than 20th century heavy industry did. But that doesn't mean reshoring manufacturing is trivial. The actual building of a manufacturing facility is the easy part  it's everything else in and around it that is hard.A recent  article  highlighted an exampleThis comes right after TSM , the world's largest semiconductor company that has been trying to bring production to the United States, reported delays until 2025 due to insufficient skilled labor. As  That brings us to the second and third order details.   e.g. manufacturing facilities  is just one part of the equation. We also need sufficient  to power it all, and sufficient  to install, operate, and maintain it all.To quantify some of the energy capital, or more specifically the electricity subset of that, China currently produces nearly twice as much electricity as the United States. Here are the annual numbers In China's case as an example, the fact that they currently dominate the solar manufacturing supply chain isn't just because they have the right manufacturing buildings, although that's a part of it. Producing polysilicon is energy-intensive. Refining it into wafers is energy-intensive again. China uses coal power for the majority of this. But it's not just the coal- it's also the groundwater used in all of the cooling for power generation facilities, and it's the extensive electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure  which is very intensive in terms of steel, aluminum, and copper inputs .In other words, China has a lot of power capital, and they have been willing to pay the environmental costs of wielding that much power capital.In contrast, U.S. electricity production has been approximately flat for the past two decades  which is when our industrial production flat-lined as well, as we shifted these things increasingly over to ChinaThe bright light in the U.S. energy landscape has been the strong uptick in shale oil production. The combination of new technology, a low cost of capital during the 2010s decade, and the willingness to operate at a loss with external financing, led to a rapid increase in U.S. oil production after a long decline of conventional productionHowever, shale oil production has fast decline rates, and the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. The cost of capital is higher now, energy investors expect a profit, and many pools of capital have divested from the industry. Going forward, it'll require more expenditure in order to maintain current or higher levels of shale production, and a lot of that expenditure will need to come from the industry's own profits.In terms of human capital, the past two generations in the United States have been incentivized to work in finance, software, and healthcare. As we have let our industrial capacity stagnate, it has to led to a stagnation in accumulated human capital for this area. It takes years to acquire sufficient technician skills to run these types of facilities. And much innovation comes from hands-on iteration  people working on the facility floor identify problems and propose changes to iterate the process and improve it over time.So, when we imagine the idea of U.S. reshoring, we must also consider the pathways of energy reshoring  which is expensive and comes with various environmental impacts  and skilled technician labor reshoring  which takes time to re-accumulate .In other words, rebuilding our industrial capacity is like turning a giant ship- it'll be a very big process. It'll require multifaceted capital accumulation, and various bottlenecks such as labor shortages or electrical requirements are likely to keep popping up in the form of unexpected delays and cost overruns as we try to re-accumulate that diverse type of capital.The prior decade and a half was mainly about intellectual technical capital accumulation, including software, electronics, cloud infrastructure, and so forth. At the foundation of this era, the introduction of the consumer smartphone with a third party app store and extensive mobile bandwidth is what led to a massive runway of innovation and growth. That combination was a powerful set of building blocks for all sorts of developers to innovate quickly with, and will continue to be.This focus came at the cost of physical industrial capital stagnation, at least outside of Asia. Our physical infrastructure aged, our power capacity stagnated, and the supply demand balances for many types of commodities have tightened. These things do tend to go in cycles.I continue to view the next decade as a more . Even as tech like AI transforms the way we work and play, it won't change our need for significant physical investment in infrastructure and energy systems.As the world becomes increasingly multipolar, we should expect the positioning and fighting over natural resources to intensify. Achieving and maintaining ownership to key infrastructure, minerals, and energy production will likely become increasingly important.I share model portfolios and exclusive analysis on .

Lumen Technologies Q2 Earnings: Don't Panic,"Last week, Lumen Technologies  . The telecommunications company is pursuing a transition away from legacy telecom assets into more modern hardware and services. While the market reacted with heavy selling of the company shares, aThe first look at Lumen Technologies  income statement can put a good shock into investors. The company recorded an operating loss of  8.4 billion in the second quarter, on nearly  1 billion less revenue than the same quarter a year ago. The entire operating loss was due to a goodwill impairment charge of  8.8 billion. Without the impairment charge, the operating loss would have been a gain of  370 million, which is still  500 million lower than the same quarter a year ago.Prior to panicking, investors need to look at how the company is treating revenue through its transformation process. Earlier this year, Lumen divided its revenue into four product and service categories  grow, nurture, harvest, and other. The company is committed to focusing on the growth segment of the business and despite declining 5  year over year, all of the decline was due to the sale of the ILEC business segment. In fact, 72  of the revenue decline and 77  of the EBITDA decline was due directly to the divestiture of assets.The company s balance sheet saw the most adverse change during the second quarter. Lumen s decision to write off nearly  8.8 billion in goodwill  impairment  led to a massive drop in assets and equity. Despite the huge drop in shareholder equity of  8.2 billion year to date, equity has increased by nearly  650 million this year if excluding the goodwill impairment. It s important for debt investors to note that the value of the physical assets is drawing closer to the value of long-term debt in the event of a recovery situation.Lumen s cash flow statement also showed a stark change compared to last year. After posting free cash flow of  1.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, free cash flow was negative  940 million for the first half of this year. The main driver behind the cash flow burn was the  938 million income tax payment made for divestitures last year. If excluding special tax payments, free cash flow is  0 year to date, which is on the bottom end of the company s guidance.Lumen is planning another divestiture that it hopes to close this year. Late last year, the company announced the sale of its EMEA business for approximately  1.8 billion in cash. The proceeds of the EMEA deal should be enough to cover debt maturities through 2025, although the EMEA transaction s tax estimates are currently unknown. It s important to note that a majority of Lumen's 2025 maturing debt is senior to publicly traded unsecured debt. Should Lumen be forced to pay these loans off  due to an inability to refinance or by choice , it will actually enhance the value of the company s unsecured debt.Despite big drops in revenue and EBITDA, management remains steadfast in its turnaround plan. For the full year 2023, Lumen management reaffirmed its guidance, only dropping the expenses related to stock based compensation. This makes sense when comparing the year to date financial results with the  in June during the company s Investor Day. While current revenue trends are slightly below guidance, EBITDA is currently projected to drop 10  this year, outperforming a 13  drop from management guidance.In addition to generating the cash needed to fund debt maturities through 2025 with the sale of the EMEA business, Lumen has an additional  2.4 billion in liquidity that is composed of  400 million in cash and  2 billion revolver capacity that it can tap into. While the company does not need to tap into the revolver at this time, it could become useful if the mitigation of lead based copper becomes a real issue, which Lumen acknowledged in its 10-Q, but stated the financial impacts, if any, remain largely unknown.From an investment standpoint, I think investors should look at either the 2025 bonds or the 2039 2042 bonds. The 2025 bonds mature in 20 months and offer an annualized yield to maturity of 25 . With the liquidity to cover near term debts, the April 2025 maturing bond seems to be the safest. For those who believe in Lumen for the long run, the 2039 and 2042 bonds offer the least capital to enter, with notes trading at around 34 cents on the dollar for each and annualized returns similar to the 2025 notes.Lumen s second quarter financial results weren t pretty, but management warned us that we would be digesting some ugly numbers through the end of 2024. The unknowns of lead copper line liability and EMEA divestiture taxes make an equity investment very risky. Investors need to watch the next six quarters of financial results to look for revenue stabilization and examine any updates in management s guidance. Until then, I m continuing to hold my long-term Lumen debt.  I own Lumen Technologies bonds maturing in 2039. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Energy Transfer Acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners Will Rally The Bears, But It's A Strong Move","On Wednesday, 8 16 23, news broke that Energy Transfer  agreed to  Crestwood Equity Partners  deal valued at  7.1 billion. This deal is likely to rally the bears, as I fully expect to see many comments andCEQP is an MLP that operates fee-based assets within the energy infrastructure space. CEQP provides solutions across the value chain to accommodate the needs of large-scale upstream producers in the major basins. CEQP owns and operates a large array of assets tied to natural gas liquids  NGLs , crude oil, and natural gas and provides produced water gathering, storage, disposal, and transportation to its partners. These are fundamental needs for any upstream producer.The three main basins that CEQP focuses on are the Williston, Powder River, and Delaware basins. In the , CEQP provides 420 MMcf d of natural gas gathering capacity, 250 MBbls d crude gathering capacity, 421 MBbls d of water gathering, and 430 MMcf d of natural gas processing capacity. In the Powder River Basin, they provide 398 MMcf d of natural gas capacity and 345 MMcf d of processing capacity. In the , they provide 1.1Bcf d natural gas gathering, 90MBbls d crude gathering, 354 MBbls d water production, and 613 Mmcf d of processing capacity. CEQP's  are mainly on the east coast, with some located in the south. In total CEQP has 13 liquified petroleum gas terminals offering 10 MMBbls of contracted storage and pipeline capacities providing integrated supply and logistical services to producers and refiners. They also have 13 trucking and rail terminals, 500 NGL truck   trailer units, 1,100 railcars, and pipeline capacity to domestic and international markets.Unlike ET's previous acquisitions, when you overlay CEQP's assets with ET's assets, this is more of an expansion than complimentary. The  deal provided ET with 3,000 miles of gathering pipelines to its Permian pipeline network and 2 million barrels of storage in Midland Texas. The  added significant pipeline mileage in the mid-continent region and made ET the largest processor in the region and the largest transporter by pipeline miles.Normally we see ET complement its current assets and expand its pipeline extensions. This deal is different as there is a mix of complementary and outright expansion into new areas. ET will complement and strengthen its asset mix in the midcontinent region, and add significant assets in the Williston Basin and in Central America. This deal is opening up new opportunities through expansion as ET will now operate in the Powder River Basin, expand its presence upward throughout the northeast, and establish a foothold in the mid-south.This deal doesn't make sense to me from an asset perspective unless ET is looking to fill out connectivity throughout the east coast or Middle America. From an asset standpoint, this deal is a much larger expansion than we have normally seen, as ET typically has stuck to complementary assets. We know that Kelcy Warren has a track record of growing through acquiring, and has publicly said that companies will need to expand to thrive. I think this deal is a stepping stone for a much larger future deal. I have no knowledge, but I would speculate that if the ONEOK  and Magellan Midstream Partners  deal falls through, they will try to acquire OKE. MMP is holding a special meeting to vote on the deal on 9 21 23, and as I outlined in my article on the deal , there has been a lot of opposition, especially from , who own roughly 3  of MMP.When I look at the combined asset map from ET and CEQP, and then I look at OKE's assets below, it would be a strong strategic move. ET just increased its presence in the Williston Basin and established operations in the Powder River Basin. By acquiring OKE, ET would gain a 40,000-mile network of NGL and natural gas pipeline, but more importantly, significant takeaway capacity from the Williston Basin and the Bakken Shale Basin. ET would also gain much-needed infrastructure for its new assets in the Powder River Basin. I don't think ET is done, and I have a feeling that the CEQP deal is a stepping stone to a large-scale deal that will shock the energy infrastructure space.ET has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CEQP at a  enterprise valuation in an all-equity deal. This deal dilutes unitholders, but ET isn't utilizing any of its cash. While ET is projected to issue 219 million units, they are also adding  3.3 billion of debt to their balance sheet as they assume CEQP's debt in the transaction. The unitholders from CEQP will get 2.07 units for every 1 unit of CEQP in the deal, and it's expected to close in Q4 2023.Here is what ET is gaining from a numbers' aspect. In the TTM, In the TTM ET as a standalone company has generatedET has  48.91 billion in  on the books, and when they assume , the total debt will increase to  52.2 billion, which is the same amount of debt ET had in 2020. If the two were a combined entity today, their TTM numbers would look like the followingET would increase its revenue by 6.84 , its Adjusted EBITDA by 5.95 , and its DCF by 6.93 . Its margins would decrease by a small fraction, as Adjusted EBITDA would still represent over 16  of revenue and DCF would represent over 10.40  of revenue. ET's total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio would slightly increase from 3.74x to 3.77x based on the TTM numbers.I think the bears will disapprove of this acquisition, and we will see a lot of negative comments on this article and future articles written about ET. From my perspective, I like the deal, and think it's a smart move. ET is assuming the debt and issuing units to fund the remaining portion of the deal and not touching its cash. While the debt will increase on the balance sheet, ET's total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, when looking at ET and CEQP as a combined entity on a TTM basis, doesn't really change much. ET would still be under a 4x ratio, which is a better ratio than we have seen in the past. ET is taking another piece off the table, and I think this is setting the stage for a large-scale deal in the future. ET once again has expanded its relevancy and widened its moat in the midstream space. I think this deal will help change the market's perception and maybe bring a more realistic valuation to units of ET as they continue to be significantly undervalued.

Casey's General Stores Stock: Boring Is Beautiful,"Quick, name a company that rallied 14  in 2022 and is up 21  YTD 2023. Is it Apple Inc.  Is it Microsoft Corp  No, it's actually the convenience store operator, This little known convenience store operator has been able to beat market darlings like Apple and Microsoft since the end of 2021, and it shows no signs of slowing down, recently soaring 11  on the release of its Q1 F24 . How good were these results and what's in store for Casey's in the futureFirst, for those not familiar with Casey's, the company is the 3rd largest operator of convenience stores in the U.S., with more than 2,500 stores in the U.S. Mid-WesternA key differentiating factor in the Casey's story is that more than 50  of the company's stores are located in rural towns with 5,000 people or less, so in addition to selling fuel, Casey's also plays the role of grocery and general merchandise stores as well as fast food restaurants. This leads to Casey's having a higher share of gross profit dollars from inside sales, and better gross margins than competitors. For Casey's, approximately 2 3 of gross profit dollars are generated from inside sales  Figure 3 .Casey's also owns its own distribution centers  3 DCs provide most of Casey's inside store goods , allowing the company to have better control over its value-chain and squeeze out additional operational efficiencies  Figure 4 .This has resulted in peer-leading financial performance, with Casey's delivering consistent double-digit growth in EBITDA and earnings in the past decade  Figure 5 .I initiated on Casey's last year, and readers may want to refer to that  for additional information on Casey's.Recently, Casey's reported its first quarter  for fiscal 2024, with revenues of  3.87 billion  -13.0  YoY  and dil. EPS of  4.52  10.5  YoY   Figure 6 . Revenues for Casey's are dependent on fuel prices and can be volatile, but earnings were notably strong, beating consensus estimates by  1.19   share.Operationally, Casey's earnings beat was driven by a number of factors. First, fuel margins were strong, at 41.6 cents   gallon, compared to management's guidance of mid-30s despite a steep decline in fuel prices from  4.49 in the year-ago period to  3.40 per gallon in Q1 F24  Figure 7 . Casey's also sold 3.6  YoY more fuel this quarter.Inside sales were also strong, with a 5.4  YoY increase and a 12.1  2-yr stacked growth rate with a 40.6  gross margins  Figure 8 . The introduction of new prepared food items was called out by management for contributing to inside sales growth.Furthermore, Casey's gross margins benefited from private label goods, which offer customers a good value proposition while being margin accretive for the company  Figure 9 .In my initiation article, I noted that tight supply demand dynamics have been the main driver for higher fuel margins, as refining capacity had been taken offline in the U.S. due to environmental concerns in the last few years. This has helped push fuel margins up from the  20 cent   gallon level to mid 30 cents range since 2020, and recently to the 40 cent range  Figure 10 .Furthermore, the decline of tobacco sales and limited inside sale categories have pressured the profitability of mom and pop convenience stores, forcing them to raise fuel prices to compensate  Figure 11 . This has indirectly benefited large chains like Casey's that have large format stores with attractive inside sales margins.For fiscal 2024, Casey is guiding to fuel margins in the mid-30 cents, but recent results suggest they may stay elevated above that level. In fact, fuel margins have stayed above 34.6 cents for a record 9 straight quarters for Casey's, significantly contributing to the company's strong profitability  Figure 12 .While management has been coy about the sustainability of 40 cents  fuel margins, there does not appear to be any near-term impetus for margins to return to historical sub-35 cent levels.Another reason Casey's jumped following the quarter was because Casey's updated markets on the number of stores it is currently acquiring to 125, including 63 previously announced from EG group.M A has been a core part of Casey's growth formula in recent years, as Casey's is a natural consolidator within the fragmented convenience store industry  Figure 13 .Casey's targets chains that are over-indexed to tobacco, with little food service offerings, and lack scale and capital. Casey's is then able to acquire these units at a 6-9x pre-synergy EBITDA multiple, and after spending capital to remodel the stores, is able to get a valuation uplift to Casey's 10-11x trading multiple  Figure 14 .Overall, the company is guiding to growing units by 350 stores over the next 3 years, and with the deals in place, Casey's is well on its way to surpassing those goals  Figure 15 .Looking forward, analysts are actually estimating a flat year in terms of EPS growth, from  11.91 in fiscal 2023 to  11.81 in fiscal 2024  Figure 16 .However, given Casey's strong Q1 results  4.52 in dil. EPS, 10.5  YoY growth , Wall Street's  11.81   share F2024 figure seems very  beatable.In fact, with the company expected to add 150 stores  6  unit growth  in fiscal 2024, there is a very high likelihood that 2024 results could be much closer to analyst's fiscal 2025 estimate of  13   share.If there are any drawbacks to the Casey's story, it is valuation. The company is currently trading at 21.6x trailing GAAP P E, significantly higher than convenience store peers like Murphy USA Inc.  and Alimentation Couche-Tard , and in line with Arko Corp.   Figure 17 .However, given 2 3 of Casey's gross profits come from inside sales, perhaps investors should value Casey's against retailing peers like Walmart , Dollar General , Dollar Tree , and Costco   Figure 18 . Against this peer group, Casey's valuation looks more sensible.I believe Casey's can maintain its elevated valuation multiples as long as fuel margin stays strong and Casey can continue to deliver on inside sales growth. With the market itself trading at a 20.2x Fwd P E multiple, it is not a stretch for Casey's to trade at 23.5x Fwd P E, given its algorithm of targeting 8-10  long-term EBITDA growth and mid-teens EPS growth  Figure 19 .There are a number of risks to Casey's that investors should be aware of. First, while inside sales growth have been strong, consumers are increasingly being squeezed in their pocketbooks from inflation. With the upcoming restart of student loan repayments, consumers may be less inclined to spend, especially those in the lower income cohorts. Fortunately, Casey's is not overly indexed to low income consumers, as the company believes more than 70  of its customers make more than  50k per year  Figure 20 .Another risk to Casey's is fuel margins, which have stayed elevated in the past few years. With President Biden heading into a tough re-election campaign, investors should be prepared for heightened political rhetoric of  price gouging by energy companies,  especially if fuel prices start to rise in the coming months.Finally, investors should note that Casey's has deviated from its tradition of adding stores organically, with several large transactions completed in recent years. While large M A transactions can add many stores at once, it also adds execution risk, as well as the risk of Casey's overpaying.Casey's remains an extremely well-oiled machine  pardon the pun , consistently delivering double-digit earnings growth over the past decade. Investors have rewarded the company with a 23.5x Fwd P E multiple, near the high end of peers. I believe Casey's is a classic GARP story with consistent low single-digit unit growth, mid single-digit same store sales growth, and double-digit earnings growth. I rate Casey's a .Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.

Valero Energy: Another Solid Quarter,"San Antonio-based   released its third-quarter 2023 results on October 26, 2023. This article  my article published on August 26, 2023. I have followed VLO on Seeking Alpha since DecemberAmong the three refiners I track on a quarterly basis are Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum , and Phillips 66 . The first company to release its 3Q23 results is Valero Energy.The U.S. refiner reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of  a significant decrease from  11.36 per share in the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the results beat analysts' expectations again.Total revenues decreased from  51,641 million last year's quarter to , over the consensus estimate.VLO increased its refinery throughput volumes slightly this quarter to The Chief Executive Officer, Lane Riggs, said in the While the ethanol margin increased to  from  0.57 last year, the refining margin per throughput barrel fell to  from  21.34 this year.I have been a long-term shareholder in Valero Energy Corporation for more than 20 years, as I have stated in previous articles, and I plan to maintain a sizable portion of my long position. With a  dividend yield, VLO offers a safe and comparatively high yield, which explains the long-term investment decision.Nonetheless, I have frequently traded LIFO, or between  of my long position, in order to profit from the volatility associated with the refining sector. Just glancing at the chart will convince you that you must trade some of your position.The main issue at hand is the extreme volatility of the refining industry, which calls for a particular approach to trading and investing.I am well above my comfort zone when it comes to my assessment of VLO's valuation. Though I'm sure many investors will tell me that VLO still has a lot of room to grow, I'm not convinced despite what Valero Energy considers a solid business outlook.Lane Riggs said in the conference callThe demand outlook, which will rely on the severity of any global economic slowdown and the rate of its recovery over the coming years, remains, as usual, the largest source of uncertainty for refiners.The United States' consumption of gasoline and distillate has returned to its five-year average following over a year of low demand brought on by the COVID pandemic, which also forced the closure of refining facilities.In addition, for the fourth quarter, Valero Energy intends to run its fourteen oil refineries in North America and the UK at a maximum of  of their combined daily throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels.VLO is now down  on a one-year basis, underperforming Phillips 66 and Marathon significantly.  Estimated by Fun Trading.Valero Energy's revenue for the third quarter was  The company reported a  increase in quarterly income to  per diluted share from  7.19 in the previous year. The results were better than analysts had predicted.For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  per share.The total cost of sales fell to  from  40.431 billion last year. Net cash from operating activities was  in the third quarter of 2023, versus  2.045 billion last year. The cash from operating activities less capital expenditures is the generic free cash flow.VLO had  in trailing 12-month TTM free cash flow. The second quarter's free cash flow, which is  is much higher than the prior quarter.The quarterly dividend remained unchanged at .Also,  worth of VLO shares were purchased, or approximately  of common stock, in 2Q23. In the press release, the company saidValero Energy had total cash of  in 3Q23, up from  3,969 million last year. Total debt was significantly down to   including total lease obligations , compared to  11,592 million last year.The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was  as of September 30, 2023.During the third quarter, refining throughput volumes increased to  barrels per day from 3,005K barrels per day in the previous year.The most important component is sweet crude oil, as the graph below illustrates.In 3Q23, the U.S. Gulf Coast supplied about  of the total throughput volume.The dividend has been taken into account in the chart.VLO forms a descending wedge pattern, with resistance at  and support at  RSI shows  suggesting that a collapse might occur in 4Q23. If it does, though, it might run counter to the bullish pattern.I frequently advise holding onto a key position for the long run and using about  to trade LIFO while waiting for a higher final price target for your core position that you may keep as a well-secured dividend provider.Thus, the trading strategy is to sell about  between  with possible higher resistance at  and wait for a retracement between  with possible lower support at Valero Energy Corporation's stock is highly sensitive to the United States' demand for oil, and the rest of 2023 is probably going to see some extreme fluctuations. It will therefore be very advantageous to trade half of your position using TA charts and patterns. The T.A. chart must be updated frequently to be relevant. It is what I am doing in my stock tracker. The chart above has a possible validity of about a week. Remember, the T.A. chart is a tool only to help you adopt the right strategy.

Refined Products: Middle Distillate Tightness To Persist," Refined product markets witnessed significant strength over the Northern Hemisphere summer, which helped to drive refinery margins to their highest levels since last year. StrengthMore recently, however, margins have started to give back a lot of these gains. Weakness has been largely driven by gasoline as we come to the end of the summer driving season. Middle distillates have also come under some renewed pressure more recently. The latest release of Chinese export quotas would likely have put some pressure on cracks.Longer term, refined product markets remain vulnerable. Inventories are mostly tight and global refining capacity has remained largely unchanged since 2019, with new capacity offset byA delay in the release of the third batch of refined product export quota from the Chinese government initially provided some support to refined product markets. Uncertainty over when we would finally see this released and the volume of the third tranche were supportive. Recently, the government finally issued the third batch, which amounted to 12 million tonnes, more than the 10 million tonnes the market was expecting. This also means that export quotas released to date total 39.99 million tonnes, above the 37.25 million issued over the whole of 2022. The increase in refinery run rates this year has allowed for a higher quota allocation.However, what is not clear is whether the government will release a fourth batch of export quotas. Much will likely depend on how domestic demand evolves over the remainder of the year. Even if we see further releases, it does not guarantee that further quotas will have to be used before the end of the year. As we saw last year, the government may allow some of these to be rolled over into early next year.Higher export quotas have obviously translated into higher export volumes of refined products. Over the first seven months of the year, refined product exports totalled 36.62 million tonnes, up 46  year-on-year. Diesel exports have seen the largest increase with 8.4 million tonnes exported, compared to just 2.4 million over the same period last year.Like last year, the middle distillate market has led the strength amongst refined products. The ICE gasoil crack has traded as high as  45 bbl recently, with the NYMEX heating oil crack hitting highs of more than  50 bbl while Singapore gasoil cracks briefly traded a little over  35 bbl in August.Declining middle distillate inventories have helped to push the market higher, with stocks well below the five-year average in most regions including the US, ARA in Europe and Singapore. The concern is that inventories have been falling and are already low as we head into the Northern Hemisphere winter, a period where you would expect to see stronger demand. This suggests that middle distillate cracks are likely to be fairly well-supported.In Europe, a key issue has been the ability of buyers to replace Russian products. Prior to the EU ban on Russian refined products, Russian gasoil flows to the EU were about 450Mbbls d. In the lead-up to the ban, there was some front-loading, evident in the buildup of inventory over the latter part of 2022 and into early 2023. Since the ban, the EU has turned to other origins, however, it would appear that this is not enough to fully make up for the loss of Russian supply. As a result, we have seen ARA gasoil inventories steadily declining since late February.Recovering air travel has also played an important role in the renewed strength seen in middle distillates. This is evident in the widening of jet fuel's premium to gasoil in Northwest Europe, whilst the Asian regrade discount continues to narrow. This shouldn't be too surprising, given that air traffic continues to move towards more normal levels. The latest data from the International Air Transport Association show that air passenger traffic  revenue passenger kilometres  in July was 4.4  below the same period in 2019. In fact, in North America and Latin America, passenger traffic is back above 2019 levels. However, Asia is still lagging with passenger traffic 8.8  below 2019 levels. While we could see a seasonal slowdown in jet demand with the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer holidays, we should continue to see a recovery year-on-year, driven predominantly by Asia.In addition, ongoing OPEC  supply cuts have led to distortions in the crude oil market, which has fed through to the product markets. These cuts have led to a tightening in the medium sour crude market, which will have an impact on refinery yields, with refiners yielding lighter products as a result.A tightening in gasoil has also attracted speculators to the market, or at least has seen a drastic shift in their positioning. This is evident when looking at speculative positioning in ICE gasoil. The managed money position has increased from a net short of almost 33k lots in early May to a net long of almost 94k lots by mid-August - 127k lots of buying, which is close to 95m barrels of buying.Our view is that middle distillate cracks should remain relatively well-supported for the remainder of the year at around US 30 bbl, whilst through 2024, we expect the crack to average a little over US 20 bbl.The gasoline market has been strong for much of the summer, trading to levels seen last summer - a time when there was plenty of uncertainty over Russian crude and product flows. The strength in the market had been partly due to low US inventories, which have been well below the five-year average. In addition, there were a number of refinery outages over the summer, whilst hot weather in parts of Europe meant that refiners had to reduce run rates, which hit gasoline output.US gasoline demand also held up well through much of the second quarter, with the four-week rolling average at levels last seen back in 2019. However, since early July, whilst demand has remained above year-ago levels, it has fallen below levels seen in 2021. Gasoline cracks have come under significant pressure more recently, coinciding with the end of the driving season.Obviously, with the US driving season now behind us, demand is likely to continue to trend lower, which should mean we start to see US gasoline inventories moving higher, particularly once seasonal refinery maintenance is complete. However, much will depend on how the rest of the US hurricane season develops. Seasonally weaker demand, combined with refiners processing lighter grades of crude  due to tightness in the medium sour market , suggests that there is limited upside in gasoline cracks in the coming months.Meanwhile, gasoline inventories in the ARA region are comfortable, remaining near five-year highs, suggesting that there will be little upward pressure on cracks driven by European dynamics.The high-sulphur fuel oil  HSFO  market has seen significant strength this year. In fact, the HSFO crack traded at an unusual premium in north-west Europe briefly over the summer. A key driver in the strength of the HSFO market has been the tightness in the medium sour crude market, which as mentioned has come about due to ongoing OPEC  supply cuts. The tightness in the sour market is reflected in the unusual discount of the Brent Dubai spread.In addition, the European market would have been supported by reduced Russian flows since the EU ban was implemented earlier in the year.Over the summer months we would have also seen the usual stronger demand in the Middle East for cooling purposes. This demand should ease in the months ahead, which should support the view of weaker HSFO cracks. Already, we have started to see these cracks weakening from their recent highs. However, this weakness is likely to be somewhat limited, given the tightness in the medium-sour crude market.As for very-low sulphur fuel oil  VLSFO , we expect this market to be relatively well-supported, given the strength that we are seeing in middle distillates and the expectation that the middle distillate market should hold up relatively well through the coming months.Therefore, given expectations of some weakness in HSFO and support for VLSFO we believe the Hi-5  VLSFO-HSFO  spread will widen from current levels. It is also worth pointing out that we are not far off from levels where this spread has historically found some good support.While the naphtha market has strengthened over the summer, prompt cracks still remain deeply in negative territory and well below historic norms. There are several reasons driving the broader weakness in the naphtha market. Firstly, a weak propane market has ensured that propane is the favoured feedstock for the petrochemical industry, with propane trading at more than a US 100 t discount to naphtha in northwest Europe. Secondly, downstream demand has been weaker, with cracker margins in both Asia and Europe not great.In Europe, the chemical sector has suffered significantly because of higher costs and weaker demand. As a result, chemical production over the first half of 2023 was down 12.3  year-on-year according to the European Chemical Industry Council  Cefic . Cefic numbers show that this weaker output from the sector is not isolated to Europe. South Korea and Japan also saw large declines over the first half of 2023, with output falling by 18.4  and 7.2  YoY respectively.Despite this, we expect naphtha cracks will see seasonal strength as we move into the Northern Hemisphere winter with increased usage amongst the petrochemical industry as propane's discount to naphtha narrows, making propane a less attractive feedstock for the industry. However, whilst we see strength in cracks, we expect that they will remain firmly in negative territory and below historic norms through the Northern Hemisphere winter, given weak downstream demand.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Oaktree Specialty Lending: An 11% Yield That Feeds On Pain,"An excellent book covering the market cycle of specialty credit is Howard Marks'  In the book he details the specific situations under which specialty lenders can take advantage ofIn essence, Oaktree and Howard Marks expect profitability to be at its maxim in times of high interest rates and economic turmoil. When borrowing is easy, or as Marks says the  window is wide open , the fund is not as profitable. If Mark's profitability inHere we can see the record of the yield versus history. A large run-up in yield occurred in the GFC of 2008-2012. Marks, along with Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, and Jamie Mai are all well-noted profiteers of the huge housing crisis that led to a credit tightening cycle the like of which had not been seen for decades. At this point, not only did the yield spike but so did the share priceAs seen from the above, this fund is at its most profitable, and valuable in times of pain.  does a great job of detailing the theorem behind the profitability with an excellent analogy to the credit window.My summation of what Marks describes as the credit cycle in a nutshellThe credit window can be seen as being wide open during times of low-interest rates, low capital reserve requirements, and economic boom cycles in which see capital appreciation of both paper and physical assets. Lenders are eager to close as many loans as possible. Appraisals always come in for what the lender needs to clear and close the loan. They fear not for capital loss since there is ample credit available to refinance should a borrower need to use outside capital to repay the borrowed capital. As asset prices inflate, there is no fear that the borrowers will be underwater and unable to repay or refinance.As rates rise, refinancing becomes more difficult. Lender's funds become more precious as their cost of capital increases when forming overnight loan syndications and when customers begin to sort cash into higher-yielding accounts and products. Bankers become more judicious and the window begins to shut. Marks likes to call this adding logs to the fire. Finally, a spark ignites and the credit market becomes a tinderbox. The window slams shut for all but the most worthy of borrowers. The credit cycle has now gone full circle.Marks also lists the progression of the lender terms from window open to window shut along the following linesThe reverse happens when the window shutsThe window shutting makes for many businesses to seek out alternative lending sources as they find it more difficult to find traditional financing. These specialty lenders can ask for very strong terms at high rates.From the Oaktree Specialty Lending Again, the goal is to seek out the  good company with a bad balance sheet . In this situation, what is the lender's motivation should these companies be at risk of defaultIn essence, one strategy for profitability at Oaktree is to negotiate the best covenants to have an asset at a steep discount that they can profit on should the company go into receivership. These covenants are very difficult to negotiate with quality companies when the window is open but easy when shut.Here we can see an outsized proportion of software in the portfolio makeup. Specialty credit and private lenders prefer  asset-light  companies that have smaller amounts of hard asset capex requirements. Hard asset companies also have the added complication of subordinate loans and rights attached to real property should they move to take the company whole. Software and biotech life sciences companies are two specialties of Oaktree as described in their fund's The fund institutes a variety of profit strategies. The aforementioned private strategies have been covered. Public credit and commercial paper are the funds' other, secondary focus. Capital appreciation for buying securities and debt under par and riding them back to par is another technical investment aspect of the fund. With the rise in rates, several debt issuances have been hammered to levels well below par while the borrower remains creditworthy enough to return funds at maturity.Incoming Co-CEO of Oaktree CEO Armen Panossian had a  where he said the company believes a recession will lag about 18 months behind the start of the rate increases. In line with the ethos of Howard Marks, he believes that rates being  higher for longer  in the face of an interim strong economy will begin to deflate asset bubbles from the last decade. He is expecting access to capital to become more difficult which in turn will spurn the recession. also mentions this. When asset values deflate and go underwater from the value for which they first gained financing, traditional re-financing will become impossible as collateral evaporates. This  from asset bubble deflation will push many borrowers to specialty, private lenders.Although Marks no longer runs Oaktree, he does write consistent memos that are posted on the company website. The most recent is from today, October 11th, 2023. The title is , the very verbiage that Panossian sprinkles into his CNBC interview. The memo covers the oddities of the rate environment that has been so kind to asset prices since 2009.In the memo Marks also believes that government rescue plans and stimulus will be less likely in the face of rampant inflation. They should not be expected.If credit spreads continue to increase as the risk-free rate marches upward, the profitability of specialty lending will only be enhanced. The fund follows a similar rule to money market funds in that no single investment can represent more than 5  of the fund's investments. You do not have to fret about a concentrated bet into one distressed borrower or ultra-high-yielding security.I have started buying this fund and plan to hold it as long as rates continue to do what they currently are doing, staying high to rising. I would expect in a recession like the previous GFC that saw Oaktree Specialty Lending's yields spike and share price appreciate, this fund should do well.I am not reinvesting the large dividend, rather will use it to invest into broad-based equities that I plan to hold for the long run. Should fiscal stimulus and rate cuts come into the picture without a recession, thus prolonging asset bubbles, I would trade out of the fund, hopefully with a nice profit. In short, I will hold and buy this fund as long as the credit window appears to be closing, ever so slowly.I am a generally optimistic person, I buy equities in all environments. Marks and Oaktree, as evidenced by the recent Sea Change memo, seem to be taking a long term pessimistic view. Things seem to work themselves out, but temporary periods of pain are inevitable. This is one of my favorite hedges should that pain materialize. Buy.

Lockheed Martin Q3 Earnings Preview: A Tricky Situation,"  stock has drawn increasing attention from investors recently for two reasons - first, the fairly rapid sell-off from over  450 to under  400 in a little over a month, and more recently, the Hamas attackI first covered the company in a detailed report in So, let's dive right inFigure 1 shows the volatility of LMT stock since the beginning of 2022 - Russia's invasion of Ukraine and peak pessimism during the 2022 bear market are clearly visible. The recent spike on October 9 due to the Hamas attack on Israel is also clear, but also look at the increase since early September. There are several reasons for the recent rise in volatility.As I explained in my first article on the company, I own this defense pure play as a non-cyclical, or even counter-cyclical investment that gives me exposure to the industrial sector. However, it should be kept in mind that the performance of defense contractors correlates with current government defense spending and its expected growth. With a national debt well over , austerity measures should not be ruled out in theory, but of course, with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, recent events in Israel, and political tensions between China and Taiwan, it is unrealistic to expect defense spending to remain flat or even decline in the future. The fiscal 2024 budget request of  842 billion for the Department of Defense is  than the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 requests, respectively. However, I do not expect defense spending to grow in the high single digits or even low double digits in the future. Instead, given the  in defense spending between 2017 and 2021  5.5  average annual growth rate , I believe continued moderate growth is the most likely outcome in this environment.In addition to the  in my view unfounded  fears of a cap on defense spending amid all-time high national debt, it was the news of a possible  that made investors nervous. After all, payments to defense contractors could be delayed and new contracts could be postponed or not awarded at all. While this is a risk to consider before investing in the defense sector, I maintain that a government shutdown will eventually resolve itself. Therefore, I consider these occasional events to be more or less irrelevant to defense stock valuations, but of course such news does lead to increased stock volatility.Given the war in Ukraine and the recent attacks on Israel, it seems only logical that Lockheed would be one of the immediate beneficiaries - so it's understandable that LMT stock jumped in response to the headlines, at least in theory.Granted, Lockheed is very well positioned with its F-35 fighter jet franchise  reliable cash flows for decades  and the close combat, precision fires and strike systems it offers through its Missiles and Fire Control segment. However, given the company's significant reliance on long-term procured projects, an immediate jump in sales and profits is an unrealistic expectation. In this context, the positive reaction to RTX stock is much more understandable given the  installed in Israel.That said, I believe LMT will benefit in the long run. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine exposed the inadequate defense capabilities of several European countries, and the company subsequently saw significant orders for F-35s  e.g., , . In my view, the reality, revealed once again, of how quickly hot wars can emerge is a stark reminder to governments around the world to maintain an adequate defense infrastructure - despite the need for austerity measures in the face of record levels of national debt.However, I think there is more to consider than government debt and a possible shutdown. In my view, it was the flattening of the yield curve that contributed to the sell-off. Long-term government bond yields have been gradually rising rather quickly since early September, and the 20-Year Treasury, for example, even exceeded a yield of 5.1  in early October. With  similarly high, the market is  finally  pricing in a  higher for longer  interest rate scenario. As a result, companies with a high level of debt and relatively short weighted-average maturity will increasingly have to refinance their maturing bonds at comparatively unfavorable interest rates, which puts pressure on earnings and cash flows.Lockheed, historically relied  and to some extent still relies  on conventional benefit plans. The company is known for having a comparatively high proportion of unfunded pension liabilities. However, as I , Lockheed has done a good job of reducing its risk by purchasing group annuity contracts from time to time. While this is encouraging, in the process the company has taken on debt that will be more expensive to service if the current environment persists for a number of years.Let's look at Lockheed's current debt maturity profile to get a good understanding of how a long-term high interest rate environment could affect the company  Figure 2 . As an aside, the maturity profile is based on information published in the   p. 86 , but includes recently assumed debt  see this May 2023 .At the end of the second quarter of 2023, Lockheed's net debt was  13.9 billion, largely due to its sizable cash position of nearly  4 billion, but still up 40  year-over-year. However, the maturity profile remains balanced and manageable, given the company's annual free cash flow of about  6 billion to  7 billion  Figure 3 .The weighted-average interest rate of about 4.4  is quite good and translates to an interest coverage ratio of about 9 times free cash flow before interest. However, investors should keep in mind that Lockheed's weighted-average interest rate was about 50 basis points lower a year ago. High interest rates are taking their toll, and considering that LMT will most likely not repay most of its debt but roll it over it as it matures, debt service costs will likely continue to increase.Judging by the current yield on its , LMT will likely refinance at a coupon rate of 5.8  to 6.0  if the current interest rate environment continues for a few years. But even if we assume Lockheed refinances all of its bonds maturing through 2026 at 6 , its interest coverage ratio remains well above 8 times free cash flow before interest  even assuming no free cash flow growth . The robustness of Lockheed's balance sheet is also underscored by its weighted-average maturity of about 19 years and its long-term credit rating of , which was  from A3.The company clearly has the financial capacity to continue its current capital allocation program  see subsequent section  and does not need to prioritize debt repayment. However, this arguably positive conclusion raises the question of why Lockheed's recent dividend increase was comparatively meager.On October 7, Lockheed  a quarterly dividend of  3.15 per share, a 5  increase. This is significantly less than the five- and 10-year compound annual growth rates of 7.4  and 9.0 , respectively  Figure 4 . Considering that LMT's dividend yield is currently 2.9  and assuming that the company continues to increase its dividend by 5  per year, investors would have to wait until 2034 before their yield on cost exceeds the current rate on the 20-Year Treasury. Investing in long-term government bonds once again has become a rather tempting alternative for risk-averse investors who desire well-predictable cash flows - another reason for the recent weakness in dividend stocks.Conversely, the yield on cost of LMT stock will eventually exceed the risk-free rate, and that is an important aspect of why I invest in dividend-paying companies with good growth potential. I want my income to at least keep pace with inflation, so I aim for a weighted-average dividend growth rate of at least 5  in my portfolio. Those who invest in long-term bonds are accepting that the purchasing power of their cash flows will decline over time due to inflation .From this point of view, it is of utmost importance to keep an eye on a company's dividend growth potential. If Lockheed continues to grow its dividend at an increasingly slower pace, that would certainly be an issue. The trend  current growth   5-year CAGR   10-year CAGR  points in that direction. However, I would not over-interpret this trend and think LMT can return to somewhat higher dividend growth in the future.For one, LMT typically pays out less than 50  of its normalized free cash flow. Granted, free cash flow growth has been non-existent in recent years, but that is largely due to working capital effects and higher capital expenditures. While capacity expansions are time-consuming and expensive - and thus a drag on short-term free cash flow - they should be recognized positively due to the improved long-term growth outlook. In addition, supply chain issues took their toll, leading to an increase in unfilled orders and thus shifting cash flow to future years. As these issues are gradually resolved, free cash flow growth is expected to return to the long-term average growth in the high single digits.Another aspect worth noting is Lockheed's recent increased emphasis on share repurchases.Lockheed repurchased 18.3 million shares in 2022 for nearly  8 billion  p. 95, 2022 10-K . So far in 2023,  1.25 billion worth of shares have been repurchased. However, along with the dividend increase, the company  a  6 billion increase in its existing repurchase authorization, bringing the total amount of future repurchases to a whopping  13 billion - or nearly 12  of LMT's current market capitalization. Conservatively assuming a net impact of only 10   consider dilution due to stock-based compensation , the positive impact on Lockheed's dividend payout ratio is still pretty significant and will improve long-term dividend growth potential.Of course, investors should keep in mind that LMT will finance a significant portion of its buybacks with debt. Given the cost of long-term debt of around 6 , the buybacks arguably come at a significant price. However, given LMT's stock is at least fairly valued, if not slightly undervalued  6  free cash flow yield, PEG ratio of 1.5, blended P E of 16.8, Figure 5 , I think the buybacks represent a good return on investment.However, investors should keep in mind that buybacks are accretive to earnings per share and, of course, are only sustainable if a company is ultimately able to repay its debt and the underlying business fundamentals are sound. I believe LMT's long-term prospects are solid and the company is well managed, as I explained in my previous post, so I think it is a stretch to conclude that LMT's management feels the need to manage earnings per share through buybacks. However, considering that LMT has retired nearly 20  of share count over the past decade, representing earnings growth averaging 2.4  per year  or 25  of total annual earnings growth over that period , I continue to monitor Lockheed's performance on a company level, not on a per share basis.Lockheed Martin beat analysis  for earnings per share in 13 of 16 quarters  Figure 6  and for revenue in 11 of 16 quarters  Figure 7 . At first glance, this suggests potential earnings management, but given that Lockheed missed revenue estimates in a period that was  and to some extent still is  characterized by supply chain disruptions, I would not over-interpret this discrepancy.Revenues and earnings per share revisions in recent months have been insignificant for both  and , suggesting analyst confidence. Based on these data and the recently improved net sales, operating profit and adjusted earnings per share guidance  p. 4, , an earnings beat on Tuesday seems quite likely. At the same time, the company's tendency to beat earnings estimates is likely baked into investors' expectations.Excluding the negative impact of the pandemic's secondary effects  see analyst scorecard in Figure 8 , the longer-term accuracy of analysts' forecasts is also quite solid, underscoring Lockheed's low cyclicality  earnings of conventional industrial companies are, by their nature, very difficult to predict .As I mentioned earlier, I do not expect recent developments to have an immediate positive impact on Lockheed Martin. However, I do think that the company's long-term outlook has improved, largely due to the change in stance on defense spending in Europe against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, but also due to recent developments in Israel. Given the immediate and quite significant jump in LMT's stock price following the attacks on Israel over the weekend, I suspect that LMT stock could actually fall in reaction to the earnings report on Tuesday if management does not address potential positives for the company. That doesn't seem unrealistic, considering that there will most likely simply be nothing significant to say. I doubt, for example, that Lockheed's backlog has changed in that short period of time, given how slow defense procurement is.After a disappointing September - Lockheed Martin stock fell by more than 10  - the overall defense sector regained interest among investors due to Hamas' attack on Israel.The September decline was due to several factors.First, stocks of U.S. defense companies tend not to be truly cyclical in the traditional sense, but they are sensitive to news related to government debt and defense spending. However, I think it is important to look beyond these near-term uncertainties  including those related to a government shutdown . I am confident that the U.S. will not cut back on defense spending, especially in light of growing geopolitical tensions. Moreover, the war in Ukraine and the latest developments in Israel are stark reminders of the importance of maintaining an adequate defense infrastructure - despite the need for austerity measures in the face of historically-high national debt. This applies not only to the U.S., of course, but also to Europe in particular.Secondly, as investors increasingly anticipate a  higher for longer  interest rates scenario, companies with high levels of debt on their balance sheets are coming under increased scrutiny. However, Lockheed's debt is very manageable - despite a 40  year-over-year increase in net debt. With relatively evenly distributed maturities and a weighted-average maturity of 19 years, the maturity profile of Lockheed Martin's debt is very reassuring. The weighted-average interest rate is up about 50 basis points year-over-year, but is still quite low at about 4.4 . I expect the current very solid debt service capacity of about nine times pre-interest free cash flow to remain robust, even as the company rolls over its maturing debt and probably raises even more debt as it is currently conducting significant share repurchases.The recent dividend increase of only 5  was a bit disappointing given the company's historical track record and the current high risk-free rate. However, I think investors should focus on the long term, and LMT is very well positioned in this regard from an operational perspective. Moreover, the share buybacks - which I think represent a good return on investment - will lower Lockheed's dividend payout ratio and as a result improve its long-term dividend growth prospects. However, considering that about 25  of Lockheed's earnings per share growth over the past decade has been due to share buybacks, I think it is critical to continue to monitor the company's performance on a company basis rather than on a per-share basis.Lockheed will report its third quarter results on Tuesday, Oct. 17, and given its solid track record, it is likely to beat earnings and probably also revenue estimates. However, this is likely already factored into investor expectations. In my view, investors are looking for signs to confirm the sharp rise in the share price following the recent attacks. Therefore, I can imagine the stock falling in response to the  likely solid  third quarter results if management does not address potential positives for the company. That doesn't seem unrealistic, considering that there will most likely simply be nothing significant to say. I doubt, for example, that Lockheed's backlog has changed in that short period of time, given how slow defense procurement is.Therefore, I do not intend to add to my LMT position ahead of the results, even though it is still quite small and the stock is fairly valued, if not slightly undervalued. Suffice it to say that I can imagine adding to my position if the stock falls in response to management's comments on Tuesday.Thank you for taking the time to read my latest article.

"MPLX LP: A Worthy Prospect, But Not The Best Out There","In my opinion, some of the best prospects in this market today are those companies that operate midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets. Examples of these assets include pipelines, storage facilities, terminals for handling commodities and finished products created from commodities, and more. EvenEven though I am active in analyzing companies in the midstream space, I have not dug in too much into MPLX LP since  back in May of 2019. At that time, the company had agreed to acquire Andeavor Logistics at an equity value of  8.67 billion. Since those days, management has succeeded in further growing the company. But before we get into the fundamental data, it might be helpful to discuss some of its assets.The best way to do this, I believe, is to break the firm up into its . The first of these is known as the L S, or Logistics and Storage, segment. Through this unit, the company focuses on gathering, transporting, storing, and distributing crude oil, refined products, renewable energy sources, and more. The segment also is involved in refining logistics, the operation of terminals, the oversight of rail facilities, the operation of storage caverns, and other similar activities. As of the end of the firm's 2022 fiscal year, this segment included 15,105 miles of holy and jointly owned pipelines and associated storage assets. It also controlled refining logistics assets for 13 refineries, 89 terminals, and a variety of other properties.Next in line, we have the G P segment, also known as the Gathering and Processing segment. This unit, unsurprisingly, is involved in activities such as the gathering, processing, and transportation of natural gas. However, it also provides similar activities, including also fractionation and storage, for NGLs. These assets, at the end of the 2022 fiscal year, boasted 10.4 Bcf per day of gathering capacity as well as 12 Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity. On top of this, the company also had fractionation and de-ethanization capacity that totaled 829 thousand barrels per day.One of the things that makes MPLX LP most interesting and unique is its ownership structure. Approximately 65  of the company's outstanding shares are owned by  . That company also has a non-economic ownership over the general partner of MPLX LP. The remaining 35  of outstanding stock, as well as all of the 29.5 million preferred units of the company, are owned by the public. In addition to having control over MPLX LP, Marathon also is responsible for about 47  of the company's revenue, making it, by far, its largest customer.In terms of overall financial performance, MPLX LP has been a really great enterprise. In the chart above, you can see that all of the company s most important financial metrics have improved over the three years ending in 2022. Revenue jumped from  7.57 billion to  11.61 billion. But even more important than that would be the earnings and cash flow results of the company. The firm went from a net loss of  842 million in 2020 to a net profit of  3.82 billion last year. Operating cash flow grew from  4.52 billion to  5.02 billion. If we adjust for changes in working capital, we get an increase from  4.72 billion to  5.14 billion. DCF, also known as distributable cash flow, grew from  4.20 billion to  4.85 billion, while EBITDA increased from  5.21 billion to  5.78 billion. Another metric I like to look at in this space is what I refer to as  true free cash flow . This is derived from taking adjusted operating cash flow and only stripping out maintenance capital expenditures from it. This prevents the company in question from being punished for its growth-oriented capital expenditures. Over the past three years, this metric expanded from  4.58 billion to  4.98 billion.As you can see in the chart above, financial performance for the  is also looking up compared to the same time one year earlier. Yes, revenue is lower year over year. However, profits and cash flows continue to grow. This growth has been made possible in large part by continued spending on growth-oriented initiatives. Over the past three fiscal years, management has allocated  2.40 billion toward capital expenditures. Of this amount,  2.06 billion was focused on growth initiatives, with the rest in the form of maintenance spending. Last year alone, MPLX LP allocated  712 million toward its growth initiatives. This year is slated to be even higher. Total spending should be around  950 million, with  800 million of it attributable to growth.Realistically, investors should expect this kind of capital allocation to continue for the next few years at least. Between , for instance, management is allocating an unknown amount of capital toward three different pipeline expansion projects and two complete under the L S segment. The investments here will increase gas transportation capacity by no less than 4.7 Bcf per day, and will increase NGL capacity by 75 thousand barrels per day. Of course, these are not projects that the company has 100  ownership interest in. In fact, the smallest of these projects they own only 5  of. In addition though, the firm is also allocating capital toward four different projects under the G P unit. These are all 100  owned and well, collectively, boost capacity by 200 MMcf per day once completed.One concern that many investors might have is that it is true that the days of fossil fuels are numbered. But those days add up to decades, not just years. According to energy behemoth  , for instance, global energy demand is  by 14.4  from 2021 through 2050. Actual oil demand should grow by 5.7  over that window of time, while gas demand should climb an impressive 21.7 . So between now and at least 2050, MPLX LP and companies like it should be in a good position to generate significant cash flows for shareholders. in MillionsIf we continue the pace that we have so far this year, MPLX LP should achieve the financial metrics shown in the table above. These are modest improvements, but improvements all the same. It is worth noting that achieving the EBITDA that I forecasted of  5.81 billion should translate to a net leverage ratio for the company of 3.38. And this excludes any additional cash flows that might reduce net leverage between the end of the second quarter of this year and the end of the final quarter of this year.Taking the aforementioned financial metrics, I was then able to create the chart above. In it, you can see just how cheap shares are on a forward basis. You can also see how shares are priced using data from 2022. As part of my analysis, I took two of these metrics and compared the company to five similar firms. On a price to operating cash flow basis, I found that only two of the five companies ended up being cheaper than MPLX LP. This number increases modestly to three out of the five if we rely on the EV to EBITDA approach.I must say that, for the most part, I really like what I see when I look at MPLX LP. The company seems to be in solid shape. Leverage is under control. Shares are attractively priced. And on top of all of this, management continues to invest in growth initiatives in order to create even more shareholder value down the road. Relative to similar firms, MPLX LP looks to be closer to fair value. Plus there are certain risks associated with having such a large shareholder and customer like Marathon. These risks are small and would likely not materialize because the pain inflicted on MPLX LP would also hurt Marathon. But a risk is a risk all the same. Because of these factors, I've decided to rate the company only a  buy  as opposed to something more aggressive. But I have no doubt that, in the long run, it will go on to create attractive value for its shareholders.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Noble Corporation Can Rise Further As Offshore Rig Capacity Remains Scarce,"Shares of Noble Corporation  have been a tremendous performer over the past year, rising by about 50 . The offshore drilling sector faced carnage from the 2014-2020 period as oil prices crashed several times, creating a glut of debt-financed rigs. However, thereIn the company s , it earned  0.38 in adjusted EPS. This was below last year s  0.40, though its acquisition of Maersk Drilling impacts comparability. Contract revenue rose sequentially from  575 million to  606 million. EBITDA was  188 million up sequentially from  138 million, thanks to a strong 29  margin. With these results, Noble generated  104 millionThere is strong demand for offshore rigs, particularly in deep and ultradeep waters relative to the available supply. Accordingly, NE has 90  utilization for its marketed floaters  used for deeper, more complex projects . Its jack-up fleet is less utilized at 62 , though floaters earn day rates about 2.5x as high, making them a more important driver of earnings.This divergence in utilization is driven somewhat by geography. Industry-wide, West Africa is the major hot spot and has 100  utilization, while Gulf of Mexico is 96 . The North Sea is lagging, and this is where many of its jack-ups have been positioned. If North Sea demand does not rise, Noble has noted these jacks-ups can be re-deployed into stronger regions to generate revenue.Given these solid results, Noble reiterated its guidance for full year EBITDA of about  775 million on about  2.45 billion revenue. In my view, this should lead to free cash flow of about  350 million, normalizing for any working capital movements. NE is returning this to investors with  165 million in repurchase over the past year. Subsequent to Q2, Noble launched a  dividend, speaking to its confidence in the sustainability of its cash flow.Its backlog plays a significant role in this confidence. As of August 2, Noble has a  5 billion backlog. Offshore rigs are contracted out for long periods of time, particularly floaters, given the fact deepwater projects are long-cycle, and both the producer and rig-owner need visibility on costs and availability. Jack-ups, which are more mobile and can operate in shallower waters, tend to recontract over shorter time periods. Its existing backlog is already at about 66  of its Q2 revenue run-rate, likely enough to keep it free cash flow breakeven absent a single new contract.Of course, it is signing up new contracts. Last quarter, it added  750 million to its backlog, 1.25x its contract revenue, pointing to solid contracting activity where demand continues to outstrip its supply. The backlog is also well-priced with a  405k floater day rate and  180k for jack-ups on average though I see upside from here. There are also  tier 1 ultra-deepwater ships left in inventory, so if companies want to keep drilling and exploring at their current pace, they will need to re-up existing contracts.In practice, producers plan not to just sustain offshore activity, but to increase it. According to  , the 2022-2025 period should see  200 billion invested in deepwater up 90  from 2016-2019 levels. This is supported by what companies have announced. For instance, Guyana is a tremendous growth market with Exxon Mobil , a key Noble partner, proposing yet another project worth  that will run through much of this decade. In Brazil, there are plans to spend  on infrastructure with increased exploration activity by Petrobras  a major contributor, which will further add to PBR s demand for rigs.This comes against a backdrop where Russia and Saudi Arabia have  they are extended their oil production cuts through year-end. The Israeli-Gaz conflict also reminds investors that much of the world s oil supply comes from a geographically fragile region. Plus, oil demand is still rising, with the International Energy Agency forecasting a  by the end of 2028.This all points to increased demand for offshore rigs. Critically, there is simply no new supply on the horizon to meet them. Also, it would take about three years to build a new rig. This is why there is no inventory in 2020, we were in the grips of the pandemic, no one was going to build more deepwater vessels. This means inventory is essentially locked in until 2027. Plus given construction costs, NE says it would need a 10-year contract at  650k to justify the capital investment. That is still well above current market levels. As such, the floater population remains well below the 2011-2014 level, keeping prices up.When I look at the offshore rig market, I actually see similarities to the US housing market. In articles on companies like  ,I spoke how a lack of building in the 2010s caused us to have a shortage of housing, which is why prices have risen so much and have held high despite the rise in mortgage rates. Something similar has happened in the offshore market, which was decimated first by prices plunging in 2015-2016, and then again in 2020. Management teams are deeply scarred by that experience and unwilling to do speculative newbuilds. This is likely to keep supply persistently tight.Noble is no exception to this  it was one of several drillers to file for bankruptcy in 2020. That process though means this new Noble is a fundamentally stronger entity. A decade ago, this company carried debt of over  5 billion, almost all of which was wiped out. Today, it carries just  330 million of net debt for a leverage ratio of 0.5x. Its balance sheet is pristine. Not only is it not debt-financing new construction, it is not even equity-financing new construction, instead returning free cash flow to investors.Importantly, Noble is also well positioned in the industry as it is the  1 drilling partner for some of the largest oil majors, including Exxon Mobil , Shell, and TotalEnergies. As noted above, XOM is aggressively growing its presence in Guyana while Shell recently dropped its plan to let  fall over time, given ongoing demand growth. It has also signed new contracts with Petrobras  in fact South America saw more activity in H1 2023 than all of 2022.The offshore market is fundamentally changed. We have shifted from having drillers bet on rising demand by building new ships. Instead, they are deeply scarred by the collapse they have seen, which is keeping inventory extremely tight. Just as we have seen in housing, in the face of rising demand, I expect this means prices will rise, likely eventually having to near the  650k level required to support fleet growth.Over time, if Noble can recontract at the  575 level, cutting the spread below replacement cost in half, free cash flow would rise by about  360-390 million, and this assumes no benefit from re-deploying its jack-up fleet. This would more than double the company s free cash flow, though even if market conditions reached that point tomorrow, it would likely take about 3 years to see NE hit the  700 million free cash flow level, given its backlog is largely priced already. Still, this positions Noble for significant annual free cash flow growth for several years.Because it takes several years to build ships, a sudden increase in supply is not a near-term risk for Noble, or even a medium-term one. I do believe the industry has learnt its lesson about overbuilding. Still over the longer term, if we were to see newbuild construction begin to take place, that could eventually lead to over-supply. For now, with no newbuild activity, that risk is unlikely to hit the market for at least 3-5 years.Rather, the primary risk would be a drop in oil prices back to  60 or lower, which makes the economics of offshore production more challenged. Importantly, with its backlog and low debt levels, NE is much better positioned for this risk in the past and can weather such a storm, though buybacks would stop. With 2 3 of its revenue contracted next year, NE would be more exposed to an oil price drop in 2025 than one in the next 12 months. Recessions tend to reduce oil demand and would be a risk. However, given rising demand for oil and already announced plans to drill offshore by major explorers like Exxon, I view this risk as low, absent a significant recession and am assuming oil stays in the  75-100 area, where offshore economics work. Still, if you are bearish on oil, I would not invest in Noble Corp, as that will be an environment less conducive to offshore exploration and production.Over the very long-term, rising renewables production may lead to lower crude oil demand, but this is an issue still many years with oil demand still rising. I would note that if the West stopped sanctioning Russian oil, allowing those exports to return to normal, the need for drilling elsewhere would decline, and this would likely reduce offshore rates. That seems unlikely anytime soon with the Ukraine war still raging.For Noble specifically, the key will be continuing to contract its vessels as their current contracts mature  given strong market utilizations, this should not be difficult, so long as the oil price environment remains similar. The company spends about  350 million year to refurbish its rigs and extend their useful life. In an inflationary environment, these costs can rise, which could reduce free cash flow. That said, this inflation would also likely make it more expensive to build new rigs, which would help to further limit supply and likely lead to higher rig prices over time. Overall, I view risks as manageableWith a  7 billion market cap, Noble is trading with a 5  free cash flow yield, which for an industry that has historically been quite cyclical  though as I have argued, management reaction functions have changed meaningfully  feels full. For comparison, equipment rental companies, like   have a 7  free cash flow yield, though they do not have the growth potential, given there is not a lack of equipment like is rigs. Using the 575k recontacting scenario, you can see how free cash flow accelerates as it recontracts ships below. Using a 10  discount rate and assuming its multiple contracts to result in an 8  FCF yield, this analysis provides a fair value of  54, about 12  higher than current levels.With jack-up re-deployment and share repurchases below its fair value price, this estimate is likely to be conservative if the gradual recontacting towards  575k occurs. If one kept a constant 5  free cash flow yield, fair value would be  80. However, I think this current 20x FCF multiple is pricing in the growth that is likely coming and as that occurs, we will see multiples contract. I used a slightly higher FCF yield than URI trades at to be conservative.I expect NE to earn about  2.25 over the next 12 months for a 21.3x P E. At my  700 million free cash flow target, Noble will be earnings about  4.85-5.00 share in 3 years, translating to about 30  annual earnings growth rate the next three year, for a PEG  price earnings to earnings growth rate  of about 0.7x. With a PEG below 1, NE is well positioned to grow into its multiple, particularly as it can return essentially all of its free cash flow to investors via dividends and buybacks given its very strong balance sheet.This analysis shows that even after a strong run, NE has further upside. Even without getting to newbuild breakevens, seeing jack-up improvement, or being able to sustain an expanded multiple, NE s strong free cash flow trajectory can support a higher share price. Over the next year as we see NE able to recontract at higher rates and drive cash flow higher, I expect to see shares continue to rise. I am targeting a share price of  55-60, as I expect NE to be able to outperform some of these conservative metrics I laid out. I would be buyer here.

"Taiwan Semiconductor, Arizona discuss adding advanced chip packaging capacity - report","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  and Arizona are in discussions about adding advanced chip packaging capacity to the company's facility in the state, Bloomberg News reported citing Governor Katie Hobbs.Hobbs is part of a U.S. delegation visiting Taiwan, with discussions among officialsAdvanced packaging allows multiple devices, such as electrical, mechanical or semiconductor, to be merged and packaged as a single electronic device.TSM has not announced plans to build facilities for advanced chip packaging in the U.S., according to a Reuters' .Part of our efforts at building the semiconductor ecosystem is focusing on advanced packaging, so we have several things in the works around that right now,  Hobbs said, as per the Reuters' report.The company's commitment to Arizona now spreads across two fabs and  40B in investment and adding advanced packaging to these efforts would again raise the ceiling on what is possible to produce there, the Bloomberg report noted.During the Q2 earnings call in July, TSM  that it was pushing back the start of production from the new plant to 2025, from 2024, in part due to insufficient amount of skilled workers needed for equipment installation.Packaging has become an obstacle in the fabrication of the most in-demand silicon today, Nvidia's  artificial intelligence, or AI, accelerators, made by TSM. The company has pledged to expand its packaging capacity in Taiwan, but anticipates supplies to be tight for another 18 months, said Chairman Mark Liu at Semicon earlier this month, according to the Bloomberg report.In December, TSM had said that it would offer more advanced 4-nanometer chips from its Arizona plant, at the request of one of its biggest customers, Apple , the report added.Liu had said during the Q2 earnings call that TSM had been sending technicians from Taiwan to train the local skilled workers, but for a short period of time the company expects the production of the N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025.Arizona and TSM are  working through some bugs,  Hobbs said, but she is  very impressed by the speed with which it has been built  and the project continues on schedule, the Bloomberg report noted.",30,2023-09-19T05:03:56.000-04:00
Simon Property Group: 7.1% Yield Is Not Enough,"  offers a high-dividend yield, but there are other better alternatives in the REIT retail segment.Simon Property Group is a self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT  that owns shopping malls and other retail assets acrossSPG is also the largest shareholder of  , a French REIT that owns shopping malls that , giving it indirect exposure to this industry in Europe.Nevertheless, the vast majority of its revenues come from rental income  about 95  and more than 90  of its revenues are generated in the U.S., being therefore not much diversified by this measures compared to otherAt the end of last June, its property portfolio had a gross value of about  38.7 billion, plus it also had stakes in Taubman Realty Group  valued at nearly  3 billion , Klepierre  1.5 billion  and other unconsolidated entities in the value of  3.4 billion.Historically, the company has a good growth history since it has been a public company 30 years ago, both through acquisitions and new developments, a strategy that is not expected to change in the near future.As I've  on  , the penetration of e-commerce sales has steadily increased over the past decade in the U.S., and this trend is likely to continue over the next few years. While this is positive for a company like Prologis, which owns warehouses that are key for online retailers to distribute goods in a rapid pace to customers, this structural trend is a headwind for SPG that relies heavily on physical store sales.However, this does not mean that shopping malls and retail centers will gradually cease to exist, but they have to adapt to the current market landscape. Indeed, following the pandemic and a big shift of retail sales to online channels, physical sales have recovered much faster than most predicted, showing that shopping malls are still attractive to customers and an important sales channel for retailers.Occupancy has recovered from low points in late 2020 and early 2021 as traffic recovered, and the operating profitability of SPG has also recovered to levels similar to 2019. This also shows that SPG has a quality portfolio in well located areas, being a key factor for long-term resilience of its business model. While some malls are struggling, top-tier malls are maintaining strong levels of occupancy and have seen a rapid recovery to levels close to pre-pandemic, plus physical retail sales also recovered to levels close to 2019.This landscape bodes well for SPG, which is mainly focused on top-tier malls, supporting its growth prospects in the near term. Moreover, retailers are increasingly following an omni-channel strategy, combining both online retail and physical stores to boost overall sales, which means that quality and well-located shopping malls should continue to be valued assets for the foreseeable future, despite the expected rise in penetration of e-commerce on overall retail sales.Regarding its financial performance, SPG has a mixed performance over the past few years given that its business was naturally negatively impacted by COVID-19, which impacted mainly its financial performance during 2020 21. However, as shown in the next graph, its business recovered quite rapidly compared to pre-COVID, especially regarding its business profitability.Despite that, SPG's  amounted to some  5.29 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.4  YoY, but still some 8  below its 2019 level. This increase in revenue is justified by higher rental income, which amounted to  4.9 billion in 2022 and represented some 93  of total revenue during the last year, which is justified both by higher occupancy rates across its portfolio  94.9  at the end of 2022 vs. 93.4  in 2021  and higher base minimum rent per square meter foot.Due to good cost control during the last year, despite the inflationary environment, SPG increased its comparable free funds from operations  FFO  to  4.45 billion  3.5  YoY , or  11.87 per share, which was slightly ahead of its revenue growth.During the first six months of 2023, SPG maintained a relatively positive operating momentum compared to the same period of last year, given that its occupancy rate and rent base have improved compared to the same period of 2022, which led also led slightly higher revenues and stable earnings.In H1 2023, SPG's revenues amounted to  2.72 billion, up by 5.6  YoY, supported by lease income growth of 4.2  YoY in this period. Total expenses increased to nearly  1.4 billion, an increase of 5.3  YoY, which means that SPG's operating leverage was quite low over the last six months justifying flat earnings growth in this period.Indeed, its  was  2.1 billion in the first semester, flat compared to H1 2022, or  5.62 per share  vs.  5.61 in H1 2022 , while its net income was  938 million  vs.  923 million in H1 2022 . Regarding cash flow, SPG has a very good cash generation capacity given that its free cash flow was about  2.1 billion during the first six months of the year.SPG also upgraded slightly its guidance for the full year, and now expects FFO to be between  11.85-11.95 per share, which is slightly ahead of 2022 level. Going forward, SPG is likely to maintain positive top-line growth, but earnings are likely to remain pressured by higher borrowing costs, while over the medium to long term growth is mainly supported by its investments in new space.Regarding its balance sheet, due to its large size and good credit profile the company has been able to refinance bonds over the past few months, even though at higher costs, leading to a liquidity position of  8.8 billion. Furthermore, its refinancing needs over the next couple of years are manageable, at some  2.5 billion in 2024 and  1.6 billion in 2025, thus SPG is not expected to have any issues on refinancing in the near term. On the other hand, its leverage position was acceptable at the end of last quarter, given that its net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.2x, a higher ratio than compared to other REITs that have a more conservative position.Nevertheless, as the company has a good cash flow generation capacity and plenty of quality assets that it may eventually dispose to reduce debt levels, I don't think its leverage position will be an issue in the short to medium term.Therefore, SPG can use a great part of its cash flow generation to distribute dividends to shareholders, even though its  is not great given that its business was impacted significantly by COVID-19 and the company had to cut its dividend in 2020. At the time, SPG cut its quarterly dividend from  2.10 per share to  1.30, but has been gradually increasing the dividend over the past two years.Its current quarterly dividend is  1.90 per share, representing an  of 8.6  YoY, but is still below its 2020 level. This means its annual dividend is now  7.60 per share, which at its current share price leads to a forward dividend yield of about 7.1 . Moreover, this assumes that SPG will not increase even further its quarterly dividend over the next year, which is quite unlikely.Indeed, SPG's payout ratio based on FFO per share is only 64  based on the bottom of its 2023 FFO guidance, which seems to be a conservative payout ratio and can easily be increased in the near future. However, this doesn't seem to be expected by the street currently given that, according to analysts' , SPG's dividend is expected to be  7.81 per share in 2024 and grow to  8.01 in 2025 and  8.20 in 2026. This seems to be conservative and SPG may increase its dividend above expectations in the coming quarters, which would be supportive for its share price in near future.Simon Property Group is largely exposed to top-tier shopping malls, which protects its business, to some extent, from structural headwinds for bricks-and-mortars retailers due to the steady rise of e-commerce sales. Nevertheless, after a strong recovery from pandemic lows, its recent growth and prospects aren't particularly impressive over the medium term.Not surprisingly, the market is not valuing SPG at a high multiple, given that its shares are currently  at only 8.8x FFO, at a discount to the average of its retail peers, which trade at about 10.9x FFO. Due to a relatively low share price  its shares are trading below 50  its peak in 2016 , SPG currently offers a dividend yield of more than 7 , which at first sight seem to be attractive to income investors.However, from a yield perspective, this is not much higher than   for instance, which , and is a better long-term investment in my opinion than SPG due to superior fundamentals and growth prospects. Therefore, while SPG currently offers a high-dividend yield, this doesn't seem to be enough to make it an interesting income play presently.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 10 30 AM ETBlake Mueller - FTI ConsultingKevin Matz - EVP, Shared ServicesAnthony Guzzi - Chairman, President   CEOMark Pompa - EVP   CFOBrent Thielman - D.A. Davidson   Co.Adam Thalhimer - Thompson, Davis   CompanyGood morning. My name is Betsy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EMCOR Group Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.  Operator Instructions .Please note this event is being recorded. Mr. Blake Mueller with FTI Consulting, you may begin.Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the EMCOR Group conference call. We are here today to discuss the company's 2023 third quarter results, which were reported this morning.I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Matz, Executive Vice President of Shared Services, who will introduce management. Kevin, please go ahead.Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. And as always, thank you for your interest in EMCOR, and welcome to our earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2023. For those of you who are accessing this call via the Internet and our website, welcome as well. We hope you have arrived at the beginning of our slide presentation that will accompany our remarks today. We are on Slide 2. This presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements and may contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Page 2 describes in detail the forward-looking statements and the non-GAAP financial information disclosures. I encourage everyone to review both disclosures in conjunction with our discussion and accompanying slides.Slide 3, excuse me, depicts the executives who are with me to discuss the quarter and 9 months results. TheyFor call participants not accessing the conference call via the Internet, this presentation, including the slides, will be archived in the Investor Relations section of our website under Presentations. You can find us at emcorgroup.com.With that said, please let me turn the call over to Tony.Thanks, Kevin, and good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to start on Pages 4 through 6. In my remarks, I will focus on the third quarter primarily, and Mark will speak in more detail on our quarterly and year-to-date results. At the end of my remarks, I will discuss some of the key drivers of our performance. Today, we are announcing a series of record quarterly achievements, revenues, gross profit, operating income, operating income margin, diluted EPS and remaining performance obligations or RPOs. Driving this performance is strong end market demand for our services, especially in semiconductors, data centers, manufacturing, health care and retrofit projects. This demand, coupled with excellent execution, has produced outstanding results, not only a quarterly basis but also for year-to-date 2023. For the third quarter, we earned  3.61 in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share on  3.21 billion in revenues. We grew revenues 13.5  overall with 12.8  organic revenue growth. We had an adjusted operating margin of 7.4 , which is exceptional by any measure. However, I would like to remind you that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix, execution and timing of projects, most of which worked in our favor this quarter.Our operating cash flow for the third quarter was strong at  261 million, which represents over 100  operating income conversion. On a year-to-date basis, we generated  476 million in operating cash flow, which represents a conversion of 81 . Our RPOs are an all-time high of  8.6 billion, which represents -- excuse me, represents 4.2  sequential growth from June 30, 2023, and 21.6  growth over the year-ago period. This was exceptional performance by an extraordinary team. On a segment basis, we had excellent performance in our Electrical and Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services segment. The operating results of our Industrial Services segment continue to improve at a modest pace. And despite difficult economic conditions, our U.K. Building Services segment is reporting operating income and operating margin which is greater than a year-ago period. The continued strength of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments is evidenced by quarterly revenue growth of 10.1  and 19.9 , respectively. With Mechanical Construction operating margin of 10.4  and Electrical Construction operating margin of 9.1 , the conversion from revenue to operating income by these segments has exceeded our expectation. We had excellent execution and great project mix. Across the country, we continue to complete some of the most sophisticated projects in markets such as the high-tech manufacturing sector, which includes semiconductors, the EV value chain, biotech, life sciences and pharmaceuticals, the EV value chain and the network and communications sector, which encompasses our data center work  the manufacturing sector, which is driven by reshoring and domestic capacity expansion as well as the healthcare sector.Our industry-leading capabilities in BIM, prefabrication, project planning and labor sourcing and the management of that labor and the training of that labor enable us to perform for our customers while also achieving superior financial returns. Our mechanical product offering is broad across applications such as HVAC, process, piping, plumbing and fire protection and fire life safety. We are operating in the key geographies where such projects are in process, and our fire life safety group has the capability to move across the country. Our customers look to us to perform complex installations in the markets I just referenced. Our Electrical Construction team has deep expertise in the data center market as well as our Mechanical Construction team, which allows us to serve our customers with the right solution delivered under the most demanding schedules with excellent outcomes for our customers. As I have mentioned on earlier calls, our segment and subsidiary management teams are leading in an exceptional manner. And they're allocating resources in a thoughtful and pragmatic way while working towards outstanding outcomes for our customers and for you, our shareholders, and that's how they produce these outstanding financial results.Our U.S. Building Services segment continues to perform well and has a strong mix of work across its service lines. The segment's revenues grew 13.7  in the third quarter with an operating margin of 7 . Demand persists for our mechanical services with excellent execution across retrofit projects, building controls and maintenance and repairs. We are working across a variety of end markets, including traditional and high-tech manufacturing. And our institutional and commercial customers remain focused on energy efficiency and IAQ upgrades. We did experience a strong repair service season because of the heat that blanketed most parts of the country over this past summer.The Mechanical Services business is driving the robust performance of the segment on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, and the overall trends for this business remain positive. The site-based services division continues to deliver entering into multiyear facility maintenance contracts to leverage our self-perform operating model for skilled trades people and operating engineers. As a result, there continues to remain areas of growth in this -- there continue -- remains opportunities for growth for this service line. However, these contracts take some time to ramp up. And scope for these contracts can expand, reduce or return  indiscernible  over time and upon rebid. Our Industrial Services segment continues to improve at an expected pace. It is important to remember that the third quarter is typically a weak quarter for field services, contributing to the near breakeven operating income reported by this segment this quarter. We anticipate executing a fall turnaround season that is comparable to the prior year, and demand for our new services is robust. We are experiencing increased levels of capital spending, which then drives demand in our shop services division in the form of greater new build heat exchange orders. We continue to wait for the resumption of demand for utility scale solar projects, which continues to be affected by supply chain issues. And we are well positioned to perform such projects when these issues subside. Our U.K. business continues to perform in a manner consistent with the available market opportunities. Building on its normal base of facility services contracts, EMCOR U.K. continues to perform various project work for its customers. Much of that work is aimed at helping them develop and implement multiple multiyear energy reduction programs. Although we experienced a reduction in quarterly revenues within this segment, we are executing well as shown by the 8  operating margin during the quarter.Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting both our organic growth and the capital needed to invest in such growth, whether through expanding our prefabrication capabilities or investment in BIM, automation and robotics. We also have the firepower to make bolt-on acquisitions that help us expand our capabilities in support of our customers. Great quarter. And Mark, I'll let you talk about the rest of it.Great. Thank you, Tony, and good morning to everyone participating on the call today. We are now on Slide 7 for those of you who are accessing this presentation via the webcast.Over the next several slides, I will augment Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's third quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through September 30. All financial information referenced this morning is derived from our consolidated financial statements included in both our earnings release announcement and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's third quarter performance. Consolidated revenues of  3.21 billion are up  381.2 million or 13.5  over quarter 3 2022. Each of our domestic reportable segments experienced revenue growth during the third quarter. Excluding  20.4 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's quarter, revenues for the third quarter of 2023 increased 12.8  when compared to the third quarter of 2022. Before reviewing the operating results of our individual reporting segments, I would like to reiterate what Tony highlighted earlier that our  3.21 billion of quarterly revenues represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record for the company and eclipses the previous record set during the second quarter.The specific to each of our reportable segment's third quarter revenue performance is as follows. United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of  697.4 million increased  64 million or 10.1  from quarter 3 2022. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, this segment's revenues grew 8.1  organically quarter-over-quarter. Consistent with its second quarter performance, the segment continues to experience revenue growth across most of the market sectors that they serve. Such quarterly revenue growth was most prevalent within the network and communications, healthcare, manufacturing and industrial and hospitality and entertainment market sectors. Revenues of our United States Mechanical Construction segment of  1.33 billion increased  221 million or a strong 19.9  from the year-ago period. This revenue growth continues to be driven by increased activity within the high-tech manufacturing, traditional manufacturing, network and communications and commercial market sectors.Consistent with its performance during the first 6 months of the year, this segment is experiencing growth in both fire and life safety as well as traditional mechanical services. Increased demand is stemming from customer projects supporting the design and manufacturing of semiconductors as well as the production and development of electric vehicles and or related battery technologies. This, in conjunction with further data center development opportunities as well as the domestic reshoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers are all contributing factors to the Mechanical Construction segment, establishing a new all-time quarterly record of revenue during the third quarter.Our combined United States construction revenues of  2.03 billion increased  285 million or 16.4 , crossing the  2 billion quarterly revenue threshold for the first time and establishing a combined all-time quarterly revenue record for construction services.United States Building Services revenues of  817.7 million increased  98.3 million or 13.7 , representing a new all-time quarterly revenue record for this segment. Excluding incremental acquisition revenues, the segment's revenues grew 12.6  organically.Revenue growth was experienced across each of the 3 divisions with the largest contribution coming from mechanical services. Specifically, we benefited from an increase in HVAC project and retrofit revenues due to increased availability of equipment and materials when compared to 2022, which faced greater supply chain delays. There also continues to be strong demand for certain of the segment's service offerings as our customers seek ways to improve the energy efficiency and or indoor air quality of their facilities.Lastly, both the segment's commercial and government site-based services divisions experienced incremental project revenues in the third quarter of the current year as a result of new customer additions or scope and site expansion with existing customers.EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of  252.2 million increased  4.9 million or 2  quarter-over-quarter. Although not as substantial as the revenue growth of our other domestic reporting segments, we are pleased by the trend of period-over-period growth that this segment has achieved the last few years despite the sustained headwinds within the oil and gas industry. Contributing to the growth in the current quarter was a resumption of capital spending by several of our customers in the form of increased new build heat exchanger orders as well as certain renewable fuel projects.United Kingdom Building Services segment revenues of  110.7 million represents a reduction of  7 million or 5.9  from last year's third quarter. The period-over-period revenue decline is a result of the nonrenewal of certain facilities maintenance contracts, which were still active in 2022 as well as the reduction in project activity as certain of this segment's customers have slowed their capital spending programs in light of the macroeconomic headwinds within the United Kingdom.Please turn to Slide 8. Reported operating income for the quarter was  235 million or 7.3  of revenues and favorably compares to  150.1 million of operating income or 5.3  of revenues a year ago. Consistent with my revenue commentary and Tony's opening remarks, the current quarter's consolidated operating income and operating margin each represent new all-time quarterly records for EMCOR. Included within our reported operating income is a small impairment charge of  2.4 million related to certain long-lived assets within our United States Mechanical Construction segment. On an adjusted basis, if such impairment charge was excluded, third quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income would be  237.3 million or 7.4  of revenues.Specific operating performance by segment is as follows. Our U.S. Electrical Construction segment earned operating income of  63.1 million, an increase of  27.6 million from the comparable 2022 period. The reported operating margin of 9.1  represents a significant increase from the 5.6  reported in last year's third quarter.Exceptional project execution, which Tony previously commented from each of our operating companies, coupled with a favorable revenue mix when compared to the 2022 period were the primary drivers of this performance. Such improved execution is demonstrated by a reduction of project write-downs as compared to last year's third quarter where certain discrete write-downs totaled  10.5 million and negatively impacted this segment's 2022 operating margin by 170 basis points. Besides a reduction in write-downs, this segment's operating income and operating margin for the third quarter of 2023 benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which positively impacted its operating margin in the quarter by 60 basis points.Third quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction segment of  138.5 million represents a  48 million increase from last year's quarter and operating margin of 10.4  represents 220 basis points of improvement from 2022's third quarter. Growth in both gross profit and gross profit margin due to a more favorable revenue mix, including a higher percentage of self-performed projects, were the most significant contributors to this overall improved performance.Additionally, in the Mechanical segment's operating income and operating margin for the quarter benefited from the successful closeout of certain projects, which resulted in 40 basis points of incremental operating margin. Operating income for U.S. Building Services is  57.2 million or 7  of revenues and compares to  46 million or 6.4  of revenues in 2022's third quarter.Similar to the growth in the segment's revenues, the increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by the segment's Mechanical Services division. Notably, we experienced favorable project execution of HVAC projects and retrofits as well as incremental building automation and controls activity.Our U.S. Industrial Services segment incurred an operating loss of approximately  200,000, which compares favorably to an operating loss of  1.4 million in last year's third quarter. As I have referenced in prior years and consistent with Tony's comment, quarter 3 is historically our Industrial segment's weakest quarter. However, we are encouraged by the trend of quarterly improvement within this segment, and we remain ready to assist our customers as they execute their maintenance and capital spending programs.U.K. Building Services operating income of  8.9 million or 8  of revenues represents an increase of  500,000 and a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. The performance of this segment is impressive considering the reduction in quarterly revenues previously discussed and demonstrates the strength of its portfolio of facilities maintenance contracts. We are now on Slide 9. Additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on the previous slides are as follows. Quarter 3 gross profit of  545.5 million represents an all-time quarterly gross profit record for the company and is higher than the comparable 2022 quarter by  132.2 million or 32 . And gross margin of 17  has improved 240 basis points.Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately  308.1 million represent 9.6  of revenues and reflect an increase of  45 million from quarter 3 2022. SG A for the current year's quarter includes approximately  4.2 million of incremental expenses from businesses acquired inclusive of intangible asset amortization, resulting in an organic SG A increase of  40.8 million.This quarter's organic growth in SG A was due to incremental expense pertaining to incentive compensation programs across the majority of our reportable segments. This is due to higher operating results to date when compared to the prior year as well as our revised profitability projections for full year 2023, which have necessitated our third upward revision in our annual earnings guidance. Tony will speak to our revised guidance range in detail following the conclusion of my commentary.Besides incentive compensation, we have experienced quarter-over-quarter growth in our personnel costs due to our continued double-digit organic revenue growth, which has necessitated increased headcount to support our back office and contract administration functions coupled with annual cost of living increases for our existing workforce. We have also experienced an escalation in occupancy costs due to inflationary pressures in the real estate market.Diluted earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2023 is  3.57 as compared to  2.16 per diluted share for the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned long-lived asset impairment charge, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was  3.61, which represents a  1.45 or 67.1  increase when compared to the  2.16 reported in last year's quarter. As Tony mentioned in his introductory remarks, our third quarter diluted EPS performance on either a GAAP or non-GAAP basis represents a new all-time record for EMCOR by a large margin. Please turn to Slide 10. With the quarter commentary complete, I will touch on some highlights with respect to our results for the first 9 months of 2023. Revenues of  9.14 billion represent an increase of  1.02 billion or 12.5 , of which 11.3  was generated from organic activities. Operating income of  586.6 million or 6.4  of revenues represents a 51.3  increase from the results for the first 9 months of 2022. We have experienced improved operating income and operating margin in each of our domestic reporting segments. Our year-to-date diluted earnings per share was  8.85, which compares to  5.50 in the corresponding 2022 period. Adjusting the current year to include the previously referenced impairment loss results in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of  8.88. Comparing this adjusted number to last year's reported EPS represents an improvement of 61.5  year-over-year. With substantial growth in our year-to-date net income plus the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding due to our share repurchases, EMCOR has been able to generate significant EPS growth.We are now on Slide 11. EMCOR's balance sheet maintains its strength and liquidity. And we continue to be well positioned to fund organic growth, return capital to shareholders and pursue strategic M A opportunities.Fluctuations of note when compared to December of 2022 are as follows. Cash on hand increased by just over  67 million. Our exceptional operating cash flow was partially offset by cash used for financing activities of  276.2 million, given a repayment of  142.8 million on our term loan and just over  105 million for the repurchase of our common stock as well as cash used for investing activities of  134 million as a result of capital expenditures and acquisitions to date.Resulting primarily from our organic growth during the period, our working capital balance has increased by nearly  128 million. The  34.2 million increase in goodwill is entirely a result of the 7 acquisitions completed by us thus far in 2023 while net identifiable intangible assets have increased by  6.8 million as the additional intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions were partially offset by  49 million of amortization expense in the first 9 months of the year.Total debt, exclusive of operating lease liabilities, has decreased by  143.2 million, almost entirely as a result of the previously mentioned  142.8 million voluntary principal payment made on our term loan. Our stockholders' equity balance has increased by  305.7 million as our net income for the 9-month period exceeded our share repurchases and dividend payments to date in 2023. EMCOR's debt to capitalization ratio has reduced to 4.4  from 11.1  at year-end 2022, given the reduction in borrowings under our credit agreement as well as the increase in stockholders' equity just referenced.With my prepared commentary for the third quarter now completed, I would now like to return the call back to Tony. TonyThanks, Mark. And I'm going to be on -- thanks, Mark. I'm going to be on Page 12. And look, we put this page in the last time, and we really got a lot of great feedback from our investors. And I like this page because it really talks about what's driving our business from a macro level and a micro level because there's some micro drivers in here. And these opportunities on this page is really what's driving our organic growth. It's been very strong. I mean, when you think about 12.8  organic growth in the quarter, you say what's driving that  It can't just be business as usual to do that. So if you go on this page, we're going to go left to right across the top of the box and then start over again on the bottom and go left to right, and we'll draw interconnections where appropriate. Let's talk about electrification in the EV value chain.We, as a management team, have done a lot of work around energy transition and the thought process behind it. I think we -- I know I personally landed on, this is not just an energy transition. It's an energy expansion because if you really want to fund other than the bottom-right box the rest of these things, you need more energy. And -- but we're going to have to do it not with just traditional sources. We're going to have to do it with traditional sources, renewable sources. There's going to be a lot of investment. There is a lot of investment.On the transition side, some of that investment has been held up by supply chain. That's not going to break easily, right, because things like transformers, inverters. You hear a lot about the panels, but the other ones are just supply chain issues where things have been pushed out 18 to 36 months for some products.But there's a lot of work going on around transition and to be prepared about that transition. Where we're going to play in that is supporting some of that transition. And then also on the electric vehicle and battery plant construction, there's a lot of discussion around this.So at the highest level, this trend right now is probably impacting our current results less than any of the other trends that you see on this page. But it is a trend that will impact our results.We're also going to be a user of some of these transition vehicles, right, whether they be hybrids or whether they be battery powered over time. So we're going to be in the construction, the supply chain of those plants that are going to support the EV plants and then also the battery plant construction.EMCOR has always been very careful of how we service the automotive sector, and we'll continue to be so. Right now, this is an electrical and fire life safety and fire protection opportunity for us, but it will expand beyond that.We do expect there to be more utility grade the way we think about it, massive number of charging stations at one location. We've done some of that and some of the big warehouses that have been built. But we haven't seen that proliferation yet, but we expect to -- for a lot of the last-mile delivery, a lot of these mass charging stations make a lot of sense.They're also supported by government incentive. So you sort of separate the noise of what's going on today, there's going to be a slower pickup. A lot of the things we do along this are for the infrastructure that's going to allow things that happen at a later date. And again, it's the box of all of these that's impacting our current results the least.You go in to say high-tech manufacturing, life sciences, and you got to sort of drag that bottom-middle box up into it because it's also a reshoring, nearshoring issue. We are very active in the semiconductor space, and we're in a lot of the right markets, both mainly mechanically but somewhat electrically in fire protection in the mechanical business as well as just straight mechanical work.And in some cases, we operate on the clean side, the high-purity piping and other places, we're doing both. We're doing the -- we call it the dirty side, but as far from dirty, it's the infrastructure to support that semiconductor plant.We're also doing some of the low-voltage offerings, and we have a pretty robust position in fire life safety and fire protection in those semiconductor plants. And then there's a whole ecosystem around those semiconductor plants that's built to support those semiconductor plants. And in that case, we're doing some of that work, but those are actually more significant maintenance opportunities for us versus semiconductor plants.On the pharma, biotech, life sciences, we are seeing it. We're seeing it in 2 ways. One is the reshoring, and we're seeing it also in the expansion of opportunity, right  These weight loss drugs are causing whole new plants to be built. And that's especially true in some of the hubs where we're most effective, whether that be New Jersey, Research Triangle Park or out into Southern California.And that links to nearshoring, especially for some of the plants that are being built to break the dependence on China and even India for pharmaceutical compounds. Government incentives continue to support that momentum, especially on the semiconductor side, but a lot of that was happening. What the government incentives will do is to elongate that cycle and bring more surety to that demand. When you get to data centers and connectivity, this is something we're pretty good at, right, both mechanically, electrically and fire protection, life safety. We're good at it. And so the demand drivers are -- they've been ubiquitous, and then AI just adds another boost to it. So go back to that first box, where we talked about electrification and energy transition. A data center uses a lot of power up to 50 to 100 megawatts. So to put that in perspective, 5,000 homes use less than 200 megawatts, and they use it intermittently. A data center is using 60 to 100 megawatts. So half of what 5,000 homes would do, it has to be continuous. It has to be clean. It has to be pure.And so if you think about that and then you think about where they're being built, we're in really good shape, both mechanically and electrically. I'd say we do data center construction as good as anybody in the country for those specialty trades and we're linked with the right customers. And there, you're also thinking about how you make them better for the owner, how you get the schedule quicker and how you continue to drive all across the top here, prefabrication, BIM, to allow a solution to be ready to be built. And we're always thinking about the value add we can do with design assist to help them get to the best cost solution for their data center needs. Great team here. We're active in about 5 or 6 markets. And we continue to look opportunities to support our customers, both from the GC and construction manager side but also the 5 major end owners that use these data centers. You get to healthcare, this is a market we've seen rebound since COVID. It's always been a good market for us because all the things that make those top boxes complicated, complicated systems, lots of systems coming together is true in a hospital between the med gases, the electrical, the backup generation, the power quality monitoring, the building control systems. Think about what goes into hospital. And that even goes beyond the hospitals we're trying to make more flexible, but also the outpatient facilities get more sophisticated every day. And it's in those hospitals and outpatient facilities. We also see an aftermarket opportunity that require the kind of services we offer, both with our mechanical services function, our aftermarket fire life safety business and also our site-based services. To get to reshoring, nearshoring, I'd go from the bottom up, there automation is allowing industries even beyond what we talked about to be reshored. And they have to, right  We used -- we went from a world where multiple suppliers, multiple plants, it's one supplier, multiple plants. So we got into a really bad place in our supply chain, not us EMCOR, right  We buy other people's stuff of one plant supplying, and that might be in China and people aren't comfortable with that.And so COVID brought that to a head. People were thinking about it beforehand. We've been investing in being able to support those customers for 10 years now. So you're seeing a lot of capacity shifting across a range of industries from tire manufacturing to other automotive manufacturing, auto parts manufacturing to textiles even coming back through automation. So a host of industries are returning and they're doing it to do not only -- I would say, it's capacity hardening and expansion.And finally, one of my favorites because I've been around it for 25 years is energy efficiency and sustainability around that energy efficiency. And we are known for what we do in HVAC control system and lighting retrofits.When we bought ECM, they have that capability, too, but they also have water reduction capability. And it's something as simple as how you fix the faucets, how you use smart plumbing facilities -- plumbing fixtures. And that can have a big impact. It's also helping our customers with their facilities footprint adjustment rationalization. It's making sure that folks can get the right utility rebates. It's adding in not on these massive utility scale solar or utility scale combined heat and power but local decentralized distributed generation. These are typically things that are 1 megawatt or less that can help shave the load but also provide more energy security and energy reduction when combined together with an HVAC or lighting or control system retrofit. There's government incentives. There are utility incentives. Our folks are expert of that. And we've carved out a niche in that market of not only doing the work directly for the owners, but also supporting just about all the ESCOs as they bring their solutions to life. And with that, I'm going to turn to Page 13 and sort of tie that into our RPOs on this page. Like we've said, this will show up by segment and market sector. We have great RPOs right now at  8.6 billion, right  That's a big level. It's up  1.5 billion from where we were in the year-ago period. And when they were  7.1 billion, we're pretty happy about that a year ago. Additionally, the third quarter bookings were strong with RPOs increasing almost  350 million from June, which was 1 -- anyway, you look at that, that's about a 4  sequential increase. Each of our 5 segments saw RPO growth in third quarter from the year-ago period.Domestic construction services RPO, which includes fire protection life safety projects are up over  1.3 billion in line with strong project demand that we've seen all year. Building services, which are anchored by that energy efficiency box and other retrofit box we talked before. So our RPOs increased 16  over last year's third quarter. RPOs by market sector tied back to the organic growth trends I talked on the previous page. If you zeroing on the actual activity, high-tech manufacturing, which includes those things, semiconductors, pharma, biotech, life sciences, R D and the electric vehicle value chain, they're up  716 million or 113  from the year-ago period. Network and communication, which includes our hyperscale data center work and our low voltage work stands at  1.4 billion. That's up 40  from third quarter of last year.We have over  1 billion in healthcare market sector RPOs as the hospital industry and the medical surgical patient industry continues to reshape post-pandemic. And they're also responding to demographic trends. We've discussed nearshoring and nearshoring and manufacturing. You see some of that in that high-tech manufacturing, but just traditional manufacturing, the way we think about it is up 30  year-over-year. RPOs also grew in the water and wastewater. We've talked about that before in institutional, and that's up 29 . And that's really for us, focused on the water and wastewater side in Florida, where we have great capability in that growing state that struggles to keep up with demand with infrastructure.If you're offsetting this increase, we've had some reduction in commercial, but it's not what you think. It's warehouse projects. We're very active a year ago, especially with our fire protection and life safety but also our electrical. That's down. You'd expect that to be down right now. There's been a lot of build there. The cold storage is still pretty good as well as the transportation market sector that tends to be very episodic for us. And that will come back at some point, but it's not what's driving our results today. We're well positioned in the sectors with strong growth characteristics. So to get ahead of you and your questions both for later in this call and also when you call us later to reiterate what we said on this call, we like our market mix, our contract mix and our margin mix and our RPOs. Now we've got to go execute. And hopefully, that all stays on track and scope doesn't expand and all that. I mean, all that sort of came together for us this quarter, but we do like our mix and backlog.If you go now, I'm going to be on Pages 14 to 16 to wrap this up. We've had exceptional performance this year. We had last year, too. And we're going to have another meaningful guidance increase. This results from favorable demand in strong end markets, coupled with excellent execution, strong project mix and timing and really a general absence of badness.We are raising our diluted EPS guidance based on our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance from a range of  10.75 to  11.25 to a range of  12.25 to  12.65 on a non-GAAP basis. We will also revise our revenue guidance. Approximately  12.5 billion. Now we had a range from  12 billion to  12.5 billion, we're going to be  12.5 billion now. As reflected in our RPOs and as discussed previously, we continue to win work in important strategic market sectors. We are executing our work with efficiency, discipline and precision as shown by our record operating margin. We are utilizing technology in BIM, prefabrication. And we're doing a great job managing our labor and managing our supply chain. And we do all this with delivering -- an eye toward delivering great results for our customers first and as a result, we deliver for you, our shareholders. As I stated earlier, it is important to remember that margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the mix execution and timing of projects. We evaluate our margin performance, our operating margin performance in ranges, and we've talked about that over a period of time. And our performance in the current quarter has yielded margins, operating margins at or above the high end of our historical ranges. Our team has shown great resilience in dealing with supply chain issues. They're still there. Lead times are terrible. And we continue to develop a strong bench from foreman to project managers to senior leadership. Further, we continue to attract notable talent from skilled labor through senior project and operations management. However, there are always things you need to consider and be prudent. We do remain concerned with the financial risk to our customers around higher interest rates and macro uncertainties posed by the Ukraine war, the war between Hamas and Israel, turmoil in the oil and gas markets, which will only get worse from those things and the dysfunction occurring in the U.S. government, which may lead to a government shutdown or the inability to fund key pieces of legislation.Additionally, while we do not believe the UAW strike will significantly impact us or our current projects, it may slow the release of future work within the EV value chain. Despite these challenges, we believe that we will be able to navigate them as we have in the past.Our team has always shown great resiliency. However, we do need to remain cognizant of these external factors and the potential impact on our execution and performance.We're going to continue to be balanced capital allocators. There continues to be opportunity within our acquisition pipeline. And with uncertainty in the financial markets, we believe that our strong balance sheet helps us win work on large, sophisticated projects as customers see our financial strength as just another reason to choose EMCOR.As always, I want to thank our entire EMCOR team for their dedication and hard work. We appreciate all you do every day for our customers first at EMCOR.With that, Betsy, I'll take questions.Operator Instructions . The first question today comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.Tony, maybe just coming back to Slide 12, when you think about -- you talked to the customers that comprise the markets that are all embedded in that slide. What do you think is the sensitivity to this interest rate environment  Because at this point, it doesn't seem like there's much.I would agree with you. We haven't seen it in our bidding or our opportunities. I think if you're going to see it anywhere, right, you'll see it in places that have the most far-out opportunity and the most strain on balance sheets. There's probably better people than me to talk about where that will be. But really, I think we see pretty good demand across most of these. And I think that it'll important, Brent, I think part of what you're driving at is what you typically see as some of this work unfolds after the initial activity comes on a site is, in general, projects then get let in smaller amounts, right, because we're there. And we're working with them to develop the add-on work and the next scope. So I think there's great demand in there yet. I think these are really good drivers, but nothing is literally up and to the right, right  There's always a little jags along the way. We haven't seen that recently, but history would say that, that will, in fact, happen. But the underlying drivers of this over a 5-year period should continue to be pretty strong.Yes. Okay. And the profitability of the business group is obviously a real standout, Tony. I hear you, the mix of business can have an impact in any given quarter on the margin. When you think about some of these kind of prevailing markets like data center or kind of large-scale manufacturing projects, healthcare, I mean, all of these require a certain level of technical capabilities that you guys have. Is that what you're referring to in terms of mix  And I guess why wouldn't that sustain going forwardYes. I think it's mix, but also contractual terms. Mark's talked about that, and I've talked about this in the past. The same project could be done, some of them may change their contractual terms because they haven't developed the scope, they think they should. So we'll maybe getting a GMP environment instead of a fixed price environment because that's going to protect us the most or we may get in an environment where the design wasn't frozen. We haven't been able to get design assist. And as a result of that, profitability can be delayed, right, Mark, because we'll -- the way the change orders get booked. So they can be a little chunky along the way. But clearly, where we do the best is when we know the work, we can do a fixed price contract, and we have more control of the schedule.Yes. And Brent, the only thing I would add to Tony's comment with regards to mix is clearly scope of services. Tony has commented in past calls that the last couple of years, we've seen fairly sizable growth in our fire protection and life safety services. That work tends to have a better profitability profile than traditional mechanical services.Additionally, a lot of the work we're performing now, a lot of the equipment that we're installing is being procured by our customers. If more of the equipment scope comes back into our future work, the mark-up we get on equipment is certainly less than we get on our labor. So that ultimately can impact margins when you're looking at them on a comparative period. It's still very good work. Certainly welcome the opportunity to perform all scope for our customers. But certainly, it changes the project profitability characteristics from a margin perspective.Yes, and building on that, right  We -- at the profitability levels we're at, we are much more focused on margin dollars right now than we are margin percentages and the growth they're in. And we don't control necessarily how people decide to let contracts and what that contract structure could be.The other thing along that, that I would add is, one of the changes that's happened in the market, and I don't see this changing, Brent. If you go back 10, 12 years on some of these jobs, what people would have tried to do is they would have tried to take these projects and break them up into small pieces as they can, which causes massive coordination issues on the job and that allows more contractors to bid.So there's a couple of things that have happened, right  With the rise of BIM even more ubiquitous and more complicated, coupled with the demand for prefabrication because it's the best way to get labor efficiency and reduce the need for craft labor on a job because they have plenty of work to do anyway, that it's much more difficult to do that.And so you're really looking for sophisticated contractors to be part of the team earlier, and you're working together to develop the best solution for the customer where before that we might have not got involved till 70 , 80 , 90 , a lot of times we're getting involved 40  to 60 , and we're not completing design. What we're doing is completing the design for constructability with design assist. And that makes a big difference about what kind of people we're working with and who they can work with.Okay. Very good. I guess my last question, I mean, your optimism here is duly noted, Tony. I guess any qualitative commentary you can offer for us on the outside looking in and how to think about the business into 2024  There's a lot of interesting drivers here. You expect the company to grow. I mean, anything that you can say about 2024 at this stage being a couple of months away hereYes. I mean we never give 2024 guide. You know that, and you're not asking for that. Actually, you're asking what's the external environment and how that could shape the environment we compete in. Look, I think energy markets remain really uncertain. And all of the energy -- when I  indiscernible  sort of the wrong word, all the anxiety that we felt at the start of the Ukraine war, if this horrible situation in Israel becomes even more expanded and more difficult through the rest of the Middle East, it's going to have a similar or worse effect than what that Ukraine issue did on energy markets. And so that could be a real issue, right, not only for us, right, as it's consumer of energy, we buy a lot of gasoline and diesel, but in the place that could happen therein, but also sort of what it does to global supply chains and the uncertainty around shipping. I mean, all of the things that come with that, right  I also think that the other thing that could sort of dampen -- again, I don't think it dampens, right  We're sitting here with  8.6 billion of RPOs off of a  7.1 billion a year ago print, which I think even then was up 30  from the previous year. So we have good momentum in RPOs. So it is what people's conviction going to be around sort of capital investment if inflation its ugly head because of labor costs and other people have or other things. So there's some macro indicators out there. Interest rates, in my mind, aren't going down. I think that's what our team believes here. We're going to run our balance sheet very prudent. But for those that are more extended, right, there's a lot of people with a lot of debt out there. And as those debts come to maturity, that could have an impact. But again, go back to our boxes and you think of our customers that are driving this right now. Data center customers, whether they be in build for use, which is one part of the market or those big customers are doing it themselves, they have cash, and they continue to generate cash. They're not dependent on financing. Semiconductors because of who they are and who they're funded by even without our government funding are fairly good with cash. There, it's going to be a matter of as they commission the first fabs on these sites, what have they learned as they go to the second one, there could be delays. There always is. That could be an issue, right  So those customers are more cash rich.The pharma company is the same. Healthcare looks pretty healthy right now. They have a need to be able to put hospitals in the market, right  They just don't build a hospital. Someone has to tell them there's a certificate of need for you to build that hospital in this market and especially in markets where the demographics are shifting to, we continue to see that. And then there's old hospitals, right  We're doing work at Mass General right now, great hospital but outdated facilities that they're rebuilding, and we're thrilled to be part of that. And so I feel good about it.If you're going to see it anywhere, you might start to see it in some of the energy efficiency work we do for our commercial customers. But they're going to be caught between things, right  Because if they don't make their buildings more energy efficient, they become harder to lease. So there's a lot going on there. I feel pretty good about where we're at. But I think, in general, there could be some -- you see it in the warehousing, you'll probably see in retail something we don't serve very much is where you'll really see it, and then you'll get it with people with strained balance sheet, some of these private equity-owned assets that have a lot of debt on them.Operator Instructions . The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.Welcome, Andy. Look forward to meeting you. Actually, Tony, can I just keep going on your PE comment  Are you seeing them show up less on M A opportunities  Finally...No, not with the kind of deals we do. I think they look at the size we like to do  50 million to  200 million, I think they say, hey, there's a place we can put all equity. And the earth and heavens will come together, and we'll be able to finance this at a lower rate in the next 18 months. So we don't believe that. That's clearly what they believe. So no, the answer is no. We really don't compete against them a lot. I mean, if someone really wants to go to PE, we're probably out in the first round anyway, we -- to get the great cultural fit and really understand the management team and it is a management team that's going to be there for the long term, sometimes that's not a great fit.Okay. All right. I'm going to try to do this, going to ask a 3-part question. On RPOs, one, is there a point where you feel like you're too full  Two, are you starting to book jobs further out  And three, do you think some of the RPO growth is market share gainsYes. So I'll take the third one. I don't even think about market share, never have. Such a big market that 19 years, more 30 years, got 30 years, you guys ever look at market share  So you can take that one away. We don't think about it. We wouldn't know how to answer that question. Massive market, we're a small part of it. Second one, are we too full  That becomes a question of what's the project, what's the size of the project, what's the timing of that project. So here's how I think about that. Our governor has less to do with how we'll be able to fill skilled craft and technical labor. We'll find that. We've always found -- and we're a really great place to work. We've done a really good job staying ahead of the development of foreman and project managers. And then where we don't have them developed, being able to hire really good people from the outside.So if there's a slowdown in RPO, it's not because we don't think we can develop them. It's just the mix  indiscernible  right, these things come episodically. Rarely do you see a run like we've had over the last 2.5 years where RPOs just consistently grow, right  I mean, it tends to be more sought to in how RPOs grow. And the third part of the question, Mark, wasWell, I think your question is further out. So 17  of our RPO balance is scheduled to be revenued beyond 12 months.That's pretty consistent.Actually might be on the low side, to be quite honest.Data center work gets done quickly. These big jobs get done in 6 to 9 months sometimes.Okay. And then there was a comment in the queue about small project quick turn risk, that's the biggest potential headwind, higher interest rates  Are you seeing that yet  I couldn't...I'm sorry, Adam. I think history has shown us that when we're in a rising rate of economy with inflationary pressures, the easiest thing for people to curtail spending is small project work. To date, we haven't seen it clearly in our performance, but it's certainly we're certainly monitoring very closely.Yes. I mean -- and there's a lot of things going on there right now that are different, right  That's where we've seen it in the past. What's different today is energy prices, and the paybacks are quicker. So how that all balances out over time, we'll see.Okay. Lastly on industrial. Tony, you made a comment, you said something was robust, but the turnarounds were flat in Q4. So I didn't understand that.Yes. So we have good -- I probably didn't say -- I might have said robust around our niche services. We continue to see demand for niche services like heater repair and things like that. We have good demand for our shop services, the best we've had since 2016, '17 in 6 years. So my view is robust, but robust is how I would describe the niche services.Niche services, got it. And then are there any -- for that segment, do you see any new secular drivers  I'm thinking kind of 1, 2, 3 years out.Well, I think one is where we're positioned, right  We're positioned on the Gulf Coast, where the refining capacity has the most advantages. I think the second secular driver will be when we can get some renewable work back in the business on the electrical side. We've proven we had network really well, electrically. We're not putting panels in that, but we're actually connecting that field to the substation to the grid. So that would be one. Another one would be upstream. We're positioned well in the Permian and Bakken specifically. And we expect both of them to have more robust opportunities here 1 to 3 years out. And then there are some interesting opportunities around also how they're helping start to think about methane management for lack of a better word and what we can do to participate in that. And we are doing some things right now to do that as they start to think about how they bring more electrification into the well instead of using diesel generators.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tony Guzzi for any closing remarks.All right. Thank you all very much. I guess we all won't talk together until February. So be well, have a great holiday season, and everybody be safe. And I guess, Happy Halloween, not one of my favorite holidays, but Happy Halloween.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T16:42:09.000-04:00

Vertex Energy: A Hold With Growing Throughput Volume And Renewable Diesel Production,"The year 2023 has seen Vertex Energy , producer and marketer of refined fuel products make noteworthy progress in regards to its renewable diesel project since the beginning of 2023. Its Q2 2023 revenues of  734.89 million beat estimatesVertex Energy has transformed from a local oil refinery company to a significant renewable fuel producer in the US. It completed its renewable diesel conversion project in H1 2023 and is expected to increase its yield profile into 2024. The recently erected Texas Tower mobile refinery planned for start-up in 2024 is also expected to lower carbon dioxide emissions and raise hydrogen production.Despite growing its revenue by 6.34   QoQ  to  734.9 million in Q2 2023, VertexAmong the niche, high-value fuel products produced by Vertex are gasoline, renewable diesel, and jet fuel, which according to the company represented about 61  of its total production in Q2 2023.I believe that the current economics of producing renewable diesel from soybean oil  feedstock  are not as attractive due to the challenging market conditions. The price of Soybeans has been marked by great volatility with the commodity trading at  12.73 per bushel from under  9 in 2020.In its Q2 2023 earnings call, Vertex Energy explained that it was diversifying its feedstock supply to at least 8 different blends including distillers corn oil, canola, and crude degummed soy. The rise in demand for renewable diesel has also necessitated this diversification with the growing conversation around sustainability. As we know, after processing from fats and oils, the chemical composition of renewable diesel is  to petroleum diesel as  it meets the ASTM specification for petroleum in the US and N590 in Europe.  Unlike biodiesel which is produced through transesterification and is blended with petroleum diesel for usage, renewable diesel provides a near-perfect alternative.Consumption of renewable diesel in California  the largest consumer of renewable diesel in the US  from 2011 to 2021 has increased from 1 million barrels a year to 28 million barrels per year.The enactment of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard  LCFS  in this State in 2011 has been a significant driver towards the adoption of biofuels. Fuel producers under this law in California are required to lower the carbon intensity of fuels while encouraging the production of renewable energy sources. In essence, producers of high-carbon fuel  above the mandated targets  are required to purchase credits from companies selling cleaner fuels. The state is quickly moving towards its zero emissions target and has encouraged other states such as Kansas, Washington, Wyoming, and North Dakota that also sell renewable diesel to California.Estimates show that the  of renewable diesel is likely to hit 216 million barrels per year in 2024. At the same time, consumption is expected to reach 239 million, indicating a deficit of at least 23 million barrels per year. The production volume of renewable diesel and other biofuels  in 2023 , according to the  Information Administration stood at 3 billion gallons per year. It has increased by 1.25 billion, a 71   YoY  increase from 2022. In the US alone, the number of states now producing renewable diesel and other biofuels has increased from 6 to 11.In Q2 2023, Vertex Energy s  conventional throughput volume  at the mobile refinery stood at 76,330 barrels  day which was equal to 102  of its operating capacity. In Q3 2023, VTNR s mobile refinery is expected to range at 74,000 b d to 77,000 b d. Additionally, the company attained a full production capacity of 8,000 barrels  day of renewable diesel which it had planned in Q1 2023.I believe this production is impressive considering VTNR purchased the 90,000 barrel  day Mobile Alabama refining facility in 2021. It had then planned to renovate the standalone refinery assets to help in the future production of renewable fuels, a plan that seems to now be working.Into Q3 2023, Vertex indicated that it had already commenced commercial sales of renewable diesel from its Mobile Alabama refining facility. In June 2023, the company sold its first 110,000 barrels of renewable diesel to Idemitsu Apollo Renewable Corp. This purchase followed an  by the two companies made in February 2022, where Idemitsu agreed to buy a maximum volume of 14,000 b d from Vertex.The Alabama facility whose first phase cost about  115 million has a planned production capacity in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 b d  of renewable diesel . The standalone hydrocracking unit is the main process involved in this phase, and it was completed by the end of Q1 2023. It is noteworthy that locally sourced soybean oil was the only feedstock that was used in the production of renewable diesel.By inference, the increase in the range of pretreated feedstock  such as meat tallow, corn oil, vegetable oil, together with soybean oil  to be used in the production of renewable diesel will enable the facility to operate at full capacity. Another important aspect to consider is that the feedstock to be used will be sourced locally, thereby creating local employment opportunities. Such an organization needs community support especially since the Mobile Alabama facility is still in its infancy. However, Vertex has been developing and sourcing alternative feedstock for at least 2 decades. It now has more than 500,000 tankers and stronger logistical capacity to improve its fuel production line in the long run.VTNR's cash balance as of Q2 2023 stood at  48.5 million, a decrease of 44   QoQ . The company s total debt and lease obligations also stand at  466.1 million with accumulated losses  negative retained earnings  at  143.4 million in the quarter. However, with the net change in cash  in the 12 months to June 2023  at  45.9 million, it shows the company has enough money to last until June 2024.Vertex Energy s gross profit declined 92.8   QoQ  to  5.2 million from  71.8 million in Q1 2023. The company also registered a net loss of  81.4 million for the first time since the quarter ending September 30, 2022. I believe that this decline was attributed to the decrease in VTNR s refining margins when considered at market prices. Cost of revenues rose 17.79   QoQ  even as the company explained that it incurred a  1  barrel impact on its yields.In this case, we may also consider the impact of hedging since the company explained that it encountered the  1 devaluation of its crude products. The price of jet fuel in the quarter also dropped by about  30 relative to that of crude oil. Overall, crude oil prices were reduced by  8 per barrel indicating a capture rate of 34 . On a similar front, energy company Blue Dolphin  also  a  significantly weaker refining margin  in Q2 2023 that lowered throughput volume, production, and sales. The refining margin  gross  dropped by almost 100  to less than  1 from a high of  15 at the beginning of 2023. The company's gross profit in the 6 months ending on June 30, 2023, stood at  22.4 million against  23.4 million recorded a year earlier. Like VTNR, Blue Dolphin also claimed that a high jet fuel yield led to a drag on its capture rate in Q2 2023. However, I believe that the price of jet fuel is growing post-Covid while gasoline prices will soon move past their seasonal adjustment phase.In regards to valuation, VTNR s price-to-book  'TTM'  ratio stands at 1.77 against the industry average of 1.67  a difference of 6.33 . The forward price-to-cash flow ratio is 8.09 against the industry average of 5.11  a difference of 58.40 . These metrics, in my view, show that the stock is slightly overvalued. Still, the company is looking at various tailwinds such as the growth in the renewable diesel output in H2 2023 and controlled hedging that should raise the shareholder value into 2024.The increasing uptake of renewable biofuels across the US is a significant driver towards the growth of Vertex Energy. The company had a challenging Q2 2023 denoted by reduced gross profit and high net losses attributed to weaker refining margins. Still, I expect the company to overcome the hedging issues in 2024 due to favorable energy prices. For these reasons, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.

Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up  in the 2020s decade,  setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion  a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation .After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy  in 2018 . It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream  exploration, drilling, extraction , midstream  transportation, storage, refining , and downstream  retail sales and distribution  handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company  a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco , Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the  350-400 billion range, but declined to the  200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only  178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over  275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly  400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers   32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  15-20 billion range from 2015-2019  with a notable drop to  8 billion in 2016 , a disastrous decline to a loss of  22 billion in 2020, a return to form of  22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to  55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story   45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to  14 billion in 2020, and a rise to  48 billion and  67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P E ratio of  8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P E is 12x,  15  above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P B  price to book  and P Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25  and over 50  above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P S  price to sales  is slightly discounted at  10  below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument  the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oilTo start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources  see Lazard data referenced later , i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables  i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.  is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy  at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used , renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost  the one-time payment for the devices themselves  to generate power  the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF , Reeves Utility Income Trust , DNP Select Income Fund , Vanguard Utilities Index ETF . Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle  or virtuous cycle  stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply  meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity Energy  or  LCOE , essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced  for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,   opens in Excel .This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about   aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry . As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. ,  t he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,  and  renewables are set to account for over 90  of global electricity expansion  in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99  of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change  humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union  EU  legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA , are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause  fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is  designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing   emphasis added . In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries  this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists  however, an  of the law by  t he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks   emphasis added . While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear  ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31  increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities  i.e., choose renewables , and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common  They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism  not to be confused with partisan liberalism . By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC OPEC , which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness  this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation , The Phillips 66 Company , Sempra , ONEOK, Inc. , OGE Energy Corp. , Brooge Energy Ltd , WEC Energy Group, Inc. , White Energy Company Ltd , Magellan Midstream Partners , Sunoco LP , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. , Enbridge Inc. , TC Energy Corporation , TotalEnergies SE , , Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Corporation , Valero Energy Corporation , NuStar Energy LP , Ovintiv Inc. , Cenovus Energy Inc. , ConocoPhillips Company , Eni S.p.A. , , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Ring Energy Inc. , VAALCO Energy, Inc.  Occidental Petroleum Corporation , Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.  aka Petrobras  , Pampa Energía S.A. , , Callon Petroleum Company , Imperial Petroleum Inc. , NiSource, Inc. , Devon Energy Corporation , Energy Transfer LP , Ecopetrol S.A. , Vistra Corp. , The Williams Companies, Inc. , Canadian Natural Resources Limited , Koninklijke Vopak N.V. , , InPlay Oil Corp. , Inpex Corporation , , Shell plc , , Dominion Energy, Inc. , Duke Energy Corporation , Baker Hughes Company , Enterprise Products Partners L.P. , APA Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , Warrior Met Coal, Inc. , PBF Energy Inc. , and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. , , Ørsted A S , , Iberdrola S.A. , , ReNew Energy Global plc , Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. , Ocean Power Technologies , Tesla Inc. , Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. , Brookfield Renewable , , Freyr Battery , Array Technologies, Inc. , Nano One Materials Corp. , Novonix Ltd , , LiCycle Holdings Corp , Maxeon Solar Technologies , First Solar Inc. , Azure Power Global Ltd , Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A.  aka Eletrobrás  , Acciona, S.A. , Nextracker Inc. , AmmPower Corp. , Enphase Energy, Inc. , Fluence Energy, Inc. , and Vestas Wind Systems A S , , among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the  winners  in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time  they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets  e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline petrol station infrastructure, etc.  into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams  upstream, midstream, and downstream  in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach  carbon neutrality  or  net zero carbon emissions  by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example  a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing   expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours  of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5  in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99  dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. ,   to cut natural gas production by 40  and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its   page 14  is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by  advanc ing  other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies,   emphasis added .At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings  this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that  t hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately  17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions   and  help in  reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling     emphasis added . Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that  a ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with   emphasis added . This is in addition to the  sustained investment  in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels  notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis . Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited  appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves  their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share  in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB  solar, wind, and battery storage  System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figureUltimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Phillips 66 Benefiting From Historically High Distillate Yields,"While Phillips 66  has been heavily investing in its Midstream and Chemicals segments in order to diversify the company from the cyclical refining business, in the near term the company's Refining segment continues to be the dominant factor whenAs most of you know, PSX has been executing on a multi-year plan to diversify away from refining by heavily investing in its chemicals and midstream segments. If you follow me, you know that I have not been impressed by the company's massive investments in newThe much better news is that PSX, in June,  the purchase of all DCP Midstream's LP units that it did not already own. As a result, the upcoming Q3 report will be the first full-quarter that will include all of DCP's LP results. Note that Enbridge  still owns a 13.2  economic interest in DCP via the General Partnership. As I have opined on Seeking Alpha, it's likely just a matter of time before PSX buys out ENB's remaining economic interests in DCP.Regardless, and with DCP now firmly under the PSX umbrella, the company expects to deliver strong growth in Midstream EBITDA from its integrated wellhead-to-market strategy. Indeed, the Midstream segment is expected to be the biggest single contributor of the  3 billion in expected mid-cycle EBITDA growth from the period 2022-2025. This is shown in the slide below from PSX's However, and considering the moribund Chemicals Segment, near-term performance will likely continue to be dominated by the performance of the company's Refining Segment, which has been a laggard for years when compared to its primary competitors Valero  and Marathon Petroleum . This under-performance is clearly shown in the relative five-year total returns performance of the three companiesYet there is some good news in PSX's Refining Segment. The company has finally started to make some significant headway in improving its Refining Segment's market capture and expects to achieve an incremental increase of  400 million annually via refining margin expansion.Meantime, PSX - which is the largest importer of Canadian Oil Sands WCS crude - is benefiting from its higher distillate yield as diesel margins remain strong as we head into the winter heating season  see graphic below . This is good news for PSX shareholders because, as you know, distillate demand is seasonal with increased consumption during the winter months.As you can see from the diagram above, while below blow-out 2022 pricing, the 2023 distillate crack spread  green dots  has remained significantly above average and jumped higher toward the end of Q3, with the average August crack spread coming in at  1.10 gallon. That was  than the RBOB gasoline crack spread in August  0.80 gallon . As a result, PSX continues to optimize its refineries for diesel. Indeed, on the , Brian Mandell - head of PSX's Marketing   Commercial Operations - reported that PSX's exports were up nearly 50,000 bpd yoy during the quarterMeantime, the recent increase in Brent WTI oil prices should mean higher margins for PSX's NGLs fractionation capacity as well as better pricing for PSX's LPG exports.As a result, and according to , consensus earnings estimates for Q3 have risen sharply from  3.82 share 90-days ago to the current estimate of  4.76For the year, the consensus estimate is for  15.71 share of earnings, which I believe may be on the low side given projections of only  2.97 share in Q4, which I believe is overly pessimistic given current market conditions and the recent increase in WTI. Also, the EPS estimates for next year appear to be on the low side as well given PSX's strategy to reduce costs while increasing efficiencies and refining margin expansion. However, PSX has been talking about increasing refining margin capture for many years, and it could be that the market is simply in  show me  mode.Regardless, and given PSX's current stock price of  115.91 at pixel time, the  15.71 share EPS estimates equates to a P E 7.4x and a forward P E 8.5x. The current  4.20 annual dividend equates to a yield of 3.6 . This valuation level appears reasonable given PSX's past performance, the relatively poor performance expectations of the Chemicals Segment, and the macro geopolitical and economic environment.However, I believe that significant upside potential exists if PSX management can show   improvement in the Refining Segment's market capture. I also think it possible that PSX could benefit from accelerating its integration of DCP integration and realizable cost synergies.As seen in the graphic below of PSX's quarterly dividend growth, prior to the global pandemic, PSX was one of the best dividend growth stocks in the entire S P 500Given the current dividend obligation is only  4.20 in comparison to expectations of over  15 share of earnings this year, shareholders can expect a big boost in the dividend. Remember, part of relatively new CEO Mark Lashier's strategy was a commitment to return  10- 12 billion to shareholders - via dividends and share buybacks - during the 10 quarters ending in 2024. So far, the company is ahead of schedule in that it has delivered  5.4 billion to shareholders over the first four quarters of the planAt the end of Q2, PSX had  3 billion in cash,  19 billion in long-term debt, and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35 . That relatively high ratio is primarily a result of the DCP acquisition. However, the company is on record to reduce that leverage metric by the end of the year. Still, there should be plenty of free cash flow to reward shareholders with a hefty dividend increase.Given PSX earnings outlook, continued strong distillate margins, multiple cost and operational efficiency initiatives, and its relatively low P E ratio, I'm tempted to upgrade PSX from Hold to Buy. However, I have been frequently disappointed by the performance of PSX's Refining Segment in the past, and have decided to curb my enthusiasm and reaffirm my Hold rating. However, I do believe that upside risks are greater than downside risks and, regardless of the second half earnings reports, I expect a strong boost in the dividend sooner rather than later.I'll end with a long-term total returns comparison of PSX vs. the broad S P500 as represented by the Vanguard S 500 ETF  since the spin-off of PSX from its mother ship ConocoPhillips  back in 2012As can be seen in the graphic, PSX was a significantly outperforming stock prior to the pandemic. But, just like , the company was caught with its pants down during the pandemic  mostly due to massive cap-ex over-spending on global petchem projects...  and had to leverage the balance sheet to meet its dividend obligation. I expect PSX will, once again, begin to outperform the S P 500 going forward. Indeed, it's already starting to do so  see far right hand side of the chart above .

"J.B. Hunt Transport: Capacity Gains, Consumer Demand Recovery, And Share Gains Drive Growth","Following  of J.B. Hunt Transport Services , I recommended a buy rating due to my expectation that the business can generate above-average secular growth from intermodal. I believed that there was room to exceedJBHT reported 3Q23 total revenue of  3.16 billion  0.3  growth , of which  1.55 billion was from intermodal, which grew by 3.5  vs. 3Q22. However, due to faster growth in operating expenses, operating income saw a decline of 10.1  to  241 million. However, on the EBITDA level, EBITDA saw growth of 9.6  to  429.4Expanding further on the subject of intermodal performance, which constitutes a crucial aspect of my optimistic stance, it is worth noting that although revenue experienced growth, the decrease in EBIT by 11.7  was somewhat underwhelming. The primary factors contributing to the decline were elevated equipment expenses, diminished utilization rates, and weakened pricing conditions. However, I derived positive outcomes from the results, despite the fact that intermodal profits were lower. This was due to the encouraging progress observed in terms of volume and box turnover, which are fundamental aspects. An essential piece of data for understanding volume growth is box turn performance  by JBHT and its rail partners . A strong box turn performance directly impacts utilization and volume growth. In my opinion, stronger box turns, a possible return in consumer demand, and capacity expansion will all contribute to sustained volume growth. Regarding the latter point, namely the expansion of capacity, it is noteworthy that the management exhibited a positive trend by increasing the number of containers added during the third quarter of 2023. Specifically, they added 1,000 containers during this period. albeit this figure still fell short of the average number of containers added in 2022, which stood at 4,600. That said, I maintain a positive outlook regarding the continuity of capacity expansion, as management has reaffirmed their objective of reaching a container count of 150,000 within the next 3-5 years, as initially stated in their 1Q22 announcement. Furthermore, management remained confident that the necessary capacity will be available once freight activity resumes within the network. With respect to the aspect of demand, it is my belief that we are currently approaching the trough of the cycle, as indicated by segment margins declining below 10 , a range that has historically spanned from 10  to 14 . Management observations regarding the destocking trend also indicate that it is probable that the conclusion of this trend is imminent. Once the destocking situation concludes, it is highly advantageous for JBHT as retailers are compelled to replenish their inventory  sell-in , thereby providing JBHT with a significant, temporary surge in volume. Retailers are compelled to replenish their inventory in due course, as there is an increase in consumer demand.Looking ahead, I feel optimistic about the upcoming growth prospects. First and foremost, I think that the increased intermodal service capability will act as a catalyst to allow trucks to gain a larger share of the market even though truck contract rates . The fact is Intermodal still offers a  over long-distance transportation. Moreover, I anticipate that JBHT will experience a resurgence in volume, as the company intends to enhance its service and expand its capacity. This will be achieved through their strategic objective of incorporating an additional 40,000 containers within the next 3-5 years, resulting in a total container count of 150,000  currently 117,387 . Although there are concerns regarding excessive capacity, it is worth mentioning that JBHT has the ability to adjust container allocation within its network in order to sustain capacity and fulfill market demands. This was acknowledged by management when they mentioned the retrieval of equipment from storage in the third quarter of 2023. The numerical data also supports this claim, as management has effectively maintained an 82  utilization rate in a sequential manner, even with an approximate increase of 1,000 containers.I believe the fair value for JBHT based on my DCF model is  334. My model assumptions are that JBHT can achieve 10  growth for the next few years, in line with historical growth rates. The growth will be driven by capacity expansion, a recovery in consumer demand  resulting in strong growth from restocking , and capturing share from truck delivery. Margin should expand as volume growth drives margin expansion due to the fixed-cost nature of the business. Since my last write-up, the JBHT share price has appreciated as expected, driven mainly by the valuation expanding from 2x to 23x forward PE. While I like the returns, I hold a conservative view that valuation will re-rate back to 21x forward PE  JBHT long-term average  as the cycle normalizes.There are various factors that may hinder the anticipated global economic recovery in the latter half of 2023. The factors to consider are the potential occurrence of a substantial economic decline, the ongoing sluggishness in rail service despite the overall improvement, and the emergence of new digital competitors competing for dominance in the brokerage industry. Moreover, the persistence of challenges, such as an excess of industry capacity that exceeds the level of demand, may lead to a deflationary impact on pricing.In conclusion, my continued recommendation for a buy rating on J.B. Hunt Transport Services remains rooted in the anticipated end of the downcycle and the potential for incremental volume growth. Several key factors support this stance. Despite challenges in intermodal profitability, positive signs in volume and box turnover are promising indicators. Capacity expansion is on the horizon, with a strategic goal to add 40,000 containers within 3-5 years. The expected resurgence in volume will be driven by improved service and capacity expansion, reinforcing JBHT's position in the market. While concerns exist about industry capacity, JBHT's ability to adapt and maintain utilization rates is evident.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Exxon Mobil: Big Market Changes,"Exxon Mobil  has long been a leader in accommodating market changes. Some changes are obvious like the increase in the price of oil that should lead to a very good third quarter report as well asThe decrease in the  and light oil prices is currently happening because OPEC  primarily Saudi Arabia when it comes to heavy oil  is cutting back on production as are otherThis movement of oil prices threatens a long-standing US refining industry profit making strategy. For a very long time, the United States has mostly exported the light crude produced by the unconventional wells while importing the heavy oil  even heavy oil with sulfur . The industry then made an  extra  profit by upgrading the heavy oil into the same products that were made with light oil while capturing the extra revenue of the discount to the finished product.But when that discount no longer exists, then the industry does not make an extra profit that justifies the assets needed for the extra refining processes. If this was a temporary phenomenon, then investors could put it down to just the usual volatility in pricing that will soon fix itself.But the Canadian completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. Threatens to change this relationship permanently. This long-delayed project is now over . Even with an expected reroute in some places, the pipeline should be in operation within the next couple of years  no guarantees, of course .This will allow a significant amount of Canadian production that was available to the United States with the usual heavy oil discount, to be exported. The volume carried through the pipeline will likely be significant enough to enable the discount between heavy oil and light oil to narrow. It may narrow to the point that the profit the United States has long made on importing heavy oil while exporting light oil will decrease or maybe even disappear.Should that prove to be the case, the refining industry will be in for at least a period of lower profits during cyclical high points.Exxon Mobil normally integrates where it has a decent upstream business. As a general rule, the company builds the upstream business first and then adds other divisions as a value-added way to grow for that particular upstream business.In the case of the Permian, the company may have inadvertently begun a refining trend. expansion is actually the size of most middle-sized refineries  standalone . So, while many talk about the lack of new refineries, the industry is working around that by expanding existing refineries to make up for the lack of new refineries. It gets the industry to the same point as building new refineries.What's even more interesting is that this refinery will handle the light crude that the company produces in the Permian. This is a variance from the industry strategy noted above of exporting the light crude while importing the heavy crude to make a profit on that spread. It could mean that the spread will not be worth the effort in the future. What we will have to see is how many more expansion projects happen with the idea of handling light crude.The third quarter itself is going to benefit from some of the best oil pricing so far in the current fiscal year. Most investors remember that prices peaked roughly in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and it was downhill after that. This year began with a fair amount of pessimism about oil prices despite the fact that the industry by and large, made decent profits at those prices.I have been reporting for some time that well breakeven points have been dropping. That should of course lead to lower corporate breakeven points and a more profitable industry at various oil prices.Exxon Mobil not only benefits from higher prices, but it also benefits from a drive to lower costs. This project has been aided by previously mentioned sales of high-cost production replaced by low-cost Permian production  that the new refinery expansion project will serve. in the next slide that Guyana and the Permian business were growing at roughly a 20  rate. What that is likely to do is begin to slowly turn the expenses  now at zero  favorable in the future.The other thing likely to happen is that unfavorable price effect shown above will likely disappear in the third quarter  or at the very least it won't be as bad as the comparison above which was against the peak pricing last fiscal year .Since oil prices remained relatively weak towards the end of the fiscal year, the comparisons should become easier on the pricing front. In the meantime, management keeps adding new low-cost production while periodically selling the higher-cost production. That is going to widen the company margin even if oil prices veer slightly from expected levels as commodity prices often do.This would include the world-class low breakeven  on Brent pricing  of GuyanaExxon Mobi of the partnership with Hess  and is the one that is bringing all the projects shown above online. The startup of the Payara FPSO will begin in the fourth quarter. This year benefitted from the first two projects shown above with the Lisa Phase 2 reaching its full potential about six months after startup.Exxon Mobil immediately began to work on debottlenecking projects to allow  eventually  all three FPSO's to process production above the nameplate amounts shown above. Exxon Mobil has also rearranged the production strategy in an attempt to hold down that breakeven point by holding down costs.The production from the numbers above is 620 BOD  as natural gas is reinjected . But that production should grow a good 10  above that and possibly more. In round numbers Exxon Mobil would get 45  of 700,000 BOD which is significant even for a company the size of Exxon Mobil. That number will increase when the next FPSO begins operations in 2025.John Hess also mentioned in the latest conference that the partners have an extra year to make up for fiscal year 2020. The advantage is that they have six ships operating whereas in 2020 they had three ships. This is important because the more acreage that moves into  developed  territory, the less acreage remaining will be part of the negotiated giveback to Guyana next year.The expected robust pricing environment may well mean that the partnership would add yet another ship or two depending upon the partners view of oil prices.  The same thing happens with the Permian as higher prices would mean more money to drill.Exxon Mobil was one of the few companies to drill right through the pandemic when it could. This allowed the company to take advantage of rock bottom prices offshore and on shore. The cost advantages achieved by such a strategy are the same as a competitive moat as those advantages last the life of the well. Offshore, that is one very long life. Onshore is close to the same.Exxon Mobil could be doing the same thing with the refinery expansion as it is adding refinery capacity that can handle light oil at a time when really no many are even thinking about that. Generally, the costs for at least some of the equipment will be low. Exxon Mobil will be done long before the  mad rush  to add additional capacity to handle light oil begins.Exxon Mobil will clearly benefit from rising oil prices just like the rest of the industry. But it will also benefit from replacing high cost production with low cost production.In addition, management may be thinking ahead to a time when it no longer benefits the refining industry to handle heavy oil  with or without sulfur . The latest refinery expansion projects will process Permian light oil.The last benefit comes from the fact that in Guyana all potential emissions are reinjected into the reservoir which leads to an industry leading low emissions project. This likewise puts the company in the front of the industry with low emissions that are actually common with offshore projects.Commodity markets change all the time. This is one company that appears to be in front of the changes. That is a very good sign for the future.The company is likely a strong buy consideration in that profits will likely outperform expectations as the cost structure continues to decline. Management has noted in the past that meeting the original goal means that the goals change to accommodate such an accomplishment. So, cost cutting is here to stay for a very long time to come. This company is becoming a growth and income vehicle.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience.

Mid-America Apartment Communities: Advantages Being Ignored Amid Supply Glut," is the largest and arguably strongest Sunbelt apartment REIT with about 102,000 units in the portfolio. This portfolio is well diversified across various types of multifamily communities, including highly amenitized and luxurious apartments appealing to higherIt also boasts the best-positioned balance sheet in its peer group with investment grade credit ratings of A3 A-, net debt to EBITDA of 3.4x, a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , and a weighted average debt maturity of 7.5 years.Beyond discernible traits of quality in the portfolio and balance sheet, there's often a certain  about high-quality companies that's difficult to pinpoint. You just know it when you see it, assuming you have an adequately trained eye.If I hadThe current CEO Eric Bolton has led the company for over two decades and has been at MAA for nearly three decades. During his tenure, MAA's total return performance has absolutely crushed that of its peersAnd yet, the market is pricing MAA at only a slight premium to its two closest Sunbelt multifamily REIT peers and a  to its high-quality coastal multifamily cousins.I'll show below that MAA's balance sheet remains in pristine shape, and the market has little to worry about on that front. It appears that the market has become concerned about the oncoming wave of supply scheduled to come online in MAA's select cities over the next year or two.I would argue, however, that this wave of supply will only be a temporary headwind, and that the current stock price decline represents a phenomenal buying opportunity for this best-in-class landlord.MAA owns a Sunbelt-concentrated yet meaningfully diversified portfolio of apartment complexes stretching from Las Vegas, Nevada to Norfolk, Virginia.In addition to a heavy presence in major Sunbelt cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Tampa, and Orlando, MAA also has significant exposure to fast-growing secondary markets like Jacksonville, Greenville, and Charleston.These Sunbelt markets have enjoyed population and job growth well above the national average over the past several years but also over the decade preceding COVID-19.The factors that drive these domestic migratory trends have not changed. Housing costs remain higher in many non-Sunbelt states, while lower taxes across the Sunbelt have attracted many businesses and jobs. Moreover, crime rates and rampant homelessness have fueled a population outflow from many coastal cities.MAA's median resident age is 34 years old, and the average rent-to-income ratio  sits at 22 .As I explained in a recent  titled  'Higher For Longer' Is Totally Unsustainable  Buy Defensive Dividend Stocks,  homebuying affordability has reached a nearly  as both home prices  mortgage rates keep rising. The practical result of this will be that many would-be homebuyers will have to remain renters until homeownership becomes more affordable. This is great news for multifamily landlords like MAA, because a rent-to-income ratio of 22  is far more affordable than the alternative of buying a home right now.Another competitive advantage for MAA is its robust development and redevelopment platform, which was significantly bolstered by its  of Post Properties in 2016. Post had expertise in property development that has clearly been beneficial to MAA over the years since the acquisition. Today, most of MAA's portfolio growth comes from internal development projects.This development arm, in addition to MAA's redevelopment platform that constantly upgrades a portion of its apartments with the latest technologies and interior designs, keeps the portfolio fresh and in tune with renter preferences.What's more, MAA is able to deliver internally developed properties at stabilized yields of 6-7  or higher. For development projects currently in the lease-up phase, MAA expects to generate a stabilized NOI yield of 7.2 . This is a massive strength at a time when multifamily cap rates are in the 4-5  territory.The above investment approach has worked extraordinarily well for MAA over the last few decades. We see it in the numbers. Compare, for example, MAA's Q2 core FFO per share and same-store NOI growth to that of its peersUses AFFO instead of core FFOUses NFFO instead of core FFOGranted, this is only one quarter. But if you zoom out further, you'll find more evidence of MAA's outperformance over its peers.Quality isn't always easy to describe, but it does tend to be quantifiable in performance numbers. That is certainly the case for MAA.The market seems to think that Sunbelt multifamily REITs' time in the sun has come to an end. The period of very low-interest rates from the second half of 2020 through early 2022 spurred a surge in new development starts in the multifamily space, focused on the areas where people were moving during the pandemic. This includes the suburban areas of coastal cities and pretty much everywhere across the Sunbelt.Notice in the chart below how multifamily construction starts averaged about 500,000 in 2022, compared to an average of under 400,000 during the 2010s.A large share of these new apartments are going to be delivered in MAA's Sunbelt markets.The market seems to think these new units will compete directly with MAA's existing portfolio, which is not necessarily the case. MAA enjoys at least two competitive advantages amid this wave of new supplyYou can see both competitive advantages displayed in the illustration below.First, in many of MAA's markets, the submarkets where the REIT's properties are located are expected to receive only a fraction of the total supply coming to those cities. MAA's communities often enjoy superior locations that offer greater convenience in terms of proximity to highways, shopping centers, and workplaces.Second, MAA's existing portfolio is able to offer rent rates significantly below the asking rents of these newly delivered apartments. Everyone knows that construction costs have gone up a lot in the last few years. Plus, developers typically have high-interest rate construction loans in place. That, in addition to the desire to sell the stabilized property for top dollar, requires them to seek out the highest possible rent rates.Thus, the primary competitors of newly delivered apartments tend not to be existing apartments but rather . These new apartment communities will likely have to offer concessions such as one or a few months of free rent in order to get leases signed at these higher rent rates. But in most cases, it is unlikely that they will drop rents low enough to compete with MAA's existing apartment stock.Plus, notice in the chart above that both construction starts and building permits for multifamily properties have dropped significantly below their 2022 levels. High-interest rates have caused starts to plummet. This means that the wave of new supply will be severely curtailed starting sometime in 2025.The supply headwind is temporary.In the long run, I would worry more about the supply pressures urban apartment landlords in coastal cities will face from office-to-multifamily conversions. Cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago with lots of old, half-empty office buildings and local governments that are desperate to revitalize their downtown areas  and therefore likely to subsidize conversion projects  are more likely to face a secular trend of apartment supply growth than the Sunbelt.According to a recent  put out by researchers at New York University and Columbia Business School, the top five metro areas with the most potential office-to-multifamily conversions were  you guessed itDue to greater office utilization and less public transportation, the Sunbelt is at a much lower risk of apartment supply growth from office conversions in the long run.MAA has among the strongest balance sheets, if not  strongest, in its multifamily REIT peer group. It is not the only multifamily REIT with credit ratings of A- A3......but it is the only REIT with 100  fixed-rate debt and net debt to EBITDA as low as 3.4x.But net debt to EBITDA is only one metric to measure balance sheet strength. There are others, and they all show MAA well-positioned compared to peers.MAA stacks up well against its peer group average in terms of debt to assets, unencumbered assets, debt service coverage, and weighted average debt maturity.Notice the small highlighted section showing that the  peer group  constituents include AVB, CPT, EQR, Essex Property Trust , and UDR Inc. . In other words, MAA is only comparing itself to the largest and strongest multifamily REITs, not any of the smaller ones with weaker balance sheets.The REIT does have a steady slate of debt maturities to refinance in the coming years. That is perhaps the weakest aspect of the balance sheet. Even if the bond market is favorable to MAA, the REIT will likely have to roll over these loans at new interest rates at least 200 basis points above the weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , based on the current average effective bond yield for corporates with an  A  rating.The good news is that MAA has plenty of liquidity as well as significant retained cash from its low payout ratio. This should help it blunt the blow of refinancing at higher rates.Certainly, up until now, MAA has managed to avoid rising interest expenses. Just the opposite has been the case. MAA's interest expense has  since 2019  i.e. the trailing twelve-month period ending at the beginning of 2020 .Perhaps the only reason why EQR's interest expense has fallen more than MAA's is that EQR has been a net seller of assets in order to deleverage. Notice in the chart below that while MAA's total assets have crept up since the beginning of 2020, EQR's total assets have declined by about 5 .EQR sold properties in order to reduce its debt load, while MAA has  needed to sell properties to reduce its debt.As more supply comes online and developers get desperate to offload properties amid high-interest rates, MAA's management believes that they will soon be able to utilize their significant dry powder  1.25 billion capacity on the credit facility plus  150 million in cash  to scoop up attractively valued acquisitions.MAA is best-in-class in the multifamily REIT space because of itsThis explains why it is my largest multifamily REIT holding and why I view it as a phenomenal buying opportunity right now.There will be mild to moderate headwinds in the short term from supply deliveries and debt refinancing, but MAA will be able to navigate these slight headwinds far easier than the market seems to think.What the market seems to ignore is  the Sunbelt is growing, and would-be homebuyers are largely stuck in the rental market for the foreseeable future.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Recession-Resistant High Yields: Kinder Morgan Vs. ONEOK,"Kinder Morgan  and ONEOK  are two recession-resistant high-yielding midstream businesses that own high-quality midstream energy infrastructure portfolios. That being said, both have considerably lagged the total returns of the broader midstream sector In this article, we will compare them side-by-side and offer our take on which is the better buy right now.KMI is a major player in the North American energy infrastructure industry, and as such boasts a diverse and large portfolio that includes natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil, and liquefied natural gas  LNG  assets. The company's U.S. gas pipeline business is particularly important, with a daily capacity equivalent to 40  of the average U.S. gas consumption. It also and a dominant position in the LNG market, servicing 50  of the U.S. market.Additionally, KMI's extensive asset footprint provides numerous investment opportunities, and KMI is also moving to reduce its carbon footprint with over 80  of its backlog comprising low-carbon investments and a recently formed energy transitions group tasked to explore renewable natural gas, biofuels, and carbon capture projects.93  of its cash flow is contracted with take-or-pay or fee-based terms, providing substantial stability for the company's bottom line. Additionally, over 70  of its customers are end users, ensuring consistent demand. As a result, the business is built to weather energy price and macroeconomic volatility quite well and with insiders owning  13  of the common equity, management interests should be well-aligned with shareholders.Meanwhile, OKE is also an increasingly prominent player in the energy industry, especially after its recently agreed-upon acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners . Like KMI,  90  of its earnings come from fee-based sources with strong counterparties and low exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The recent acquisition of Magellan's refined product assets further solidifies its position and creates new investment avenues.OKE has strong growth potential in its Rockies and Williston Basin assets while its acquisition of MMP should also give it growth investment opportunities in the Permian Basin as well as in hydrogen and renewable fuels.In summary, both of these businesses generate very stable and defensive cash flows from a well-diversified set of assets, geographies, and energy commodities, making them good sources of stable income during a period of significant macroeconomic and geopolitical instability.KMI and OKE both have solid balance sheets as evidenced by their BBB credit ratings from S P. Both OKE and KMI anticipate closing out 2023 with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.0x.That said, OKE expects to bring its leverage ratio down to below 3.5x by the end of 2026 whereas KMI sees itself as being in an excellent financial position already with a long-term leverage target of 4.5x. With well-laddered debt maturities, strong free cash flow profiles, and plenty of liquidity, both OKE and KMI are in sound financial condition.Neither KMI nor OKE has delivered particularly exciting dividend growth in recent years as both businesses have been focused on capital spending and improving their balance sheetsMoving forward, it is unlikely that growth will dramatically improve, though it is expected to improve some. KMI is projected by analysts to post a dividend compound annual growth rate of 2.9  through 2027 underpinned by an anticipated 3.7  CAGR in distributable cash flow per share during the same period. Meanwhile, its 2023 dividend coverage is expected to be quite conservative at 1.9x on a DCF basis, indicating a very safe payout and room to grow it in the coming years.Meanwhile, OKE is poised to achieve a dividend coverage ratio of 1.79x in 2024 on a DCF basis, which marks its first full year following its acquisition of MMP. As a result, OKE is also well-positioned to increase its dividend in the coming years even as it also focuses on continuing to deleverage its balance sheet. Analysts currently forecast a 5.7  dividend CAGR for OKE through 2027.Both companies' dividend payments currently appear to be on solid ground and are likely to increase at a pace that keeps pace with or surpasses inflation for the foreseeable future. Overall, we give OKE the slight edge here.As the table below illustrates, KMI is quite a bit cheaper than OKE across both the EV EBITDA and dividend yield metrics, though OKE appears cheaper relative to its historical average EV EBITDA than KMI doesBoth businesses appear to be quite strong and positioned to weather an economic downturn and or stormy seas for the energy sector. Moreover, both are trading at clear discounts to their historical average valuation metrics despite energy prices being fairly elevated in recent years as rising interest rates have weighed on them. Moreover, both offer attractive, well-covered, and growing dividends.That being said, neither is without risks. OKE is paying a pretty hefty premium for MMP despite the fact that MMP was already trading at a pretty substantial premium to most of its midstream peers at the time that the deal was struck. OKE is justifying the acquisition by  that it will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annualized synergies by the combination of the two companies. However, actually realizing these synergies is uncertain, so there will remain a degree of risk involved in the full integration of this substantial acquisition until it is successfully executed.Meanwhile, KMI has a past history of destroying shareholder value and deeply slashing its dividend. Moreover, despite generating a lot of excess cash flow above its dividend payouts in recent years, KMI has failed to grow its dividend very much and its buybacks have been relatively immaterial. As a result, KMI has significantly underperformed the broader midstream sector over the past three yearsMoreover, it is uncertain what catalyst the company would be able to enjoy in the future that would drive a significant upside in the stock as the dividend is good, but not great, especially relative to current long-term interest rates. Moreover, the dividend growth rate is pretty anemic and unlikely to materially improve for the foreseeable future. Finally, KMI recently  a mixed shelf, which includes the potential for it to issue additional common stock. There is certainly a risk that this offering may end up diluting shareholder value over the long term.Overall, we like both of these businesses and think that they should prove to be solid dividend payers for years to come. If we had to pick one of these, we would choose OKE simply because we think it has great valuation upside potential and its leverage ratio is likely going to be lower than KMI's in the coming years. We also see it having stronger growth potential than KMI in the near term at least. That said, we rate both as Buys and relatively low-risk investments.

Special Situations Report: Have Oil Prices Reached Their Peak?,"According to the September IEA  International Energy Agency  report released for September 2023.Oil demand is projected to growStrong economic conditions in major energy-consuming countries, such as the U.S., have led to record high global oil demand in 2023.In 2024, the demand is expected to grow by a more modest 990 kb d, reaching 102.8 mb d, due to below-average GDP growth and a structural decline in road transport fuel use in major markets.Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended voluntary production cuts through the end ofOPEC  output has already decreased by two mb d this year, partially offset by higher Iranian flows. Non-OPEC  supply has risen by 1.9 mb d to a record 50.5 mb d by August 2023. World supply in 2023 will rise by 1.5 mb d, with the United States, Iran, and Brazil being the main sources of growth.Russian oil export revenues have increased due to higher prices despite lower shipments. Russia is chasing higher oil prices for several reasons, primarily driven by the need to replenish its military arsenal amidst declining oil exports. Russia is employing several tactics to increase its oil revenue. First, it is benefiting from higher global oil prices due to factors like production cuts. Second, Russia is focusing on selling more premium refined oil products, particularly diesel, by maximizing refining capacity. Lastly, it is exploring new distribution channels, including increased piped flows to select European countries and using the shorter Arctic route for oil shipments to China, in an effort to optimize distribution and reduce costs.Refinery margins reached an eight-month high in August due to challenges in meeting the growing oil demand, particularly for middle distillates. Product cracks and margins reached near-record levels, driven by unplanned outages, feedstock quality issues, supply chain bottlenecks, and low stocks. Global refinery runs are projected to rise by 1.7 mb d to 82.4 mb d in 2023 and by 1.2 mb d to 83.6 mb d in 2024.Global observed oil inventories decreased by 76.3 million barrels to a 13-month low in August, primarily driven by a substantial decline in oil on water. Non-OECD oil stocks decreased by 20.8 million barrels, with China experiencing the largest drawdown, while OECD inventories declined by 3.2 million barrels. In July, OECD industry stocks increased but remained below their five-year average.Oil prices traded in a narrow range in August, with North Sea Dated crude oil hovering around  85 per barrel. Price volatility reached multi-year lows. Prices surged higher at the end of the month, surpassing  90 per barrel for the first time in 10 months.Analysts predict that oil prices could breach  100 a barrel in the near future due to strong demand, limited supplies, and the U.S. administration's limited tools to control prices. SPR  Strategic Petroleum Reserve  levels are low, and the Biden administration pulled back an offer to buy six million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in August 2023. The administration also highlights that while higher oil prices boosts profits for oil producers, it may not lead to a significant increase in domestic production. The U.S. shale oil industry has become more cautious in its approach, focusing on returning cash to shareholders rather than rapid production growth.The EIA predictsThe key forecast for global oil markets and prices is driven by Saudi Arabia's decision to extend a voluntary production cut of one million barrels per day  b d  through the end of 2023. This extension is expected to lead to a decrease in global oil inventories, exerting upward pressure on oil prices. In the fourth quarter of 2023  Q4 23 , the Brent crude oil spot price is projected to average  93 per barrel  b , while prices should decline in 2024 to an average of  88 b as oil inventories build. The current assessment indicates that global oil inventories are falling by 0.6 million b d in the third quarter of 2023  Q3 23  and moderating to 0.2 million b d in the fourth quarter of 2023  Q4 23 . OPEC  production cuts are expected to keep global oil production below global oil demand, with the Brent spot price remaining above  90 b through the first quarter of 2024  Q1 24  and averaging  87 b for the rest of the year.Non-OPEC production growth, led by the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana, is a significant factor in global production growth. Russia's production is anticipated to decline slightly in 2024, while OPEC crude oil production is forecasted to decrease in 2023 but increase in 2024.Historical trends spanning the past decade reveal that crude oil prices have faced consistent challenges in maintaining a position above the  90 per barrel threshold for extended periods. Typically, these periods of higher prices have been followed by corrective actions in the market. While there is a slim possibility that Brent Crude might briefly breach the  100 per barrel mark, it is improbable that such levels will be sustained. Recent price hikes, primarily attributed to OPEC  production cuts, are anticipated to diminish in the near term, barring unforeseen risks. These historical patterns of price volatility present opportunities for short-term gains when adopting a bearish stance.In essence, considering the existing supply-demand dynamics and potential consequences in financial markets, including potential political implications for Saudi Arabia's long-term strategic objectives, shorting the USO ETF could be a viable investment strategy. Nonetheless, investors should exercise caution in the face of short-term market fluctuations and remain vigilant to changing conditions. It is worth noting that the trade offers an upside potential of 17  with a corresponding downside risk of 10 .The reluctance of Saudi Arabia and OPEC to increase oil production, as they have done for previous American presidents during election cycles, poses a near-term risk to the view that oil prices will gradually decline. Historically, American presidents, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump, received timely increases in Saudi oil production to ease price pressures on oil markets in the lead-up to U.S. elections.However, when President Joe Biden last sought similar support, OPEC  chose not to raise production but, instead, implemented a substantial cut. This decision contributed to keeping oil prices above  90 per barrel, significantly higher than the 10-year average. The Saudi s animosity towards President Biden and a desire to assist Republicans in the U.S. midterm elections potentially favors the re-election of Donald Trump in 2024 offers new initiation reports on roughly two dozen companies per year, with a focus on under-followed small and mid-caps with significant potential.

Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Magellan Midstream Partners LP  Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call August 3, 2023 1 30 PM ETAaron Milford - President, CEO   DirectorJeffrey Holman - Principal Accounting Officer, EVP, CFO   TreasurerTheresa Chen - Barclays BankSpiro Dounis - CitigroupJeremy Tonet - JPMorgan Chase   Co.Keith Stanley - Wolfe ResearchGreetings, and welcome to the Magellan Midstream Partners Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  Operator Instructions . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 3, 2023. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Aaron Milford, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Hello, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Magellan's second quarter financial results. Before getting started, we must remind you that management will be making forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are based on our current judgments regarding the factors that could impact the future performance of Magellan and our pending merger with ONEOK, but actual outcomes could be materially different. You should review the risk factors and other information discussed in our filings with the SEC and form your own opinions about Magellan's future performance as well as our pending merger. As disclosed in our press release this morning, Magellan delivered another solid quarter. Our second quarter results beat our expectations due to higher contributions from commodity-related activities as well as a higher proportion of longer-haul shipments and associated higher average tariffs on our refined product system. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jeff Holman, to review the highlights from our second quarter earnings, then I'll be back to discuss our expectations for the year and our pending merger with ONEOK before answering your questions.Thanks, Aaron. First, letEarlier this morning, we reported second quarter net incomeAdjusted earnings per unit for the quarter, which excludes the impact of commodity-related mark-to-market adjustments, was  1.23, which, as Aaron just mentioned, exceeded our guidance of  1.10. DCF for the quarter increased to  312 million, up nearly  84 million from last year, while free cash flow for the quarter was  271 million, resulting in free cash flow after distributions of  59 million. A detailed description of quarter-over-quarter variances is available in our earnings release. So as usual, I'll just speak to a few highlights. Starting with refined products. We reported second quarter operating profit of  234 million, which were  67 million higher than second quarter 2022 primarily due to higher average transportation rates as well as higher product margin. The higher average transportation rates were driven largely by the midyear 2022 increase in our tariffs of about 6  on average. In addition, the current period continued to benefit from more long-haul shipments, which moved at higher rates, in part as a result of ongoing refinery disruptions. Product margin increased between periods primarily due to both higher gas liquids blending margins and sales volumes as well as lower unrealized losses in the current period related to our hedging activities. Our realized blending margins doubled year-over-year to more than  0.80 per gallon versus closer to  0.40 per gallon in the prior year period. Turning to our crude oil business. Second quarter operating profit was  61 million, down  12 million from the '22 period primarily due to lower revenues from our condensate splitter, in part due to lower rates provided for in the splitter extension contract executed last year as well as lower storage revenues in the current period. Otherwise, transportation revenue increased slightly due to additional volume moves. Longhorn volumes averaged a little over 245,000 barrels per day, up from just over 200,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of '22 due to higher third-party volumes resulting from additional volume commitments. Volumes on our Houston distribution system increased versus the prior year period, in part due to higher shipments from the new pipeline connection that was ramping up in 2022. Since these shipments move at a lower rate than long-haul volumes, this increased HDS activity resulted in a lower average rate for the segment overall. Crude oil product margin increased versus the prior year period due to higher contributions from our crude oil marketing activities as well as favorable mark-to-market adjustments on futures contracts in the current quarter. Moving on to our crude oil joint ventures. BridgeTex volumes were about 90,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of '23, down from approximately 215,000 barrels per day in 2022 due to lower volumes from committed shippers. This volume decrease reflects the low prevailing Midland differential and the highly competitive nature of the crude business in general and of the Permian Basin in particular, which we have noted for some time, while again emphasizing the importance of having take-or-pay commitments from high-quality counterparties. Saddlehorn volumes reached a new record of about 265,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 220,000 barrels per day the year before as a result of higher shipments for both committed and uncommitted shippers. Just briefly touching on expenses, G A increased by approximately  18 million between periods for our refined and crude segments combined due to higher incentive compensation costs and to approximately  10 million of merger-related costs incurred in the second quarter. In terms of liquidity, we continue to have a  1 billion credit facility available and at quarter end had no borrowings outstanding on our commercial paper program. As of June 30, the face value of our long-term debt remained unchanged at  5 billion with a weighted average interest rate on net debt of about 4.4 . Lastly, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x for compliance purposes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Aaron.Thank you, Jeff. We continue to anticipate the transaction with ONEOK will close during the third quarter of this year and remain confident that the value created by this transaction for unitholders is superior to the value of our standalone alternative, including on an after-tax basis. That said, based on our second quarter performance, we believe it's appropriate to update 2023 financial expectations ignoring future potential merger-related costs for Magellan on a standalone basis. Our revised full year outlook highlights the quality of our assets and the ability of our businesses to continue to drive value through a stronger combined company once the pending merger with ONEOK is complete. We now expect to generate  1.26 billion of DCF for 2023 on a standalone basis, again, excluding merger-related costs. This increase reflects better-than-expected performance during the second quarter and continued strong commodity margins expected for the remainder of the year. On the commodity front, we have hedged more than 3 4 of our forecasted fall 2023 gas liquids blending activity at this point for an average margin of  0.60 per gallon. All in, our full year 2023 expectations currently include an average blending margin of  0.70 per gallon, which compares favorably to the  0.50 we generated last year and our 5-year average margin of  0.45 per gallon. We have also made excellent progress hedging next spring with more than 70  of spring 2024 hedged at a  0.65 margin per gallon. We have also increased our refined products tariff rates midyear -- excuse me, we also increased our refined product tariff rates consistent with our most recent guidance. The increase -- we increased the 30  of our markets that are subject to the FERC index by 13  and the remaining 70  of our markets by an average of 11 , which equates to an all-in average refined products tariff increase of approximately 11.5  effective July 1. Turning back to our pending merger with ONEOK. We continue to be confident in the strength and durability of Magellan's business. And we further believe just as confidently that the value unitholders will receive through our combination with ONEOK is full and fair and that it'll be difficult to capture this value on our own. Prior to the announcement of the merger, we consistently and frequently shared our views that Magellan was undervalued and in response, have repurchased 12  of our outstanding equity since 2020. The same analysis we used to conclude that repurchasing MMP equity created value for our unitholders also formed the basis for our conclusion that a merger with ONEOK delivers more present value than we could likely realize standalone. Magellan has always been focused on delivering superior value to unitholders. Tax considerations are very important to our unitholders. It's something we've spent a great deal of time considering, especially recently in connection with the pending transaction. What is clear to us is that the ONEOK transaction delivers more value to our unitholders than Magellan standalone, even on an after-tax basis. Robert Willens, a respected tax expert, reached a similar conclusion. I would highly encourage you, if you haven't done so already, to visit MaximizingValueforMMPunitholders.com to read Mr. Willens' work along with other information about the pending merger and why we are confident the transaction is in the best interest of unitholders. We've had the opportunity to speak with many investors, analysts, employees and customers. And overall, the feedback has been positive. We are pleased to see that a lot of investors are coming to understand the rationale of the transaction as we have tried to clarify some of the initial confusion in the market around the tax impact. And as we and ONEOK progress our integration planning and communicate more detail on anticipated synergies, we are confident investors will become even more excited about the combination. It's clear that the market is starting to reflect some of the potential value of the combined company. While trading prices of our units and ONEOK shares will continue to move around, as recently as July 26, ONEOK shares closed at  67.60 per share. At that price, Magellan unitholders would have received a value of  70.08 per unit based on the terms of the transaction, nearly a 27  premium to the market price of our units prior to announcing the merger. Operator, we are now ready to answer questions.Operator Instructions . Our first question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays.Aaron, on the deal itself, so since the announcement came out and the materials have been released since then, you faced some public opposition from your holders. Can you speak to your view on this  And also just which inning are you in related to the education process for both your institutional and retail ownersWell, as we continue to talk to investors, as I said in my prepared remarks, overall, the reception has been positive. We're spending a lot of time communicating and clarifying, frankly, a lot of misunderstandings around the tax impact of this transaction. And then as we go forward from here, we expect to be talking in more detail about the synergies from the transaction. And as we communicate that, people are beginning to understand our rationale. So the inning that we're in, to answer the second part of your question, the inning that we're in is -- I would say that we're in the first inning. We've got a full game ahead of us, and we're prepared to see it through to the ninth inning. And we think we're going to be successful because the merits of the deal when accurately communicated, we think, are very compelling.Got it. And since you have the full game ahead of you, if it's not enough time from now until September 21, what are the next steps  Would you just choose to adjourn and hold it on another date  And if you can give us some color about what you expect, that would be helpful.Well, first of all, we have the shareholder meeting scheduled for September 21. We think that's plenty of time, and that's where we're focused.Our next question is from Spiro Dounis with Citi.First question, maybe just to hit on the commodity activities, pretty strong this quarter but kind of seasonal. So just curious if you guys can maybe walk through that a little bit further. Just seems like maybe you're doing something differently there to sort of squeeze out those extra margins. And I guess as you look forward, it sounds like you feel pretty good about the ratability of that. So once again, just more detail on how that's working.Yes. So let's break it apart into its 2 pieces and talk first about the margin. We've just had a very favorable setup when you look at our gas liquids blending margin in the sense that we've had relatively strong gasoline prices, and we've had an NGL market that has been a little weaker than what you might think. And that drives a wider margin available for us. So the margins have just been better. The basis differential, you may recall in the past, we talked about basis being a bit of a headwind for us. And so far this year, it's been less of a headwind than we had anticipated coming in. So we're looking at just wider margins, gross margins in the first place. And we're also not feeling quite the headwinds on the basis differential that we otherwise expected. That's the margin picture. We see that remaining fairly consistent for the rest of the year based on what we see at the moment. The other part of the overall performance is just volume. We're just doing, as a company, a better job of capturing all the opportunities that are available to us and part of that process in terms of, again, just being better at it. So it's a volume story as well. Volumes are higher, margins wider and the outperformance as a result of both.Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Just want to talk about the business a little bit if I could. Just curious with regards to fundamental trends as far as product demand trends have been materializing. In your markets, across your footprint, how has that materialized versus expectations so far  And I guess on a go-forward look, how do you see things kind of normalizing thereSo we're going to have a very stable and healthy business. When you look at the second quarter of this year, gasoline was down. Distillate was up. It's not unusual for us to see some swings, and the commodities were actually moving. But we expect demand to stay relatively stable and in some areas, be growing, especially as we are able to extend our system. We have our pipeline system expansion in West Texas coming online fully in the beginning of 2024. So as we think about those opportunities to extend our market, that will provide some growth to us. But the fundamentals, we think, are fairly stable, which means we'll have a slowly growing volume trend, we think, over the immediate period. So we think that sets up very well and just highlights the consistency of our business going forward. We also outperformed in the quarter, as Jeff and I mentioned, due to longer-haul movements on our pipeline. So that's been a real bright spot for us. The longer hauls are primarily driven when there are refinery disruptions. And as refinery disruptions happen since we're connected to almost 50  of the refining capacity in the U.S., just because the refinery may be suffering some short-term headwinds, the demand is still there, and it has to be served. And we tend to move barrels into those markets to fill those holes when refineries are down. So that allows us to see longer-haul volumes. Now it's a little unpredictable of when those longer-haul volumes may show up, but they do. And so when you look at a very stable business, slight growth through the extension combined with just the optionality of our system, we're going to have a really stable, high-performing business. And when you look at the combined company, you fast forward to the pro forma company and you think about the strength of our business inside that combined company and the strength of ONEOK's business and you put those together, we think it's going to be a really compelling pro forma company.Got it. That's very helpful there. And just want to touch on exports if I could, particularly, I guess, Permian crude oil exports between Corpus and Houston, how you see that dynamic playing out over time  And any thoughts, I guess, on LPG exports as well to the extent you're able to comment on thatYes. I don't have any comments on the LPG side. But on petroleum products generally, we expect exports to continue to grow from the United States, whether that's refined products or components or crude oil. We just see world demand pulling those resources into that market. It needs them. On crude specifically, Corpus is still the predominant export port out of the United States due to its proximity to the Permian and lower cost logistics generally to get into that market as well as the terminal infrastructure that's there. We talked in the past about through time, Corpus, we expect to fill up from the pipeline capacity into that market. We don't know yet to the extent that capacity will expand. It will expand some, we expect. But as Corpus fills and as Houston's capabilities continue to evolve, we'll start seeing more barrels start heading towards Houston through time in order to meet that, again, growing export demand worldwide.Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one on the deal if I could ask. I think in response to earlier questions, you said it, I think, in the early innings here, maybe the first inning. Just wondering from the outside as far as this process is concerned, how can we see, I guess, things are progressing as far as getting the boat out there, getting people to show up and how things are progressing towards a successful deal  What can we see from the outside  When do we know we're at the seventh inning stretchWell, I think that's a good question. And so if we're in the first inning, we have a game plan to reach our investors, make sure we're communicating the merits of this transaction. And we're going to execute that game plan. And my expectation is that game plan is going to take us from the first inning all the way to the ninth inning. And we're not going to let up on that game plan. We've got the website set up, where investors who have questions can go get answers. We have outreach plan. We're talking to investors that call us. So we're talking to everyone all the time between now and we get to our special meeting day. So when I say we're in the first inning, that's the -- in this metaphor, the game that we're in. We're in the first inning. We're getting started. We're going to execute our game plan. We're going to execute all the way till the end of the game. And then we're confident if we do that, the merits of this transaction will be well understood, and we'll be successful in getting our vote. But when will we know we get to the seventh inning stretch  I'm not sure I'm worried about the seventh inning stretch. I'm worried about getting to the end of the metaphorical game here.And our next question is from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.Just one question for me. I wanted to follow-up on the longer-haul movements and some of the refinery disruption impacts. So the average refined products pipeline tariff was very high for the quarter even putting the normal increase aside. It just seemed meaningful, the impact of some of those longer-haul movements. But any other comment you can make on that and expectations for the balance of the yearYes. So if you think of the second quarter and you isolate it, we estimate that long-haul movements positively impacted that quarter -- or the second quarter by about  20 million, to your point. It was significant. Now you also have to consider the refinery disruption environment in the second quarter. You had several refineries down in Texas, in particular, that you wouldn't normally expect to have sort of those refineries down at the same time in the manner that they were for as long as they were down. So I think it's a bit of a unique event in the second quarter that we have to be careful not to extrapolate to virtually every quarter from here on out. But for the second quarter, it was significant, like as I said,  20 million. And they're difficult to predict. I mean, that's the nature of them. What we know is to the extent they occur, we generally benefit from them.Operator Instructions . Our next question is a follow-up from Spiro Dounis.Sorry. Back again. Just had one more follow-up related to the deal, a 2-part question on it though. One, I guess, curious on the customer side of things. We've got a sense now where your investors' heads are at or going. But curious what the customer receptivity has been in the last few months. And then number two, this is maybe tougher to answer. But as you think about the sort of units held on swap, I'm curious if you've been able to garner any sort of consensus on what the broker voting policy is there.Yes. So let's take the -- your first question first, which is the reaction from our customers. And what I have been hearing is a positive reaction. But it's also important to keep in mind that we value customer service, and that hasn't changed. So all throughout this pending merger, our customers, we've been working really hard to make sure they don't feel any difference in how we treat them and what they expect from us. So from that perspective, our customers, they're still getting the same service they've always gotten, and we expect them to continue to get it. So the fact that there hasn't -- there's been a positive reaction to the deal overall and that our customers are happy, that's because we're continuing to make sure we do what we need to do to make sure they stay happy. So on that front, there's not really a lot of news there, quite frankly. To your question on the swap, so those that hold units via swap, there are some brokers that essentially can facilitate those units being voted based on the wishes of the holder. There are others that don't. Where people are, I don't have -- I don't know exactly how to break that down for you in terms of what percentage can or can't. But we do know there are swap counterparties that will allow those that hold our units on swap to make their interest known and vote accordingly. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. But we think total swap ownership, just to put it in perspective, is probably under 10 , give or take. Does that answer your questionYes. No, no, it does. I appreciate you taking a stab at it. I know it was a tough one, Aaron. So I always appreciate the color, guys. I'll leave it there.Yes. And just to follow up on that, Spiro, there have been folks we know on swap that have been moving their positions to make sure they can vote. And we think that's positive. So I'd be remiss not mentioning that as well.Mr. Milford, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.Thank you for your time today. We remain confident in the strength of Magellan's business and look forward to becoming a valuable contributor to a larger, more diversified company following investor approval of our pending merger with ONEOK. And we look forward to continuing our discussions with investors in the coming weeks. We appreciate your continued support and encourage all investors to vote for Magellan's pending merger with ONEOK ahead of our special meeting on September 21, and have a good day.And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and kindly ask that you please disconnect your lines.",3,2023-08-03T16:35:06.000-04:00
"Suncor: A 5% Yield, Massive Buyback Potential, And Way Undervalued","Over the past few years, I've increasingly focused on Canadian stocks, a market I never cared for before I got serious about dividend  growth  investing. While I usually preferNot only do I like its railroads, but it also has some great defensive consumer stocks, world-leading mining companies, some decent banks  although I dislike its housing market , and some of my favorite energy stocks.In this article, I focus on , the Calgary energy play with a well-integrated network of upstream, midstream, and refining operations.Over the past ten years, SU shares were more or less a pet rock. The total return of NY-listedIf you had bought SU in New York or Toronto prior to the Great Financial Crisis, you are now breakeven, which includes having reinvested every penny of dividends you received along the way. That's not a great performance.However, underperformance is over.The company is now in a much better spot. It has deep oil reserves, highly efficient operations, allowing it to produce a lot of free cash flow, an increasingly healthy balance sheet, the plan to distribute all of its excess free cash flow to shareholders, and a well-integrated network that will serve the world's energy needs for decades to come.While I won't buy SU because I'm already significantly overweight energy, including its Canadian peer Canadian Natural Resources , I believe that SU is poised to outperform both its peers and the S P 500 on a prolonged basis.Founded more than 100 years ago, Suncor is an integrated oil and gas company, meaning it has more operations than just upstream  drilling . This makes it a competitor of companies like Exxon Mobil  that turn most of their oil into value-added products like gasoline, diesel, and related.As we can see below, the company has mining operations. Roughly 20  of Canada's oil sands can be mined using above-ground equipment.This is the process of turning sand into oilSuncor was the first company to develop oil sands in Northern Alberta commercially. Now, that industry has become an important source of oil, as the American shale revolution has run out of steam  as I explained in .Not only is the company able to produce oil very efficiently, but it also has an expected oil sands reserve life of 26 years, which exceeds almost all of its peers. On top of that, new discoveries consistently expand this number, as we shouldn't expect that Suncor will cease to exist after 26 years.On top of that, the company has room to upgrade operations and refine most of its own products.With 2Q  year-to-date  production of 742 thousand barrels per day, the company has the capacity to refine 466 thousand barrels, which is roughly 62  of upstream production.I'm obviously painting with a broad brush here, but essentially, this indicates that the company benefits from high margins as it refines its own supply. Pure-play refinery companies cannot compete with that.It also needs to be said that exploration risks are low - on top of the fact that the company has deep reserves. The company has extremely low decline rates compared to tight oil  shale oil , which adds to the company's attractiveness.Also, most of its operations have cash operating costs between  30 and  43, which gives the company a very low breakeven price.While Suncor has no major impact on global oil prices, it can focus on its own production.During its 2Q23 earnings call, the company highlighted several efforts to improve its business.These included ongoing improvement of base business fundamentals, optimizing mining fleet management to reduce costs per ton, enhancing turnaround planning and execution, advancing the long-term plan for Fort Hills, and driving towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through the Pathways Alliance.Having said all of this, Suncor is highly efficient when it comes to generating cash and is willing to let shareholders benefit from it.According to 2Q23 numbers, at  81 WTI, the company is able to generate  6 in adjusted funds from operations per share after sustaining CapEx and its base dividend. This translates to a 13.9  yield based on the current stock price of  43.10 - again, I'm using Canadian numbers here.If we take a look at the overview below, we see that the company has a very clear game plan when it comes to rewarding its investors.Essentially, the company's plan is to distribute excess cash using buybacks. This sets it apart from companies that prefer  variable  dividends.Keeping sustaining CapEx, growth CapEx, and annual dividend payments unchanged, the company adjusts buyback expectations based on its net debt load  gross debt minus cash and cash equivalents .For example, if the company has a net debt load between  9 and  12 billion, it uses 75  of excess free cash flow to buy back stock, using the remaining 25  to reduce debt.The goal is to eventually lower net debt to  9 billion. At that point, every penny in free cash flow will be used to buy back stock.Current analyst estimates are that net debt could reach this target in 2024.The company's credit rating reflects this. It has a BBB  rating, which is one step below the A-range. It has just  1.1 billion in maturities in the 2026-2030 period.Over the past three years, SU has bought back 15  of its shares.On top of that, it pays a juicy dividend.The current dividend is  0.52 per quarter per share. This translates to a 4.8  yield.The dividend was hiked by 10.6  in November 2022, which shows that SU is also committed to investors seeing income from their investments.Based on the company's profitability at elevated oil prices and my belief that declining global oil supply growth and long-term demand growth could result in triple-digit dollar oil prices in the future, I believe that SU is a terrific place to be.Once it has achieved its leverage targets next year, it can unleash the full power of its free cash flow.Hence, I believe that SU will turn from an underperformer into an outperformer.On top of that, it is further enhancing oil production and increasing refinery utilization rates after the planned turnaround lowered the utilization rate to just 85  in 2Q23.Hence, I also believe that SU is attractively valued.A 14  implied FCF yield at  81 WTI is a terrific deal. I believe we could see a  24  FCF yield with oil above  100.If oil rises above  90 and remains at these prices for a prolonged period, I could see a scenario where SU rises to  64 in Toronto, which implies a surge of roughly 50 .Needless to say, if my long-term oil thesis turns out to be correct, we're looking at much higher gains.While I will assign a rating, I want to make three things clearIn my exploration of Canadian stocks, I've found a gem in Suncor Energy.With a well-integrated network spanning upstream, midstream, and refining operations, SU is poised for a turnaround.Though its past decade's performance was lackluster, a new era has started.Robust oil reserves, efficient operations, healthy finances, and shareholder-friendly strategies position SU to shine.Its low-cost operations, ample reserves, and commitment to shareholder value make it a standout in its industry.As an investor, I'm optimistic about its potential to outshine peers and the S P 500.While the road may have some bumps, SU's potential for growth and outperformance is substantial.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

On the other hand, MPLX LP is paying a higher dividend yield of As I said in my prior article, the company has shown exceptional performance in 2022, and with oil prices down in Q2'23 from a record high, it is normal to notice lower returns in H1 2023.However,  significantly from Q2'23, and refiners have done very well in Q3'23, with increasing margins.However, I believe all the goodies have already been factored in the stock price, and the sector looks overbought and ready for a technical retracement.Thus, trading LIFO for about  of your long-term position is prudent in case of a steep retracement happening at any time now.Keeping a long-term holding makes sense from an investor's perspective.

The Dividend Investor's Natural Gas Export Playbook - Part 2,"Over the next 5 years, a multitude of natural gas export terminals are scheduled to commence operations. This will expand exported volumes of liquified natural gas  from roughly 14 BCF d to over 26.5 BCF day by 2030. TheA secondary round of projects that have reached FID will also serve to ensure these are not just one-off events. These supplementary projects will progress demandAs investors, this is an important market dynamic that can be captured for monetary gain. This can be done in several ways but also needs to be identified BEFORE the molecules start flowing.  focused on the producers of natural gas. Part 2 will focus on the midstream companies that will transport natural gas from the well heads to the export terminals.The midstream sector is ideal for income seeking investors due to its consistent levels of performance. Midstream companies help move molecules from point A to point B and charge a fee to do so. The business model in the midstream sector is usually fee based and structured with take-or-pay contracts that guarantee minimum levels of revenue. This has the benefit of insulating them from the swings in commodity prices.For a midstream company to experience growth, it needs to increase capacity to sell and increase volumes to fill that capacity. In this episode of my natural gas export series, we will look at two midstream companies that are building expansion projects to accommodate more molecules flowing overseas.This segment will be looking for stable and reliable income. Similar to my , I believe the midstream sector should hold roughly 30 -40  of one's energy portfolio. Here are my top two picks for this position.KMI made my list because it is already a front runner in the export game with greater than 50  market share in existing export terminals. KMI is obviously a natural gas dominated play with over 60  of its EBDA generated from the natural gas pipeline segment  KMI reports EBDA instead of EBITDA in its K-10 reports . The rest of its portfolio is supported by its refined products, terminals, and CO2 divisions.KMI currently supports a healthy 6.8  dividend. While it does not have quite the payout pedigree of a competitor like Enterprise Products, KMI has been . During that time, the quarterly dividend has grown from  0.125 share to its current value of  0.2825 share. That works out to be 7  average annual growth rate.A 6.8  dividend certainly makes KMI a viable option as an income producing asset. Let's take a look at how it stands to benefit from increased natural gas exports.KMI already services a bulk of the LNG export terminals that are currently in service, transporting a combined 7 BCF d. The company is projecting a 50  increase in those volumes once the first wave of new export terminals comes online  targeted for 2H 2024 . Beyond that, it is evaluating additional projects and contracts to supply the incremental increases that occur in the 2027 2028 time frames. KMI did not get into this position by mistake. It has the necessary ingredients that exporters want...connections and storage.Remember how I said the midstream business sells capacity  Just one look at KMI's asset map you can see that its system is connected to every major basin in the US. This gives flexibility to lean on other basins should weather or equipment issues disrupt service to ensure the molecules keep flowing.More importantly, KMI has the largest natural gas storage capacity of any of the big name midstream companies. Storage is a vital component of any natural gas network to ensure that adequate volumes are available during periods of extreme demand. In the same manner, export terminals rely on storage capacity to help meet their customers' needs should there be interruptions or higher priority customers upstream.It does not get advertised much but KMI has almost as much capacity as Enterprise Products, Energy Transfer, Enbridge, and Williams combined. This edge over the competition gives customers the confidence that KMI will be able to deliver. I summarized the capacity offered by some of the biggest midstream names in the table below using data from each company's annual K-10 report.Now that we have established a firm competitive advantage for KMI, what is KMI doing to build off this strength to capture more market share  KMI continues to invest in critical infrastructure to ensure its pipelines are the ones that the molecules flow on.These projects focus on the nearest basins, namely the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford. In the image below, you can see that these projects will direct over 4 BCF d to the Gulf Coast, with a whopping 2 BCF d dedicated to the Plaquemines export terminal.To bundle all this together we need to know one more fact. We need to understand what KMI can transport today so that we understand how much all of this will move the needle.In 2022, KMI transported a total of 39 BCF d. Therefore, we are looking at a potential 10  increase in transported volumes from just four of the 12 projects currently in the KMI pipeline  shown below . This will translate into roughly 6  higher cash flows for the business and larger pools of FCF available for distribution once the capital expense of these projects rolls off the annual budgets.KMI currently sits at a debt level of 4.0x debt to EBITDA ratio. This sits somewhere in the 'average' zone, being a full turn higher than industry leader EPD. While net debt has reduced from  38 billion in 2016 to  31 billion in 2023, near term maturities over the next few years will cause some competing interests to develop.KMI has  1.9 billion and  1.5 billion worth of maturities due in 2024 and 2025 respectively. The firm has stated that it plans to stay in the range of 4.5x net debt to EBITDA so all signs point to refinancing of near term debt. The 'anti-debt' crowd may not enjoy this news against the backdrop of high interest rates, but I believe over the long haul this is the appropriate move.At the current clip of capital spending, the dividend consumes a significant amount of remaining FCF. So far in 2023, after also accounting for share repurchases, KMI only has  to pay down its debt. KMI would be forced to forgo pursuing projects that are necessary to maintain its advantage in the export market. This opportunity cost is too great. Ultimately, I believe investors will see a larger reward over the long term by growing the company at this time versus trimming down its debt profile.The midstream space is boring. And that is a good thing for income investors. We want growing and reliable income to be the cornerstone of the portfolio. That is the premier reason to have the portfolio weighted so heavily to the midstream space.The midstream model has shifted in the last 5 years for these companies, with a focus on organically funded growth to minimize the reliance on debt. Being capable of self-fund all growth projects without having to tap a bank is a huge selling point to investors.But the market only values these projects for their cash generation capabilities, and as a result, shares largely trade with yield. This effectively creates both a price ceiling and floor for the share price. As shown below, over the last three years, KMI and its peer group's share price have tracked their respective dividend. I like these charts to get a general sense of value as each company's income generating abilities grow over time.Buying when yields are starting to compress only means two things. Less income and higher capital risk. Conversely, as yields expand, investors are rewarded with higher incomes and less capital risk. With the dividend continuing to grow against a dropping share price and several promising projects in the pipeline, I view KMI as a buy.WMB doesn't have the same pure fit with the export industry that KMI does. However, its Transco pipeline is hard to match. The Transco pipeline is the headline asset for WMB, which deploys 10,000 miles of pipe to stretch from New York, down through the sunbelt and into Texas. This pipeline network accounts for .Having a major artery like this means that even if it does not supply the export terminals directly, it is a good bet that the molecules will travel through WMB pipe at some point on their journey from underground to the boat. More importantly, you can see the connection points between three large energy hubs. On northeast end of the Transco pipeline we have the Marcellus shale, on the Texas side we have the Eagle Ford. Snuggled up in the middle is the Haynesville shale.Again, sourcing and capacity will be key to growing its business a reap the benefits of new volumes associated with LNG exports. WMB has projects planned to further extend the capacity and connection points of this mega pipeline system.WMB has a lesser dividend compared to KMI, coming in at 5.3 . This dividend has been growing since 2016, at a rate of about . While this is largely unimpressive compared to some of the bigger names in the MLP space, we will see that WMB's balance sheet fundamentals will allow Williams to be a growth play in the MLP space.WMB obviously has an anchor asset in the Transco Pipeline. This flagship asset is one that can have a springboard effect for future growth. To extend the reach of Transco, WMB has 22 planned projects entering service between now and the end of 2025.WMB's major projects start at the key basins.1. The Louisiana Energy Gateway is being constructed to delivery 1.8 BCF d from the Haynesville basin into the Transco pipeline.2. The Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway will expand the Transco connections in South Texas to increase volumes out of the Eagle Ford basin by 0.4 BCF d.3. The Susquehanna and Utica expansion projects will boost capacity out of the Marcellus shale by approximately 0.45 BCF d.The Louisiana Energy Gateway needs supporting projects to feed the massive 1.8 BCF d pipeline. WMB plans to incrementally increase its gathering and processing capacity by using the South Mansfield, Mansfield, and Haynesville West projects for an additional 850 MMCF d gathering capacity to help feed into the Transco main artery. These projects are scheduled to go into service in 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively.To wrap this up, let's again look at how much impact potential these projects have. We can conservatively estimate the major pipeline business to transport an additional 2 BCF d and the gathering and process business to feed an additional 600 MMCF d when all projects are in service. , WMB's average pipeline volumes was approximately 21 BCF d while its gathering volumes exceeded 18 BCF d. Working these volumes into the balance sheet, the six projects mentioned have the potential to lift earnings by approximately 5 .WMB stands at a slightly healthier position than KMI with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. It also has a similar maturity profile over the next several years. The major difference between KMI and WMB is the amount of unallocated funds remaining after paying the dividend and paying for capital projects.Over the , WMB generated nearly  2.9 billion in cash from operations. With  1.1 billion paid in dividends and  1.2 billion spent on capital expenses,  600 million remains to give WMB operational flexibility. This runs out to be  1.2 billion on an annual basis. While this could be deployed to reduce its debt profile, I believe investors would also be better served to devote excess cash to growing the business.WMB's debt structure also has a healthy cadence with no year in the 5 year horizon having any monumental balance due. This will allow WMB the opportunity to use its excess cash flows the opportunistically trim the debt profile.Similar to KMI, WMB's share price is lagging the current growth rate in the dividend. WMB has a smaller dividend than typical in the midstream sector but this also has its advantages. The excess free cash flow that is not earmarked for dividends and capital projects provides valuable flexibility.Management can use this flexibility to continue to accelerate growth projects or opportunistically retire debt without creating pressure on the balance sheet. WMB has the tools to grow its business to become stronger and leaner. Investors also get access to the largest natural gas pipeline in the United States. With the strong debt profile, slate of projects under construction, and ample excess free cash, I view WMB as a buy at current price points.In Part 2 of my natural gas playbook, we have explored two different midstream companies that are heavily focused on natural gas transportation. Kinder Morgan is already top dog when it comes to natural gas exports thanks to the connectivity of its system and vast storage capacities. KMI has several large products under construction to bolster its already leading position. Most notably, 2 BCF of additional pipeline capacity to feed the Plaquemines terminal when it comes online.My second candidate was The Williams Companies. WMB has the largest US natural gas pipeline in its Transco pipeline. This pipeline has the Eagle Ford basin on the Texas end, the Haynesville basin in the middle, and the Marcellus shale on the North East End. This connectivity from one pipeline is unmatched.

"Cushing oil stocks lowest in more than a year spark quality, price concerns","U.S. crude oil stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub have shrunk to their , causing concerns about the quality of the remaining oil and the potential to fall below minimum operating levels.Further drawdowns at CushingOn Tuesday, front-month Nymex crude for November delivery settled  to  90.39 bbl, and November front-month Brent crude closed  to  93.96 bbl.ETFs  , , , , , , , , , Since topping 43M barrels in June to reach a two-year high, Cushing's inventory levels plunged nearly in half to just below 23M barrels by September 15, the lowest since July 2022, and analysts expect another draw of as much as 1M barrels in the week ending September 22.Tank storage below 20M barrels, or 10 -20  of Cushing's 98M-plus barrels of capacity, is considered close to an operational low, because the oil is difficult to remove at such levels, among other problems.Strong refining demand, rising crude exports and future prices that have been weaker than spot prices have drained Cushing's tank farms, analysts say.Some analysts believe seasonal maintenance at refineries will help build crude stocks somewhat, but others warn that refiners likely will exit maintenance quickly and run full bore to keep up with high fuel demand.Separately, the U.S. Interior Department said it will  a sale of Gulf of Mexico drilling rights originally scheduled for September 27 to no later than November 8 following an appeals court ruling that ordered the Biden administration to .",46,2023-09-26T18:55:56.000-04:00
Valero Energy: Taking To 'Hold' After Solid Run (Rating Downgrade),"Back , I upgraded   to  Buy.  I said that while the company had experienced peak earnings, it had been doing a great job buying back stock and increasing its dividend while also undertaking someAs a refresher, VLO operates 15 refineries in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. that process a variety of sweet and sour crude, as well as other feedstocks. In turn, it produces things such as gasoline and other transportation fuels, as well as low-sulfur fuel oil and heating oil. The company sells its refined products through unbranded channels, as well as a network of independent dealers and distributors that operate under theAs I've noted in past articles, the biggest profit driver for VLO and other refiners tends to be crack spreads, which in basic terms is the difference between crude prices and refined product prices. They are similar to refining margins but don't include revenue from other produced products or costs outside of crude.Crack spreads blew out in 2022, leading to huge results for VLO and its peers. Not surprisingly, these ultra-high spreads did not last forever, but spreads continued to be well above historical norms in the first half of 2023. Today spreads have returned to more normalized levels, near their . There is some seasonality in the spreads around peak driving time, and they are expected to widen out again in March 2024.Strong crack spreads led to solid Q2 results for VLO, with the company reporting net income attributable to Valero shareholders of  1.9 billion, or  5.40 per share. That was down from adjusted EPS of  11.36 a year ago.For the quarter, VLO generated operating income of  2.76 billion, compared to  6.22 billion a year ago.Refining segment adjusted operating income was  2.4 billion compared to  6.1 billion a year ago. In Q2 2021, the segment only reported adjusted operating income of  442 million. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3.0 million barrels per day for both Q2 2023 and 2022. Volumes were 127 thousand barrels per day lower in Q2 2021 for reference.In the Renewable Diesel segment, VLO recorded  440 million in adjusted operating income, up from  152 million a year ago. Volumes doubled to 4.4 million gallons a day, due to the startup of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of last year.In its ethanol segment, adjusted operating income rose 61  to  127 million from  79 million a year ago. Volumes climbed by 15  to 4.4 million gallons a day.The company generated  1.5 billion in operating cash flow, or  2.5 billion when excluding an unfavorable change in working capital.Turning to the , VLO ended the quarter with  9 billion in debt and  5.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, the company bought back  951 million in stock and paid out  367 million in dividends.Looking at recent and future growth projects, the company's Port Arthur Coker project came online in April and is currently operating at full capacity. The company said the new coker has boosted the refinery's throughput capacity and has allowed it to process incremental volumes of heavy crudes and residual feedstocks.Meanwhile, it said its Sustainable Aviation Fuel  SAF  project at the DGD Port Arthur plant is progressing on schedule and is expected to be completed in 2025. VLO will pay half the  315 million cost of the project, which will allow it to upgrade 50  of the current 470 million gallons annual renewable diesel production capacity to SAF.On its  COO Gary Simmons was bullish on the market and refining fundamentals, sayingOverall, VLO put up a solid Q2, as crack spreads remained high, and it saw nice growth from its Renewable Diesel and Ethanol segments. With crack spreads starting to normalize, these two segments become more and more important for VLO.While their contributions look small today, as noted above in Q2 2021 VLO's refining segment only had adjusted operating income of  442 million, and it was  1.0 billion in 2019 before the pandemic. Combined, the Renewable Diesel and Ethanol segments generated  567 million in adjusted operating income this quarter, so in a more normalized environment they are a much more sizable contributor.VLO trades at a 3.6x EV EBITDA multiple based on the 2023 EBITDA consensus of  15.4 billion. Based off of the 2024 EBITDA consensus of  10.1 billion, it trades at around 5.5x.It trades at about 5x forward EPS, with analysts forecasting 2023 EPS of  26.13.It's projected to see revenue fall -13  in 2023 and 7  in 2024.VLO's stock generally trades in line with other refiners.As I noted in my past write-ups, VLO and other refiners look cheap because crack spreads have widened to well above historical norms. More normalized EBITDA after growth projects for VLO is likely closer to  6-7 billion. On that basis, it's trading around 8.5x normalized EBITDA.Valero Energy Corporation should have a strong Q3, as summer crack spreads were strong due to some unexpected refinery outages at competitors. Meanwhile, diesel and jet fuel crack spreads blew out after Saudi Arabia cut its production of heavier crude, which is often produced into diesel. However, RBOB crack spreads have recently been plummeting, in part due to seasonality, but also on some concerns of gasoline demand.Given the run-up in Valero Energy Corporation shares since my upgrade and the shift lower in RBOB crack spreads, I'm going to take my rating on VLO to  Hold,  as once again the stock looks close to fairly valued.

"Forget MPLX, 3 Reasons To Buy Enterprise Products Partners Instead","MPLX  and Enterprise Products Partners  are both investment grade, high yielding midstream businesses that have impressive track records of growing their distributions through good times and bad while also delivering very attractive long-term totalSince MPLX went public, it has delivered total returns that have totally crushed those of the broader midstream sector EPD has also significantly outperformed AMLP over the long termThat said, when comparing EPD with MPLX, EPD emerges as the clear winner in terms of which is the better risk-adjusted buy right now. Here are three reasons whyEPD beats MPLX in this category hands down, as evidenced by its sector-leading A- credit rating compared to MPLX's BBB credit rating. EPD's leverage ratio of 3.0x isAdditional metrics that support EPD's edge in this category are its robust  4 billion in liquidity, substantial free cash flow generation net of distributions, weighted average term to maturity on its debt of nearly 20 years, including over half of which is termed out to 30  years.Meanwhile, while MPLX lacks the impressive debt maturity calendar that EPD has, it is still expected to generate between  1.2- 1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions annually through 2027 and sums to only  1 billion less than the amount of debt that MPLX has maturing over that period. As a result, it is well positioned to soften the blow to its interest expense that may come from having to refinance debt at higher interest rates.As a result, we can conclude that both businesses have strong balance sheets, but EPD's is still head and shoulders above MPLX's.Both businesses have strong and stable business models overall.MPLX manages midstream energy infrastructure assets across two main segments   1  Logistics and Storage and  2  Gathering and Processing. Their operations include handling natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, and other hydrocarbons. They also transport products in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast and have terminals for refined petroleum. As a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation , MPLX is uniquely positioned near Marathon refineries, often serving as their exclusive provider. This strategic location poses barriers for competitors. Furthermore, MPLX's long-term contracts with Marathon ensure stable cash flow, making it resilient in the face of broader industry and macroeconomic fluctuations.EPD's top-tier portfolio is diversified by asset, energy type, and geography, with four key business segments   1  NGLs,  2  Crude Oil,  3  Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, and  4  Petrochemical   Refined Products Services. Its integrated business model and strategically located assets offer significant competitive advantages, presenting numerous opportunities for high-return investments and synergistic acquisitions.EPD's asset portfolio is overall better than MPLX's in our view as it has connections to every major U.S. shale basin and owns strategically located export facilities out of the Gulf Coast. Moreover, its comprehensive NGL network offers unparalleled access to Mont Belvieu. While MPLX's portfolio is also pretty good - especially its refining and Appalachia-based gathering and processing assets - it still lacks the strategic depth and breadth that EPD has.Moreover, its larger scale and geographic and asset diversity give it access to more high returning, low risk growth investment opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions. EPD's diversified operational footprint spanning natural gas liquids, crude oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals offers a balanced and resilient earnings profile. In contrast, MPLX is more concentrated geographically, has greater tenant concentration risk, and lacks the petrochemical exposure that EPD enjoys. As a result, we see EPD as having a more promising long-term growth profile compared to MPLX.Another big reason to favor EPD over MPLX is that EPD's insiders own a significant  32  of the company's equity. This substantial stake not only underscores the management's belief in the company's long-term prospects, but also ensures that their interests are aligned with those of the shareholders.Meanwhile, MPLX is largely beholden to MPC, which owns a large percentage of their equity and is also their primary business counterparty. While MPLX benefits from the steady stream of business and operational synergies from its relationship with MPC, it also exposes MPLX to the operational and financial risks associated with MPC. Any adverse event affecting MPC could have an outsized effect on MPLX. In contrast, EPD's diversified client base and operations insulate it from such concentrated risks. Moreover, in the past MPC has sold mediocre assets to MPLX at a price that proved to be a bit rich via the Andeavor Logistics . There is always the chance that MPC could execute a similar transaction in the future, which would likely hurt MPLX unitholder value.A final reason why we like EPD more than MPLX right now is that its valuation looks much more appealing. MPLX currently trades at an EV EBITDA of 9.35x whereas EPD trades at a nearly identical EV EBITDA of 9.47x. However, when compared to their 10-year averages, EPD's valuation is at a more significant discount  12.23x 10-year average EV EBITDA for EPD compared to an 11.64x 10-year average EV EBITDA for MPLX . Moreover, on a five-year basis, MPLX's EV EBITDA currently stands at a slight premium  9.25x five-year average EV EBITDA for MPLX , whereas EPD's stands at a discount  9.91x five-year average EV EBITDA for EPD .When factoring in EPD's stronger balance sheet, overall superior business model, greater insider alignment and less questionable ownership structure given MPLX's close relationship and dependence on MPC, EPD appears to be a much more compelling risk-adjusted buy right now.MPLX is not a bad investment opportunity either, as its 9.3  next twelve month distribution yield - that is well-covered by distributable cash flow - complements its fairly strong business model and balance sheet to make it an attractive income investment. However, EPD's very low risk balance sheet, strong business model, and even more compelling valuation make it the clear winner in the comparison of these two businesses in our view.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Beginning Of The End Part III: Green Energy Realities," Economies and their growth are fundamentally reliant on energy. Without it, economic growth would simply not be possible. Energy serves as a pivotal input in the production of goods, the cultivation of food, the transportation of these goods, and nearlyOver time, technological advancements have empowered humanity to devise more efficient means of generating energy. This progression has spanned from human and animal power, to biomass and fire, wood to coal, coal to oil, and now to renewables.These shifts in energy sources mark significant junctures in history, reconfiguring societies, economies, and the environment. They represent substantial changes in the primary outlets of energy harnessed for diverse purposes. Two notable transitions in the history of energy sources include the move from wood to coal, and subsequently from coal to oil. These transitions not only transformed societalWe stand at yet another pivotal moment, and I anticipate that the consequences will be nearly as significant. During this phase, we're witnessing the initial steps towards replacing a longstanding and reliable energy source that our modern economy relies on with another. As I've outlined in my previous articles, such a transition is highly unlikely to be smooth in nature. History has demonstrated that it often leads to more frequent booms and busts, heightened inflationary pressures, and economic volatility.For millennia, wood was the dominant energy source, employed for cooking, heating, and illumination. However, the 18th century saw a decline in wood supplies due to population growth and extensive forest clearing for agriculture and industry. The advent of the steam engine marked a pivotal stride in transitioning from wood to coal. James Watt's enhancements to the steam engine, alongside the ensuing Industrial Revolution, expedited this shift. Coal-fired steam engines fueled factories, railways for goods transportation, and the production of iron and steel.Coal emerged as a viable alternative to wood in the late 18th century. Coal boasts higher energy density compared to wood, meaning it yields more energy per unit volume. Additionally, coal is more easily transported and stored than wood. This transition, which of course helped to propel the Industrial Revolution forward and led to significant advancements, was also marked by major economic turbulence and societal dislocations.In the early 20th century, oil began to challenge coal's dominance. Oil stands as a more versatile fuel than coal, capable of being transported and refined into various products, including gasoline, diesel, and heating oil.The transition to oil gained momentum with the invention of the combustion engine, which helped to increase the demand for oil and refined products. Oil-powered vehicles proved more efficient and adaptable than coal-fired power plants. The discovery of extensive oil reserves in the 19th and 20th centuries, starting in regions like Pennsylvania, Texas, the Middle East, and Russia, supplied the fuel that has driven modern industry and our contemporary high-tech world for the last 70-80 years.These energy transitions brought about both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, they enhanced the quality of life for much of the global population. For instance, coal-fired stoves and furnaces provided more reliable heating compared to wood-burning alternatives. Oil-powered vehicles offered more convenient and efficient transportation.However, these transitions also gave rise to environmental issues such as increased air and water pollution, health concerns, and, as we see today, calls for radical changes to the regulation of industry.Energy transitions have emerged as pivotal historical moments, shaping our societies, economies, and environments. These shifts are marked by changes in the primary energy sources that power our world. From early wood burning for warmth to the coal-fueled Industrial Revolution, and the subsequent dominance of oil in the 20th and 21st centuries, each transition has wielded profound impacts.It is crucial to grasp that energy transitions are not swift processes. The transition from wood to coal spanned the 18th and 19th centuries, covering approximately 200-300 years. The shift from coal to oil took place over about 50-70 years. These transitions were characterized by phases of gradual adoption followed by periods of accelerated change, especially during peak industrialization.The contemporary transition is presenting unique challenges. It is primarily driven by climate scientists and environmentalists warning of widespread catastrophe if society does not swiftly transition away from fossil fuels within the next decade. This presents significant difficulties and physical limitations, both practically and economically.One significant challenge in achieving a swift transition away from fossil fuels lies in the fact that approximately three-quarters of the global population, encompassing regions like China, India, Africa, and South America, are actively expanding their reliance on fossil fuels rather than phasing them out. While Western industrialized nations are rapidly moving away from conventional, steady sources of power such as nuclear, coal, and gas-fired plants, China and India are in the midst of a substantial upswing in constructing these facilities at staggering rates.As of September 2023, China is currently in the process of constructing 95 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, a capacity . India, on the other hand, is working on 27 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, with an additional 24 gigawatts in pre-construction stages. While China and India are actively industrializing and enhancing their energy portfolios to provide affordable energy for their economies and citizens, Western nations are decommissioning coal-fired plants, which played a pivotal role in supplying electricity throughout the 20th century. Since 1990, the reliance on coal as a primary energy source has dwindled from 22.7  to 9.8  today. This percentage is projected to decrease further, with more coal plants slated for closure and replacement by wind and solar alternatives. This shift is predominantly driven by environmental considerations in the Western world, but it also entails significant trade-offs that are not currently factored into climate models, a point we will delve into later.China and India are also at the forefront of constructing state-of-the-art nuclear power plants, while the US and other Western nations have been progressively decommissioning and downsizing their nuclear power capacity over the past few decades. In 2023, the US has reduced its nuclear plants from a peak of 112 in 1992 to 92. In stark contrast, China boasts 55 operational plants with an additional 21 under construction, while India has 22 active plants and another 8 in various stages of construction. Both China and India are leading the charge in nuclear power generation. These nations are adopting a diversified approach in expanding their power and electricity grids, incorporating nuclear, coal, natural gas, and renewables.Unfortunately, the US and Europe are pursuing a curious and almost unthinkable objective of transitioning away from easily scalable baseload sources of power to intermittent energy sources that wholly depend on the weather and favorable climates of certain regions.The challenge facing the US lies in the absence of a well-structured energy transition plan. Instead, the shift towards green energy is marked by disjointed policies at both the Federal and state levels. Many of these policies are implemented through legislation or executive orders, often lacking thorough planning or grounding in engineering and scientific principles. Consequently, new mandates are being issued, resulting in the closure of nuclear, coal, and gas plants, and their replacement with less reliable wind and solar sources.A notable case is California, which exemplifies the consequences of energy transitions driven by political considerations rather than sound science, engineering, and physics. The state shuttered the San Onofre nuclear plant in 2013, with Diablo Canyon set to follow suit in 2030. The Mohave coal plant was closed in 2005. The retirement of the Redondo Beach and Huntington Beach natural gas plants, to pave the way for a transition away from natural gas in favor of wind and solar, has led to an increase in blackouts and brownouts. During the summer heatwave of 2022, the governor urged residents not to charge their electric vehicles during peak hours from 9 AM to 9 PM. The state's electrical grid is ill-equipped to meet its mandates of phasing out diesel trucks and gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030 and 2035.Not only is California's power grid becoming less reliable, but it is also driving up electricity costs. In July 2023, the average monthly residential electricity bill in California was  164, which is more than 22  higher than the national average of  134. California boasts some of the highest utility rates and gasoline prices in the country, with some areas already seeing prices surpass  6 per gallon and many even exceeding  7.The governor and state legislature have passed over 800 energy bills, compelling 5,000 companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks. As these green initiatives and mandates proliferate, the cost of electricity and gasoline is bound to become increasingly burdensome for residents. Rather than reevaluating their energy policies, the state is taking major oil companies to court, attributing rains, mudslides, and forest fires to climate change caused by the oil industry.Moreover, the state government is unwilling to address its own policies that hinder controlled burns for forest debris clearance, adequate water storage provisions, and erosion control. This, in turn, undermines the effectiveness of the state's green policies in delivering affordable and reliable energy, ultimately driving up costs for both industry and consumers. The state's plan to phase out diesel trucks and gasoline engines by 2030 and 2035, if adopted at the Federal level by the Biden Administration, could result in a significant loss of American auto jobs, as the majority of the supply chain for electric vehicles is controlled by China. This is a central concern in the UAW strike, as EVs threaten to phase out numerous auto jobs in the US.Apart from issues of unreliability and intermittency, there are four key problems with the current implementation of green energyLet s begin with scale. Chris Martenson's analysis in his latest book update to the  provides a compelling perspective on what would be necessary to replace fossil fuels. Here are some key considerationsGiven these colossal numbers, it's evident that a single-minded pursuit of renewables is unachievable. This is why countries like China and India are strategically ramping up their domestic energy capacity across all fronts. They get it, we don tWhen it comes to resource intensity our second point above there is a widespread misconception that using renewable sources of energy like wind and solar leads to a conservation of earth s resources. This is a far departure from reality. On the contrary,  green  energy demands a vast amount of mining of raw materials and critical metals. In a monumental study, Professor Simon Michaux, Senior Researcher for the Geological Survey of Finland, estimated that a total of 4.5 billion tons of key metals, encompassing copper, zinc, silver, cobalt, lithium, vanadium, and nickel, would be needed for transitioning away from fossil fuels.To put this into perspective, consider the amount of key minerals required to build a Tesla SSimilarly, for windmills and solar panels, vast quantities of steel, fiberglass, copper, aluminum, and rare earth metals are essential components.Minerals used in building a windmillMinerals used to build a solar panelMoreover, the high-tech devices we use daily, such as iPhones and iPads, also require a significant amount of resources and metals for their production. For instance, a single iPhone contains about 32.5 grams of things like gold, silver, and platinum, while an iPad Pro has approximately 67.5 grams.According to a , here are the estimated amounts of minerals in kilograms required to manufacture specific devicesAs demonstrated above, our modern technological world relies heavily on a diverse array of minerals, encompassing rare earth elements  REEs , precious metals, base metals, as well as materials like glass, lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel.Professor Micheaux's research underscores a critical concern  the current mining efforts, and those in the process of ramping up, are insufficient to support the envisioned green transition.The third challenge to a rapid and large-scale transition away from fossil fuels is, ironically, fossil fuels themselves. One inconvenient fact of green energy is that it depends on cheap and abundant sources of oil.As we just pointed out, the manufacturing of wind and solar requires vast amounts of raw materials such as steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, and rare earth elements, all of which require energy to extract and process. Electric vehicles in particular necessitate six times the mineral volume compared to conventional gasoline or diesel engines.Yes, an EV doesn t directly run on gas but it indirectly requires a large amount of cheap energy in the form of coal, oil, and diesel in order to make one.Graphite, for example, is the largest mineral by weight required for an electric vehicle. However, processing graphite is an energy-intensive process and is done so primarily in China using cheap coal-based power. Electric vehicles are far more expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles, however, their price is already highly dependent on cheap fossil fuels.Mining operations overall rely heavily on robust earth-moving machinery, including excavators, loaders, trucks, dozers, graders, and crushers, all of which run on diesel fuel. At present, it simply isn t practical for a large-scale replacement of diesel-powered machines with electric batteries given the large charging times and higher costs.But this is overlooking a much more powerful point  Oil itself stands as a cornerstone of the global economy, fueling 95  of all transportation worldwide. Virtually every product we purchase today, from groceries to household goods, relies on trucks, ships, planes, and trains for distribution the vast majority of which run on fossil fuels.The majority of our current oil consumption is sourced from 500 major oil fields discovered over half a century ago, constituting 75  of conventional oil reserves  I covered the giant oil fields and their depletion in a previous article, . However, these fields are approaching depletion. The remaining reserves primarily consist of heavy oils  as seen in Venezuela  or unconventional  tight  or  fracked  oil.Over the past decade, American shale has been the driving force behind 83  of global oil growth. However, these shale fields, spanning from the Marcellus to Eagle Ford and culminating in the Permian, are now approaching their peak. The Permian Basin, the final major shale basin, is projected to reach its peak production by the end of this year or the next. The latest reports from the EIA reveal a consistent decline in production in the Permian over the past three months, signaling our proximity to this peak.The IEA, in what I view as an optimistic scenario, considers factors like greater efficiencies and widespread adoption of alternative fuels. This outlook suggests that with concerted efforts, we could facilitate a successful transition to greener energy sources. The primary emphasis is on discovering new fields to replace those reaching their peak, a challenge given the global depletion rate of 8  per year on most oil fields. Unfortunately, new oil discoveries have dwindled over the past decade, with the remaining reservoirs often situated in demanding environments like oil sands, deep-sea reserves, or the Arctic. Shale oil has been the stalwart that saved us over the last decade, driving global oil production growth. As Goehring and Rozencwajg have repeatedly pointed out, just six counties in West Texas have been responsible for 100  of all global production growth, a trend now plateauing. The pressing question is  where will the new oil, essential for funding economic growth, come from  Shale wells face a daunting depletion rate of over 80  within a three-year span, necessitating ongoing drilling efforts to sustain production. As of September, the rig count is down by 11, and it's a decline of 134 rigs from a year ago.In addition to oil, the transition to a green economy demands substantial mineral resources, which, in turn, hinge on extensive mining endeavors. Diesel fuel is irreplaceable for mining operations due to its unparalleled energy density, particularly for the robust trucks tasked with transporting processed materials crucial for EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels. Consequently, diesel prices are poised to rise significantly.As highlighted in this and previous articles, oil discoveries have been declining by decade, as shown belowSource  Our Finite WorldThis decline has been exacerbated by a substantial drop in investment for exploration, a trend originating from the 2014 oil price downturn. Moreover, the administration's stance against fossil fuels is amplifying the costs and complexities associated with oil exploration and drilling. Foreseeably, oil prices are expected to remain in the triple-digit range for a significant portion of the coming decade, potentially further inflating the cost of mineral mining.The transition towards a green economy is further complicated by the fervent anti-fossil fuel stance advocated by environmental groups. There appears to be a dearth of critical thinking regarding the scientific and engineering requisites for mineral production to power a green economy. Despite the notable growth in renewable energy, it's crucial to acknowledge that energy consumption from fossil fuels has outpaced this growth. As indicated in the upcoming graph, energy consumption from fossil fuels has surged by 6.8 quadrillion BTUs from 1990 to 2022, almost doubling the demand seen for wind and solar.Source  Institute for Energy ResearchIt's imperative to recognize that the demand for fossil fuels persists for a reason they underpin the foundations of our technologically advanced economy. Without them, our present world would not be possible. Additionally, little has changed in our energy mix over the past three decades, except for a decline in coal and a rise in natural gas.To achieve Net-Zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, a reduction in fossil fuels' share of the primary energy mix by 62  to 0  by 2050 would be necessary. I will delve into why this scenario is unlikely to unfold and why green initiatives are poised to falter in the forthcoming installment of this series. In summary, the green transition is contingent on the use of cheap fossil fuels to extract and process the minerals essential for its realization. Current policies being pursued are poised to culminate in a major energy crisis and lead to an unfortunate reality check for much of the globe.Much like oil, the minerals requisite for building out the green economy are destined to become more expensive and face eventual decline in output a phenomenon commonly referred to as  Peak Minerals.  The ensuing series of graphs from  serves to illustrate the extensive mineral demand entailed in constructing clean energy.These visuals underscore that an electric vehicle necessitates six times the minerals for its production compared to a traditional gasoline engine. Moreover, in the realm of power generation, wind and solar technologies can require nearly ten times the volume of crucial minerals. In essence, we lack the mineral reserves needed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The shortage is compounded by insufficient mining resources, diminishing discoveries, lower ore grades as existing mines deplete, and a dearth of oil to fuel the mining of raw materials.As further exemplified in the previous graphs, clean energy is highly mineral-intensive, necessitating 6-10 times the mineral quantity for its production and implementation. According to the International Energy Agency  IEA , in their sustainable development scenario, demand for lithium is projected to surge by a factor of 42, graphite by 25-fold, cobalt by 21-fold, nickel by 19-fold, and rare earths by 7-fold. Meeting this escalating demand for metals will require a rise in metal demand from under 10 million metric tons to 42 metric tons by 2050. The pressing question is  where will the requisite metals be sourced to meet this demandA significant challenge facing the West is that these crucial metals are more geographically concentrated than oil production. While oil was distributed across the Middle East, Russia, and the United States, energy transition metals exhibit a more pronounced geographical concentration. China presently exerts dominance in the processing of the majority of these minerals, accounting for 40  of global copper production, 58  of lithium, 35  of nickel, 65  of cobalt, and a staggering 87  of rare earths.In line with a report from the Department of Defense titled  Securing Defense Critical Supply Chains,  China has assumed a pivotal role in the global advanced battery supply chain, claiming 94  of lithium production, alongside a significant share of other materials indispensable for the green transition. As electrification intensifies in order to meet the global elite's 2030 target date, dependence on China is slated to amplify through the remainder of this decade. This reliance raises significant concerns for the U.S. military, as we are reliant on Russia for our uranium, which fuels our nuclear aircraft carriers, submarines, and power plants, and on China for the computer chips that guide our missiles and power our high-tech economy.While the U.S. possesses access to many of these raw materials, mining companies are hindered from exploiting and processing them due to opposition from environmental groups and the Biden Administration's reluctance to open new mines. Instead of cultivating our own reservoirs of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, graphite, rare earths, oil, and natural gas, there is a preference to outsource the extraction of these resources to other nations, for fear of antagonizing influential environmental groups, which vehemently oppose all mining and fossil fuel drilling. The BANANA  Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody  Greens may have an affinity for their EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, iPhones, iPads, and iMacs, but they harbor a deep disdain for the economic systems and companies that produce them.It is imperative to underscore a few of the paramount resources necessary for driving the green energy transition. Let's commence with copper an average electric vehicle necessitates six times the copper compared to a gasoline engine. Furthermore, copper plays a pivotal role in constructing wind turbines and solar panels. Similar to oil, copper discoveries have been steadily decreasing by decade, with lower ore grades necessitating the processing of greater quantities of earth to yield a pound of copper. As evidenced by the graph from S P Global, copper discoveries have witnessed a precipitous decline over the past decade.According to S P, the copper discovered over the last 15 years amounts to a mere 143 metric tons. To put this in perspective, almost an equivalent amount of copper was discovered in a single year back in 1991. Even with fresh investments, copper discoveries are slated to reach a historic low for the remainder of this decade, unlikely to match the prime discovery decade of the 1990s. This decline in discoveries coincides with a surge in demand for the metal, expected to double in the near future.The next metal on the horizon to face a supply deficit is silver a metal with a multitude of applications, from electronics to solar panels. According to recent reports, China stands as one of the foremost global consumers of silver, with an annual demand averaging 6,300 tons. However, China's annual silver production barely reaches 3,350 tons, with reserves estimated at a mere 41,000 tons as of 2020. At the current pace of mining, China's reserves are projected to be depleted in another 11 years.Per the U.S. Geological Survey  USGS , global silver production reached 25,000 tons in 2020, with estimated reserves totaling 500,000 tons. Even more disconcerting is the situation in Mexico, which boasts the title of the world's largest producer of silver. Over the last decade, Mexico's average silver output has been 5,600 tons, with remaining reserves of 37,000 tons. At the current rate of extraction, the country's silver reserves are anticipated to be exhausted by the end of this decade. With silver reserves in China and Mexico facing depletion by the decade's end, the supply of silver could plummet by 15,450 tons, while demand is projected to exceed 30,000 tons.Source  GoldFixAnticipated demand for silver is set to surge over the remainder of this decade, spurred by requirements from green energy, high-tech industries, AI, 5G, clean power stations, EVs, medical technology, space stations, and smart appliances. Given the waning discoveries and reserves, where will this silver be sourced  The prevailing price of silver does not align with this reality, as its value has been suppressed through massive short positions on the Comex and London exchanges. The burgeoning demand is reflected in the premiums paid on sovereign silver coins by investors, which have ranged from 40  to 90  above the spot price of silver.As Guillaume Pitron chronicles in his two must-read books,  and , the digital revolution and green energy transition are highly intertwined. The technological convergence resulting from the integration of these new technologies exerts a multiplier effect on the consumption of metals that humanity relies upon. An aspect that often goes unacknowledged is the environmental toll of digitization and green energy. The extraction and processing of the needed metals for green energy is an inherently dirty process, but many countries are also unwilling to vastly increase the required mining efforts to make such a transition possible. Instead, the West has outsourced its renewable energy needs to countries with less stringent environmental standards, where metals are both mined and processed away from the public eye. Everyone loves clean energy, as long as it comes from somewhere else.In summation, the current energy transition necessitates a significant quantity of critical minerals, which are presently in short supply, anticipated to grow scarcer in the decade ahead, and ultimately poised to lead to resource scarcity and potential resource conflicts.In a forthcoming article, I will elucidate why the timetable for the green transition is likely to fall short, not only missing its target but, more crucially, propelling us toward a major energy crisis. You are already witnessing this in the soaring price of gasoline, elevated utility bills, increased food costs, and the inflationary impact of rising energy prices.Full transparency  we have vested interests in base metals, strategic metals, precious metals, uranium, oil, and natural gas.

Enterprise Products Partners: Stability At A Fair Price,"  is a North American company that offers midstream energy services for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals. They have an extensive infrastructure with over 50,000 miles of pipelines, 260 million barrels of storageIn early August Enterprise Products Partners reported adjusted 2Q23 net income of  1.283 billion, a decrease from the previous year, with .This decline was due to lower prices for various energy products and hedging losses, despite increased natural gas and NGL volumes. Net revenue fell by 34 , and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 10 , both below consensus estimates.But on the other hand, the company's operating costs were significantly reduced due to cost-reduction initiatives. The gross operatingIn February 2022, Enterprise Products Partners acquired Navitas Midstream Partners for  3.25 billion in cash, a move seen positively as it provided EPD with a foothold in the productive Midland basin, offering natural gas gathering, treatment, and processing services along with substantial processing capacity., in Q2 EPD completed several major growth projectsCurrently, EPD holds a leading position in the natural gas and NGL value chain within some of the largest-producing basins in the United States. They have  4.0 billion worth of growth projects in the pipeline, expected to come into operation in the coming years, while also continuing to invest in the development of shale plays.The increased production of hydrocarbons from shale basins and unconventional drilling has created structural cost advantages for petrochemical production in the U.S. This, in turn, has driven greater demand for NGLs from the petrochemical industry. I think this favorable market dynamic should enhance earnings visibility for EPD and support growth in their distributions, which have been growing for the past 25 years.In his August report from a proprietary source, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky highlighted that EPD continues to maintain the most robust DCF coverage ratio among the MLPs covered by Argus.However, using another MLP coverage list  from BofA , I cannot say that EPD has an outstanding dividend yieldThe same cannot be said about the FCF yield - 7.61  looks solid in absolute terms, of course, but it is not an outstanding result compared to other MLPsOn the other hand, EPD is qualitatively different from other companies in terms of its credit risk - the company's debt ratio is far below the industry averageEPD's leverage profile looks exceptionally strong, with 97  of debt being fixed-rate, consolidated liquidity of approximately  4 billion, and a net leverage ratio within their target range of 2.75x to 3.25x.Overall, I like EPD. Thanks to its healthy balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio below the industry average, the company will most likely continue to perform well in any market environment and continue to pay good  if not the best in the industry  distributions. Argus analysts expect EPD to benefit from the continued recovery in gathering and processing  G P  volumes, new growth projects, and the recent acquisition of Navitas Midstream Partners, and I agree with them here.As you have already seen above, EPD stock cannot be called undervalued in terms of FCF yield compared to its closest peers  Despite the rather high absolute value of this ratio, it is not outstanding. According to another valuation multiple - the forward EV EBITDA - EPD looks even looks overvaluedBut perhaps EPD will have higher EBITDA growth next year to justify such a high comparative multiple. Let's take a lookAnalysts' consensus expects EPD's EBITDA to be 8.9  above the current TTM next year - just 0.75  above the sample average. At the same time, EPD's FWD EV EBITDA figure is 4.9  above the peer group average.Valuation is a subjective thing. Sometimes it's completely incomprehensible why a stock continues to outgrow most others while its valuation has a comparative premium.In the case of EPD, however, it seems to me that the premium is primarily explained by a  a more stable leverage profile and b  a fairly reliable history of rising DCF figures, which is what all income seekers want.So, to me personally, EPD looks like a high-quality, fairly valued income stock that should feel comfortable in an investor's portfolio in any weather. However, Argus' Bill Seleski believes EPD is actually somewhat undervalued compared to its major peers, as its P E ratio is still quite low given its 5-year earnings per share growthOf course, investing in EPD stock at its current price level presents a range of risks that should be carefully considered. First of all, the company's fortunes are closely tied to the volatile energy market, subject to fluctuations in oil and gas prices that can impact revenues. Regulatory and environmental risks, including evolving regulations and unforeseen environmental incidents, pose potential challenges. Also, EPD's distributable cash flow, the basis for its distributions to investors, can be sensitive to market variables  even if it wasn't the case in the past , while competition, geopolitical events, technological shifts, and changing investor preferences for sustainable investments further underscore the complexity and uncertainties involved in investing in the energy sector.However, despite all these risks, to which is added the risk of slight overvaluation according to some valuation metrics, it seems to me that EPD is now trading fairly, distributing quite a bit of money to its shareholders. The complex energy landscape and wars in various regions of the world play into the hands of EPD and its peers, making their high yields even more desirable in the modern age of uncertainty. That's why I rate the stock a  Hold  this time, which I would consider a  Buy  if I saw it undervalued relative to other companies in the industry.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Medical Properties Trust: More Financial Distress Ahead," dividend continues to be unsustainable following its recent cut in almost half, plus the company s liquidity position is expected to turn quite concerning over the next six months.As I ve , MPW has reported relativelyWhile this is a step to improve the company s balance sheet, in this article I ll focus on MPW s cash flow generation capacity and balance sheet strength. Given that when I published my last article its cash flow statements were not available, I want to see if MPW now has a more sustainable dividend or ifAs I ve discussed in , MPW s investment case was heavily geared to its high-dividend yield, but its dividend was not sustainable and a cut was quite likely. Its management acknowledged this situation and has recently decided to cut its quarterly dividend by almost half, from  0.29 per share to  0.15 per share. Despite this cut, MPW s current dividend yield is still about 8.5 , due to a declining share price in recent weeks.This is still a quite interesting yield compared to other REITs, even though from a yield perspective MPW is now in-line with some other comparable healthcare REITs, such as   that currently yields around 8.7 .Regarding dividend sustainability, MPW should now be in a better position, given that it s going to spend much less on dividend outflows. However, as I ve  in detail in a previous article, when analyzing MPW s dividend sustainability based in free cash flow its dividend coverage was quite poor.Indeed, MPW s dividend outflows have increased gradually over the past three years, from  568 million in 2020 to near  700 million in 2022. During this period, its free cash flow generation has been on the opposite trend, declining from  513 million in 2020 to  421 million over the last year.Given that MPW has about 598 million shares outstanding, its new annual dividend of  0.60 per share will lead to an annual cash outflow of nearly  360 million, which is below the company s historical free cash flow generation. Therefore, at first glance, MPW s new dividend level seems to be sustainable based on historical financial figures.However, MPW has been selling assets to pay down debt, like it has done in Australia, plus one of its largest tenants is not paying rent  Prospect , thus its free cash flow generation in the coming quarters is going to be lower than compared to its recent history., MPW s cash flow from operations amounted to  212 million, a decline of 38  YoY, and its capital expenditures were close to  180 million. This means that MPW s free cash flow generation was quite weak, at just  32 million during the first half of the year. Despite that, the company paid  350 million in dividends, which were financed through borrowings and asset sales.Indeed, during the first half, MPW received  489 million of net proceeds from the sale of real estate, which were used to pay down debt, and borrow from its revolving credit facility in the net amount of  270 million. This explains why its cash position increased to  329 million at the end of June, compared to  262 million at the end of 2022.Thus, while MPW s operating activities continue to generate some free cash flow, it's not enough to make its dividend sustainable over the long term.Moreover, with the sale of its Australian assets, the company will not have meaningful refinancing needs in 2024, but it has a bond payment to make next December in the amount of  400 million  504 million . As the company is not generating enough free cash flow and is not likely to refinance this bond in the capital markets, it will need to pay it down using its revolving credit facility.According to Bloomberg data, MPW s  1.8 billion revolving credit facility with   has an amount available of around  600 million, thus MPW can use this credit facility and cash on hand to pay down the upcoming bond maturity. Assuming that MPW will want to maintain cash and will use the revolving credit facility to pay down the sterling bond, it will have only  100 million remaining in the credit facility by year-end.Assuming that MPW will maintain its historical pattern of distributing quarterly dividend payments next October and January, this will lead to a cash outflow of  180 million over the next six months. On the other hand, MPW has recently announced that it sold  105 million of its interest in Steward s credit facility, which helps to raise cash.Nevertheless, given that MPW s free cash flow generation from its operations has been quite low in recent quarters, this will reduce its cash position to around  300 million by next January, which is alarmingly low. Furthermore, MPW is quite likely to borrow the  600 million outstanding from its revolving credit facility until the end of 2023, which means MPW may start 2024 in a very difficult liquidity position.This does not necessarily mean the company will enter bankruptcy over the next six months, but it needs desperately to sell assets to raise cash or borrow from banks, which at this point will only be possible using its real estate assets as collateral  mortgage loans .Looking at current street  for the next couple of quarters, its cash flow from operations are expected to be around  150 million per quarter, which is enough to finance capex of around  70- 90 million per quarter. Given that capex is not easy to reduce given the company s asset size, this should lead to a negative cash generation after dividend payments, thus even after MPW s sizable dividend cut it remains unsustainable and the company should have suspended it.This cash burn profile does not bode well for MPW s share price ahead, as the market is likely to start worrying about its cash position, especially after the bond payment next December.Beyond its cash issues and poor dividend sustainability, MPW s deal with Prospect Medical was reportedly  by regulators, information that the company did not disclose to investors in its recent earnings call or financial reports. This raises some questions about the company s transparency on top of other issues raised by short-sellers, being another warning sign for investors about the company s business model sustainability over the long term.Medical Properties Trust continues to offer a high-dividend yield following its recent significant dividend cut, but its sustainability remains poor and the company s liquidity position is expected to become a concern over the next six months. In an extreme scenario of financial distress and a possible chapter 11 process, there probably wouldn't be much value left for shareholders, thus even after MPW s weak share price performance over the past year, further downside may lie ahead and this is a stock to avoid.

PepsiCo Q3 Earnings Preview: Time To Question The Dividend Motif,"No doubt about it -   is a wonderful company to own. It meets a variety of criteria that qualify it as an excellent investment. To name a few  The company has great brand strength, a well-diversified portfolio, operatesHowever, PepsiCo stock has been quite a weak performer lately. Hence, and considering the company will release its  on Tuesday, Oct. 10, and hold a conference call at 8 15 a.m. EDT, it's a good time to reassess. In this update, I discuss the reasons forThere are several aspects that I believe are responsible for the fairly poor performance of PEP stock recently, aside from the fact that the stock was definitely quite richly valued with a P E ratio in the high 20s and a free cash flow yield of just over 2 .For one, consumers continue to be squeezed by inflation, leading investors to fear that PepsiCo, which owns mostly premium brands, could lose market share to discount or white-label brands. That fear is certainly justified to a certain extent, given that PepsiCo saw a volume decline of 3  in its Convenient Foods segment and 1  in its Beverages segment in the second quarter. For the Convenient Foods segment, this is the fourth quarter that PepsiCo has reported a volume decline  Figure 1 .However, I don't think the recent decline in volumes should be over-interpreted. After all, isn't it the small, everyday treats that can brighten up a bad day  I firmly believe that people living on increasingly tight budgets are more likely to cut back on other things than to forgo the easy-to-obtain and cheap  in absolute dollar amounts  goodies that promise  and deliver  instant gratification. So I view PepsiCo's recent performance as temporary, also from the perspective that year-over-year comparisons are difficult, as consumers were still much less price-sensitive in late 2021 and early 2022. Nonetheless, it's certainly a good idea to keep an eye on PepsiCo's performance in terms of volumes, while its pricing power is undeniable if you look at its performance over the past few quarters.Second, it's the rotation to higher-growth stocks with exciting stories  AI, weight-loss drugs - to name just two  and the fact that long-term government bonds have finally become an alternative again. While dividend-paying blue-chip stocks have long been referred to as a  bond substitute   which is itself a fallacy due to the discretionary nature of the dividend , a dividend yield of less than 3  is certainly no longer that enticing. And even if PEP stock is down 14  from its 52-week high and now has a dividend yield of 3.0 , it's hard to argue away the attractiveness of long-term government bonds. Even if PepsiCo can continue to grow its dividend at   the five-year CAGR , it would take eight years to match the  that the 20-Year Treasury currently offers - or thirteen years if PepsiCo dividend growth declines to 4.0  per year  Figure 2 . I can certainly understand why income-oriented investors are increasingly interested in long-term bonds, but since I invest for the very long term, I stick with stocks because they carry no reinvestment risk.Finally, I think  is one aspect that makes risk-averse investors somewhat cautious against the backdrop of sharply higher interest rates. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, PepsiCo had  37 billion in net debt - roughly six times its long-term average annual free cash flow. While I concede that a consumer staples company with a reasonably recession-proof business model can manage above-average debt, it is still worth taking note of PepsiCo's pretty high debt load. However, investors who fear that the snack and beverage giant could suffer significantly in a  higher for longer  scenario should first of all keep in mind that PepsiCo currently pays a weighted-average interest rate of only about 2.7  on its debt.However, a look at the maturity profile of PepsiCo's bonds in Figure 3 shows that the short-term maturities  23  of PEP's debt matures by the end of 2025  have very low average interest rates. Assuming interest rates remain at current levels for several years, and based on current yields on its long-term bonds  e.g., the , PepsiCo would likely need to refinance at a rate of more or less 6 . This would negatively impact the company's overall weighted average interest rate by about 90 basis points, or worsen its interest coverage ratio from over six times long-term average free cash flow to five times. This is not a major concern, of course, but the somewhat cautious market sentiment makes sense in this context as well.PepsiCo has a history of delivering . For at least the last sixteen quarters, PepsiCo exceeded consensus revenue estimates by 2  to 7   Figure 4  and earnings per share  EPS  estimates by up to nearly 13   Figure 5 .With that in mind, an earnings beat next Tuesday seems very likely, but at the same time, I think the company's impeccable track record is very well understood and therefore shouldn't cause PepsiCo's stock price to jump. Of course, I can imagine a positive market reaction if PEP reports a return to volume growth, especially since smaller rival General Mills, Inc.  recently  rather poor volume numbers for its first quarter of fiscal 2024  ending August 27, 2023 .Another aspect to consider when assessing the likelihood of an earnings beat is . Short-term upward revisions by analysts can be an indication of an imminent earnings beat. However, due to the apparent ease of predictability and low volatility of PepsiCo's earnings  as evidenced by FAST Graphs' pristine analyst scorecard in Figure 6 , revisions have remained fairly insignificant in recent months  Figure 7 . That said, the long-term outlook for PEP's revenues and earnings has  over the past six months.However, aside from the high probability of an earnings beat due to the impeccable track record  and the positive guidance revision after Q2 , I think it makes sense to take note of the recently appreciated U.S. dollar. PepsiCo reports its revenues and earnings in U.S. dollars but generates more than 40  of its sales outside North America, including Canada  Figure 8 . Still, I don't think PepsiCo's significant exposure to foreign economies will have a major impact on its upcoming sales and earnings numbers. For example, recall the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the third quarter of 2022 - PepsiCo delivered an EPS surprise of nearly 7  and a revenue surprise of 5.5  in this arguably challenging environment.As mentioned above, management's announcement of a return to volume growth in both segments could boost investor confidence. Given the easier comps in the recently ended quarter  see Figure 1  and due to higher advertising spending in the first half of the year, I think a return to volume growth is actually possible - despite the lackluster numbers from General Mills. Finally, while news of a return to volume growth could spark a  modest  post-earnings rally, I think PepsiCo shares, which are still quite expensive, continue to trade more on external factors such as , bond yields and, of course, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's  than on operating fundamentals.PepsiCo stock has been blowing off some steam after flirting with an - arguably lofty -  200 price tag. PEP stock is down 14  from its 52-week high, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a buy. The company continues to perform very well in this difficult environment, but it's certainly not without weaknesses.Its balance sheet is fairly highly leveraged, and if we are indeed in for a  higher for longer  scenario, refinancing of the currently low-cost  in terms of interest rates  short-term maturities will reduce PepsiCo's debt-servicing capacity. But even if the company refinances all its bonds maturing by the end of 2025 at a coupon of 6 , the weighted-average interest rate will still be well below 4 .Somewhat slow long-term free cash flow and a high payout ratio of 60  to 100  of free cash flow  depending on whether acquisitions and divestitures are included in the calculation  suggest that management could return to somewhat more conservative dividend growth rates in the future. This makes PEP stock somewhat unattractive when compared to the de facto 5  risk-free Treasury yield that can currently be locked in for 10 to 20 years. Depending on PEP's future dividend growth rate, it could take well over a decade for investors to match long-term Treasuries in terms of generated income  of course, different taxation should also be kept in mind . However, investing in shares of blue-chip companies has the advantage of avoiding reinvestment risk - what if interest rates are back at 0  when the long-term government bonds purchased today matureI have a hard time calling the stock a great investment at its current price - even though I expect the company to beat earnings estimates next Tuesday when it reports its third-quarter results and long-term prospects are very solid. The stock could jump on positive news of a return to modest volume growth, largely due to relatively easy comps and increased ad spending. However, with a  of 23, PEP stock isn't exactly cheap. That said, if analysts' estimates are accurate, PEP stock price outlook and return prospects over the next few years are pretty acceptable for a blue chip  annualized return of 7.1 , Figure 9 . Consider also that this expected return includes even a modest multiple contraction to a P E ratio of 21.All in all, I remain ambivalent about PEP stock valuation. However, it is difficult to argue against the quality of the company, and that is why I am sticking to my .

Philip Morris Q3 Earnings Preview: What Nobody Is Talking About,"  is the undisputed leader in smoke-free products - thanks to relentless internal research and development, the very astute acquisition of Swedish Match, and shrewd deal making with Altria Group At the same time, given that the stock has essentially gone nowhere since early 2021, investors need to recognize that the company got cheaper over time as earnings, cash flow, and prospects improved  e.g., PMI's re-entry into the U.S. was unknown at the time . And with the tobacco giant regularly  and set to  its third quarter numbers on Thursday, Oct. 19, at about 7 a.m. Eastern, it's likely that the stock is getting a little cheaper once again.In this update  I cover PMI stock regularly , I share my expectations for the upcoming earnings report and my updated valuation.However, as investors focus almost myopically on PMI's undoubtedly solid growth prospects, I also will take a close look at the company's debt. While U.K. competitor British American Tobacco plc ,  suffers from seemingly unending bearish sentiment  largely due to its high U.S. dollar debt , PM stock is holding up very well - despite a significant mismatch between U.S. dollar sales and U.S. dollar debt, a 90  increase in net debt since 2021, and an increasingly likely  higher for longer  interest rate environment.Philip Morris exceeded earnings per share expectations by a more or less significant margin in every single quarter over the past four years  Figure 1 . Sales estimates were exceeded in 13 of 16 quarters, but in the few cases where Philip Morris missed expectations, the deviation was insignificant.For the recently completed quarter,  earnings per share of  1.62, representing year-over-year growth of 5.6 . This is solid growth considering the challenging environment where consumers are increasingly switching to discount brands in the face of high inflation. The consensus estimate for net sales is  9.22 billion, up nearly 15  from Q3 2022, and with the Swedish Match transaction digested and Philip Morris successfully establishing IQOS in the U.S., EPS growth is expected to accelerate  Between Q3 2023 and Q4 2025, analysts expect average quarterly EPS growth of 13.1 . , average annual EPS growth is currently expected to be 9.4  - PMI is clearly not a company in decline.Given the more or less significant positive EPS surprises  7.0    5.7  and the rather insignificant EPS and revenue revisions in recent months, an earnings beat on Thursday is a reasonable expectation. However, Philip Morris held its  on Sept. 28, 2023, and  a  0.17 negative currency impact, two-thirds due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and one-third due to balance sheet-related impacts in Argentina. As a result, adjusted earnings per share guidance has been reduced slightly by 3  and is expected to come in at the lower end of the range of  1.60 to  1.65. Considering that the event was held only two days before the end of the quarter, it's unrealistic to expect a significant improvement, and therefore this will likely be one of those quarters where PMI beats the estimate by only a small fraction.PMI's adjusted operating profit margin for the third quarter of 2023 is expected to be about 41.5 , which is in line with the third quarter of 2022 but slightly better than the second quarter of 2023, when profitability improved 2.1  from the first quarter to 39.4 .PMI expects to ship approximately 32 billion Heated Tobacco Units  HTUs  in Q3, or between 125 and 130 billion HTUs for the full year. Management is obviously very confident about the growth prospects of its heated tobacco business, even though the launch in Taiwan has been delayed and the already proposed ban on flavored heated tobacco in the EU  is currently . In my opinion, this says a lot about PMI's market-leading position not only in devices but also in conventional, tobacco flavored HTUs. That said, management has cautiously pointed to inventory uncertainties as its trading partners adjust to the ban.The acquisition of Swedish Match, without a doubt, was a very smart move . It should be remembered, however, that Philip Morris took on a significant amount of debt to fund the Swedish Match acquisition and be in a position to pay Altria the  2.7 billion consideration to exclusively market IQOS in the U.S. starting next year in May. Philip Morris currently has about  44 billion in net debt on its balance sheet  Figure 2 , which is 90  more than it had before the bold but undoubtedly brilliant moves it made to solidify its position as the market leader in smoke-free products.The company generates modest interest income  Figure 3  due in part to its sizable cash balance  3.5 billion , but nonetheless net interest expense increased 88  year-over-year to  527 million in the second half of 2023. For the full year, investors should expect net interest expense to continue to rise, driven by recent debt raised and, of course, the high interest rate environment.Philip Morris' weighted-average all-in financing cost of its debt in 2022 was 2.5 , 10 basis points higher than the previous year. However, looking at the current numbers  p. 48, 2022 10-Q2  and conservatively ignoring interest income, the company's weighted-average interest rate is 3.9 . This is far from what I would call worrisome, but it's still important to look more closely at two aspects - the maturity profile and currency composition of PMI's debt.The current maturity profile of PMI's debt, based on data in the 2022 10-K and including debt issuance in the first six months of 2023  p. 50, 2022 10-Q2 , is shown in Figure 4. Clearly, the company faces significant maturities in the coming years with weighted-average interest rates well below the current weighted-average rate for its total long-term debt  about 3.6 . As an aside, the difference of around 30 basis points to the company-wide rate  see above  is due to more expensive short-term debt.Of course, if interest rates do remain higher for longer, the company will have to refinance a significant portion of its upcoming maturities at comparatively unfavorable rates, which will impact debt service capacity, earnings and free cash flow. If we conservatively assume that interest rates remain at current levels for five years and Philip Morris refinances its long-term debt at the current rate of its long-term bonds , the company's interest burden increases by approximately 50 , excluding the contribution of short-term debt  14  of total debt at the end of the second quarter . Put in relation to free cash flow  which is expected to be rather weak in 2023 due to the aforementioned currency headwind , PMI's interest coverage ratio would decline from 6.9 times free cash flow before interest to 5 times.Even though the decline in the interest coverage ratio looks serious, I would not overinterpret it. After all, free cash flow should recover significantly once the Swedish Match integration is completed, the heated tobacco business becomes profitable in the U.S.  remember that HTUs are much more profitable than traditional cigarettes , and the synergies between Swedish Match and IQOS are realized. In addition, I think it's reasonable to expect PMI's capital expenditures as a percentage of operating cash flow to decline over the years, given the company's significant investments over the past decade . All in all, I'm confident in Philip Morris' strong growth prospects and hence do not consider its currently rather pronounced leverage concerning. This also is evident from the company's growth targets for 2024 to 2026, which were highlighted during the Investor Day event  e.g., adjusted operating income CAGR of 8  to 10 .In addition to considering a  higher and longer  interest rate scenario, it's also worth looking at the currency composition of PMI's debt. In the event that the U.S. dollar continues to appreciate against other currencies  or PMI theoretically fails to gain a foothold in the U.S. , interest costs will rise due to the high proportion of U.S. dollar-denominated debt  68 , including short-term debt, Figure 5 . Still, I would not over-interpret this risk as PMI has an obviously experienced and savvy treasury department. Prior to the Swedish Match acquisition, the company had de facto no sales in U.S. dollars, but still had adequate currency risk management. With Swedish Match's sales growing  approximately  2.1 billion in 2022 , IQOS slowly gaining a foothold in the U.S., and assuming Philip Morris can indeed leverage Swedish Match's supply chain infrastructure for IQOS, the company's currency risk will gradually decline, which should ultimately dampen earnings volatility.According to , PM stock is undervalued based on several metrics  Table 1 . According to FAST Graphs  Figure 6 , Philip Morris International stock is currently trading at a blended price-to-earnings ratio of 15. Based on current earnings estimates, the stock has a potential annual return of 13  through 2025. While this is significantly less than its peer British American Tobacco, I believe PMI's growth prospects are much more solid and its risks are lower. Of course, this should not be taken to mean that I think British American is an overly risky or poor investment - quite the contrary, my regular readers know that I have a .Finally, PMI stock is also quite favorably valued from a free cash flow perspective. In 2023, free cash flow suffers from currency headwinds, but with the growing contribution from Swedish Match, synergies potential, and the expected launch of IQOS ILUMA in 2025, a return to significant growth is likely. As PMI has cemented its leadership position over the years, I also suspect that capital expenditures will gradually decline below previous levels, which also will support free cash flow growth. According to Figure 7, PMI stock would be fairly valued at  128 per share, representing upside potential of 37  based on stated growth rates and a cost of equity of 9   brief sensitivity analysis included in the figure .Philip Morris will announce its third quarter results on Oct. 19 before the stock market opens. Although the company has regularly beaten estimates for quarterly earnings per share by more or less a wide margin in the past  7.0    5.7 , I don't expect a big surprise on Thursday. The company held its Investor Day event just two days before the end of the third quarter, so recent guidance is well reflected in consensus estimates. Still, I expect a small positive surprise given management's typically cautious comments and its tendency to under-promise and over-deliver.Longer term, PMI's prospects are obviously very good and intact. This is underscored, for example, by the fact that management still expects HTU sales of about 32 billion in Q3 2023 - despite the ban on flavored heated tobacco products currently being implemented in the European Union. Longer-term shipment guidance of 180 to 200 billion HTUs and 800 million to 1 billion nicotine pouch cans in 2026 also confirm the strong growth path.Investors also should watch for an update on the Pre-Market Tobacco Product Application  PMTA  for IQOS ILUMA  the induction-based successor to the conventional, blade-based design  that management recently announced for October 2023  expected approval 2025 . However, the conventional design will still be introduced in select U.S. cities starting in May 2024 for testing purposes  after Altria's exclusive distribution rights end , but I suspect this technologically inferior system will not be sold nationwide.But while PMI is clearly a leader in smokeless products and has excellent growth prospects, it's important not to forget the sharp increase in debt, largely due to the acquisition of Swedish Match and the consideration paid to Altria for regaining exclusive distribution rights in the United States.Philip Morris' net debt has nearly doubled since 2021, and the weighted-average time to maturity of its long-term debt declined from 10 years at the end of 2021 to just over eight years at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Given its relatively high dividend payout ratio  70  to 90  of free cash flow , PMI will need to refinance most of its debt at maturity. If we assume interest rates remain at current levels for five years, the interest expense on PMI's long-term debt will increase by approximately 50 . As a result, interest coverage would drop from about 7x pre-interest free cash flow to 5x. In addition, PMI is significantly dependent on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, which further increases potential pressure on the company's debt service capacity given the still very low level of sales in the United States. Finally, investors should keep in mind that Philip Morris is, after all, a tobacco company, and it increasingly looks like such companies - along with oil   gas companies, for example - pay a more or less significant  ESG premium  on their debt .However, due to excellent fundamentals and expected strong free cash flow growth, I believe PMI is well positioned to weather a potentially longer-term high interest rate environment. With Swedish Match's sales growing  about  2.1 billion in 2022 , IQOS slowly gaining traction in the U.S., and assuming Philip Morris can leverage Swedish Match's supply chain for IQOS, the company's currency risk will decrease, and with it the need for potentially costly hedges.Given PMI's undoubtedly strong prospects, the compelling roadmap presented at the investor day, and manageable debt levels even in a persistently high interest rate environment, I think the stock is a solid buy in the  90 range.Thank you for taking the time to read my latest article.

SFL Offers A Herculean Dividend,"SFL Corporation Ltd.  is a diversified ship leasing firm with 36 containerships, 13 tankers  after the recent sale of four older tankers , seven car carriers, two drilling rigs, and 15 dry bulk ships.The company is controlled by JohnSource  Company WebsiteSFL s cash flowSource  SFL brought in  182.4 million in Q1 charter revenue, approximately 60  of which dropped to EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow  110.3 and  108.5 million respectively . This obviously covers the  29.2 million they pay out in dividends per quarter many times over. Or if you prefer, one can look at the last years EPS of  1.60 and see that it covers their 96  annual dividend well. Despite this predictable cash flow, SFL is currently trading at an attractive 9.3  dividend yield  covered 1.7x last year, representing a 15.8  earnings yield . It is also currently trading at a lower than typical valuation.The firm, however, does have debt that is currently convertible at  11.76 per share  so resistance as the convertibles become  in the money  should be expected. At that price SFL would still be offering a well covered 8.2  dividend before any dividend increases.In the last three months,  was priced under  9 per share because investors were worried about containership firms in general, as well as the re-lease prospects for the drill rig,  West Hercules .The containership worries however have always been unfounded as current spot rates for SFL are mostly immaterial. The average containership in SFL's fleet remains on contract for the next 6.7 years.Offshore rig lease volatility has been a bigger challenge for SFL and especially Fredrickson s other holding, SDRL, in the past. Thus, Mr. Market may have some holdover memory and fear from that previous negative event. Currently, however, offshore exposure is clearly more a benefit than a risk. Drilling rig lease rates and thus the ongoing outlook for recently refurbished SFL's  West Hercules   and eventually the  West Linus  have improved materially since the invasion of Ukraine. According to Woods Mackenzie  and expected to grow another 20  by 2025.SFL, however, did have to invest  100 million in the  West Hercules  to modernize it and thus make it more marketable. This capex is already factored into management plans and guidance with a lot of it showing up in Q1 and Q2. Now that the dry dock is completed,  West Hercules  will start a short 4.5-month,  50 million dollar contract with Exxon. Following that it will be offshore Namibia for another  50 million contract with Galp Energia. Then offshore Canada for a  100 million contract with Equinor. All told this will generate  200 million dollars and keep the rig employed into early 2025. The  100 million looks well spent.Car carrier rates have also been rising significantly. Two of SFL's car ships were just released to Volkswagen for three years at rates that will generate 6x the cash flow they used to  6 share to 36, SFL has been benefiting not just from higher drill rig, car carrier and tanker lease rates caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, but also the ability to sell older tanker ships at premium prices. In Q4 2022 the company sold four older tankers  raising over  100 million in cash , then some more in Q1. Hence, with the delivery of the SFL Elbe in June, SFL will now have no tanker vessels trading on spot and a fleet with a lower average ship age.SFL had  185 million  1.46 per share  in cash on the books at the end of Q1. Thus even after factoring in remaining Q2 Hercules refurbishment expense, SFL is going to be swimming in cash.As a shipping firm with a lot of long-term contracts, SFL can afford to carry a lot of debt  expected to be about 72  of assets following a recent car carrier refinance .Source  The rates, however, are reasonable with nothing due in 2023  a refinance completed in Q1 eliminated all 2023 debt listed above . A fair amount, 40  of the total debt, is fixed. Hence, an additional 100-bps increase in interest rates is estimated to cost the firm about  9.8 million in additional annual interest, or roughly 5  of their earnings run rate. A 100-bps decline in rates on the other hand would increase their earnings by about 5 . Neither is particularly material compared to the effect of changes in current ship lease rates.Our estimated Debt   Adj. run rate EBITDA is 2.4x. This is admittedly off a historically high EBITDA  however, that EBITDA is expected to be pretty secure and growing through at least 2024.It doesn t really matter how well management is aligned. John Fredrickson owns over 20  of the firm so from a capital allocation point of view, whatever he says goes. Mr. Fredrickson has a long history of maximizing dividends with the firms he controls. So, if dividends are something you find appealing, the firm should be well aligned with your wishes.SFL broke solidly above  10 today  August 14  on at least double the normal volume.  and recent  1 billion  in refinancing's make their 9.3  dividend not only solid, but likely to increase over the next couple years.The board also recently approved a potential  100 million stock buyback  the first I'm aware of them ever doing . They may be starting to execute on this buyback approval. If so that would create ongoing demand which should be supportive of the stock's price.- Ole Hjertaker - CEO of SFL s charter book insures significant ongoing cash flows that should continue to cover the dividend well for the next couple years at least. Only 7  of their ships are on spot, with those on time charters having a greater than 6-year average backlog duration totaling more than  3.7 billion. If you are happy with a 9.3  and growing dividend, you should be happy owning SFL Corp.The primary goal of the  is to produce an overall yield in the 7  - 10  range.

Tesla: Turbocharging The Future,"As the electric vehicle  EV  landscape accelerates,  is not just keeping pace but setting a scorching track record. , the company marked a significant milestone in itsThese numbers aren't merely impressive  they represent Tesla's extraordinary scale, unwavering commitment to operational excellence, and mastery in meeting robust market demand. Therefore, the pullback in TSLA and these achievements reaffirms the  rating for the stock.TSLA remains a strong contributor to the , but since I am also trading the stock on my personal portfolio, I have sold my position to take advantage of the recent peak. Nevertheless, I am planning to reenter at current levels following the pullback.In , Tesla reported notable production and delivery figures. The company produced  vehicles and delivered 435,059 vehicles, reflecting its impressive scale and consistency in increasing production and deliveries. Tesla's production and delivery volumes have increased, indicating its operational efficiency and the strong demand for its EV.In detail, during Q3, production increased by 18  year-over-year, highlighting the company's capacity expansion and efficiency improvements. Deliveries grew by 27  year-over-year, indicating increased production and the successful distribution of vehicles to customers. This consistent growth in production and deliveries indicates that Tesla is well on track to achieve its 2023 volume target of around . This impressive production and delivery performance is a key driver of the company's value growth potential.One of Tesla's primary strengths is its consistent and impressive revenue growth. In Q3, Tesla reported total revenue of  23.4 billion, representing a 9  year-over-year increase. This revenue growth is a result of an increase in vehicle deliveries. In the third quarter, Tesla achieved growth in this area, contributing to its overall revenue expansion.While vehicle sales remain a substantial portion of Tesla's revenue, its efforts to diversify revenue streams have been paying off. Revenue from other parts of the business, such as energy and services, also contributed to the overall revenue growth. This diversification mitigates the risk associated with relying solely on automotive sales.Although there was a reduction in average selling price  ASP  year-over-year, it is important to note that this reduction was partly due to pricing and mix changes. Tesla's ability to adapt to market conditions and adjust pricing to remain competitive is a strategic strength that allows it to maintain sales volume and market share.On the downside, a negative FX impact of  0.4 billion was reported in Q3. While this dampened year-over-year revenue growth, it's essential to recognize that Tesla operates in a global market and is exposed to currency fluctuations. Managing such impacts is just part of its financial expertise.Finally, the Q3 report indicates that the company plans to grow production as quickly as possible, aligning with its long-term target of a 50  compound annual growth rate it began guiding in early 2021.While Tesla's operating income decreased 52  year-over-year in Q3 to  1.8 billion, resulting in a 7.6  operating margin, it's essential to understand the specific factors affecting profitability.As mentioned earlier, the reduced ASP hurt operating income. On the other hand, the increase in operating expenses driven by projects such as the Cybertruck, AI development, and other research and development initiatives impacted operating income. While this may have weighed on short-term profitability, it is an investment in long-term growth and innovation, which is crucial for Tesla's future competitiveness.Additionally, the cost of production ramp and idle costs related to factory upgrades are short-term expenses aimed at improving production efficiency. These investments can lead to cost savings in the long run, making Tesla more competitive in the EV market.Despite the challenges, Tesla reported gross profit growth in segments such as Energy Generation and Storage and Services and Others, highlighting the effectiveness of diversifying revenue streams and the potential for these segments to contribute significantly to profitability in the future.Tesla is making progress with the development and production of higher-density 4680 cells. These battery cells are more energy-efficient, offering increased range and performance. During Q3, the adoption of an 800-volt architecture for the Cybertruck is notable. This architecture may bring significant cost savings and demonstrates Tesla's dedication to engineering efficiency.One of Tesla's most significant strengths lies in its Autopilot and AI technology. As of the latest update, Tesla vehicles have driven over 0.5 billion miles with the Full Self-Driving  FSD  beta. This real-world data collection and training set Tesla apart from its competitors. The immense amount of data gathered from these miles provides a deep pool of information for refining and improving autonomous driving algorithms. It's important to note that training data is a critical limiting factor for the progress of self-driving technology.Additionally, Tesla's AI and FSD version 12 advancements are a game-changer. FSD version 12 leverages end-to-end AI, taking photons as input and providing control outputs. This mimics the human perceptual system, with a large bitstream of input data being compressed into a small set of control outputs. Tesla's approach closely resembles how humans process information, primarily through optical inputs from their eyes. This alignment with the human perceptual system sets Tesla's technology apart.Finally, the company has more than doubled the size of its AI training compute to accommodate its growing dataset and support projects like the Optimus robot. Also, the development of a humanoid robot, Optimus, using AI rather than hard-coded software, is an example of Tesla's innovative approach to automation and robotics.Tesla's energy storage division is another fundamental strength with rapid value growth potential. In Q3, it became one of the company's highest-margin segments. Energy and service contributions to quarterly profits exceeded  0.5 billion. Tesla's energy storage deployments increased by 90  year-over-year in Q3 to 4.0 GWh.This growth is attributed to the ongoing ramp of Tesla's Megafactory in Lathrop, which is working toward a full capacity of 40 GWh. The demand for clean energy and efficient energy storage solutions continues to rise globally. Therefore, Tesla's ability to provide high-quality energy storage products positions it well to capture a significant share of this growing market.The company has strategically opened new factories in different parts of the world. The factories in Berlin and Austin are critical components of this expansion.The capacity to manufacture vehicles locally in different regions reduces shipping costs and allows Tesla to cater to local markets more effectively. During Q3, there was an increase in Tesla's locations  sales, service, delivery, and body shop  by 25  year-over-year. Also, the number of supercharger stations and connectors increased by 31  year-over-year.Finally, the upcoming Gigafactory in Mexico adds to Tesla's global footprint, enabling it to tap into a new market. Tesla's ability to adapt and expand its production capacity and market share based on regional demand is evidence of its agility.While Tesla's Cybertruck is a highly anticipated product, with over 1 million reservations for the Cybertruck being a recent example, in the earnings call Elon Musk acknowledged the enormous challenges in bringing the Cybertruck to volume production and making it cash flow positive. Creating a product with advanced technology and a unique design, like the Cybertruck, presents specific obstacles. One notable point made by Musk is that prototypes are relatively easy to create, but the transition to volume production is exceptionally challenging.Musk's caution about the time and effort required for the Cybertruck to become a significant positive cash flow contributor indicates a practical approach to growth. Elon Musk acknowledges it could take  or longer before Cybertruck becomes a significant positive cash flow contributor. Production difficulties could lead to delays and increased costs, impacting Tesla's profitability.Cybertruck is set to debut in its 2024 model year and will likely start with only all-wheel-drive versions, as indicated by the absence of a single-motor  two-wheel-drive  option in the .This decision implies that the initial models of the Cybertruck might be more expensive, since two-wheel-drive variants typically cost less and are often offered as entry-level options. Furthermore, the VIN decoder reveals that the Cybertruck, like other electric trucks, will be considerably heavier than traditional gas-powered trucks, mainly due to the substantial weight of their battery packs.Despite the growing competition in the electric truck market, with entries from Ford , General Motors , and Rivian , Tesla's decision not to offer a two-wheel-drive version aligns with current industry trends where similar EV trucks are also primarily all-wheel drive.This approach might be partly influenced by manufacturing challenges and the goal of profitability, as suggested by Elon Musk's comments on the difficulties in mass-producing the Cybertruck and achieving positive cash flow from it.A fundamental strength of Tesla is its consistent focus on reducing the cost per vehicle. In Q3 2023, Tesla's cost of goods sold per vehicle decreased to approximately  37,500. While it's essential to understand that production costs at new factories remained higher than at established factories, Tesla took proactive measures by implementing necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions.Overall, this cost reduction effort aligns with Tesla's belief that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader. The company maintains competitiveness by consistently driving down production costs and ensuring higher profitability. Therefore, lower production costs also have the potential to lead to more affordable vehicle offerings, expanding Tesla's customer base.One key weakness in Tesla's Q3 2023 report is the reduced ASP year-over-year. This reduction in ASP is primarily attributed to pricing and mix. If lower-priced models  e.g., Model 3 Y  make up a significant portion of the sales mix, it can drive down the overall ASP. Economic conditions, consumer preferences, and incentives also influenced the ASP. For example, changes in government incentives or economic downturns can impact consumers' willingness to pay a premium for EVs.Critically, Tesla's focus on FSD technology is a fundamental aspect of its future growth. The development of autonomous driving systems is highly complex and carries significant regulatory and safety risks. If Tesla faces delays or regulatory hurdles in deploying FSD, it may impact its value growth potential. Likewise, the high-interest rate environment affects car affordability. Monthly costs for customers influence Tesla's pricing strategy, and rising interest rates may impact the cost of financing a Tesla vehicle.Lastly, Tesla's energy storage business is a growing source of profit. However, Megapack deployments can be lumpy. Variability in deployments may impact the energy division's contribution to quarterly profit. Finally, the Q3 report revealed a decline in solar deployments, down 48  year-over-year to 49 Megawatt. This decline is attributed to sustained high-interest rates and the end of net metering in California.Tesla's Q3 2023 results illustrate a dynamic blend of triumphs and challenges in the evolving EV and energy sectors. Dominating with record-breaking production and delivery of 435,059 vehicles, Tesla underscores its leadership and ambition in the EV market.However, the company faces challenges like a reduced ASP due to a shift in sales mix and economic factors, along with the high costs and risks associated with scaling up innovative products like Cybertruck and FSD technology.Despite these challenges, Tesla's commitment to cost reduction, global expansion, and advancements in AI, battery technology, and energy solutions mark its enduring commitment to driving the future of sustainable technology and transportation.Author of I am the founder of , a stock-market  designed to elevate your due diligence process through in-depth analysis of businesses.I have previously worked for  and  in external auditing, internal auditing, and consulting.I am a  and an  Global member, and I hold  and  degrees from leading UK business schools.In addition to my research platform, I am also the founder of a private business.Yiannis Zourmpanos is a Charter Certified Accountant, a former corporate auditing consultant and a Fellow Member of ACCA Global with both BSc and MSc degrees.

Medical Properties Trust: Let Me Tell You About The Lonesome Loser,"There s a lot going these days in politics in sports in finance and in real estate investment trusts  REITs .And one of the ways that I drown out the constant flow of noise in the world is by going to the gymI ve been doing this for quite some time, and I ve found that my writing has improved because of my  time away.I get a lot of new ideas when I m not staring over a computer screen and not scrolling through messages on my phone.And don t even get me started with social mediaAnyway, back to the gymSo, this week I was walking on the treadmill and one of my iTunes songs began to spit out these lyrics,Now, in case you don t know, this is a tune by The Little River Band that tells the story of a gambler who bet and lost to the  Queen of Hearts.Now, I know you re really confused by nowWhat does this song have to do with the beaten down healthcare REIT known as And am I the lonesome loserAfter all, I m still long shares in Medical Properties Trust, and specifically, I m down -29  in one account and -28  in another.As I informed members last week, I m now maxed out of the  speculative  buy position, which means I have only two remaining options   either hold  em or fold  em.As I explained in my   in mid-MayShares were trading at  7.59 when I penned that article and today, they re trading at  7.39 per share. I may be one of the few writers who s humble enough to show you my YTD track recordSo, as you can see, there s no pride parade herePerhaps a pity partyBut as John Ortberg wrote in his book  also the title to his book ,As I ve explained in previous Seeking Alpha articles, I m a big Monopoly fan, and in real life, I ve come from near bankruptcy to a net worth of millions.So, the real truth is   I have not lost anything yet  since I haven t sold my shares  and I m sure I m not the only player in the gameWhich means I m not lonely.I m sure there are many others reading this article just like me.Who are sitting on MPW chips and debatingShould I hold  em or fold  emOr perhaps after reading this article, some of you may even double downWithout further ado, let me tell you about this lonesome loserMedical Properties Trust has been a battleground stock since the beginning of 2022 and has been one of the most shorted REITs since that time. There continues to be negative sentiment surrounding the company and at the time of this writing the stock has a short interest of 21.07 .The stock rallied from the middle of May towards the end of July with the price per share going from  7.26 on May 16 to  10.62 on July 26 for a gain of approximately 32 , but shares fell sharply after  on August 8 and have continued the downward slide into this week, losing practically all of the gains made during its two-month rally.Primary concerns surrounding the company include MPW s outstanding debt, the financial health of their tenants, and the potential for a dividend cut.MPW s management team touched on these issues during their second quarter conference call, so we wanted to take a closer look at their most recent operating results along with some of the topics discussed during the call.MPW is an internally managed real estate investment trust that was formed in 2003 and specializes in the acquisition and development of hospital facilities which are leased to operators on a net-lease basis.They invest in a variety of medical properties including general acute care hospitals, behavioral health clinics, impatient rehab facilities, long-term care hospitals, and urgent care facilities. But the primary driver of their earnings is general acute care hospitals, which make up 63.7  of their total assets and 69.6  of their second quarter revenues.MPW s portfolio consists of 444 healthcare properties that contain approximately 44,000 licensed beds, which are leased to or mortgaged by 55 operators with properties located in 10 countries across 4 continents. 2023 second quarter total revenue at  337.4 million compared to  400.2 million for the same period in 2022. Total expenses for 2Q 23 were reported at  529.2 million versus  232.1 million in 2Q 22 and GAAP net loss was reported at  42.4 million, or  0.07  per share versus GAAP net income of  189.6 million, or  0.32 per share in Q2 22.Included in the 2Q 23 net loss were several non-cash charges including approximately  286 million in accelerated lease intangible amortization and a  95 million straight-line rent write-off, both of which are related to the early termination of Steward s leases for the hospital properties in Utah, which are now leased by CommonSpirit.Normalized funds from operations  NFFO  in 2Q 23 were reported at  285 million, or  0.48 per share, compared to  275 million, or  0.46 per share in 2Q 22.While the 2Q 23 reported NFFO shows a year-over-year increase, it is important to point out that  68 million, or  0.11 per share, that was included in the 2Q 23 NFFO was rent and interest revenue that was recognized due to the receipt of an equity interest in Prospect s managed care business  PHP Holdings, LLC  in lieu of cash for the 2023 contractual rent owned by Prospect Medical Holdings.The  68 million included in NFFO reflects the excess value of their equity interest in PHP Holdings over the book value of the real estate and other assets exchanged for the equity interest in the managed care business.When backing out the non-cash item of  0.11 per share, NFFO for 2Q 23 comes to  0.37 per share, which represents a 19.5  decrease in NFFO when compared to the same period in 2022. When asked if the equity stake in PHP Holdings would generate any recurring cash flow, MPW s management repliedGiven that this is a non-cash item, we will back out  0.11 from NFFO and adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  when evaluating MPW s dividend coverage.While it was not brought up during the , it is well known that MPW has high tenant concentration, especially in their top tenant Steward Health Care, which contributes more than 20  to their annualized revenue.Given their high exposure to Steward, many investors and analysts have had concerns over Steward s financial health and how it might impact Medical Properties Trust.MPW disclosed that Steward refinanced its asset-backed credit facility that was set to mature at the end of 2023 and entered into a new asset-backed credit facility that has a four-year term and provides Steward with significant incremental liquidity.MPW is 1 of 7 members of the lending group that is financing the new asset-backed credit facility and  which is secured by first-lien interests in Steward s government and commercial receivables.I see both positive and negative aspects in this recent development.Many investors would like to see MPW get out of the business of lending money to its tenants, as the additional investment increases their exposure to Steward.At the same time, the new asset-backed credit facility extends Steward s debt term, increases their liquidity, and removes concerns over Steward s ability to refinance its debt.Edward K. Aldag, Jr., the CEO of MPW, pointed out that the new investment is not an operating loan to Steward but rather a .While unrelated to the new investment, MPW highlighted that Steward s trailing-twelve-month EBITDARM rent coverage came in at 2.9x which is a significant improvement over their EBITDARM rent coverage of 1.8x that was reported in the second quarter of 2022.As of the end of the second quarter, MPW had  19.2 billion in total assets and  10.2 billion in debt for a debt-to-asset ratio of 53.3 .Their adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAre ratio was reported at 6.8x and their adjusted interest coverage ratio was 3.4x at the end of the period. 86  of their debt is fixed rate and their total debt carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.93 .MPW has been in the process of deleveraging their  recently and .During the second quarter, MPW completed the sale of 7 hospitals in Australia for AUD 730.0 million and used the proceeds to reduce their Australia term loan which matures in 2024.They expect to sell the remainder of their Australia portfolio for AUD 470.0 million during the third or fourth quarter this year and expect to use the proceeds to fully repay the 2024 Australia term loan.On the earnings call, MPW stressed that the use of capital for debt reduction continues to be their primary focus.In addition to the proceeds from their Australia portfolio, MPW plans to use  100 million in proceeds from the sale of 3 hospitals to Prime, and the expected  355 million in proceeds from the planned sale of their Connecticut hospitals to Yale to further deleverage their balance sheet.MPW s management team pointed out that due to their asset sales the company does not have to refinance any debt at this time.They have a single maturity due later this year for  400 million but have the liquidity to cover it and the 2024 term loan should be fully repaid once the remaining hospitals in their Australia portfolio have been sold..When asked how MPW plans to refinance the 2025   2026 maturities, MPW s management team commented that they have several levers to pull, with the primary one being asset sales, but also mentioned that they could enter into joint ventures to help reduce and refinance their debt.One lever MPW could pull to raise capital for debt reduction is a dividend cut.In 2022, MPW paid out approximately  698.5 million in dividends, which represents approximately 45  of their total revenues that year.During the call, Jonathan Hughes, an analyst with Raymond James asked if MPW s board is considering a dividend cut to retain more cash in order to pay down debt and improve the balance sheet more quickly. MPW s management team stated that the decision is at the board level but that During the second quarter, MPW paid a dividend of  0.29 per share. Using their reported NFFO of  0.48 per share gives us a NFFO payout ratio of 60.42 , but when removing the non-cash item of  0.11 that jumps to 78.38 .After accounting for share-based compensation, debt costs amortization, and straight-line rent, MPW s AFFO per share for the second quarter was reported at  0.41. After backing out the non-cash item of  0.11 that leaves  0.30 of true cash flow for the quarter, which translates to an The uncomfortably high payout ratio does not necessarily mean that MPW will cut its dividend, but given their emphasis on debt reduction, .Currently MPW pays a 15.28  dividend yield and trades at a P AFFO of 5.89x. The high yield and low AFFO multiple suggest that the market is expecting a dividend cut, which is very possible. I look at MPW as an extreme example of a high risk   high reward trade.The company has a BB credit rating  junk rated , so it does not get investment-grade pricing, and in today s interest rate environment any new debt incurred would likely be prohibitively expensive to make accretive acquisitions.Similarly, with an AFFO yield of almost 17 , the same could be said about their cost of equity.MPW s overall cost of capital will make it very challenging for them to achieve external growth, and if current conditions persist, it will be very costly for them to refinance their 2025   2026 debt maturities.At the same time, hospitals are essential for a functioning society, so in the long run MPW should continue to generate positive cash flow as they have over the last 20 years.For an investor with a strong stomach that is willing to ride out the storm this could be an excellent entry point as the stock is trading at a significant discount to their normal AFFO multiple and is trading approximately 40  under the net asset value.In a recent Seeking Alpha article someone commented,MaybeThat s yet to be decided.Us  shareholders are funding a lawsuit right now. On the Q2-23 earnings call, management pointed out that the  costs related to  our  Short Seller Litigation were about  2.5 million.I m sure that number will increase as litigation continues.Keep in mind, here s what happened to   after they announced a  to help fund their litigation against a   on Seeking Alpha .There s another interesting comparison I ll make with regard to FPI and MPWThe Chairman and founder of FPI is Paul Pittman. He owns 2,473,000 shares, amounting to around  27 million today  as per FactSet .Edward Aldag, CEO of MPW, owns 4,294,000 shares, amounting to around  32 million today  as per Fact Set .Whether you love or hate  em, they both have significant skin in the game, and in the case of Aldag, his retirement is riding on the success of MPW.For now, I m hanging on for the rideJoin  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

10 Dividend Growth Stocks For October 2023,"Welcome to the October edition of my monthly series of In this series, I rank a selection of  stocks and present the ten top-ranked stocks for further research and for high-quality stocks with superior growth and income prospects and stocks trading below my risk-adjusted Buy Below prices. In my view, these stocks are excellent candidates for dividend growth investors.The latest Dividend Radar  dated October 20, 2023  contains 713 DG stocks.Of these, 224 are high-quality stocks with quality scores in the range of 21-30. As explained below, I screened these high-quality stocks for ones with qualifying Chowder numbers  37 passed , with a projected 5-year yield on cost of at least 4   70 passed , and trading below my risk-adjusted Buy Below prices  200 passed .Only 18 Dividend Radar passed all the screens. fYou implement the Chowder Rule by adding a stock's forward dividend yield and its 5-year dividend growth rate  DGR  to obtain the Chowder Number C .Chowder required a margin of safety based on whether the stock is a Utility sector stock and based on the stock's yieldHigher-yielding utility stocks get special treatment because utilities are  and enjoy regional competitive advantages. As a result, utilities have relatively stable yields and growth rates.For this reason, I use two more metrics to predict future growth, the  and the 5-year revenue growth rate  RGR . These metrics provide additional hints of future growth prospects as companies pay dividends from earnings, and earnings depend on revenue.Assume you buy a stock today and hold it for five years. If the company continues to increase its dividend at the same DGR as over the past five years, your 5-year YOC would be the dividend you receive annually relative to today s stock price.To calculate the 5-year YOC is easyHere,  5 means .I prefer to invest in stocks with a 5-year YOC of greater than 4 .My risk-adjusted Buy Below prices allow premium valuations for the highest-quality stocks but require discounted valuations for lower-quality stocksMy Buy Below prices recognize that the highest-quality stocks rarely trade at discounted valuations. As a dividend growth investor with a long-term investment horizon, I'm more interested in owning quality stocks than getting a bargain on lower-quality stocks.This month's valuation screen looks for stocks trading below my risk-adjusted Buy Below prices.As mentioned earlier, only 18 candidates passed all of this month's screens.

Energy Transfer's Massive Purchase Of Crestwood Equity Partners Makes Sense,"August 16th ended up being a monumental day for both   and  . Shares of both companies rose after news broke that the former had Digging into the details, I found that there are solid financial and operational reasons why such a deal has been made. As a shareholder of Energy Transfer, with the company making up my second-largest holding with 12.9  of my overall portfolio, I am a big fan of any deal that brings value for shareholders. Certainly, the price paid for the business was attractive - though, personally, I would have preferred the transaction involved at least some cash given how discounted shares of Energy Transfer are. But in the grand scheme of things, this is only a small complaint, and the overall picture for both firms movingOn August 16th, the management team at Energy Transfer  that it had reached an agreement to acquire Crestwood in an all-stock transaction with an implied enterprise value of nearly  7.1 billion. For each share of Crestwood that an investor has, they will receive 2.07 shares of Energy Transfer when the transaction closes in the final quarter of this year. Based on the price that shares of Energy Transfer was trading at immediately before the transaction was announced, this would imply an equity value of  2.75 billion. To get up to the  7.1 billion of enterprise value, we add  3.25 billion of net debt,  434.2 million of non-controlling interests, and  650 million of preferred stock that Crestwood has.This price does not really represent any premium for shareholders of Crestwood. The implied buyout price works out to approximately  26 per share, using the price that shares of Energy Transfer were trading at on August 15th. Even so, that did not stop Crestwood stock from climbing 4.6  for the day, while shares of Energy Transfer popped higher by about 1.7 . It is unclear why Crestwood is trading at a premium to the buyout price, but this usually means that the market anticipates some other firm stepping in with an offer.As you can see in the  above, the two companies do have some rather substantial overlap in terms of the assets that they have in operation. Beyond any doubt, Energy Transfer is the larger of the two, as made clear by the  40.33 billion market capitalization of the company. So, this means that its physical footprint is also substantially larger. The assets that seem to be particularly appealing to Energy Transfer are those focused on the Williston and Delaware basins, that should complement the acquirers  downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and its hydrocarbon export capabilities in both Texas and Pennsylvania.There are, of course, other assets that Crestwood would bring to the table that are valuable to the company. For instance, it opens up the door to the Powder River basin because of the gathering and processing system that Crestwood has located there. Combining the storage and logistics business that Crestwood has with Energy Transfer s NGL, refined products and crude oil assets pave the way for operational synergies. The location of oil and gas exploration and production drilling and completion activities, as well as operations geographically close to the assets that Crestwood has, opens the door for various growth prospects, including, management said, the potential to make bolt-on acquisitions.Another reason for this deal is the financial side of matters. For starters, Energy Transfer believes that it can capture around  40 million in annual run rate cost synergies from the deal. And that is even before factoring in the benefit from potential revenue growth. Even though this may not sound like much, when compared to the  300 million in core costs that Crestwood incurs each year, that is a rather sizable amount of capital on a relative basis. Management also indicated that some synergies could come from debt refinancing in the years to come. Over the next five years, Crestwood should have around  1.1 billion worth of debt coming up for refinancing or repayment.Frankly, I am skeptical about any benefits here. The  500 million of debt coming due in 2025  an annual interest rate of 5.75 . And the  600 million coming due in 2027 bears a rate of 5.625 . The last sizable amount of debt that Energy Transfer raised, which was back in December of last year for  2.5 billion, was in the form of senior notes. This was done in two different tranches, with the cheapest of the two bearing an annual interest rate of 5.75 . I would be surprised, especially with interest rates having risen since then, if the company could get better terms on refinancing. Where it might get some benefit, however, would be on the credit facility side of matters. As of the most recent quarter, Energy Transfer had a weighted average interest rate of 6.33  on its credit facility. That compares to the 7.56  that Crestwood had. But on only  417.4 million, we are looking at potential cost savings of only  5.1 million on an annual run rate basis. That truly is a rounding error.It was also mentioned that, in two years, there could be the opportunity to essentially refinance the preferred units of Crestwood. The  650 million that's currently outstanding bears an annual interest rate of 9.25 . The cheapest of the preferred units that are publicly traded for Energy Transfer have a rate of 7.375 . But those are fixed floating rates. And as I detailed in an  not too long ago, the switch to floating, given current interest rates, could take the amount paid on those securities up to nearly 10 . So I really don't see much of an opportunity on that front unless there is something that management knows that I don't. It is worth noting that, in some instances, the decision to not follow through with the agreement by either party could result in Crestwood having to  a  96 million breakup fee to Energy Transfer.The big question that investors likely have is whether this deal ultimately makes sense for Energy Transfer. It does, but I would argue that the firm should have used cash to pay for the transaction instead. For the current fiscal year, Crestwood said that EBITDA should be somewhere between  780 million and  860 million. They did say that it will likely be in the lower half of that range. So for the purpose of this article, I assumed that EBITDA will be  800 million. If we strip out interest expense on its current debt and a modest amount of taxes that the company pays, we would end up with operating cash flow of roughly  576.2 million. For the purpose of this analysis, since I am focused on the common stock as opposed to the preferred, I decided to strip out the preferred distributions from this to get us a bit lower at  516.2 million.Using these figures, I was able to create the chart above. On a forward basis, Crestwood is trading at a price to operating cash flow multiple of 5.3, while the EV to EBITDA multiple should be 8.9. The numbers dropped to 4.9 and 8.4, respectively, if we assume that synergies forecasted by management come into play. While this is very cheap and is definitely affordable compared to similar firms, it's not as cheap as Energy Transfer. It is trading at a price to operating cash flow multiple of 3.9 and at an EV to EBITDA multiple of 7.7.This price disparity is why I would have preferred the deal being done entirely or mostly in cash. It's painful, as a shareholder, to see undervalued equity being used to acquire a more expensive company. But because shareholders of Crestwood will only own 6.5  of the combined business, the overall multiples of Energy Transfer, even without the synergies, won't change much. The price to operating cash flow multiple will remain 3.9, while the EV to EBITDA multiple will inch up slightly to 7.8. It is because of this minimal impact on the company's valuation that I am still optimistic about the deal.Interestingly, in its own  regarding the transaction, Crestwood made its case for why this deal makes sense for its shareholders. They also argued, in the same way that I have in prior , that, relative to similar firms, Energy Transfer is drastically undervalued. Using August 15th closing prices, the transaction assigned a value of  26.19 to shares of Crestwood. But seeing Energy Transfer hit the median price target set for it by Wall Street analysts of  17 per share would result in an implied value for Crestwood investors of  35 per share. That is upside of 33.6 . And if the company is compared to similar enterprises, using the median trading multiple for them, we would get an implied share price for Crestwood of  49 per share. That translates to an upside of 87.3 .It is refreshing to see some other party perform an analysis like this. It means that they also are of the opinion that shares of Energy Transfer are significantly undervalued, and they believe that, by latching themselves to the company now while it is cheap, they can experience the upswing that will eventually come to pass.All things considered, I must say that I am fairly happy with this transaction. Even though the deal is not structured the way I would have preferred, it does represent a valuable opportunity for Energy Transfer to get a quality asset that will benefit it in the long run, while simultaneously giving shareholders of Crestwood the opportunity to experience strong upside once the market realizes just how cheap Energy Transfer stock actually is. I am skeptical of some of the benefits, such as refinancing debt and preferred stock. But in the grand scheme of things, these are fairly small qualms. With a deal does more than ever is validating my prior bullish stance on Energy Transfer, which makes me happy in these uncertain times.Daniel is an avid and active professional investor.

Gambit,"Looking at the most recent CPI print in the US coming at 3.7  in August from 3.2  in July and in conjunction with oil upOne can opine that the sacrifice of the strategic reserves of the United States  SPR  dipping below 800 million barrels, a level once seen in 1985, moving from a record 92-day supply three years ago to a 46-day supply low is akin to a  political gambit  and in terms of  soundness  is not only procuring zero time gain but, also leading to a positional weaknes in light of the latest oil production cuts of both Saudi Arabia and Russia, but we ramble again.In this conversation we would like to look at the inflationary implications of the significant rise in oil prices as well as the message coming from the significant rise of soft commodities from a  monetary  perspective.Back in early August in our conversation , we pointed out our  Gambit  which was an upward acceleration of oil prices. As well in our June conversation , we indicated that the energy sector was currently being  neglected  flow wise and that for us it was indicative that it was getting cheap and therefore  enticing   yet another allocation hint of ours from our musing . No wonder that our  Gambit  was vindicated  our contrarian stance  given  performance for the last three months has been significantThere is of course a similar picture when we look at various commodities in the last three months with oil prices racing aheadAt the time of our August musing, we put forward again a paper from the Bank of Israel we have quoted on numerous occasions , Bank of Israel DP092015. . Since the Great Financial Crisis  GFC  of 2008, the paper argues that a 10  change in oil prices moves 5Y expected inflation by nearly 0.1  in the US and 0.05  in the Euro area.As such at the time of our writing back in early August we concluded that we were expecting a rise in inflation expectations in that context in the coming quarters.On top of that we are looking at the rising discrepancies between oil prices and Diesel pricesBoth Saudi Arabia and Russia have reduced oil production which are  richer  in DieselWith consumption rebounding, there is a  refining capacity  problem showing up in rising pricesThere is also an issue with Crude StockpilesAnother  broken  market has been in the Jet Fuel space relative to oil prices since the start of the conflict in UkraineAll in all, Christine Lagarde at the helm of the ECB is no  Le Chiffre  aka Mario Draghi when it comes to managing  expectations  even after the 25 bps latest rate hike. This is the ECB's tenth consecutive rate hike, putting rates at 4.5 , their highest since 2001Inflation is becoming entrenched and the three consecutive months of rising oil prices represent a significant headwind for European economies in general and for the ECB in particular as shown by Banque de France February 2018 post entitled  The impact of oil prices on inflation in France and the euro areaWhen it comes to the impact of global oil prices on domestic inflation, the IMF find out in their September 2022 paper entitled , that using data for 71 economies, a 10  increase in global oil inflation amounts to 0.4  impactVolatility in commodity prices, increases volatility in domestic inflation over the medium term.But when it comes to the United States, given the recent UAW strike there, is cause for concern inflation wise. Last month, large stoppages from strikes resulted in 4.1 million missed days of work, the biggest monthly total since August 2000 as per the Labor Department dataWhy is it a cause for concern you may askBecause of what was highlighted in the IMF September 2022 paperAs such, the inflation receding narrative touted by many financial  experts  is akin to a  Gambit  we think. We remain in the stagflationary camp regardless of the Jedi tricks from financial markets punditry.Before delving into the nitty gritty of what entails our second bullet point we would like to remind our readers that the most important monetary changes will certainly come from the Bank of Japan.We have highlighted on numerous occasions that there has been a significant weakening of the Japanese yen in synch with the rise in US Treasury 10-year yields  6-month chartAs per our last conversation this is what we had to sayIn early August in our conversation  The Decoy effect , we mentioned that Mrs Watanabe and her  Double Deckers were back into play through Uridashi and Toshin funds via carry trades on both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real which used to be her favorite currency back in 2011. Sure for many the NASDAQ play has been the TINA trade  There Is No Alternative  of some sort in 2023, but, Mrs Watanabe knows a thing or two about  carryShe also knows  thing or two about  YieldsAs you know from our regular musings,  Bondzilla  the fixed income allocator monster is  with the significant role played via carry trades through Mrs Watanabe, GPIF and Japanese lifers and other financial players.When it comes to Monetary regime change we read with interest Bloomberg article entitled As well from the same article we are reading that Goldman Sachs has been recommending funding purchases of Latin America currencies such as the Colombian pesos borrowing Yuan rather than Japanese yenThe yuan apparently is becoming an attractive funding currency thanks to its low inflation and low volatility, making it an attractive  Gambit  for global Macro players hence our monetary regime change reference.But we think there is more to it. If demography is destiny, then indeed Japan is turning more and more from the land of the rising sun towards  SunsetAlso in continuation from our last missive rebuking the Chinese  Doom and Gloom  narrative we would like to point out that China is turning towards internal consumption hence the push of Hospitality Accor Group on track to sign 125 hotels projects in China as Chinese consumers splash out on leisure and Hilton betting on China s middle class as it eyes about 730 hotels in the next 10 years. China continues to organize the  controlled demolition of financial instability from the likes of  Evergrande  and WMPs  Wealth Management Product .As well in our June conversation  Willful blindness  we indicated the followingHermès vs LVMH YTD below chartAs a reminder, the luxury sector represents more than a third of the weight of the CAC 40 French index  LVMH   L Oréal   Hermès   Kering . The weight of the luxury sector in the French sector has tripled since 2007.The CAC 40 is not a true reflection of the French economy as such given some sectors such as the luxury sector are over-represented. In the US, the Tech sector as well is over-represented in some indices.Another very important point we think when it comes to the  monetary regime change  is the growing premium of Chinese gold to international pricesWe also raised our concerns again in our last musing about the US fiscal trajectory.As commented by our friend Geoffrey, the  bond vigilantes  are in control of the long-end and do not care about  massaged  inflation numbers but care about the fiscal position of the United States. The US fiscal trajectory is unsustainable because of Quasi Fiscal Deficit in the US.  For more on QFD issues we highly recommend watching Geoffrey Fouvry quick take on Graph Financials,  and . US Treasuries seems to be more and more trading like Emerging Market bonds when it comes to  volatility .But there is according to him a more profound change  the biggest monetary change in the last 100 years. The end of FX used as reserves. This process started with the  recommendation from the Genoa Convention of the Leagues of Nation forcing countries to accept the US currency and the British currency as reserves. Before that only national currency claims and Gold would qualify as reserves. That started in 1922. This led to a double counting of reserves and a boom. This is where we got the idea of  currency as reserves , with a repeat in Bretton Woods I, also known as the Triffin Dilemma. Evidently double counting without flow of Gold but  in fine convertibility  is totally impossible. In the end, double counting is a turbo charger for booms, and the convertibility is like actioning the hand brake while driving at 200 mph, while gold flow without currency reserve double counting is like using a pedal brake early in the cycle without the risk of  overspeeding .A system of floating currencies without the parasitizing of FX in central banks is perfectly possible, it would be achievable with bilateral swaps with the balance settled in Gold, and it does not require currencies to be pegged to Gold. The UK was under such system during the 1797-1821 period and the US between 1861 to 1879. The currencies were floating with no foreign currency reserves parasitizing   forced into seigniorage collection, while trade was settled in Gold.He believes that is what China is doing now.WATCH the  in Augmented Media.As such the much vaunted  balanced  portfolio 60 40 is getting  unbalancedThere is also a monetary message coming from  soft commodities  with Cattle Futures closing at an all-time high again in conjunction with Orange Juice and Sugar and this is not only thanks to poor harvest.In our February conversation  we mentioned that back in 1933 a group of young investors in Boston started to worry about inflation and how it would affect bonds and stocks value and after two years of study they set up the first commodity investment trust in the world called Commodity Corp. in 1935.We also pointed out the work of Professor Edwin Walter Kemmerer he was a professor of economics at Princeton University. He became famous as a  money doctor  or economic adviser to foreign governments all around the world, promoting plans based on strong currencies and balanced budgets. He also helped in the design of the US Federal Reserve System in 1911If the only satisfactory hedge against inflation is commodities as thought by investors in 1933, we are not surprised to have seen such a rally in commodities overall and soft commodities in particularGeoffrey Fouvry also added a quote from Henry Thornton modern central banking according to the Fed. it is a mistake to seize assets during a conflictWATCH the  in Augmented MediaWhen it comes to  Gambits , it seems to us that Russia knows a thing or two when it comes to  chess games . As such, Russia has sacrificed its FX reserves with the aim of achieving a subsequent positional advantage thanks to its commodity trading position which has led to an acceleration in the monetary and geopolitical grand chessScarcity and commodities do not mix well when it comes to inflation expectations.

Energy Transfer Selling Off Is An Opportunity Yielding 9.66%,"Energy Transfer  is having a strong 2023 as units appreciated from  11.62 to a 52-week high of  13.67. Units of ET are retracing a bit after earnings, finishing the week down -4.06 . ET has now missed I am pro-renewable energy, and I am invested in several renewable energy companies because they are projected to increase their percentage in the global energy mix over the next several decades. Why I see the opportunity in renewables, I am a realist and understand that eradicating oil and gas isn't probable over the next 20-30 years. I continue to read many different energy industry publications to understand current trends and future predictions. I continue to allocate capital toward energy infrastructure companies due to the information I will share from these publicationsOver the past decade, there hasn't been a year where global oil production exceeded the amount consumed. In 2022 the global economy consumed 97,309,000 Bpd of crude while the production level was 93,848,000 Bpd. Natural gas has been produced at a slight surplus over the period compared to the deficit of oil produced. The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer, producing 18.93  of global oil production and 24.2  of global natural gas production. When Canada is accounted for, an additional 5.94  of oil production and 4.57  of natural gas production comes online. This is the main reason why I am consistently allocating capital to energy infrastructure companies. There is 24.87  of the global oil production and 28.77  of the global natural gas production occurring in North America, and it all needs to be treated and transported.The 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids and natural gas will increase through 2050 in the U.S. The U.S. will also remain a net exporter of petroleum and liquified natural gas  LNG  products. If the U.S., which is the largest oil and gas producing nation globally, is projected to increase production and be a net exporter through 2050, the logical conclusion is that more takeaway capacity will be needed, and energy infrastructure companies will generate larger levels of distributable cash flow  DCF  as more fuel passes through their systems.In  completed its acquisition of Lotus Midstream for a combination of  930 million in cash and 44.5 million of newly issued units. ET added 3,000 miles of active gathering lines and 2 million barrels of crude storage. ET is projecting that the integration of Lotus will generate significant synergies between the companies and immediately enhance their ability to generate free cash flow and distributable cash flow. I like the deal because it provides ET with a bi-directional connection from the Permian Basin to Cushing OK, and adds capacity to other major hubs, including Midland.ET finished Q2 generating  3.12 billion in Adjusted EBITDA and  2.04 billion of DCF on a consolidated basis.  1.54 billion of the total DCF is attributable to the partners of ET. ET saw its NGL fractionation volumes increase 5 , midstream gathering volumes increase 8 , NGL transportation volumes increase 13 , intrastate natural gas transportation volumes increase 3 , crude transportation increase by 23 . ET guided that in 2023 we will see between  13.1 billion and  13.4 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, which is the largest amount from all the MLPs.For the past several years, I have discussed ET's strength in the exporting sector and why it was a strategic move for the company. ET has export facilities on the East and Gulf coasts with a large pipeline system that spans over 120,000 miles. ET recently signed  to sell LNG from the proposed Lake Charles export facility in Louisiana. The first deal that was announced was with an unnamed Japanese consortium for the purchase of 1.6M tons year for a 20-year term. The 2 agreement acts as a middleman where Swiss commodities trader Gunvor would buy LNG from Chesapeake Energy  at a price indexed to the Japan-Korea Marker for 15 years. CHK would supply the Lake Charles facility with enough volumes of gas to produce 1M tons year for 15 years  after liquefaction. The 3 deal is with an unnamed U.S. customer and involves a tolling arrangement for 1M tons year for 15 years.The Lake Charles facility has come under question, and on the conference call, ET discussed this project at length. In May of 2022, ET received an extension from FERC on the deadline for the completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. The DOE denied ET's request for an extension for the commencement of exports and in April, denied ET's appeal placing this project in Limbo. We have now been informed that ET has been in discussions with the DOE and is filing a new application for export authorization. ET expects to file in August and, during the DOE's review, work with existing customers, prospective equity investors, and other stakeholders to progress the development of the Lake Charles export facility. Ultimately I believe that ET will be granted the authorization because commodities are too important to the U.S. in global trade, and there will be a continuous need for U.S. energy on the global stage.The Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from increased demand both in the U.S. and international markets. ET has made a final investment decision on an expansion to its NGL export capacity at the Nederland facility to address increased demand. They expect the expansion to cost  1.25 billion and add roughly 250,000 bpd of export capacity. ET also is pursuing a project at the Marcus Hook facility that would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity.I am bullish on ET's future because as the demand for energy increases, so will the need for ET's services throughout the value chain. ET generates incremental profits throughout every segment in transporting crude, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Exporting could be a critical differentiator between ET and the rest of the sector in the future and allow ET to grow even quicker. If ET gains the approvals from the DOE it will expand their exporting capability and should drive higher volumes through their infrastructure due to contracted exports.ET goes  on 8 11, and the current distribution is larger than before the cut. In the November 2020 distribution, ET made a -50  reduction from  .305 to  0.1525. Since the February 2022 distribution, ET has provided unitholders with 7 consecutive quarterly distribution increases, bringing the annualized distribution to  1.24. On the conference call, management indicated that they will continue to target a 3  to 5  annual distribution growth rate.If ET grows the distribution at a 4  rate which is the midpoint of their guidance, the annualized distribution could grow by 17  by the 2027 distribution. Management reduced its leverage, acquired 2 companies, and provided 7 distribution increases, bringing the distribution above its prior levels before the cuts in less than 3 years. ET is getting back to its roots and could become a distribution growth machine. I think between the new acquisitions and the potential export expansion, ET has the ability to provide larger increases to the distribution in the future and this is becoming an enticing yield story all over again.I updated all of the numbers for the MLPs I compare ET against, and they still look undervalued. I used the following MLPs in my peer groupET trades at the lowest Adjusted EBITDA to market cap ratio in its peer group at 3.02x. The peer group average is 5.39, and units of ET still look to be on sale compared to this metric.ET's EV to Adjusted EBITDA is 7.89 compared to a 9.31 peer group average. PAA trades at a similar valuation then the rest of the group trade between 9.36x and 11.79x.When looking at the DCF that these companies generate compared to their market caps, ET trades at 4.66x compared to a 7.02x average.ET has the largest amount of debt, but they also produce the largest amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF. ET has a 3.74x total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which isn't that high even though it's the largest in the peer group.ET is also the largest-yielding MLP in the peer group, with a 9.73  yield compared to the peer group average of 7.98 .I still feel that ET is undervalued, considering you are paying 3.02x its market cap for ET's Adjusted EBITDA and 4.66x for its DCF. Today you would be getting the largest yielder out of the growth with a commitment to 3-5  in annual distribution growth at the lowest valuation. Oil and gas aren't going away, and with the global demand set to increase along with production in the U.S., ET's services will continue to see increased demand. If units continue to retrace in the coming weeks, I think the opportunity will just get stronger. I think ET deserves a stronger valuation, and eventually, the market will come around.

Crestwood Equity To Become Part Of Energy Transfer Empire,"I ve written positively on Crestwood Equity  and its preferred shares  a few times. Today, the company announced that it would be acquired by Energy Transfer . The stock has returned about 9 , including distributions, sinceCEQP  that it would be acquired by ET at an enterprise value of  7.1 billion. The deal will be an all-equity deal with an exchange ratio of 2.07x. ET will issue about 219 million units to fund the  2.7 billion equity portion of the deal. It will also take on about  2.85 billion in long-term CEQP bonds. The deal comes with no premium.The deal is expected to close in Q4 of this year. The deal will need approval from CEQP unitholders, as well as regulatoryET is expecting to see  40 million a year in cost synergies, with half realized in 2024 and the rest in 2025. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to CEQP unitholders, and ET is projecting to grow its distribution by 3-5  a year over the next 3 years. CEQP also noted in that there could be an opportunity to refinance its preferred units over the next two years. This is something preferred holders likely won't like to hear.CEQP also noted that ET has a much lower cost of capital, which will benefit unitholders as the company has  1.1 billion of senior notes it needs to refinance over the next 5 years.Commenting on the transaction on a call to discuss the deal, CFO Robert Halpin saidIn a presentation, CEQP said that the deal will extent ET s position in the Williston  Bakken  and Delaware, and that its substantial processing capacity in those basins complement ET s downstream fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and hydrocarbon export capability from its Nederland terminal in Texas and its Marcus Hook complex in Philadelphia. The G P also noted that ET will be able to execute more growth projects around its assets given its balance sheet, as well as pursue more private bolt-on deals around CEQP s assets.The combined company with have a pro forma enterprise value of around  108 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of around  14 billion. That puts a 7.7x multiple on the combined company. That compares to a 9.1x multiple for fellow integrated midstream operator Enterprise Products Partners , 9.5x for natural gas pipeline giant Williams , and 10.5x for integrated Canadian midstream operator Enbridge .Asked why now was the right time to be bought out after years of transforming the company, Halpin saidIf anyone is aware of my background, they may know that CEQP was the top position and one of the biggest contributors to the fund I previously worked for back several years ago. At the time, CEQP was a beaten down stock trading in the single digits that no one would touch will a 10-foot pole, but we heralded the name with our  presentation and formed a constructive conversation with management. Through a series of transactions, the company was able to transform itself into what it is now today. The CEQP management team deserves a lot of credit for what they were able to accomplish over the last seven years. Congratulations to them.Today, I still own a lot of CEQP in my personal account, with a cost basis that is  0. My other largest midstream holding just happens to be ET, which we also owned at the fund after CEQP. While receiving no premium is a disappointment, given the discounted value of ET and the fact that I believe it has the best midstream assets in the midstream space, I still like this deal for CEQP. Essentially CEQP unitholders are upgrading the stock without any tax consequences.I like to view ET as the largest energy arbitrageur in the U.S., and a company that is integral in the midstream space. In my view, it has the premier assets in the midstream sector and a lot of growth opportunities ahead of it. The stock has traded at a discount to peers as former CEO and current Chairman Kelcy Warren hasn't always been on the side of LP holders, but past conflicts of interest are now well behind the stock and interests are aligned. When this valuation gap eventually closes, ET s stock has a lot of upside.Overall, I think this is a pretty good exit for long-term CEQP unitholders. I would vote  yes  for the deal.

"TORM plc: Record Earnings, 15%-21% Yield, Very Undervalued","With energy prices continuing to rise, and major displacement causing much longer ton miles, shipping vessel rates have remained far above 2021 rates, which has benefited fleets which focus on the spot market. One such vessel company is TORM plc TORM is present in all large vessel classes in the product tanker market, with specific focus on the LR2- Long Range 2, LR1 - Long Range 1, and MR - Medium Range vessel classes as these three segments offer the greatest synergies.This rise in spot rates has enabled TRMD to begin paying very generous dividends.During January 2023, TORM acquired seven 2011-2013 built LR1 vessels. In March 2023 additionally three MR vessels were acquired in a partly cash-based and partly share based transaction.TRMD shares are listed on the Nasdaq in New York and Copenhagen. Oaktree owns 65  of the shares, vs. 20  for retail shareholdersProduct tanker fleet utilization has reached a level where small changes in utilization lead to large changes in freight rates.There has been strong growth in Europe's middle distillate imports from the Middle East Asia US as a result of the EU sanctions against Russia which came into effect in February 2023. Changes in refinery landscape with closures in importing regions  e.g. Australia, New Zealand  and capacity additions in exporting regions  Middle East, China , also have supported higher rates.In addition, world fleet growth remains low, with a low volume order book with the earliest delivery date at renowned yards in 2026, which means that fleet growth in 2023-2025 remains limited. leading to higher utilization.2022  This was a record year for TRMD, with three-digit topline growth and four-digit earnings and cash flow growth, as rates soared above those of 2021, rising  3X vs. 2021.Q2 '23  Management reported  the strongest second quarter in our history, a quarter that continues the performance from the first quarter of this year. We realized a TCE of  308 million in the second quarter and an EBITDA result of  237 million. Adjusted for unrealized gains on FFA contracts of  37 million, our EBITDA result increased 23  to  199 million while profit before tax increased 72  to  184 million compared to the same period last year.  Q1-2 '23  TRMD continued its major growth, with revenue up 41 , and 3-digit gains in net income, EPS, operating cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA.Looking forward, management sees Q3 '23 TCE rates down  20 , to  30.5K day, vs.  436K day in Q2 '23. Also, 74  of the fleet is covered at that rate. However, looking forward to Q4 '23 and 2024, TCE rates are expected to strengthen to  41K day, which bodes well for continued high dividend payments over the near term.At its 10 20 23 closing price of  28.71, TRMD has a forward dividend yield of nearly 21 , based upon its most recent quarterly payout of  1.50 share in August.At 20  lower TCE rates in Q3 '23, the dividend may decrease to  1.20 share, which is still a nearly 17  yield. If they drop by 30 , there may be a  1.05 share dividend, which would equal a nearly 15  yield. Countering the lower TCE rates are TRMD's higher fleet days due to its vessels acquired in 2023.TRMD should declare the next quarterly dividend on  11 10 23, with an  11 22 23 ex-dividend date, and a  12 8 23 pay date.TRMD's current dividend run began in Q1 '22, at  .58, and going as high as  2.59 for Q4 '22, and to  1.50 for Q2 '23. Dividend coverage was a healthy 1.43X, and has averaged 1.33X over the past four quarters.That EPS figure even includes non-cash depreciation and amortization, of which there was  .83 share in Q1-2 '23, which is quite a cushion.TORM is based in the UK, which has a reciprocal tax treaty with the US.Not surprisingly, TRMD's gross profit, margins, ROE, ROC, and ROA are all impressively much higher than marine shipping averages. It has earned high ratings for these metrics, ranging from B  to A , from Seeking Alpha's sector relative grading system.TRMD's Interest coverage factor is very strong, at 14.98X, and gets a solid grade of B from SA's dividend safety grading system. In addition, it has much lower debt leverage than its sector, with net long-term debt EBITDA leverage of just 59.18 , which is 32  lower than its sector's 87.31  average leverageIn Q2, TORM completed the refinancing of bank and leasing agreements for USD  480M and further secured a USD  73M facility that can be used for additional secondhand vessel financing.Since the announcement in March 2023, TORM has utilized USD  50M of the USD  123M that was originally committed for secondhand financing. As a result of the transaction, TRMD has outperformed its industry and the S P 500 by a wide margin over the past quarter and year. While it has lagged price wise so far in 2023, its total return is  9.15 , while its one-year total return is more than 48 , due to its very high dividends and price gains, vs 17.08  for the S P 500.TRMD's total return so far in 2023 is 26.86 , vs. 11.83  for the S P 500At its 10 20 23 closing price of  28.71, TRMD, is 14.5  below analysts' lowest price target of  33.60, and . Its trailing P E, both GAAP and non-GAAP, are over 60  cheaper than the sector median valuations, as is its Forward non-GAAP P E.Its trailing EV EBITDA is also 39  lower, while its forward EV EBITDA is 31.7  lower, with both metrics getting B  ratings from the Seeking Alpha grading system. TRMD's Price Book of 1.53X is  10  cheaper than the 1.69X sector median.There appear to be varying valuations of TRMD's equity - TRMD's balance sheet shows it as  1,562M, a book value share of  18.04, which results in a P book of 1.55X.However, TRMD's vessels are also rated valued by brokers each quarter, according to their age, condition, and earnings. Much higher rates have caused these vessel valuations to jump by  43  in Q2 '23 vs. Q2 '22, which has led to TRMD's net asset value share jumping from  18.50 to  29.80.The shipping industry is traditionally volatile due to changing economic conditions, which can affect shipping rates. Since TRMD concentrates on spot rates, a prolonged economic downturn would most likely affect the level of its dividends. Countering this would be the ageing of the world tanker fleet, leading to more scrapping of vessels, and long delivery times for new vessels.At  28.71, TRMD presents a compelling value - its trailing and forward P E valuations are much lower than its industry's averages, and its dividend yield dwarfs that of its industry. Given the opportunity for continued attractive dividends in 2023 - 2024, we rate TRMD a buy up to  32.You can see more detail on TRMD's operations in its , and its This article was submitted as part of , which runs through October 25.

$100 Oil Is Only The Beginning,"Saudi Arabia is OPEC's de facto leader,  established to exert maximum market influence. The Kingdom primarily does what it likes, and the subservient OPEC members eventually follow. For instance, the Kingdom recently announced that it would cut oil output by  and warned that the supply cuts could deepen.Saudi Arabia's supply cuts are part of a long-term effort to elevate oil prices in partnership with Russia. While Saudi Arabia cuts by 1M barrels daily, Russia will continue its 300,000 daily production cut. Russia is the third most significant oil producer globally, responsible for roughly 12  of global oil output in 2022. Additionally, Russia is the undisputed leader in the CIS  former soviet republics  block, which accounted for roughly 15  of global oil production in 2022.Additionally, Russia faces difficulties due to its ongoing conflict in Ukraine and increased isolationism and alienation from the West. Therefore, these oil exporting juggernauts must maintain a relatively high oil price and should continue implementing strategies to keep oil prices heading toward  100 and possibly higher beyond that.Furthermore, there are continuous threats to production disruptions in the Middle East. Iraq is the third most significant oil exporter globally and is a perpetual hotbed for unrest and instability. Additionally, Iran remains a substantial producer and exporter and may face additional sanctions due to its destabilizing policies and direct indirect involvement in various conflicts in the Middle East.The Middle East has the most dominant market position in proven oil reserves. Moreover, we see Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, and other OPEC nations sitting on oceans of black gold. Russia has a significant 6.2  portion, which could increase due to its enormous untapped and underexplored landmass. The U.S. only has 4  of the proven global reserves, limiting its influence in the oil industry.Europe, the U.S., and the West have minimal oil reserves and are primarily net oil importers. Therefore, much of the pricing power is with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and OPEC , as these nations produce far more oil than they use. They can keep oil prices low for their domestic markets while constricting supply to increase prices for the export market, primarily to the U.S., Europe, and other Western markets. Due to the OPEC  agreements, their oil production is expected to fall by an average of  this year.Despite America being a net oil importer and not having the most outstanding reserves or the best relations with the top oil exporters, the U.S. has the best oil companies in the world. U.S.-based high-quality oil companies have some of the most extensive expertise, professionalism, and advanced technologies required to locate, extract, refine, ship, and sell oil globally. Therefore, the U.S. oil companies make the global oil world spin, and they should benefit from the higher oil prices as we move forward.Some of my top picks in the oil and energy space include Take advantage of the  and receive this limited-time  with your subscription.  and start beating the market for Victor Dergunov is an independent investor and author with 20 years experience.

"Delek Logistics: Great Distribution Growth, But There Are Better Options","Delek Logistics  has a strong track record of raising its distribution quarter over quarter, but there are better midstream options out there.DKL is an integrated midstream company that primarily operates in the PermianThe company operates in four segments. Its Gathering   Processing segment is its largest and consists of crude gathering systems in the Midland and Delaware basins, as well as over 800 miles of crude and product transportation pipelines. Its Marketing   Terminalling segment, meanwhile, has 10 light product terminals as well as a wholesale and marketing business in Texas, while its Storage and Transportation segment encompasses storage facilities with 10 million barrels of capacity and rail offloading facilities. Finally, the company has threeOne of DKL s biggest opportunities is growth around the Delaware Permian, the most prolific oil basin the U.S. The company has been working to diversify away from its parent company, and on that end it has done a good job. Its Gathering and Processing revenue has gone from 30  being from third parties in Q2 of 2022 to 47  in Q2 of 2023.Its Midland Gathering System has been seeing very strong growth, and then it supplemented that through the purchase of the midstream assets of 3Bear Energy in the Northern Delaware Basin. The assets obtained in the deal included 485 miles of pipelines, 88 million cubic feet per day of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity, 120 MBbl of crude storage capacity, and 200 MBbl d of water disposal capacity. It also came with  350,000 acreage dedication and long-term fixed fee contracts. DLK laid out  624.7 million in cash in the deal, paying an expected 6.25x multiple based on 2023 EBITDA estimates at the time.Volumes on its Midland Gathering System, meanwhile, more than doubled year over year in Q2, while its Delaware Gathering System, formerly the 3Bear assets, were expected to exceed a  100 million EBITDA run rate in Q4.Discussing its Delaware Permian assets , CEO Avigal Soreq saidDKL has been pretty aggressive in raising its distribution, increasing it sequentially for 42 straight quarters.Nearly 80  of its gross margins are underpinned by MVCs, so it has a pretty clear visibility. However, 55  of that are contracts that will expire within the next year, so that is a risk moving forward.In addition, the company carries a pretty high amount of leverage at nearly 4.7x. Most midstream companies have settled into leverage of between 3-4x, so DKL s leverage is higher than most peers. About 46  of its debt is variable, which is a risk in a rising rate environment, and it has nearly  550 million in debt that needs to be refinanced in 2024 and 2025, which likely will be at higher rates.The majority of its margins also stem from systems that support the Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring refineries located in Arkansas and Texas. To the extent that there is less refined product demand in the future that impacts these refineries, it would impact DKL.And while DKL is primarily fee based, it does have some wholesale fuel sales that it makes to third parties. These margins on these sales can move up or down, impacting the company s results.Looking at valuation, DKL trades at 8.9x the 2023 EBITDA consensus of  382.0 million. For 2024, it trades at 8.3x the 2024 EBITDA consensus of  409.3 million.The stock has a yield of about 9.6 . It has a coverage ratio of about 1.34x as of last quarter.The stock trades in the middle range of valuation compared to its crude-focused midstream peers.While the company carries a nice 1.34 coverage ratio based on its distributable cash flow, after paying distributions and growth capex, it s seeing cash outflows. Most midstream companies are now more conscious of this and try to have excess cash after capex and distribution. Through the first six months of the year, FCF after distributions is around - 81 million, and after making some adjustments it would still be around - 22 million.Given this dynamic, it will be difficult for DLK to lower its already higher leverage. Higher rates on its variable debt are also not helping, with its interest expense nearly doubling year over year. Taken altogether, I don't think the stock should trade at a valuation similar to peers with better balance sheets and FCF metrics.While investors will be undoubtedly be intrigued by the consistent distribution growth from DKL and the nice growth out of the Permian, I think there are better options in the midstream space. There are also a couple things that I don t love about the stock. One is that the company carries higher leverage than most its peers. Most midstream companies have fixed their balance sheets over the last several years, and most now carry under 4x leverage. So on that end, DLK is not as attractive. I also don't like how the company is not FCF positive after distributions. Combined, that's not a good combination in my book.Given DLK s characteristics compared to other midstream companies at a similar or higher valuation, I m largely neutral on the name. For more crude-oriented names, I prefer Plains All American , which I last .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Hub Group: Steamrolled By An Intermodal Market With Little Demand And High Truckload Capacity,"I thought that 2023 was going to be a rough year for transportation providers given high inventories and excess capacity exiting 2022, but this year has developed even worse than I expected, as demand has continued to underwhelm and marginalDown close to 30  since , Hub Group has underperformed the broader transportation sector, as well as more specific comps like  ,  ,  , and . Valuation is  undemanding  now, but the business is likely looking at two more quarters of double-digit year-over-year revenueIf you can be patient, I still think this is a good business in a growing market, but the last few years have really brought home just how difficult estimating the top, bottom, and duration of cycles can be for this business and this sector.The quick takeaway from Hub Group s third quarter results is that while revenue performance wasn t quite as bad relative to expectations as the second quarter, the unexpected margin strength that helped in the second quarter was absent this time around as operational scale issues and the absence of higher-margin revenues from the prior year hit profitability.Revenue fell 24  this quarter, down modestly from the prior quarter  a little more than 1  and down about 27  from the peak of the cycle. The revenue contraction was driven by the intermodal business, where weak pricing  revenue load down 20  and weak volumes combined to drive revenue down more than 30 . The logistics business fared better, down 12 , likewise saw significant price pressure on weak freight demand and excess capacity in the market.Gross margin  revenue net of purchased transportation  was up slightly from the prior year  up 10bp to 24.6 , and one of the limited positives to be taken from this year is that management has done a good job of managing controllable costs, including a 27  decline in cost per drayage. Operating income fell 64 , with margin roughly cut in half from 8.7  to 4.2 , and missed expectations by about 20   or  0.25 share . Intermodal profits fell 84   margin down almost eight points to 2.3 , while logistics profits fell 6 , with margin actually up 40bp to 6.3 .Echoing the comments of others in the trucking, intermodal, and logistics space, Hub Group management said they ve seen only a  muted  peak season, as retailers have been cautious about ordering and building inventories ahead of the holiday season. I believe this is due to both higher than desired ongoing levels of inventory as well as weakening consumer spending trends that suggest a lackluster holiday shopping season.Management expects intermodal volumes in the fourth quarter to fall at a rate slightly better than what has been seen recently   low-to-mid-teens   but that s not exactly good news. Adding to that, the company has been more aggressive on price recently after acknowledging that they have perhaps tried to hold the line there for too long.The market right now is basically seeing a perfect storm of sluggish demand and surplus supply. Trade with China has softened noticeably, leading to high single-digit declines in intermodal volumes from Western ports to various regions of the U.S.. At the same time, weak truckload freight rates are keeping more volumes on the road as operators try to maintain volumes.This has driven that sharp 16  year-over-year decline in Hub s intermodal volumes, with Transcon down 9 , Local West down 18 , and Local East down 14 . While J.B. Hunt s intermodal business has held up a little better on similar volumes  revenue down 1  on a 16  volume decline , Hub s pricing approach is more boom bust than J.B. Hunt s.If nothing else, the last few quarters from Hub Group  and J.B. Hunt  have highlighted that the intermodal business model very much works better in an environment of higher rising truckload rates. I don t expect to see that environment for a little while longer, as capacity has only started to leave the market and there s still just too much capacity chasing too few shipments.Looking at the longer-term picture, though, I still see a strong future for intermodal. Management believes there are still 56M over-the-road loads that can be moved by rail, and cross-border business  U.S.-Mexico  is likely to see significant volume growth over the next five years and beyond as more companies push on with near-shoring to Mexico.In the meantime, management remains focused on growing the intermodal business, and is still looking for scale-building M A opportunities, as well as continuing to invest in the tech infrastructure at Hub. Not all of the cash is going back into the business, though, as management has initiated a  0.50 share dividend and a new  250M buyback.That dividend is admittedly not large  it s less than a 1  yield today , but between the dividend and the buyback I don t think management would be looking to voluntarily increase cash flows out of the business if they weren t reasonably confident that the cycle is bottoming out.I don t dismiss the risk that Hub could see two years of back-to-back year-over-year revenue declines, but that is not my base-case assumption today. I am looking for below-Street revenue next year  4.2B versus  4.4B , but I do expect a meaningful rebound in FY 25 26 and long-term adjusted revenue growth of around 4   consistent with my prior long-term outlook .Weak revenue will keep pressure on margins, and I m looking for an EBITDA margin close to 8  next year before a rebound above 9  in FY 25. Along those lines, I also expect a below-average free cash flow year for FY 24 followed by better results in the subsequent years. I m still assuming that Hub Group doesn t get its FCF margins much above 4  over the long term, but that still supports an adjusted long-term FCF growth rate around 5 , and these growth numbers could be augmented by accretive M A.Discounted cash flow and a modified EV EBITDA approach get me to roughly similar end results   fair values in the  80 s. Discounted cash flow suggests a fair value above  85 and a double-digit long-term annualized potential return. With EV EBITDA, a 6.75x multiple on my FY 25 number discounted back a year gets me to a little more than  83  that same multiple on my FY 24 EBITDA estimate gets me to about  73, but I d argue that s not really a number that reflects the longer-term run-rate performance.If cyclical businesses teach you nothing else, they teach you that conditions can always get worse   but eventually they do also get better. This has been a tougher year than I expected at the start of 2023, but I see nothing to suggest that Hub Group s long-term competitiveness has been compromised, nor that the long-term outlook for intermodal freight and logistics services like truck brokerage, managed transportation, and freight consolidation isn t still positive and strong enough to support the growth I expect from Hub.The one question that s still tough to answer is whether this is the time to step up and buy shares. I think the business  and market  is bottoming out, but the economy could still slow further than I expect and drive yet another step down to a new low. I do think predicting the exact bottom is really just guesswork, though, and I think the longer-term upside justifies a more contrarian  positive  stance today.

"Custom Truck: ESG Efforts, Capacity Expansion, And Cheap","Custom Truck One Source, Inc.  delivered double digit net sales growth for Q2 2023, and announced the purchase of new fleets, which may enhance future capacity. Also, with new ESG efforts and after declaring massive market opportunity from T D end-market, CTOSCustom Truck One Source is a company that offers, through its subsidiaries, sales and rental services of specialty equipment, parts for end markets, and related services such as the repair and maintenance of equipment with customized applications.Custom Truck's primary customers are in the power transmission and distribution, telecommunications, waste management, and infrastructure solutions markets within the United States. The products are available to independentCustom Truck designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells its equipment, among which we find trucks with baskets for the transportation of light cargo, drilling and excavation rigs, garbage trucks, cranes, and service trucks among others.The company's operations are divided into three reportable segments  equipment rental solutions, sale of trucks and equipment, and services and parts for end markets. The current expansion allows the company to offer its services in 35 cities in Canada and the United States. The company also provides technical advisory service 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Due to this position, experience, and recognition, Custom Truck is one of the reference companies at the local level when it comes to the rental of services for the installation and transmission of electrical networks industry.The business model of offering its own fleet for the operation of other businesses, with an integrated network for the immediate contracting of services in the areas where it is present, allows the company to access a series of clients from various industries, and the projections of the company are made based on the forecast on the activity of these markets. In terms of results, if we base ourselves on the statistics obtained for the year 2022, the sale of equipment is the segment that represents the highest income for the company.I believe that further expansion of its position in the markets in which it participates, taking advantage of its wide range of channels, and deepening the relationship with existing customers will most likely bring net sales growth.The  that the company can capture by combining the operations of its three segments is valued at many billion dollars.Besides, the competitive advantages regarding its flexible business model and territorial expansion will most likely play a role when trying to capture more market share. With regards to the total market opportunity, investors may want to have a look at the following lines from the annual report.Custom Truck expects to allocate a series of investments to the purchase of new fleets in order to meet the growing demand coming from the different markets in which its clients participate. Along with these points in its growth strategy, we have added the search to achieve the positioning of its products in new end markets as well as geographical expansion through the acquisition of businesses and infrastructure networks that include distribution centers and customer service centers. In my view, these initiatives will most likely bring business expansion.The company , including initiatives and priorities encompassing environmental compliances, sustainable operations, business ethics, and corporate governance. Given the number of  recently created, I believe that many new investors will most likely have a look at Custom Truck, which may enhance net sales growth.The company reported an asset liability ratio larger than two along with a healthy current ratio, which basically means that the balance sheet appears quite clean. With that, it would be a good idea for investors to have a look carefully at the total amount of debt, which is not a small amount.More in particular, as of June 30, 2023, the company reported cash and cash equivalents worth  42 million, accounts receivable of about  151 million, financing receivables of close to  41 million, and inventory worth  765 million.Goodwill is also quite large, equal to  704 million, with intangible assets close to  291 million, and total assets worth  3.138 million. I believe that the accumulation of goodwill comes from the transaction reported between Custom Truck One Source, L.P, and Nesco Holdings. Given the expertise in the M A markets, I would be Among the list of liabilities, the most remarkable are accounts payable worth  117 million, accrued expenses close to  67 million, current maturities of long-term debt of  3 million, and total current liabilities of about  729 million.Besides, with long-term debt of about  1.425 billion, finance leases of close to  3 million, and derivative, warrants, and other liabilities of about  1 million, Custom Truck reports total long-term liabilities of about  1.489 billion.Given the total amount of debt, I studied a bit the credit facilities signed and their interest rates. In the last quarterly report, the company reported interest rates close to 5.8  and 7.3  with notes payable reporting 3.1 -5 . I believe that these figures are very relevant to assess the cost of capital in any discounted cash flow model. I did use them in my valuation assessment.My financial valuation includes net income close to  153 million, depreciation and amortization worth  706 million, but no amortization of debt issuance costs, no loss on extinguishment of debt, and no gain on sales and disposals of rental equipment. I tried to avoid extraordinary events in future cash flow statements.I also included provision for losses on accounts receivable worth  44 million, share-based compensation of about  39 million, changes in accounts and financing receivables of about - 18 million, and changes in inventories of - 190 million.Additionally, I included prepaids, operating leases of about - 52 million, changes in accounts payable of - 53 million, and customer deposits and deferred revenue worth - 28 million. I obtained net cash flow from operating activities of close to  658 million. Finally, taking into account purchases of rental equipment worth - 311 million, 2030 FCF would be close to  347 million.My figures are pretty much in line with the expectations of other analysts and the 2023 outlook, so I believe that it is worth having a look at them. Analysts are expecting 2025 net sales close to  1993 million, 2025 EBITDA of about  489 million, 2025 net income of  108 million, and The updated 2023 outlook includes Adjusted EBITDA growth close to 8 -13  and consolidated revenue between 10  and 16 . I believe that the figures are quite beneficial.With the previous FCFs obtained, a WACC between 5 -9 , and EV FCF close to 11x-15x, I obtained a stock valuation between  5 per share and  13 per share. Note that my WACC is in line with the cost of debt reported by Custom Truck. Besides, my EV FCF multiple is close to the median reported in the sector.My results also included a minimum internal rate of return of close to -1 , maximum IRR of 16 , and a median IRR of close to 7 . In any case, I believe that Custom Truck One does appear undervalued at the current price mark.The industry is highly fragmented, and offers varied competition between national distribution networks, and another series of companies that have regional reach. In this sense, the company enjoys competitive advantages, as it is one of the traditional leaders in its market, and it served, during 2022, more than 3,000 clients throughout the country, of which the 15 largest concentrated 25  of the company's operations.The company's current risks are mainly due to the inflationary situation of the global economy, which forces it to establish higher prices for the service since raw materials and supply networks for the manufacturing of equipment have increased. Furthermore, any decline in activity in the industries serves indirectly a significant reduction in the company's operating margins. Within these factors, we must also add the volatility of the price of oil, which directly affects the company and its supply chain.In the financial sense, it is good to highlight that the company declares a high debt situation from which it will have to cancel obligations in the short term, which could complicate future access to lines of credit or forms of financing. Furthermore, taking into account that the projection of sales is high at this time does not ensure the success of operations in the future.Custom Truck One Source does not only expect double digit net sales growth in 2023, the company also noted the purchase of new fleets, which may enhance capacity. Taking into account the massive market opportunity reported, benefits from public investments in infrastructure, and recently designed ESG reports, Custom Truck may be in the radar of many investors out there. I do see risks from failed acquisition integration or debt risks, however I think that the company appears quite undervalued.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

United Airlines Is The Industry's Most Vulnerable Player (Rating Downgrade),"As the summer 2023 travel season winds down and a growing number of investors ask if the rapid recovery of the airline industry post covid has slowed, thereAlthough all U.S. airlines compete in the domestic and most in the near-international market to Latin America and the Caribbean, the long-haul international market is carriedConversely, of the big four U.S. carriers, which includes Southwest  but not Hawaiian, United is the smallest in the domestic marketplace. Thus, United always provides an interesting study in airline strategy and market dynamics, and that is true as summer storms give way to a chill in the air in many parts of North America. Several key changes indicates that trouble could be looming that could threaten United's strong position since COVID recovery began.United stock has been one of the strongest airline stocks driven by its ability to capture revenue, especially in the long-haul international market. Low fuel prices have been a boon to airline recovery while the international marketplace has consolidated heavily in favor of incumbent legacy airlines and away from the burgeoning low-cost carrier segment, especially across the Atlantic. United, along with multiple other U.S. airlines, offered investor updates over the last month and all of them included higher costs and or weaker revenue. United's update follows along with as a discussion of other issues that the industry is facing, whether United cited them or not, as well as an examination of United's strategies and how they might be impacted. Increased crude oil prices are a threat to many components of Western economies, and transportation companies are particularly at the pointed end of the spear. Airline stocks usually move inversely to crude oil prices. Crude oil prices are flirting with their one-year highs in the low  90s after hovering in the low  70s for the early part of the summer.Crude oil prices are not a direct correlation to the jet fuel cost for airlines which must incorporate the cost to refine crude oil into jet fuel. Jet fuel competes in the refining process with, or is similar to, diesel and home heating oil and, for many refiners, jet fuel is not the primary product of the refining process. Historically, the jet fuel crack spread, the additional price that refiners essentially charge to convert crude oil into jet fuel, has been in the low teens of dollars per barrel.During the pandemic, especially as total refinery volumes declined, jet fuel crack spreads vacillated wildly even as demand for diesel fuel remained strong. As the U.S. and Western Europe adapt to more efficient transportation sources including electric vehicles, demand for gasoline has weakened, but fuel for heavy transportation such as diesel and jet fuel have remained strong since there are limited alternatives for those fuels - with the exception of relatively small amounts of sustainable aviation fuels -SAF. In addition, autumn often coincides with refinery maintenance. This fall, several large refineries will be offline for scheduled overhauls including Delta's Trainer refinery which is tuned to maximize jet fuel output, most of which is destined for the airline's operations in the Northeast U.S. although some distillates are sold on the spot market  Trainer expects to be able to provide contracted jet fuel volumes during the shutdown but will not be able to supply the spot market.Delta and United are the largest commercial users of jet fuel in the Northeast U.S., both of which have large hubs in the New York City area, while United also has a hub at Washington Dulles airport and Delta has a hub at Boston. Jet fuel prices in the Northeast are typically at a premium to the U.S. due to the relatively few number of refineries that remain in the region.Currently, jet fuel crack spreads are near  40 bbl and could move higher. Even when crude oil touched its one-year highs in March 2023, jet fuel crack spreads were around  30 bbl, indicating that there is the possibility that jet fuel prices could move even higher than they did during the pandemic recovery. In the third quarter of 2022, United paid  3.81 gal for jet fuel. United has long paid the most per gallon of the big four U.S. airlines, a reflection of the size of its operations in the Northeast U.S. and its lack of fuel hedging or cost reduction efforts such as Delta's refinery. By the fourth quarter of 2022, UAL's fuel price had eased to  3.54 gallon. If fuel prices increase even as demand decreases, UAL's profits could tumble.In addition to higher fuel costs on the horizon, United also faces higher labor costs. United pilots are currently deciding whether to accept the contract proposal endorsed by their union leadership that would increase pay and benefits by  10 billion over the four year contract including retroactive pay that covers the pandemic period. UAL has taken the appropriate accounting adjustments for its increased pilot expenses but pilot wages will be much higher now than when fuel spiked last summer. In addition, United has not reached an agreement with its flight attendants on a new post-pandemic contract. Delta is the only one of the big 4 airlines that has hiked the pay of its flight attendants including adding pay during the boarding process for the first time  most U.S. airlines have not paid cockpit or cabin crew members during boarding or flight preparation but rather only when the aircraft door was closed.Delta changed the paradigm, which will particularly benefit junior flight attendants who often work shorter flights and spend more of their workday on the ground rather than in the air. American has made an offer to its flight attendant union that essentially matches Delta's pay rates and major proposals including boarding pay and Delta's higher profit-sharing formulae but the AAL flight attendants have not adopted the company proposal. Each of AAL, DAL and UAL employ more than 20,000 flight attendants which could add another billion dollars per year to each of the big 4's labor costs. Southwest has not lifted the pay of either its pilots or flight attendants.While cost increases are troublesome, the potential for a weakening revenue environment creates concern for some airline investors. United has both reasons for optimism but also concern.Like American and Delta, United caters to premium passengers that pay for a higher caliber of service than the low cost carriers provide. UAL's revenue guidance reflected much less concern about a weaker revenue environment than low cost carriers including LUV expect for the third quarter. Nonetheless, inflation, rising interest rates, the restarting of student loan payments, and greater labor unrest outside of the industry including the UAW strike which have ripple effects throughout the U.S. economy are bound to impact the big 3 global carriers  while they cater to passengers that pay more, those airlines fill many seats with leisure passengers that could potentially have much less to spend, including leisure travel by their business customers. Domestically, the big 3 are less vulnerable to a degradation of the fare environment than low cost carriers.However, United does have a high degree of vulnerability to a decrease in the international revenue environment. United's post-pandemic strength came from the international marketplace where it was first able to capture postponed transatlantic trips amid a reduced presence of transatlantic low fare carriers. European demand this past summer has been described by many carriers as particularly strong with reports of high costs in Europe despite the relatively strong U.S. dollar which will mute demand from Europe to the U.S. during the winter. While several carriers including United report that the normal summer travel period is stretching later into the fall and beginning earlier in the spring, there is a growing expectation that travel demand will return to normal levels. The need to increase international air fares in the off-peak periods could lead to reduced levels of surplus demand outside of the traditional peak periods.United faces several competitive and regional challenges across its international network. United has been the largest carrier across the Pacific, regardless of nationality, for a number of years. The Asian market was much slower to reopen than Europe and many major markets such as Japan only began to see the normalization of demand levels this past summer. The Japanese Yen is considerably weaker now than it was pre-covid, limiting the ability of Japanese tourists to travel to the U.S.  there is more transpacific capacity between Japan and the U.S. than for any other country, partly the result of Tokyo's historic role as a major connecting hub for the region. United says Japanese demand is returning but they are funneling large amounts of connecting traffic over All Nippon Airways, their Japanese joint venture partner.United was the largest carrier between the U.S. and China pre-COVID, but draconian limits on the number of flights imposed by the Chinese government has reduced each of the big 3 U.S. carriers to just 4 flights week between the U.S. and China. China is allowing a further expansion this fall and all 3 carriers are eyeing significant expansions, petitioning the U.S. DOT for the more than double the number of flights they operate. United is focusing its efforts on gaining the right to reinstate San Francisco service on a daily basis to both Beijing and Shanghai. Since the pandemic started, U.S. airlines have used their limited number of flights just to serve Shanghai. Fares between the U.S. and China are at historically high levels so the Chinese government loosening will help ease fares but only about the Chinese are only allowing a return of about 25  of pre-pandemic capacity so fares will remain much higher than they were pre-pandemic. Because of the strict Chinese capacity controls, significant amounts of traffic has connected over other gateways including Japan and so the slow addition of capacity to Japan will partially weaken the revenue environment in other markets  United serves a number of other markets and has announced expansion of transpacific services this winter, opposite of when northern hemisphere flights are usually started.Latin America traffic neither fell during the pandemic as far as to Europe or Asia and promises to not rebound as strongly  many Latin American economies, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, remained open during the pandemic and benefitted from increased tourist traffic as other parts of the world remained open. Competitively, United faces a more challenging environment as Aeromexico and Latam, both Delta joint venture partners, rebuild following their restructurings under U.S. bankruptcy laws.United has traditionally been the second-largest U.S. airline to Latin America, but Delta is likely to displace United as the two Latin carriers cooperate more closely with Delta and expand post-pandemic and post-restructuring. In addition, Mexico just regained its high level status for aviation safety which limited airlines from that country to expand in the U.S. for the past several years. There has been rapid growth by Mexican low cost carriers and United's position could be weakened by its weaker position in the region as a whole and by weaker partners.The DOT has released  by global region through the second quarter of 2023 for the four U.S. airlines that operate long haul international flights and United's international strategies have not been near as successful as Delta's in terms of profit generation. While many people argue that airlines can report costs and revenues differently, there is much more uniformity than some might expect and, more importantly, the total for each region has to sum up to the total for the company on a global basis. UAL for years has been willing to settle for lower profits in exchange for larger size.AAL - Latin America  336 million profit, Atlantic  52 million profit, Pacific  52 million loss  DAL - Latin America  124M profit, Atlantic -  530M profit, Pacific -  104M profit HA - Pacific -  5.5 million loss  UAL - Latin -  74M profit, Atlantic -  305M profit, Pacific,  116M profit.Delta was more profitable than United flying both to Latin America and across the Atlantic. United's profit on the Pacific was just 10  larger than Delta even though United's Pacific revenue was almost exactly twice as much as Delta.United's biggest risk relative to its competitors is its high capex, driven by its intention to grow its network. More than three times larger than its nearest competitor's order book, UAL plans to spend a whopping  50 billion on new aircraft over the next 7-10 years, far more than any other U.S. airline has ever spent. Both in terms of sheer numbers of aircraft and in the complexity of its plans, UAL's fleet spending is unprecedented. Internationally, UAL committed to an order for 100 Boeing  787s, the first of which are just now arriving. UAL is one of a handful of airlines that operate all 3 variants of the 787 from the initial 787-8 which seats 240-250 passengers depending on configuration to the -9, the longest range model with approximately 265 seats, and the 787-10, the largest model at  315 seats  -10 has less range than the - 9 but outstanding economics with enough range to comfortably fly 12-hour flights. UAL operates one of the longest current -10 flights from Chicago to Tokyo at more than 12 hours at certain times of the year.Domestically, UAL is the smallest of the big 4 in terms of passengers carried and smaller than AAL and DAL in domestic revenue, a result of predecessor airline Continental's heavy use of regional jets and small market shares outside of its hubs. UAL is determined to correct its domestic weakness and is committed to using large portions of its order book for growth, adding hundreds of aircraft to its fleet.While some of those new domestic aircraft will be for growth, many will be replacements of regional jets, including 50 seat regional jets  United contracts for the largest number of 50 seat regional jets in the world. The economics of small regional jets, including UAL's CRJ550s which are 70 passenger aircraft which have been retrofitted to 50 seats including first and extra space economy classes, have deteriorated dramatically as pilot and fuel costs have increased. While UAL has now outlined firm plans to retire large portions its regional jet fleet, many of those aircraft are reaching the end of their life. Because of U.S. airline scope requirements, new generation regional jets cannot be used as contracted aircraft for U.S. airlines so the fuel economy of regional jet will continue to deteriorate relative to narrowbody mainline aircraft. In addition, mainline aircraft are more efficient from a labor standpoint as 2 pilots are required for all commercial aircraft  even at higher rates for mainline aircraft, there is much greater labor efficiency in the cockpit as well as for ground staff working an aircraft that can hold 140-200 passengers than 50-70 passengers.Part of UAL's fleet challenge is that it operates large numbers of older aircraft. United currently operates the oldest fleet among large jet U.S. carriers. While aircraft can be maintained to remain in service for years, economics favor newer aircraft as maintenance costs increase with age and as fuel prices favor the use of newer technology aircraft. International aircraft have larger fuel efficiency gains going from one generation to the next and also benefit more from new airframe technology such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer -CFRP- construction which the A350 and B787 have.Even with its massive fleet replacement and growth plans, UAL will still large portions of its fleet that will not be as efficient as competitors. UAL, like AAL, ordered Boeing 777-300ER aircraft near the end of the production line, which Boeing intended at the time to bridge the gap to the B777X, which will be the largest twinjet ever and will have a CFRP wing but a traditional metal fuselage. UAL has not ordered the B777X and so will have 777s well into the 2030s as competitors replace their 777 fleets with newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft.The greatest risk for UAL's fleet plan is that interest rates are increasing and the Fed indicates they may remain so for much longer than expected. UAL has used portions of the cash it accumulated during the pandemic to help supplement its cash flow but it will soon reach a point where its levels of fleet spending - more than  8 billion year - will far outstrip its cash generation, requiring the addition of debt. In addition, UAL has committed to a number of airport terminal upgrades which will also be costly  many of its airport terminals as configured cannot accommodate the number of flights or the number of mainline aircraft that UAL anticipates so UAL will be increasing its debt if it finances its own terminals or increasing its airport rental costs much more than competitors if airports build facilities, which is the norm in the U.S. airline industry.The bottom line is that UAL might not grow its fleet near as much as it says it will but its fleet spending will remain very high for years, debt will increase, heightened by terminal projects, and UAL will still not gain fuel efficiency levels as great as many of its competitors unless it begins to retire many of its less fuel efficient fleets, something it says it will not do for years.One final source of fleet-related vulnerability for UAL is its dependence on the Boeing 737 MAX 10 in its fleet expansion and replacement plan. The MAX 10 is the largest of the Boeing 737 MAX family and is intended to compete with the Airbus A321NEO, which has taken the lion's share of orders for large, new generation aircraft. United was very slow to order the A321NEO, but will be receiving its first copies in the next few months. Still, UAL has committed to the MAX 10 and will use it on domestic routes with some of the aircraft configured with lie flat seating which is competitively necessary in long haul domestic routes, including from the Northeast to the west coast.Certification of the MAX 7, the smallest model of the family, and the MAX 10 have been delayed due to concerns from the FAA about the MAX family as a result of the two fatal foreign carrier crashes that resulted in the grounding of the global MAX fleet but also of the entire certification process, in which Boeing has been allowed to self-certify many processes over which the FAA wants greater control.United has been converting some of its MAX 10 orders to the smaller MAX 8 and MAX 9 models in a process similar to what Southwest is doing for the MAX 7 which is delayed even longer than the MAX 10. However, there is a lead time for airlines to switch models in the family and UAL and LUV along with Boeing continue to base their plans on BA's best estimates of when they complete the certification process. The MAX 7 will be the first of the two models to be certified and certification could come later his year with deliveries to Southwest in the first half of 2024 and entry into service shortly thereafter. While getting the MAX 7 certified should help clear the roadblocks to MAX 10 certification, the MAX 10 will not likely enter service in 2024 or at least not until late in the year. As with the MAX 7, there are MAX 10s that are already built, so Boeing will begin to delivering some of those aircraft fairly quickly, but there will still be a lag until Boeing can right size the MAX family order book for United. United financially benefitted relative to its competitors in 2022 because of its decision to not retire aircraft during the pandemic. It was able to quickly respond to a massive return of demand both in the domestic and later the international markets. However, as oil prices once again surge, very likely headed for over  100 bbl, and as demand weakens, both because of higher interest rates worldwide and because of growing fears of recession, and as UAL's massive fleet spending plan takes larger and larger portions of its earnings to service debt, UAL could quickly move from being one of the airline industry's darlings from a stock performance standpoint to one of its weakest players.

Sigma Lithium: Green Energy Darling,"Sigma Lithium  has been a fantastic success story in the lithium world. This company has brought a new mine from exploration to production in a part of the world that has known little lithium mining. Along the way, theyAnd they are a great business. They have done an amazingIn this article, I will explain why I think this is a great company and a buy. Though the share price has risen from  1.70 to  32 in five years, they have further to go as they ramp up production and expand.As of late, they have had a little bit of rocky news to do with legal disputes on some land claims. I'll get into this in the article, but I think this news presents a minor buying opportunity rather than a major obstacle to the company's future.Here is a summary of the company. Sigma operates the  in the Minas Gerais province of Brazil. They have a large spodumene deposit which they mine and concentrate into SC5.5. After acquiring this asset in 2012 the current leadership team  2023 and are ramping up. They are a pure-play hard rock lithium company like Pilbara . Pilbara CEO Dale Henderson has recently argued that in the lithium space, the highest margins will lie with the miners and not the chemical converters for a long time on   23 30 . Sigma is a low-cost producer of an amazing asset, and they should make a lot of money.This is the first phase of four planned phases. Once this phase is complete they plan to produce 270,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate, which is about 37, 000 t LCE. Currently, spodumene is  That would make for revenues of  756 million. The current spodumene price is below recent trends, and many analysts believe it could hold at higher prices for a while.They are currently in the feasibility stage of phases two and three. In these stages, they will greatly expand their operational capacity to 766,000 t spodumene concentrate annually or 104,000 t LCE. They believe construction for these phases will be. This company will be one of the major lithium producers once it achieves this milestone. Pilbara's current production capacity is currently  650,000 t of spodumene, for example.On the most recent earnings call, Cabral mentioned that they are talking about phase four  they may take on some debt and get into to chemical processing of spodumene. She mentioned lithium carbonate or lithium chloride as midstream possibilities.Sigma is a great lithium mining company and should create shareholder value over the long term. Here are eight reasons they are a great company. It is difficult to find a lithium company that is great in all these categories.The Grota do Cirilo mine has a great quality asset that will be able to scale into a large lithium producer. They have a cluster of spodumene-bearing pegmatites that make up their current resource.The resource is great for a few reasons. First, it is large. They currently have 85.6 Mt of resources and 54.8 Mt of reserves. Together they will have more than 100 Mt, and this resource will probably grow as they mine d the resource. A large resource means that this mine will be able to scale up and have a large nameplate capacity. A large mine also means it will have a longer mine life.Second, these pegmatites have a high concentration of lithium. The Greenbushes mine has the highest quality large swarm pegmatites and they have a grade of 1.50  LiO2, this is the absolute best. Sigma has 1.43  which is very good. If you look at the table below you can see Sigma is better than almost all other mines out there.Grade is very, very important. A high grade means that producing the spodumene concentrate is easier and the concentrate will be high grade too. Some mines are now selling 5.3  spodumene concentrates, rather than the standard 5.5  or 6  because their grades make it difficult to achieve 5.5  at scale. The lower the grade the more difficult conversion to lithium hydroxide is, making the product less valuable.Speaking of conversion, the third reason that Sigma's asset is so great is that the spodumene is very low in impurities. Impurities like iron and mica also make the conversion process difficult. Sigma's product is high lithium and low impurity, making it a dream for converters. You can see a comparative chart below.I just want to double down on this whole point. Mr. Lithium, Joe Lawrie, says that lithium is not a commodity  it is a specialty chemical. Because lithium is used to make batteries the chemistry of lithium is very important. Impurities make battery production harder. This puts a burden on the chemical converters.When lithium chemicals are sold to the cathode makers they come with a spec sheet, saying thing has exactly this much Fe ppm and this much Na ppm, etc. The cathode makers look at this stuff very carefully. The original lithium supply is important. Not all lithium coming out of the ground is the same. The lithium from Sigma is amongst the best.There is going to be a spodumene shortage for many years to come, so any mine producing it at scale will make money. Sigma has a number of ways they have sought to add value to this basic product.First, most operating spodumene mines use flotation circuits to concentrate the ore. Sigma has opted for a DMS  dense media separation  circuit instead. Each has pros and cons. Flotation has a higher recovery rate  you get more lithium . DMS requires less Capex and does not use chemicals, so it is more environmentally friendly.DMS also leaves the product more coarse. The final product is 6.5-9.5 mm, little rocks rather than a fine grain. The kind of material is also easier for converters. This idea has been so successful that many other lithium juniors are seeking to imitate Sigma. As far as I'm aware Sigma is the first to do this. There are some other spodumene mines that have struggled with their flotation circuits and are effectively DMS only, but Sigma has planned for DMS only.Also, Sigma advertises their spodumene as  Green Lithium.  I'll explain what this means in the ESG section. It's important to point out that having a green product makes lithium very attractive to EV makers and battery makers who are embracing the green narrative. Places like the EU and the US are more likely to subside green products. The green label also makes the lithium from Sigma special.Albemarle has been advertising their new Kings Mountain mine as ''. The first zero-emissions lithium mine anywhere was Sigma.The cost curve refers to the idea that all lithium makers have different costs tonne for producing lithium. As Sigma are in ramp-up we won't know exactly what their cost will be. On , they published  523 US t. On their recent earnings call the CEO said it might be a little higher than this. Whether it's  550 t or  650 t this is a great price. This puts Sigma in the first quartile. For reference,  for the next year is between  600 and  700 t. Minerals like lepidolite cost something like  3000- 4000 t to mine into a 6  concentrate.Currently, spodumene concrete is being sold for around  3000 t. Sigma's second shipment . I am of the view that it should mostly stay above that price for the medium term as there will be a shortage. There will be a sustained growth in demand from the EV and ESS, while there will be a shortfall on the supply side.Sigma will be making a lot of money. They are already saying they will be able to fully fund phases two and three from their own free cash flow. Amazing.Sigma has brought a lithium mine into production. This is no small feat on its own terms. They have managed to ramp up, very quickly.  they said they are producing 890 t every day which puts them at a run rate of 320,000 t per year, above their nameplate capacity of 270,000 t. That's wild.Below you can see a graph of their ramp-up phase, from the September investor presentation. This is an impressively fast ramp-up. They have executed well on phase one, which is the hardest because they are learning as they go. They will most likely be able to execute the expands for phases 2, 3, and beyond.The difficult part of spodumene mining is getting the concentration right. Bring the 1.4  LiO2 rock to 5.5  spodumene concentrate. Sigma has three plants to do this  the crushing circuit, the separating circuit, and the dry stacking circuit. Getting all three of these right is a technical challenge. That they are producing above nameplate capacity shows their operational prowess.Mining is hard  at least spodumene mining is hard. Most projects have PFS and DFS predictions that prove overly optimistic once the company starts to really seek permits and build. The chart below comes from a Canaccord paper called, .The chart is tough to read and you can look it up if you want to see the context, but the point is clear  all lithium mines take a long time and they are late. Getting into production is hard, and Sigma has done a great job. They should continue to do a good job with future expansions.Another connected point is that phase one has come in on budget. They have spent  126.7 million USD so far with only  8.1 million left.This is remarkable for two reasons. The initial CAPEX really is quite low  many mines are  300-500 million. Second, many mines go over budget. The Liontown   CAPEX at  435 million AUD but   p24  said that the CAPEX will come in at around  895 million AUD. Ouch.Sigma's estimated CAPEX for phases two and three together has been  154.9 million USD. They are currently conducting the studies so a more precise number will come out.This is worth mentioning. Different jurisdictions can be more or less mining-friendly. When they are unfriendly permitting can take a long time and the process of mining can be difficult.The Brazilian proving of Minas Gerais is now being viewed as a very friendly place for lithium mines. There are currently three large explorer developers in the state  Latin Resources , Lithium Ionic, and Atlas Lithium . They have all spoken about how easy it has been to operate compared to other places.Sigma got their permits in great time and should get all the permits for the next phases soon too. Sigma is being celebrated as a provincial hero.CEO Ana Cabral has done an amazing job bringing this lithium company into production. She started at the company with a dream to be a company that benefits the world. They are seeking to be on the new edge of ESG-friendly mining, creating a new image for the mining industry in general.She has created a fantastic team that has executed her unique vision for green lithium. She is really worth listening to. . She has flair and passion.This is what  When I tell my friends and family that I'm learning about lithium mining they often wrinkle their noses. My wife said recently,  It's sad how much these companies rape the earth.  Ouch. Well, when people say this I am very happy to tell them about Sigma and their practices.There is a lot here, and I won't get into it all. Just to mention a few points. Sigma calls their product, 'Triple Zero Lithium.' What does this mean  First, lithium is zero hazardous chemicals. The flotation method that other mines use to concentrate lithium uses hard chemicals. By going with DMS Sigma has eliminated these chemicals. Second, zero tailings. Most mines have wet tailings. Because of the DMS process, Sigma has dry tailings, which are easier to use. Some of the tailings are sold to other companies and then up-cycled to good lithium. The rest of the tailings are used to create roads. Third, zero carbon, or net-zero carbon. Sigma built their mine to be as carbon-light as possible. They use hydropower. They have purchased carbon credits to offset the carbon they create. So, zero, zero, zero lithium means green lithium.There is more. They recycle 100  of their water. Beyond the environmental side, they have a number of social benefits. They have hired over 1000 local employees creating wealth in a very poor province. They have started a micro-loans initiative for women in the area.  these micro-loans. They are involved in the conservation of trees in the Amazon. And more.Sometimes people outside the investing world are cynical about mining, they think all mines are bad. Sometimes investors roll their eyes and think all the ESG stuff is hippie nonsense. In a world filled with cynicism, Sigma stands out as a company doing the world good. Check out their website .The mine is located in a place with excellent infrastructure. They are hooked up to cheap hydroelectric power. There are existing highways to the port of Vitoria. They will be able to truck containers to ships without needing to build any infrastructure of their own.Before I go onto evaluations I need to address some recent news. Recently, Reuters has reported that Sigma is having legal disputes over some of the land packages  and .  that the Reuters reporting is mischaracterization and this is a minor issue that  does not impact Sigma Brazil nor Sigma Lithium.  After looking at this issue I think that this will not be a major problem for Sigma.Sigma has been led by a married couple, Ana Cabral and her husband Calvyn Gartner. Sometimes her name is written Ana Cabral-Gartner. He has been leading the technical team that built the mine and she has been leading the strategic team doing the business side. Sadly, they have recently split. She mentioned this in  as early as Jan 8, 2023. He was co-CEO of the company and .They are now in divorce court and it's quite complicated. They jointly own various companies, like RI-X Mineracao e Consultoria and A10, that have various stakes in and roles in connection with Sigma. They are currently in  and there are several suits flying around.The recent news concerns two land packages that are part of the phase two and three construction. The fear has been that this legal battle will put a pause on the phase two and three rollout. There are a few reasons why this is probably not the case. First, it seems from the disclosures from Sigma that there may be waste facilities planned for these land packages, but they are not the main part of the new phases.Second, Sigma is claiming that if there are disputes they can be settled through a cash payment, and stopping construction isn't necessary.Third, this company has garnered a lot of social capital. Latin Resources is developing a mine near Sigma in the same state, Minas Gerais.  CEO Chris Gale tells a story where he meets with the governor of the state who says,  Here's my card. If anyone gives you trouble give me a call.  This state is very excited about mining lithium. Sigma has created over 1000 jobs and is generating an economy in a poor area.It may be that this legal battle delays phases two and three, but I am not too worried. The one big result that I can see is that any potential takeovers will be put on hold until this is sorted out.This news caused a little price dip, and I think it's a good time to buy the dip.I am of the philosophy that a few different 'views' can give a more realistic handle of true value than one well-worked-out DCF. So, here are a few metrics.If we do a comparison, Sigma makes a very nice comparison to Pilbara.  of spodumene concentrate  5.3  actually . Their market cap has been between  8.09 and  10.80 billion USD. Currently, Sigma is  3.31 billion USD. If all goes according to plan phases two and three will begin producing into Q3 2024 and should ramp through to Q2 2025. That is by late 2025 their production should be more than Pilbara today.Sigma and Pilbara have very similar economics and positions. If anything, the lithium coming from Sigma is slightly higher quality. Sigma still needs to prove that they can do this, but you can get there before the market. If the comparison holds then Sigma should be at least around  10 billion USD by late 2025, meaning the shares would be  92. If we discount that at a rate of 15  to the present a target price is  69 share today.On the recent earnings call, CEO Cabral said that they are a producer that is still being evaluated by the market as a developer. She showed this graphTo be clear, Sigma has only just come into production, so the market is waiting to see if the company will consistently produce cash flow. Pilbara has been producing for many years and even just declared a dividend. Sigma's FCF will go towards developing their new phases, but that is exciting organic growth. From everything above I believe they will deliver great shareholder value.If we take Sigma's production projections at face value we can get a handle on possible earnings in the future. Let's assume that the spodumene price holds around  3000 t and their costs are  650 t, we get a profit of  2350 t. If they make 766,000 y by Q4 2025 then that gets an EBITDA of  1.8 billion USD. They have a chart with post-tax earnings   EBITDA 1.19  see chart below , so that gets us  1.5 of post-tax earnings per year.Pilbara's P E has swung wildly in the last two years from a high of 26 to a low of 4.5. The market cap of these lithium companies will swing with the lithium price, and it has been volatile. That's great if you are a long-term investor. We can sell when P Es are high and buy when low.Sigma will only need a P E of 6.66 to achieve a market cap of  10 billion USD. they will have a P E of 10-15 at some point during a lithium upswing, which might happen within the next year. We then get that Sigma will be at least the  92 share from the last analysts, but this suggests further upside.This chart comes from Sigma's own presentation. They, in fact, estimate an after-tax earnings of  2.7 billion USD, which suggests even further upside from my estimate. They got this number with more aggressive spodumene assumptions. This assumption comes from Benchmark Minerals, which is one of the two most important firms that make price predictions, see below. So, though these assumptions are more aggressive they come from a credible source. The Benchmark price of lithium is used by companies to set their contract prices.So, all this analysis says is that a  69 share price target today is probably conservative. We don't know exactly what the price of spodumene will be, but my guess is that the average will be somewhere between  3000 and  4000 for some time.Sigma has a slide showing NPV as a function of spodumene price. The numbers are a little hard to read so I'll put them on a table.Here's the chartWhat the chart says is that at a  4.0 billion market cap, the market is assuming a long-term spodumene price of  1500. The current market cap is actually  3.3 billion. If there is a  3000 spodumene price, my midterm floor, then we come to an NPV of  9.9 billion, just like the last two price predictions.Spodumene was priced at  3956 when the chart was made implying an NPV of  15.3 billion. Remember, Sigma's last shipment was  3500 t even though the China spot price is closer to  3000.It seems that the target share price of  69 is conservative and only requires a spodumene price floor of  3000. There is room for upside, if Sigma has even greater production with a fourth phase, or if spodumene prices are higher. So why is this company only going for  30 a shareThere are two reasons that this company is not fully valued. The first is that they have only just come into production. Over the next few years, the market will be looking for consistency. If they continue to hit their targets, there is a lot of upside here.The other reason this company is undervalued is that the market is quite fearful about a crash in the lithium price. I don't have the space to make the lithium bull case here, but all the market insiders are predicting lithium shortages. In said it would be reasonable to take  3000 t as the new floor for spodumene prices. The price is currently slightly below that.Of course, the market does crazy things. In the short term, it is possible for the price to go even lower, due to stocking issues in China. However, we shouldn't see the price go too much lower and the long-term price average will be somewhere above  3000. This means that Sigma will print money. on Sept 13th, 2023, that they have received multiple proposals  from potential strategic partners, including global industry leaders in the energy, auto, batteries and lithium refining industries  and are considering them. If there is some kind of deal it might materialize shareholder value very fast.Sigma is a great company. They produce low-cost quality lithium at scale. They have proven themselves at an operational level by successfully coming into production and ramping up quality. This bodes well for their future as they have bold plans to triple their current nameplate capacity in two years.They are also the poster child for the new wave of eco-friendly mining. CEO Ana Cabral began talking about her vision of green lithium way back in 2012 and she has managed to bring her dream into reality.Success breeds imitation. As I listen to other lithium companies out there, many are pointing to Sigma and saying,  We're going to try to do that.

Is Medical Properties Trust A Potential Takeover Target?," is currently trading at depressed multiples, but this is not enough to make it an interesting takeover target due to several fundamental issues that justify its  cheap  valuation.As I ve , I have been quiteHowever, I ve received some pushback that MPW s valuation is too cheap and below its liquidation value, plus it has plenty of assets that it may monetize to boost its liquidity position. I see these facts as potential risks for my bear thesis, thus in this article I analyzeOne bullish argument on MPW is that its current market value is too low and, probably, below its liquidation value. This means that if someone were to buy the whole company today, sell its tangible assets and pay down its debts, it would make money. For this to happen, its net liquidation value would be above the company s current market value of about  2.9 billion.This simple idea comes from the fact that MPW s reported assets, at the , were  19.2 billion, while its liabilities were only  10.9 billion, thus its net book value was  8.3 billion. This value is way above MPW s current market value, thus  bulls  say that its stock is clearly undervalued and a potential buyer could make some good money buying the company and selling off all its assets to pay down debt.Another possibility is that MPW is so cheap that a competitor could bid for it, refinance its debts and sell some assets, and have a good return on investment given that it's buying MPW on the cheap side.Moreover, with the  down by some 80  from its peak at the beginning of 2022, this seems to be a compelling argument that MPW has become too cheap to ignore and a takeover is just a matter of time. Moreover, MPW is currently  at some 3x FFO, thus its stock may appear at first glance a bargain, given that the REIT sector is currently trading at some 15x FFO.However, the reality is not so simple and there are many issues that investors should take into account, justifying MPW s current relatively low market value compared to its book value.As shown in the next table, MPW s assets include other lines beyond its real estate portfolio, including rent receivables, financial investments, and stakes in unconsolidated joint-ventures. Its real estate assets amounted to some  12.3 billion the end of 2022, including land and buildings, while in the Q2 2023 report the company also included intangible lease assets in the same reporting line, totaling  13.1 billion. Intangible lease assets were nearly  1.4 billion at the end of 2022, thus stripping out this amount of Q2 2023 assets, MPW s land and buildings should amount to about  11.9 billion at the end of last June.The company also had some  400 million in real estate held for sale, of which some  305 million was  this month related to four assets in Australia. The company has used these proceeds, and previous sales of Australia assets, to pay down its AUD loan and now doesn t have significant refinancing needs in 2024.Regarding other assets, they are much harder to monetize given that, as I ve analyzed in a previous article, MPW has, on several occasions, financed its tenants to keep them afloat, which may not be the best use of its financial resources. This means that a prospective buyer would require a deep discount to other assets and extensive due diligence to value those assets, thus investors shouldn t use MPW s accounting figures at face value.Moreover, investors should not overlook  of malpractice at MPW that weren t fully addressed by the company, raising several doubts about the true value of its stakes in real estate joint ventures and other operating entities. Note that these two lines were valued at  3.3 billion at the end of last June, thus it s a significant amount that is not easily valued by external analysts or prospective buyers.For instance, within the investments in real estate ventures there is  425 million related to the , related to eight hospitals operated by Steward. This is a tenant that is struggling financially, thus the value of this stake may be much lower from a prospective buyer's point of view, justifying a discount to MPW s book value.Moreover, within the investments in unconsolidated entities, there is an additional  487 million exposure to Steward related to loan and equity investments, which again a prospective buyer would require a significant discount, or full write down if Steward is in worse shape than what MPW is currently saying to its shareholders.Furthermore, while MPW has been reducing its exposure to Steward, it remains its largest tenant accounting for some 19  of its total assets. This is much higher than desired and leaves MPW heavily exposed to a struggling tenant, a profile that is not positive for a prospective buyer. In addition, Prospect Medical Holdings is another  and represents about 5.5  of MPW assets, thus a good part of MPW s assets are concentrated in problematic tenants.Related to its exposure to financially struggling tenants, another issue is that MPW s accounting value of its real estate may not reflect its current market value. While the company was able to sell its Australian assets over the past few months without incurring any losses, there has not been much more meaningful sales, which may be a sign that the market value of its properties is much lower than what MPW is reporting n its balance sheet.Given that interest rates have been on a rising trend over the past eighteen months this is not a surprising outcome for real estate in general. However, MPW is significantly exposed to struggling tenants, which is another headwind for the value of its properties operated by Steward and Prospect.While some investors think that if a tenant goes bankrupt, MPW will be able easily to find new operators for its property, eventually that may not be the case. The company highlighted this issue in its risk factors section of its Due to this risk, a prospective buyer would certainly value MPW s properties that are currently leased to Steward and Prospect at a significant discount, to accommodate the risk of potential bankruptcy from these tenants and its inability to find replacement operators to some, or all, of the related properties. This is, in my opinion, a key reason why MPW is trading much lower than its net book value, as MPW s properties most likely don t have much use beyond healthcare, thus in case of vacancy its remaining value may be very low.Beyond these issues, there is also the issue of who would be willing to buy MPWAs I ve analyzed in a , some of MPW s main negative factors in the short to medium term are its liquidity position and refinancing needs, which are pressuring its share price negatively.This would not be an issue for a larger REIT with good credit quality, like   for instance, but the likelihood of a large REIT moving into the healthcare sub-sector seems to be rather low. Synergies and asset complementation is quite low, thus there doesn t seem to be much benefit for a larger REIT to buy MPW and enter into the healthcare sub-sector.Other healthcare REITs would be the most obvious potential buyers, and there are some large REITs in the sub-sector, such as   or  . However, the business doesn t seem to be a great complement, even though Ventas also owns hospitals and could eventually look at some of MPW s assets, but I doubt it would be interested in the whole company.Another possibility would be for a private equity company to buy MPW, but usually these companies buy distressed assets and would be more interested, in my opinion, during a bankruptcy proceeding rather than buying it on the stock market.While MPW s share price has collapsed over the past eighteen months and is currently trading at depressed multiples, this is justified by the company s woes and questionable value of its assets, meaning perhaps is isn't the bargain it appears.I don t think MPW is an interesting takeover target at this point, which means that most likely the company has to fix its woes on its own. Investors should be aware that MPW s cash flow generation is weak and its ability to refinance debt or sell assets is also questionable, putting it in a potential financial distress position over the coming quarters.MPW will report its quarterly earnings in a , and for me personally, I think it is more important to look at its operating performance to see how much cash the company burned through over the past three months. I also want to see what is its liquidity position is, and its plan to address bond and loan maturities over the coming months.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Summit Midstream Partners' Recent Earnings Are Just The Start,"  had a great week on the back of a strong . The volatility in the company's share price is primarily due to its substantial debt load in relationThe company's largest source of weakness continues to be its debt load.The company has a massive debt load that drowns out its market cap. The company's revolving credit facility has  328 million borrowed. On top of that, the company has 8.5  in senior secured second lien notes due October 2026, for a total of  785 million, and lastly 5.75  in Apr 2025 senior notes, with a total of  259 million. Total debtFor perspective, the company's market cap is a hair over  200 million. There's another risk here in the rising interest rate environment. The company managed to raise its recent debt at much lower interest rates. The company's annual interest obligations are roughly  100 million. Once it has to roll over its debt, and it will have to, its interest could increase substantially.The company needs to pay down as much debt as it can before refinancing.The company has announced a rough guidance of its earnings and results.The company announced massive volume growth across its business. That includes 20  Northeast volume growth and 20  Rockies liquids volume growth. That massive volume growth shows a recovery in demand for the company's assets, the most important part of success for any midstream company.The company saw 74 wells connected during the quarter, with 224 YTD, targeting 300 for the year. That's as many well connects as the company saw in the 2018 peak, and more than 2019. This is supported by strength in the company's segments. The company expects  70 million in EBITDA for the quarter, up 20  QoQ, and is guiding  80 million for the last quarter.The company's customer base has 8 rigs and 170 DUCs, which will help support additional drilling completion. The company has yet to set the 2024 guidance, but 1H 2023 guidance is  300 million. The company's guidance for these connections is  55 million.Financially, what matters for the company at the end of the day is whether it can turn its EBITDA into free cash flow  FCF . The company's  107 million in 6 month adjusted EBITDA turns into  57 million in cash flow for distributions and  40 million in FCF. Triple that EBITDA and remove the  40 million in extra interest, and you get  120 million in FCF off of  300 million in EBITDA.That means from 2024-2026, the company will earn  350 million in FCF. That's  25  of its debt. We expect all cash flow will go towards this goal.The company's assets have substantial capacity for minimal cost.The asset location informs the incremental cost to add volume. In Marcellus and the Ohio Gathering JV, the company's cost to add incremental pads is almost 0. For Liquids in the Northeast, it's much higher. Across the company's assets, its utilization is 38  meaning that there's substantial room to increase utilization.The overall system can support almost 4 billion cubic feet   day in additional incremental capacity. The company's survival is based on whether drilling continues in its segments. It continues to receive MVC shortfall payments, and while those are closing down, it will not continue forever.The company's new Double E pipeline is backed by 13 rigs and the company believes in the long-term potential here, but its other assets combined have 8 rigs, not a ton for long-term support. As long as the company's utilization remains low, its earning potential remains lower. The company fundamentally needs long-term demand for its assets.The most important note in the company's update was that it's started to review strategic updates.That's not surprising. The company continues to trade in an incredibly low valuation because of fear over its debt load and whether the company can refinance it. A large company that could handle that debt load, especially one with the gathering assets, could integrate and receive strong overall integrated assets.How that future pans out remains to be seen, but the market is clearly optimistic. We expect the company to get a strong premium.The largest risk to thesis is whether the company can continue to maintain utilization and see wells completed. That relies on higher prices. Natural gas prices have had some strength recently. We expect this strength to continue as natural gas prices have strong demand, however, whether that pans out remains to be seen.Summit Midstream Partners has had some strong performance recently. The company has a strong portfolio of assets and the market has been strong recently. However, the company remains susceptible to its massive debt yield, paying off as much as it can before the next rollover. Higher interest rates present a massive threat.However, despite that threat, Summit Midstream Partners, LP has the cash flow to drive substantial shareholder returns long term. A strategic acquisition could provide a strong short-term return. The company's rollovers continue to remain important for its long-term returns.

Quantum-Si: Highly Speculative With A Strong Appeal,"Quantum-Si incorporated.  has been a pioneering entity in proteomics since 2013. I believe QSI's revolutionary Platinum platform is the linchpin of its revenue model. However, QSI s nascent revenues still make it a highly speculative investment proposition. QSI s valuation is challengingQuantum-Si incorporated has held a significant position in the expanding field of proteomics since 2013 to enhance protein sequencingThe  platform is designed to democratize  protein sequencing globally. This initiative propels comprehension of complex biological systems forward, a pivotal step for advancing medical science. In my view, the positioning of QSI in the market, coupled with its innovative product line, harbors substantial growth prospects, sketching a promising trajectory toward achieving commercial success. The Platinum platform caters to a wide range of , including academic institutions and industry-based laboratories, regardless of their level of bioinformatics expertise.QSI was developing the  platform to automate sample preparation for protein sequencing and genomics, streamlining lab procedures, particularly with third-party DNA sequencing technologies. Carbon, part of a broader technology suite including the Platinum platform and QSI Cloud software, aims to address common challenges in genomics and proteomics by enhancing sample prep efficiency and reliability. Although Carbon can minimize sample prep variation and optimize workflow, it's not essential for operating the Platinum instrument. Currently, its development is , and its business case is under analysis.The Platinum instrument commenced its journey into the market by initiating order-taking in December 2022, followed by the onset of commercial shipments in January 2023. Parallel to this, the sustained endeavor in research and development is targeted toward refining this instrument and scrutinizing the business viability of the Carbon sample preparation solution. QSI released a  in July, addressing customer feedback. This upgrade enhanced the user interface and provided additional visualizations at the amino acid level, resulting in positive feedback from .The Cloud software seamlessly pairs with the Platinum instrument, providing a unified, intuitive environment for planning, setting up, and analyzing sequencing runs. As each run proceeds, the generated data is automatically uploaded to the Cloud, where proteins are identified without requiring bioinformatics expertise. This software can be securely accessed from any computer, allowing analysis from any location and promoting collaboration with colleagues and partners worldwide, making the process of protein sequencing data analysis effortless and accessible.An expenditure increase is anticipated to invigorate the sales, marketing, development sectors, and inventory accumulation. Several factors could potentially fuel the acceleration of cash requirements, including but not limited to setbacks in reaching scientific and technical milestones, unforeseen capital outlays, modifications in business or commercialization strategies, ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial demands of maintaining a public company status, and the prospect of future acquisitions.QSI's latest earnings call underscored fiscal vulnerability, hinging on acquiring future financing under favorable terms. As stated, the inability to secure such financing could impart a detrimental effect on business operations, financial stability, and the capacity to respond adeptly to market pressures or seize acquisition opportunities. The mention of potential setbacks, particularly those tied to scientific and technical milestones and unforeseen capital expenditures, underlines a level of uncertainty that could, in my opinion, necessitate a conservative financial strategy to ensure sustained growth and stability.QSI's conservative stance could act as a buffer, mitigating the adverse impacts of unforeseen challenges, thereby ensuring a steadier, albeit possibly slower, trajectory toward achieving long-term business objectives. And it's important to note that financial stability is crucial for attracting customers and growth. Fortunately, I estimate that, indeed, QSI should have enough liquidity to last until roughly 2027 at the current cash burn rate. Thus, I believe it'll be able to benefit from the promising proteomics market valued at . In fact, QSI s market continues to grow at an impressive CAGR of 14.6 . So, QSI's Platinum platform is undoubtedly poised to benefit from this growth trend.However, QSI s promising potential differs significantly from its nascent revenue streams. QSI s current revenue largely depends on instrument and consumables sales, augmented by service maintenance contracts. The launch of the Platinum instrument and the commencement of  in January 2023 marked a significant milestone. However, QSI has only recognized revenue of  0.2 million in Q2 2023, underscoring the company s embryonic commercialization stage. QSI s ongoing R D efforts to enhance the Platinum instrument and the evaluation surrounding the  preparation solution are crucial for long-term success, and it anticipates accelerated spending to bolster sales and marketing teams, continue product development, and build inventory.Therefore, QSI's cash burn dynamics for the six months ending on June 30, 2023, primarily stem from the operating activities, with net cash used in operating activities amounting to  51.6 million. Cash 1H2023 cash burn increased compared to 1H2022, which was  49.2 million. The primary driver of this cash usage is the continued investments in R D efforts and the ramp-up of commercialization activities. QSI s operating expenses reveal a YoY decrease in R D costs by 14.2  for Q2 2023, primarily attributed to refined R D activities and restructuring initiated in Q1 2023. Conversely, SG A expenses saw a slight uptick due to ramping up commercial sales activities.So, to finance this cash burn, QSI generated positive cash flows from its investing activities, which amounted to  55.2 million. Yet, these were primarily due to sales of marketable securities totaling  59.5 million. Similarly, in 2022, the net cash provided by investing activities was considerably higher at  94.5 million, primarily due to sales of marketable securities totaling  100.1 million. For context, at the end of the latest quarter, QSI reported  87.9 million in cash and  209.3 million in marketable securities, representing approximately  in remaining liquidity to fund its ongoing cash burn. As previously noted, such cash burn is roughly  103.2 million  annualizing 1H2023 figures . Thus, QSI should have enough liquidity to last another 2.9 years  late 2026, more or less .From a valuation perspective, pricing a company like QSI is tricky. The company has no revenues and is still in the development phase of its product. Yet the key consideration regarding QSI is its technology platform that departs from traditional proteomics, often replacing lengthy conventional procedures with a streamlined workflow that delivers results within a day. The introduction of NGPS, characterized by its massively parallel sequencing capability, signifies a  over previous sequential methodologies. This enhancement provides a high-resolution, unbiased insight into the proteome, with  enabling an in-depth examination of amino acid variations. In my view, the company's integration of Platinum instruments alongside the  software service is a thoughtful step toward digitizing proteomics. This assertion stems from reputable academic institutions' noted adoption of the Platinum instrument, indicating a positive reception within the scientific community. The instrument s simplified workflow, which doesn't necessitate advanced expertise, could lower the entry barriers to proteomics research, making it a valuable asset to the field.This digital transition, highlighted by the capacity for single-molecule detection, embodies the company s innovative ethos. The Quantum-Si Cloud software service, as a scalable informatics platform for protein sequence data analysis, aids in seamlessly integrating protein identification into existing research initiatives, thus hastening the realization of research objectives. This ease of integration is crucial as it could foster broader platform adoption, supporting the claim of digital transformation as a linchpin for contemporary scientific progress. This is further illustrated by the collaborative integration of  exploration tool, which augments the platform's analytical competencies. This enhancement allows researchers to delineate connections between protein sequences and diseases, other proteins, and post-translational modifications, cultivating a favorable environment for innovation within the proteomics sector.Yet, QSI's revenue capabilities are still budding, as demonstrated by the revenues of  0.5 million in the first half of 2023. A backlog of around  0.1 million hints at potential revenue, although its conversion remains to be determined due to the company's fledgling status in the market. Furthermore, such a backlog is modest compared to the ongoing cash burn rate.But, as you can see, QSI is  its revenue generation starting from Q3 and Q4 of 2023. By 2024, the revenue is projected to reach  6.0 million annually. This anticipated revenue growth underscores the potential effectiveness and acceptance of QSI s offerings and indicates a pivotal shift in risks from R D to scaling and production capabilities. This shift is crucial, as it substantially lessens the company's risk profile  securing financing for scaling operations is often less challenging than funding groundbreaking technological development.Moreover, estimates for QSI s 2024 revenues reflect significant growth from 2023, illustrating a more than fourfold increase. Suppose QSI maintains this growth trajectory, even with a moderating growth rate. This is reasonable, given the market size is  to burgeon to  72.9 billion by 2028. I believe this market expansion bodes well for QSI as it could continue to increase yearly revenues substantially, provided its scaling and production capabilities are enhanced concurrently. The alignment of QSI's revenue growth with market expansion is pivotal, and this synchrony will be instrumental in realizing the substantial revenue potential projected for 2028.Naturally, the above are relatively speculative forecasts, which is the best we can do given QSI s early ramp-up stages. However, this does showcase that there s indeed a way to justify QSI s current valuation. And in fact, the further we forecast its potential growth, the higher its upside potential becomes. However, all of this is contingent on rosy forecasts holding up, and as investors, we often see that is not always the case. Thus, I think, as a whole, QSI remains in a highly speculative phase. Yet, it s currently in the most exciting part of its speculative phase because it s just starting to ramp up after seemingly working out its products' quirks.So, while it s still highly uncertain the growth pace it ll experience and the hurdles it ll encounter, I do think there s a persuasive bullish case for QSI if one thinks of it as a smaller part of one s portfolio that could potentially be a multibagger if it all works out. Other than that, I don t think QSI is viable as a main component of any investor's portfolio. So overall, I rate QSI a  buy  because it looks incredibly promising at this point. Yet, I temper my bullish rating by stressing that QSI should still be considered a small speculative part of one s portfolio. After all, it s simply too risky to make it a meaningful portion of an investor's portfolio because, as the table shows, if revenue growth doesn t materialize or grow as much as expected, then the downside potential is massive.Overall, QSI s financials and prospects reveal a narrative of innovation melded with caution under the broader umbrella of a burgeoning proteomics market. QSI is seemingly teetering on the brink of escalating its operations, with a projection of a notable revenue increment by 2024, benefiting from its market anticipated size of  72.9 billion by 2028. However, its prevailing cash burn further exemplifies the inherent risks entwined with QSI's ambitious growth trajectory. Thus, QSI s speculative revenue projections frame its bullish narrative with cautious optimism. While I advocate a  buy  rating for QSI, I stress that investors should earmark QSI as a speculative portfolio slice. This prudent stance, dovetailed with the burgeoning promise of QSI's technology, encapsulates the narrative of QSI being a speculative yet potentially rewarding market proposition.

Energy Transfer: 9% Yield Is Too Good To Pass,"Energy Transfer LP  has arguably become one of the better dividend income opportunities in the energy sector as a whole, but certainly when looking at the industry for oil and gas storageThe company is at an attractive price point with a valuation in line with the rest of the sector. With a yield over 9  as well I think ET displays a strong buy case right for the dividend-oriented investors that want exposureET is a prominent  with a market capitalization of approximately  41 billion. The company boasts an expansive and strategically significant pipeline network that stretches across an impressive 41 U.S. states. Within the energy sector, Energy Transfer is a pivotal player, responsible for facilitating the transportation of crucial resources.One of the most critical roles that ET fulfills is its substantial involvement in the movement of energy resources. Specifically, the company plays a central role in transporting approximately 30  of the United States' natural gas supply, demonstrating its indispensable contribution to the nation's energy infrastructure. Additionally, ET is responsible for the transportation of around 35  of the nation's crude oil, emphasizing its role as a key player in the energy sector.The company operates through five distinct segments, each contributing to its diverse portfolio of energy-related activities. These segments encompass a wide range of functions within the energy sector, providing a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to its operations. One of the key segments within the company focuses on compression services. In this capacity, the company plays a vital role in maintaining and optimizing the transportation of energy resources. By offering compression services, they ensure that energy resources, such as natural gas, can be efficiently transported through pipelines, facilitating their journey from production sites to end-users.One of the leading  from ET has to be the fact they are acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners LP  for a deal valued at  7.1 billion, taking into account the  3.3 billion of debt the company has.The deal is a major step in the progress that ET is making to solidify a growing dividend yield with further additions of FCF to the business. The deal is expected to fully close in the fourth quarter of 2023 so we are still some time off from seeing the true impact of the deal in the results of ET. However, I am optimistic about the prospects of a steadily growing FCF yield for ET over the next decade because of it.Over the years ET has had a slight volatility to the yield, which I think can be largely attributed to the pandemic and the uncertainty about energy usage during that period. ET cut the dividend which I think was a good idea given they have a lot of debt on hand that they also need to attend to. But I think it has since become obvious that natural gas is not going to go away and even though there can be disruptions, ET remains in a strong position to benefit from major market trends over the long term. I would expect in 2024 that we see an increase in the dividend and reach levels closer to  0.35 which will be driven by EPS expansion for the business. EPS growth can come from closing significant deals like acquiring Crestwood.The most recent report from the company displayed strength in my opinion as the net income managed to reach  911 million in total.What ET has managed to do very well in my opinion is maintain a strong set of diversification as from where they generate their revenues and earnings. The company is not heavily reliant on one source. The largest one is NGL   Refined Products at 27  in total. The cured oil segment, for example, is benefiting from the connectivity that it has to major basins of operations and the access to the US market which right now is a strong demand on domestic oil production.In addition to the potential impact of interest-rate fluctuations, the ability of ET to consistently meet its debt obligations is a critical factor in maintaining its overall financial stability. The company's ability to make regular and reliable debt payments is paramount to ensure solvency and financial well-being. It's worth noting that any circumstances that lead to a decrease in the company's cash flow can pose a significant risk, particularly if ET carries a substantial debt load.While midstream companies like ET often demonstrate relatively stable cash flows over the long term, it is essential to recognize and address the associated risks within this aspect of their operations. Maintaining a high leverage ratio, which involves having a significant amount of debt relative to equity, introduces certain financial risks that must be carefully managed.A situation that can significantly impact a company's cash flow, such as a decrease in demand for its offerings, unexpected operational challenges, or broader economic downturns, has the potential to disrupt the company's capacity to fulfill its debt commitments. This concern becomes more pronounced when the company's debt load is substantial compared to its ability to generate cash flow.  is being pushed for but the fact remains that gas and oil are still going to be massive parts of the current energy supply and unlikely to be largely disrupted in the near decade because of the sheer amount of capital that is necessary to make something like that happen.ET has managed to exemplify itself over the years and deliver a very strong dividend yield for investors that has made it very attractive. Right now the P E for the business is just 4  over the rest of the sector at 11. On a P S basis though ET is trading over 60  below the rest of the sector which I think indicates a very strong buy case here honestly. With reliable revenue growth as natural gas demand picks up and is consistent over the next decade at least, I think ET is undervalued. A slight discount may be justified as ET has a very high payout ratio currently, which indicates that perhaps expansion is not as quick as in previous years. Nonetheless, the acquisition of Crestwood I think displays that ET can still take market share grow the distributable cash flows, and be a benefit to shareholders, for these reasons I am rating it a buy right now.

"Valero: Despite Massive Strength, I'm Considering Selling (Rating Downgrade)","It's time to discuss an investment that has been with me since I started my current dividend growth portfolio in 2020. I bought  during the depths of the pandemic whenWhile I was unable to buy it at the bottom  I was down more than 20  at some point , the stock has turned into one of my best investments, returning almost 200 , excluding dividends.I'm bringing this up because the company has gone from an underperformer with many issues and a high risk of dividend cuts to a company that is firing on all cylinders.Not only is it benefiting from ongoing strength in gasoline demand, favorable margins, and past tailwinds that have resulted in a tsunami of cash, but also newThe bull case has gotten so good that I'm considering taking some money off the table - especially in light of potential economic issues down the road.In this article, I will share my thoughts and discuss the company's risk reward so investors know what's going on in my mind.Let's start with the bigger picture.The chart below shows the relationship between the VLO stock price   below its all-time high  and the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite leading indicator for economic growth.While the correlation is far from perfect, we see that economic downtrends almost always result in steep losses for VLO investors. Almost always.Right now, VLO shares are up 16  year-to-date, less than 4  below their all-time high.Meanwhile, the ISM Index has been below 50  the neutral line between growth and contraction  for ten consecutive months.Despite economic headwinds, refining companies enjoy strong tailwinds that are mainly supply-related.Earlier this month,  highlighted some of the biggest issues driving favorable refining margins.According to the article, oil executives are seeing a critical issue of inadequate crude-processing capacity due to a lack of investment, coupled with more frequent shutdowns, as refiners prioritize higher margins and defer planned maintenance.This pattern emerged during the APPEC by S P Global Insights conference held in Singapore. The consequence of this situation is the heightened vulnerability of fuel prices, particularly diesel and gasoline, to abrupt fluctuations whenever unexpected outages occur.For example, unplanned plant shutdowns have been occurring almost weekly in Europe.According to Bloomberg, Frederic Lasserre, global head of research   analysis at Gunvor Group Ltd., makes the case that many refiners have delayed routine maintenance, making them susceptible to unexpected technical glitches resulting in surprise outages.Especially after the pandemic, too much supply was offline, which forced refineries to produce at elevated utilization rates.Not only is this an issue in Europe, but stockpiles are tight in general.In the United States, inventories for finished products are dropping faster than expected.To make things worse, Russia is increasingly using its energy leverage.On September 21,  reported that Russia is temporarily banning exports of diesel in order to support domestic supplies. This hurts Europe and global supply in general. After all, if one region sees a lower supply, it needs to import from other regions.Having said all of this, instead of easing prices due to new post-pandemic supply, the situation remains tight, pressured by outages, persistent demand, and new geopolitical issues.Refinery companies are winning big time.Over the past three years, America's two pure-play refinery stocks, Marathon Petroleum  and Valero Energy, are up 439  and 234 , respectively. I excluded Phillips 66  due to its massive footprint in chemicals.With this in mind, what do we make of VLO at these pricesIn the second quarter, the company massively benefited from the aforementioned tailwinds.Its refineries had a throughput capacity utilization of 94 , capitalizing on tight product supply and strong product demand in the U.S.The company also started its Port Arthur coker, which has the capability of adding up to 100 thousand barrels of crude oil capacity to the company's daily capacity.Valero also expanded its renewable products.Looking forward, Valero anticipates that low global light product inventories and tight supply-and-demand balances will continue to support refining fundamentals.Global demand for transportation fuels has rebounded substantially, with gasoline and diesel demand on par with pre-pandemic levels and steady growth in jet fuel demand.This outlook reinforces the company's dedication to its core strategy of operational excellence, capital discipline, and delivering on its commitment to shareholder returns.When it comes to its commitment to shareholder returns, the company is seeing tailwinds that were unimaginable a few years ago.For example, in 2012, the company spent more than 100  of depreciation and amortization on sustaining capital expenditures. In 2022, that number was 55 , indicating much more efficient operations.Furthermore, the company's total CapEx requirements are below the longer-term average, thanks to lower growth CapEx, as major projects have progressed nicely over the past few years, generating additional earnings.Hence, after spending 2020 and 2021 protecting the , the company is now back on track, repurchasing stock and raising its dividend.Last year alone, the company distributed  6.1 billion to shareholders, which was a blowout record and still less than 50  of its net income.In the second quarter, the company made clear that it has a strategy of balancing dividends with share repurchases to ensure an optimal allocation of capital to provide returns to shareholders.As the overview above shows, Valero's share repurchase program is a fundamental element of its capital allocation strategy.The significant allocation of funds, amounting to  951 million in the second quarter for the repurchase of shares, shows the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and belief in the intrinsic value of its shares  buying back shares when the valuation looks attractive .The repurchase of roughly 8.4 million shares in the quarter alone reflects the proactive steps Valero is taking to manage its outstanding shares and potentially enhance shareholder value.Having said that, the current dividend yield is 2.8 , which is nothing to write home about, at least not in the energy sector, where drillers often pay much higher yields.On January 31, the company hiked by 4.1 , which shows that it is still mainly focused on buybacks instead of hiking its quarterly dividend commitment.Nonetheless, going forward, I expect dividend growth to pick up.The company has a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, which is one of the best numbers in its sector. It is expected to lower net debt to less than  3 billion next year, and free cash flow expectations indicate a  12  free cash flow yield next year.In other words, if the company were to spend every penny of free cash flow on distributions, it could distribute 12.3  of its market cap to shareholders.I'm not saying that will happen, but it shows how much cash this company is generating.Note that free cash flow is expected to fall in the years ahead. This is not an indication that Valero is doing something wrong. It shows that analysts are expecting a normalization in refining margins, as no analyst is willing to incorporate prolonged geopolitical issues and other supply forces in their estimates. I can get behind that.However, it means that any tailwinds could lead to higher expectations for the quarters and years ahead.This part is so tricky. Not only because nobody knows how long refinery margins will remain tight but also because the global economy isn't doing so well right now. We could easily run into a scenario where demand destruction offsets tight supply.Having said that, the company is trading at less than 4x 2023E EBITDA. That number rises to 6.6x 2025E EBITDA due to the aforementioned decline in expected margins.If we apply an 8x multiple, we get a price target of  177. The current consensus price target is  145, a dollar below the current price.My opinion is that the company will generate higher-than-expected earnings  including EBITDA and free cash flow  over the next few years. I do not expect supply to rebound as quickly as expected, and I'm also not a supporter of the thesis that quick EV adoption will significantly hurt demand.If anything, emerging demand in markets like Asia and Africa will likely provide strong export demand growth for decades to come.Having said that, I'm considering selling a bit of VLO.This is not a call to get people to sell VLO. This is just my view on the mid-term risk reward.I believe that VLO has a very bright future, and if I decide to sell, I will be on the hunt to buy back at lower prices. That could be triggered by a further decline in economic growth, causing potential demand destruction to offset supply tailwinds.Valero Energy has transformed from a struggling investment to a major success.The refining industry, despite economic headwinds, is thriving due to supply-related factors. Recent geopolitical shifts, like Russia's temporary diesel export ban, emphasize this.Valero's strategic growth and financial discipline bode well for investors. The company's prudent capital allocation strategy, boasting a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, signifies a commitment to shareholder returns.Nonetheless, given the current risk reward and other investment opportunities, I'm considering selling a bit of Valero Energy Corporation to potentially buy it back at lower prices if I get the chance.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Royal Caribbean: Sailing Far Away From Fundamental Value,"The hotel and leisure sector has performed generally well throughout 2023 as traveling rates rise back to, , pre-COVID levels. After years of delaying vacation, many have pursued much larger traveling opportunities this year. Most stocks in the industryRoyal Caribbean's equity stock price is currently around 20  below its pre-COVID level. However, a company's financial value is not its stock price but its market capitalization and, more accurately, its  enterprise value,  which also accounts for net debt. Royal Caribbean's market capitalization equals itsDuring the COVID period, RCL suffered huge losses, causing the company to sell equity and raise debt to maintain its liquidity, considering Royal Caribbean is technically more valuable today than ever. Thus, no investors should buy RCL solely because it appears discounted to its pre-COVID level, given that it is due to financial dilution - it is at an all-time high.Short interest on RCL is relatively high at 8.8 , implying a fair amount of speculators see more downside risk than upside potential for the company. Indeed, it is a much more expensive company with no further  recovery  potential. For its valuation to make sense today, we must expect the company to expand its sales and income well above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, we must expect it to be immune to the cyclical risk factors facing other consumer discretionary stocks.Over the past twelve months, Royal Caribbean has seen its total sales rise firmly above its pre-COVID level. Its annual sales are around 30  higher than before 2020, indicating it has recovered well. That said, there has also been around that much inflation since then, so its revenue growth is not a great indicator of its actual growth. Further, its total expenses have risen much faster at 45  over the past five years, so its operating income is around 25  lower. Due to its increased debt and the sharp increase in interest rates, its net income is still negative over the past twelve months. See belowFor the most part, Royal Caribbean has not seen material COVID-related impacts over the past 12 months. Its sales have been normal since 2022, or perhaps in the summer of 2022 if we account for inflation-adjusted sales. Thus, I believe the past 12 months are a good indicator of what we can expect from Royal Caribbean in the long term, depending on consumer trends. Air travel has also completely recovered and , so, likely, the market is back at a peak economic cycle.There are numerous trends causing strains on its profit margins. For one, fuel costs were sharply higher from the end of 2021, creating negative headwinds for the company as it was already challenged with pushing higher costs onto customers. Over the past year, its , while the price of fuel commodities has declined dramatically. Its operating margins were around 21  last quarter, roughly the seasonally normal level before 2020. Aside from interest costs, a substantial negative factor for equity investors, Royal Caribbean is about as profitable operationally as it usually is. Of course, oil and petroleum product prices have started rising sharply again in recent months, so the company may soon see that primary headwind return.In my view, the most significant issue with Royal Caribbean is its immense debt growth since 2020. As its liabilities soar, its tangible book value has crumbled by over 75 , bringing its price-to-book to over 7X. While that figure is not too relevant, it has some importance, considering it is a very capital-intensive company. This trend also illustrates the extreme increase in liabilities facing the firm. Its interest expenses have risen by around 4-5X, bringing its times-interest-earned down to about 1X. See belowOver the past 12 months, Royal Caribbean's EBIT has gone to interest costs. Even if we assume its EBIT rises slightly as its recovery finalizes  which I believe it already has , we can take most of its income to interest costs. This is a permanent issue because it is unlikely the company will earn enough money to raise sufficient cash to pay off its debt. Equity dilutions are a likelier means of reducing debt in the long run. Its financial debt-to-EBITDA is a staggering 7.7X, making it extremely difficult for the company to get out of this debt hole. Currently, its net income is not high enough that it should be able to raise sufficient cash to pay down its debt. It can refinance this debt, but likely at even higher interest rates due to the rise in borrowing costs since 2021. Most likely, the firm can  and, I believe, eventually will  issue equity to reduce debt, potentially diluting equity investors significantly.Royal Caribbean's credit rating is B1  B  . This is objectively a meager credit rating, particularly for a company of its size. Most of its around 2025-2027 but occurring from 2023 to 2035. Crucially, much of this debt was created during the 2020-2021 period when interest rates were meager compared to today  thus, if rates remain high over the coming years, then Royal Caribbean's interest costs will continue to rise as it refinances at much higher interest rates.From a purely operational standpoint, not accounting for debt concerns, Royal Caribbean's current standing is equal to, or even slightly better than, its pre-COVID level. Bookings are higher than in 2019, and the company has pushed most increased operating costs into its ticket prices without losing customers. A rebound in fuel costs could easily upset that trend, considering much of Royal's margin recovery in 2023 is likely due to the compression in fuel prices,  Still, I believe it is safe to say that most major demand-side headwinds are behind the company, at least on a TTM basis.Subjectively, I believe that Royal Caribbean's economic pattern is  . If we're looking broadly, US and global consumer activity is not strong. People are actively  as their real spending capacity declines, and many people's ability to borrow money reaches a limit. Over , there has been a notable uptick in credit card defaults, slowdowns in credit card debt growth, and another sharp decline in personal savings rates. Put simply, many people  like they have not been impacted by inflation but do not have the excess financial capacity to do so. For example, steakhouses are seeing stellar demand because people missed them, even though they're not much  afford them so quickly.For the same reason, I believe many may be booking cruises because they missed the opportunity over the 2020-2022 period. Of course, cruises are more expensive, and people do not have more money to spend. Increased credit card debt has offset that issue, but the recent declines in credit card metrics indicate that people will need to reduce spending in the future. Statistical recession odds remain extremely  in unemployment could accelerate that trend significantly.It is difficult to confidently say where consumer spending trends will go over the next year. Based on a great deal of data and trends, it seems most likely that consumer spending levels peaked around Q2 in the US  seasonally adjusted  and are now heading lower as more people tighten budgets. Obviously, this will not deter many from going on Royal Caribbean cruises  however, given its higher costs, even a 5-15  decline in ticket sales would be enough to hold Royal's net income below water for a prolonged period. The ongoing rebound in fuel prices or an actual cyclical recession  that causes some unemployment  would accelerate this trend. However, even if those negative catalysts do not occur, it seems very unlikely that consumer demand for Royal will continue to rise into abnormally high territory, given today's low savings and high consumer debt levels.Overall, I am very bearish on RCL and believe it is significantly overvalued and likely a decent short opportunity at its current price. In my opinion, the stock is considerably overbought because it is a recovery trade. While that was true in early 2021, the company has been operating in a  new  normal environment over the past twelve months. Indeed, I believe the most recent quarter, and potentially Q3, are abnormally above its long-term potential because it's generating excess sales due to pent-up demand  people who delayed travel, etc. . I believe that Royal's ability to generate a consistently positive net income is questionable, considering both rising costs and, most importantly, colossal interest cost increases.RCL's downside is challenging to estimate because it depends considerably on external trends. If we assume that consumer demand remains abnormally strong while cost pressures do not mount, then perhaps RCL overvalued by just 20-30 , adjusting its net income potential for increased interest. However, if any negative headwinds occur, such as a recession, prolonged high interest rates, increased fuel costs, wage pressures, environmental regulatory issues, or declines in consumer spending, then Royal's downside appears to be relatively significant because its ability to earn an income would become questionable. Most companies with debt-to-EBITDA and times interest earned at Royal's level could not obtain any external financing  however, its situation is unique because lenders have assumed it is recovering.Although RCL's short interest level is elevated, its borrowing . RCL's than most stocks but nearly one of the lowest levels RCL has seen in recent years. Since RCL's implied volatility is so low, speculators may find added potential in put options that may be a cheaper way to bet against it with defined risk. Of course, bearish speculators must be mindful of RCL's upside risks. To me, there is very little fundamental reason why RCL's income should outperform over the coming twelve months, but Q3 may still be better than expected, giving it some short-term upside potential. Further, it is a volatile stock historically popular among retail investors and can push stocks well outside of their fundamental value. Still, at its current elevated enterprise value and in light of economic trends, I firmly believe RCL's downside is much more significant than its upside.

Medical Properties Trust: Capturing Value Or Catching A Falling Knife?,"Since early 2022, there has been an increased chatter around Medical Properties Trust  and its prospects to deliver solid returns for REIT investors. It is a combination of many unpleasant factors that have contributedYet, the overarching driver of why MPW has been so an interesting case is its defensive fundamentals  i.e., business model  on the one hand and on the other the idiosyncratic struggles, which impose significant downward pressure on the MPW's market cap level.Interestingly, starting from 2022 there has not been a meaningful period in which the Stock assumed an upward momentum or even traded sideways. Instead, it has gone from one decline to another decline providing value investors with a reason to consider opening a position.Investors, who previously thoughtA while ago, I  on MPW stating that the talks around potential dividend cut overshadow the underlying value. Since then, the dividend cut took place and the market cap continued to plummet.My thesis points revolved around the underlying resiliency of MPW's operations. For example, almost full occupancy, positive NOI, and successful transactions on the asset monetization front.I also argued that the leverage, while relatively high from the capital structure perspective, looking at the ICR level, the debt coverage remained very solid. In other words, my firm opinion was that MPW will eventually manage to reduce its leverage and successfully roll over the near-term maturities.This in combination with depressed multiples rendered the overall investment case interesting.Yet, at the same time, I pinpointed the potential downside risks stemming from continued uncertainty on the operator front. Unfortunately, this has materialized and sent the stock price 30  below the level when my article was circulated.However, now that MPW is down 65  since the first struggles began  i.e., tenant default risks , value investors  including me  are left with no choice but to revisit the thesis once again.I am fully aware that the same logic was prevalent in earlier periods as well, but on a 3-month basis, the price decline is just too steep to ignore.On top of that since the publication of my article, we have received a couple of positive updates on the Steward and Prospect tenant situation as well as new data points associated with asset divestitures.At the same time, MPW has approached a deep value territory with even the forward-looking P FFO trading at 3.2x.No matter which valuation metric you look at, MPW is cheap both on absolute and relative terms.Yet, the devil lies in the details, and prudent value investors have to be very careful to avoid making a  long  decision, where the odds are stacked against normalization in the underlying cash flow generation  or fundamentals .In my opinion, one of the main reasons why the multiples are so depressed across the board is that the market has not yet fully calibrated the long-term path of MPW's cash flows. In other words, there is a significant risk premium attached to MPW because of the inherent uncertainty about its tenants, refinancings, and the effects of the  higher for longer  scenario.For me, it is clear that MPW will not become the next A-rated REIT that is associated with stability and dividend predictability for long-term investors.However, I am interested in getting compensated for the elevated risk premium and reallocating once the situation normalizes  i.e., risk premium contracts  and multiples have bounced back to a more reasonable levels.In my view, for this to happen MPW has to deliver on two aspectsOne of the main drivers behind the massive decline in MPW's stock price is the uncertainty around MPW's ability to pay off its debt burden, which going into the new era of  higher for longer  scenario was not that optimal, especially if compared to the sector peers.As of now, MPW has a net debt to adjusted EBITDAre of 6.8x. These days everything that is above 5x could be deemed suboptimal, implying an elevated exposure to financial risk. In MPW's case given the uncertainty around its leases and high cost of debt, being on the aggressive end with the leverage is not great.Currently, the weighted average cost of financing that is embedded in MPW's books is 3.9  - clearly below the market terms. This is so because of the debt structure, where 84  is based on fixed rate financing. The remaining 14  have already percolated through the system and brought the financial rate up.The key question now is how long MPW can ride with these rates of financing and when the first major debt rollovers could take place that will inevitably render a negative impact on the incremental cash flow level. This is critical considering the current YTM levels of MPW's outstanding bonds that are revolving around . Namely, we are talking about  10 - 12  of negative spread that could eventually feed into MPW's current cash flows via the repricing of its indebted balance sheet.As of Q2, 2023, MPW had    2.4 billion of maturing debt by 2026, or  21  of the total debt portfolio. It is critically important to pay careful attention to 2023, 2024, and 2025 maturities given the market's consensus estimates on the future Fed Fund's rate, which indicate that by 2026 we could be converging back to  3  level.In other words, avoiding debt repricings until we arrive at more friendly interest rate levels is important for all corporates, but especially for those who are finding themselves in an already difficult financial position - like MPW.At first glance,    2.4 billion seems a lot. Yet, let me explain why MPW could do just fine with the forthcoming debt maturities., it has recently made a couple of lucrative exits from foreign markets that have injected well-needed liquidity into the MPW books.  divestitures were of the Australian facilities that were sold to HMC Capital at a 5.7  cash cap rate for  305 million. As a result of this, MPW now holds  950 million of pure liquidity that could be channeled towards successful debt refinancing., roughly only    1 billion of all debt maturities until 2025 are based on fixed rate financing. What this means is that MPW has the luxury to fully retire these borrowings, thereby avoiding an unfavourable rate of change in the interest rate component. The remaining    1.4 billion is already subject to SOFR, which at the extension of the rollover date would not add that much of incremental financing cost  the risk premium might be higher, but it is peanuts compared to the repricing of below 3.9  yielding debt ., when thinking of forthcoming debt maturities we have to factor in extra tailwinds that are associated with the relatively recent dividend cut. Back in August 21, MPW decreased its quarterly dividend from  0.29 per share to  0.15 per share. This has now brought the AFFO payout to 60  level.Unfortunately, we cannot get the AFFO or NOI number that is directly associated with the recently sold Australian facilities, but one thing is for sure - these are not material numbers. Based on the , we can isolate this exposure via the registered revenues per each state and or country level. In the end of 2022, the Australian market accounted for roughly 4  of the total revenues and a bit less than that on the total asset level. Now, after the successful disposal, MPW is left with around 1.6  exposure towards the Australian market. Hence, when making any estimates on the prospective AFFO figures, there is absolutely no reason to significantly revise downward the Q2, 2023 AFFO result.So, assuming a 5  drop in the AFFO due to the recent divestitures and keeping the remaining data constant  as there is also no reason to inflate the financing costs due to the reasons described above , we get    842 million in the annual AFFO. Thanks to the dividend cut, MPW is able to retain around  335 million that could be used for gradually deleveraging the balance sheet.Assuming that there are no major negative shocks in the MPW's operations and taking into account the existing liquidity, by 2026 MPW is set to generate an additional    750 million of incremental liquidity on top of the currently available    950 million - totalling to    1.7 billion.Again, this is more than enough to not only successfully refinance, but also to retire a major portion of these borrowings that kick in from 2023 - 2025.Granted, the risk beyond 2025 remains as in 2026 and 2027, MPW will have to refinance 42  of the currently outstanding debt. From these,  2 billion is currently fixed and thus with the potential to inflict notable damage from higher cost of financing when refinanced.Now, let's take a rather pessimistic view and assume that MPW will not be able to partially pay off this and that it will have to roll over the entire amount with an additional spread of 10  in the cost of financing  to match the current YMT level .This would result in an annual AFFO reduction of    200 million. It would wipe out a significant chunk of the currently retained AFFO indeed, but it would still leave MPW with an AFFO coverage of less than 100   closer to 90 .Even in such a pessimistic scenario, MPW's dividend is covered., while mathematically this works, there are some implicit risk factors that could make it difficult to execute refinancings. For example, some banks and or institutional investors could decide to not give new loans at the required amount, thus forcing MPW to tap into more expensive financing sources such as private credit. There could be also a risk stemming from more aggressive covenants, which would limit MPW's capital allocation tactics. Plus, if the 2026 and 2027 maturities are fully repriced at yields above 10 , the remaining cash flows would be very small to weather any incremental struggle on the operations or leasing front.So, my assumption is that MPW will divest some additional facilities to bring down the leverage and make the debt refinancings in 2026-2027 period less painful. Granted, further divestitures will reduce the underlying AFFO, but considering the embedded cash cap rates at most likely around 6 - 8   based on the recent transactions  and the cost of debt levels at 12 - 15 , it is more than a smart thing to do.Again, a smaller base of assets will indeed hurt the cash generation, but as we can see with the Australian property case, even a tiny share of a portfolio that is divested renders a significant benefit to MPW's liquidity, where the reduced debt pressure outweighs the foregone AFFO.In fact, we can confirm this by looking at the recognized gains from the recent transactions, which indicate that the property book values reflected in the balance sheet are considerably below the fair value levels at which the properties could be sold.All in all, I am not worried about MPW's financial risk.The second component that is necessary to reduce the elevated risk premium in the Company is the stability on the top-line front. Currently, there is a lot of uncertainty around MPW's ability to collect all of the stipulated leases.Optically, the lease structure is very robust and I would argue that it is one of the greatest in the industry. No meaningful lease maturities kick in over the next 10-year period. This, theoretically, provides MPW with the necessary cash flow visibility to plan for either accretive M A or organic growth projects. It also helps with the debt management aspect, where the lease cash flows could be aligned with the debt service payments.Moreover, the average financial health of MPW's tenants looks solid.The EBITDARM rent coverage above 2.4x could be commonly deemed satisfactory. In fact, it has not been much higher even in the pre-pandemic period.So, on average, MPW's tenant and lease profile is solid.Yet, the devil lies in the details, and more specifically in two tenantsIn a nutshell, MPW carries an elevated risk exposure towards two tenants, which together constitute around 45  of the total lease payments. While Steward's case seems to be de-risked at this moment, the situation around Prospect remains uncertain.Unfortunately, we lack details to make any judgment as to what would happen in case the deal does not go through. Based on the publicly available information, the odds are in favour of the deal actually taking place, which then, in turn, would definitely stabilize the lease collection process.Yet, at the same time, we do not have sufficient details about Prospect's financial position post-transaction which makes the cash flow forecasting extremely difficult  considering the 20  share of the total leases .Currently, MPW trades at extremely depressed valuation levels, where it yields   12  despite the recent dividend cut and the AFFO payout ratio of 60 . It is clearly evident that the market is attaching a huge risk premium to the Company.In my opinion, there are two major reasons for that.First is the debt problem, where MPW's debt trades at 13 - 15  YTM level, which in the context of a 3.9  cost of financing that is embedded in the books and significant near-term maturities could imply surging interest expense component. This risk, however, is greatly mitigated by MPW considering the recent asset divestitures at very attractive cash cap rates, close to  1 billion liquidity, dividend cut, and future AFFO generation.Second is the struggles on the lease collection front. While I would assume that the situation with Steward is somewhat fine, the case with Prospect Medical Holdings is far from acceptable. Namely, we do not have any data or information that would warrant a justified decision-making around the future lease payments stemming from Prospect  which accounts for  20  of the total leases . Looking at the publicly available information, there is a bias towards a more positive outcome, but even in such a case, we would still lack details about Prospect's financial health.If the Prospect's situation normalizes, investors would be able to capture a significant value as the tenant risk decreases and as the market finally recognizes that MPW's debt problem is totally manageable.If MPW experiences further struggles with the lease payments, the tenant problem would transform into a true debt  refinancing  problem and, ultimately, send the stock price even lower.In my humble opinion, until we do not receive additional details pertaining to Prospect's deal, there is not sufficient ground to make either a short or long call. Yet, if I had to make a bet, I would open a tiny long position in MPW and treat it as a call option  i.e., writing off the paid premium in case the lease situation goes south, and capturing a huge payoff if the situation stabilizes .

Better High Yield Buy: Enbridge Stock Or Kinder Morgan Stock,"Enbridge  and Kinder Morgan  have both generated consistent, albeit slow, dividend growth, over the past three years with mediocre total return performance alongside it that has significantly lagged that of the broader midstream sector That being said, thanks in large part to a disastrous dividend cut a number of years ago, KMI has dramatically underperformed ENB and even AMLP over the long-termIn this article, we compare ENB and KMI side by side and offer our take on which one is a better buy right now.ENB's boasts large midstream infrastructure business is well-diversified across numerous segments of the midstream space, including liquid pipelines, gas transmission and distribution, and a growing renewable power generation portfolio. ENB also recently made a  14 billionIn addition to having North America's largest natural gas utility, it owns one of the longest natural gas transmission pipeline networks in the United States, the largest natural gas distribution business in North America, and the longest crude oil pipeline network.As a result of its emphasis on utilities, the majority of its pro-forma EBITDA after the closing of the Dominion Energy deal will come from regulated assets and virtually all of its remaining EBITDA will come from long-term take-or-pay contracts and nearly all of its counterparties are investment grade. As a result, it enjoys exceptional stability of cash flows, regardless of the macroeconomic and energy industry conditions are at any given time. As a result, it boasts a very impressive 28-year dividend growth streak, making it arguably the industry's most reliable dividend growth stock.While KMI is not as large as ENB and does not have nearly the same dividend growth track record, it still owns very high-quality assets. It is primarily a major natural gas infrastructure player, with 62  of its EBITDA coming from assets that serve that segment. It benefits from economies of scale and strategically located assets that make it an indispensable player in the North American energy industry, including North America's largest CO2 transport capacity with  1,500 miles of CO2 pipelines, largest independent terminal operations with 140 terminals and 16 Jones Act vessels, largest natural gas transmission network with  70,000 miles of pipelines that provides  15  of U.S. natural gas storage and transports  40  of the United States' natural gas production, and largest independent refined products transportation network with  10,000 miles of refined products and crude pipelines. Furthermore, it is investing in growing its energy transition business, with a particularly strong focus on RNG production capacity.Like ENB, it has a very stable cash flow profile with 93  of its EBITDA stemming from long-term commodity price resistant contracts. While it does not have the regulated utility exposure that ENB enjoys, it still has ample cash flow stability in the face of wild swings in energy prices and shifting macroeconomic conditions.ENB has one of the highest credit ratings in the midstream segment with a BBB  rating from S P. It can command this higher credit rating despite having much higher leverage on its balance sheet than many of its lower rated peers do because of its extremely high-quality cash flow profile with substantial utility exposure, little to no commodity price exposure, and counterparties that are almost all investment grade. One of the beauties of ENB's balance sheet is that it has a large amount of its debt at fixed interest rates and not maturing for many decades  including well into the second half of the 21st century . This gives it a pretty predictable cost of debt for many years to come, further enhancing its distributable cash flow stability.KMI, meanwhile, comes in just a tiny bit behind ENB with its BBB credit rating and has a fairly low leverage ratio of 4.1x with expectations of finishing this year with a 4.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. Given that their long-term target is 4.5x, they have substantial flexibility to buy back stock and invest in growth projects opportunistically.Both businesses generate a lot of cash flow above and beyond their dividends, enabling them to fund much - if not all - of their growth capex with retained cash flow and lean only on debt markets when debt comes due for refinancing or when making a large acquisition.ENB's dividend growth rate is expected to come in between 3-5  annually for the foreseeable future. Prior to the announcement of the Dominion Energy acquisition, analysts forecast a 3.1  CAGR for ENB's dividend through 2027. That said, ENB's CEO thinks that its acquisition of the Dominion utilities would further enhance ENB's ability to grow its dividend over time in addition to enhancing its earnings quality. Overall, we think that ENB will likely grow its dividend at a 3-4  CAGR for years to come. KMI, meanwhile, has opted for a slow dividend growth rate as it has been focused on deleveraging, investing in an impressive array of new projects, and buying back stock when opportunistic to do so. This should improve somewhat moving forward, as growth CapEx should decline a little bit and the company's leverage has reached a very satisfactory level. That said, analysts don't think it will grow much more than at a 3  CAGR through 2027, and thus far KMI has not given investors any reason to think it will grow faster than that.KMI is clearly cheaper than ENB on both an EV EBITDA and P DCF basis. KMI's current EV EBITDA stands at an 11.2  discount to its five-year average EV EBITDA while ENB's current EV EBITDA stands at a 6.5  discount to its five-year average EV EBITDA.That said, ENB does offer an 80-basis point higher dividend yield than KMI does, so income investors may prefer the higher yield even if it comes at a more costly valuation for the underlying cash flows.Both ENB and KMI are high quality infrastructure businesses that have strong counterparties, very low short-term commodity price cash flow exposure, rock solid investment grade balance sheets, a clear path to growing their dividends for years to come, attractive current dividend yields, and discounted valuations relative to their historical averages.That said, ENB's cash flow profile is undoubtedly higher quality given its greater exposure to regulated earnings and investment grade counterparties and its current dividend yield plus growth profile plus dividend growth track record make it appear to be a superior dividend stock. On the other hand, KMI's balance sheet is arguably better than ENB's despite its lower credit rating given that its leverage ratio is quite a bit lower than ENB's. Moreover, its valuation is quite a bit cheaper than ENB's and it is retaining significantly more cash flow which it is using to buy back stock and invest in attractive growth projects.ENB is also a 1099 issuing Canadian company  with related tax circumstances  that declares its dividends in Canadian Dollars whereas KMI is a 1099 issuing American company  with related tax circumstances  that declares its dividends in U.S. Dollars, so investors should keep that in mind before investing.We like both and rate both as very attractive, low risk Buys right now and think that dividend focused investors who don't mind owning a Canadian stock would probably like ENB more, whereas value investors and or investors who prefer owning an American company would probably like KMI more.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Superior Industries: Mill Road Keeps Buying, Should You?","Superior Industries  is an Original Equipment Manufacturer  OEM  producing aluminum wheels for vehicles in North America and Europe. The company's balance sheet is complex, and the business has suffered from leverage issues as well as low auto productionSuperior was founded in 1957 but their leverage problem is new. From 2002-2016, Superior had no net debt, but they levered up in 2017 to gain European exposure throughMost production takes place in Mexico and Poland, with limited operations in Germany. Superior believes their footprint is well-situated to take advantage of . They own their manufacturing locations and should be able to tap these for liquidity via sale-leasebacks if traditional financing becomes too expensive for their business. If land and buildings were sold near their book cost of  150m, and leased back at 8-10  annually, Superior would retain more flexibility to deal with maturities. Based on commentary , some rationalization in Europe is likely incomingSuperior has about 27m shares outstanding, which currently trade at  3.50 share - roughly a  100m market capitalization. Superior also carries a  399m term loan,  217m of senior notes  236m   6 30 23 , and  5m other debt against  181m of cash for  458m net debt. Lastly, they have preferred stock, convertible at  28 share with an initial value of  150m, redeemable after September 2025 for  300m in cash or a maximum of 5.3m shares.If we value the preferred at the full  300m, the total Enterprise Value  EV  is  100m    458m  300m    858m, which is what it would take to buy the full company today before any equity premium and not giving them any credit for significant owned real estate.Superior is guiding to a midpoint of  180m Adjusted EBITDA  4.8x EV EBITDA ,  120m of cash from operations in 2022 and  65m of CapEx. Subtracting another  14m for preferred dividends, 2023 free cash flow to equity should be  41m at the midpoint, about a 40  yield to common shareholders and unleveraged yield is almost 15 . Given current auto supply is not exactly at all-time highs, these metrics are not very demanding on what are hopefully depressed earnings. This guidance also suggests they will reverse the negative FCF YTD, due to some fluctuations in aluminum payables  per Q2 call .I dislike making macro calls, I.e., predicting the direction of automobile manufacturing. My goal here is to show that I think the most likely direction for demand for Superior's products is up.There is a relative lack of vehicles in the US currently, and I expect the result of this to be demand for wheels to remain steady or increase.  also remain far below pre-covid levels. If new vehicles are prohibitively expensive, then hopefully this will increase aftermarket demand  though it is only  6  of Superior's business . GM, Ford, and VW represented  respectively, making their production a key driver for Superior investors.There have been looming talks of a , which could certainly harm Superior's main customers.Auto suppliers are generally not great businesses, and I wouldn't be surprised if Superior trades near 5x EBITDA going forward, but there is upside to the stock if it maintains the current multiple.If FY24 EBITDA can hit  200m with European restructuring and no additional growth, and the stock trades at 4.5x, the resulting  900m EV would only be a  42m accretion to the current EV but would have the tailwind of reduced leverage from cash generated by the business, and all that accretion goes to the equity. Between debt paydown and EBITDA growth, the current share price could easily double to  7 in this scenario.If we advance to FY25, when the 6  senior notes will be due and the preferred stock will be callable, Superior appears on track to pay the notes off in full or refinance a portion. Interestingly, in this scenario, Superior may be able to settle the preferred using only the 5.3m shares it is redeemable for.AssumptionsIn FY19, Superior was able to sell about 19m wheels against 35m vehicles produced in Europe and North America, earning EBITDA of almost  9 wheel. In FY22, earnings had improved such that 15m wheels earned about  12.50 wheel with vehicle production down about 10  from FY19. If we assume Superior can recover to 2019 production levels, but maintain their better earnings per wheel  12.50- 15 wheel , FY25 EBITDA could be  250-300m. I would expect with higher factory utilization, margins would increase to the top of this range, but the amount of production Superior can recover remains to be seen.It seems possible the stock could trade at 7x EBITDA if there is a clear path to eliminating the preferred overhang and leverage is back below 2x EBITDA. Therefore, 7   300m    2.1B EV, less  400m debt plus  150m of cash generated is  1.85B valuation 32.5m shares after conversion    57 share. This is a blue-sky scenario, but maybe not as outlandish as you would expect for a stock trading under  4 today. This kind of outcome could also be part of some kind compromise with TPG to remove the overhang sooner.If I'm going to suggest a stock has this much potential upside, there must be some risks.Superior's acquisition of UNIWHEELS in 2017 led to significant growth in revenues and EBITDA, but the complexity of its capital structure, including the redeemable preferred stock deal, presents a hurdle to overcome before the 2025 debt and convertible preferred stock maturities. This provides opportunities for the company to unlock value for its shareholders as maturities approach. Monitoring the evolving automobile landscape will be essential for potential investors. Tailwinds to the industry may be extremely favorable for Superior shareholders, and Mill Road is seizing the moment.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Why You Should Buy A Historically Expensive Energy Transfer,"  continues to see its share price trend up to more than  40 billion in market cap. The company has now almost completely recovered to its pre-COVID-19 prices, as the company was sweptThe company's developments have enabled it to narrow its positioning and increase shareholder returns.The company has put Frac 8 into service and its total fractionation capacity is now more than 1.1 million barrels   day. The record volumes there are supported by the company's midstream production also hitting record volumes, along with the company's NGL business. The company is continuing to look for incremental ways to improve its business and production.TheLong term, the company continues to plan to spend heavily on growth capital at  2.5 billion annualized. We'd like to see the company cut its growth capital to reduce its debt to a 3.0x - 3.5x ratio that we think is more sustainable to long-term shareholder returns.The below chart provides an example of the company's capital strategy.The company's expectation is  7.5 billion in distributable cash flow. From this, the company expects  2-3 billion to be growth capital.  4 billion will go to distributions targeted at a 4  growth rate. The company's current yield on cost is almost 9 , and 4  growth there is steady and impressive. After all, this is the company has  0.5-1.5 billion leftover.That's dependent on its capital expenditures. Given the company's  43 billion market cap, that means after dividends, it has roughly 4  in additional cash flow. At its dividend yield, we'd like to see that cash flow go to share buybacks, saving on the dividend expenses.The company has continued to focus on growing its asset base, and it has an impressive and networked portfolio of assets.The company's assets and their integration are clearly visible above. Especially in the South of the country, the country's energy heartland, is where the company dominates. The company's continued acquisitions tend to be bolt-on acquisitions for its existing asset portfolio, letting it integrate well with the company's existing portfolio and save substantial money.This integrated asset portfolio is incredibly important, and its importance to the nation's energy demand will continue to enable it to provide strong returns for decades to come.Energy Transfer has a strong history of consolidation, the acquisition is its second of 2023.The company closed the Lotus Midstream acquisition. The Crestwood acquisition is at  8  of its enterprise value. That's one of the larger acquisitions for the company in a number of years. The company's  7.1 billion acquisition involves a substantial amount of assumed debt, but still involves 219 million in freshly issued common units.The company assumes synergies of  40 million   year. That represents a 13  cost cut from operating   corporate expenses, expected to be recognized in 2025 . The transaction is expected to close at the end of the year. The synergies are reasonable, and given Crestwood's debt load, interest costs might even go down for the company.However, it's still a relatively expensive acquisition for the assets.Energy Transfer has worked to improve its portfolio substantially, and continues to have strong financial strength.The company has reduced its growth capital from  4.9 billion to  2 billion. It doesn't expect any future reductions, long-term growth capital is expected to be in the  2-3 billion range. The company's adjusted EBITDA has grown at the same time, the company's narrowed guidance of roughly  13.2-3 billion. From this, the company has  8 billion in discounted cash flow, or DCF, impacted by interest rates.The company's annualized interest expenditures are  2.5 billion. It's at a  5  yield on cost for its debt, well below prevailing interest rates. That could have a  1.5 billion impact on its interest payments and associated free cash flow, or FCF, dependent on what rate it's forced to refinance at.The largest risk to our thesis is the long-term demand for the company's assets. The company moves millions of barrels   day of high demand assets. However, that demand equation is changing. Renewables are spreading, and changing the equation. The company's assets will be essential for 20 30 years, but we're not sure how much longer. The company is doing nothing to diversify.Unfortunately, the nature of change is that it tends to be slow at first and then hits you like a wall all at once.Energy Transfer has an impressive portfolio of assets. The company has a market capitalization just a hair over  40 billion, and a strong dividend of roughly 9 . At the same time, it's seen its debt load improve along with its credit rating. The company has continued to make aggressive acquisitions to expand its footprint, expanding its debt load.The concern with the company is its debt load especially in a rising interest rate environment. However, the company is continuing to invest and it continues to grow. Over the next decades, Energy Transfer LP has the ability to provide shareholders with incredibly strong returns, even at its current rates, making it a valuable investment.The Retirement Forum provides actionable ideals, a high-yield safe retirement portfolio, and macroeconomic outlooks, all to help you maximize your capital and your income.

"Energy Transfer: Some Compelling Narratives, But Not A Compelling Buy","The stock of Energy Transfer LP , an operator of a vast and diversified pool of energy assets, has a number of sub-plots working for and against it. In this article, we ll highlight two important sub-plots, and then closeEnergy Transfer s EBITDA comes from 8 different sources, but the segment we re most enthused by is the segment that focuses on the transportation of NGL  Natural Gas Liquids  and Refined Products. Last year, it was the second largest contributor to annual group EBITDA, but this year  as of H1  it has become the top contributor, accounting for of ET s total EBITDA.In H1, this segment saw impressive EBITDA YoY growth ofSecondly, the surge in the export of ethane propane, and other NGLs from America should not be underestimated. Domestic propane inventories may be at record highs, but what s key to note is that close to of this gets exported. This year we ve seen a few producers resort to production cuts, and that too has limited the supply of propane inventories in the international market  besides being a byproduct of natural gas production, propane is also sourced during crude oil refining . As a result, US propane exports have gone through the roof  see image  and could stay elevated all through this year.The trend of ethane exports is another shining light and should reflect well on this division s numbers. Note that in H1, ethane exports out of the country averaged barrels a day, translating to solid growth of 22 , but as recently as September, ethane exports were hitting levels of over barrels a day. We don t believe this is just short-term euphoria either  the EIA believes the country could continue to export at this 500k rate through the end of FY24.Readers would also be interested to know that ET management recently stated that they are in discussions to lock in close to of the aggregate ethane volumes that will come into the system over the next 3-4 years.It's also rather well known that ET is relatively well insulated from the capricious nature of commodity prices, as its contracts are predominantly long-term and fee-based, but what s also key is the dominance of take-or-pay transportation contracts, particularly in this segment. Currently, ET is benefitting from some very strong volumes, but even if volumes were to slow for some reason  which is not the base case , these contracts demand that payments be made to ET regardless of whether a fixed volume is transported.To flourish and build scale in this business, management needs to exercise good judgment with capital and leverage, and even though the jury is still out, it's fair to say that things are better than where they were a few years back.At the start of last year, Energy Transfer had intended to only deploy  1.575bn- 1.8bn by way of growth CAPEX, but primarily on account of the Lotus Midstream acquisition this year, further investments will also be made there, pushing up the overall figure. All in all, growth CAPEX for the year will likely come in within a higher range of , and the long-term plan is for the company to push the CAPEX runrate closer to  3bn p.a.We understand that this likely ramp-up in CAPEX won't please all stakeholders of ET, but we feel investors should be less skeptical in questioning the capital allocation and financing decisions of the management, particularly in light of some of the improvements engendered in recent years.Firstly, we bring to attention the manner in which ET has been financing its growing asset base in recent years. A couple of years back, around 53  of the asset base was being financed by debt  however, this has consistently crept down since then and currently stands at around 45 .It also helps that ET's assets are now generating some useful FCF  which in turn puts less pressure on the need for external funds , something it was barely managing to do during the pre-pandemic era.Admittedly ET still has a hefty sum of  of total debt on its balance sheet, and some of you may be wondering how best placed the company looks in a higher interest rate environment, but do note that as of H1-23, only 10  of its total debt consisted of floating rate debt.Note that as a function of EBITDA, ET s target debt level range is , and hitting the lower end of that range, is something they intend to do very soon. If that happens, investors have another added reason to feel more encouraged as you could see the company recommence its unit buyback activities, something which has gone dormant since. For context note that the company still has around  880m of funds that could be authorized towards this endeavor.Even though we can find plenty of reasons to appreciate the well-rounded business of Energy Transfer, we are not necessarily convinced that this is the right time to kickstart a long position in the stock per se. Here s why.Let s first look at ET s long-term price imprints on the monthly chart. Since dropping to the pandemic lows of sub  4, the stock has done well to make up lost ground by trending up in the shape of a rising wedge pattern. However, the issue with a rising wedge pattern is that it typically signs the increasing possibility of a after an uptrend.Now, an inverted V-shaped reversal in the price action may not necessarily come to fruition, but we do think the possibility of sideways movement has increased, rather than another strong move higher.We say this because firstly, the share has not resorted to any major pullbacks since the start of 2022, rather there s just been a pause for a brief while followed by another upward leg. Secondly, also consider that the stock has now revisited the old congestion zone which coalesced from Q2-2016 until Q3-2019. During this period ET had just chopped around within this zone lacking direction  don t be surprised to see the stock take another breather here.Then, prima facie, relative to most other alternatives a  9  yield is something to behold, but this should also be contextualized relative to what unitholders have typically received. Even though the recent distribution growth came in at an impressive rate of YoY, the uptrend in the stock has been such, that the current distribution yield falls short of the 4-year average by around.You also want to be getting into a stock when forward valuations are well below the long-term average, but with ET that is quite the opposite. Currently, the stock is priced at a forward EV EBITDA of 7.4x, close to the peak of its 5-year valuation range, and 8  pricier than its 5-year average.We wouldn t be averse to paying this premium if the degree of EBITDA growth over the next few years was strong enough, but data from YCharts show that EBITDA CAGR through FY25 will come in at an unremarkable pace of a little over 2 .Gauging insider sentiment towards a stock across different periods can also sometimes provide slight insight into what management thinks about the share s current valuation. Well, in that regard, what we can see is that aggregate discretionary purchasing in Sep had come off in a big way from levels seen in August, and in the current month, there have been no purchases whatsoever.The other thing to note is that even though ET primarily appeals to the retail cohort, there s also ample participation from the institutional segment  40 , the guys with deep pockets, who often drive big moves in the stock.If one looks at the size of the candles all through this year, one won't find too many large-bodied candles, implying the lack of institutional participation, and that's further reiterated by the data which shows that they haven't really participated in the rally this year, and have not shown any inclination to add to their positions all through this year. In fact, on a YTD basis, the net shares owned by institutions are down by over 15 . Granted, these guys don't always get things right, but yet still, when the institutional positioning is moving one way and the price is moving another way, one should perhaps pause and think twice.Finally, also consider that ET is unlikely to benefit from any rotational interest in the energy infrastructure MLP space. Note that the relative strength ratio of ET as a function of AMLP is currently trading well above the mid-point of its 7-year range, and is also not too far from hitting levels from where the ratio has previously pivoted.

"United down 4% post market as Israel, fuel weigh on Q4 guidance","United Airlines NASDAQUAL is down  4 in after-hours trading Tuesday despite beating on both lines in its Q3 earnings after its Q4 EPS guidance came in below Street estimates.The carrier sees Q4 adjusted EPS of  1.80 per share if its ban on flights to Tel Aviv only lasts through the end of October. However, if it is extended to the end of December, it is  1.50 per share. Consensus is  2.15. The ban on Israel flights is also seen impacting Q4 capacity and operating revenue. Assuming flights resume after the end of the month, Q4 capacity is expected to increase  15.5  year over year. With the same assumption, operating revenue is projected to increase  10.5  YoY.If the flights don't restart until the end of December, those figures are, respectively, 14  and off 9 .United UAL also noted that rising jet fuel prices would also weigh on Q4 results.",28,2023-10-17T16:55:35.000-04:00

Icahn: The Hunt For The Billion-Dollar Triumph,"Concerning dividends, the dynamics are more complex than meets the eye. Icahn's investments fall into two main groups  The widely-discussed equity investments and the wholly-owned subsidiaries. Each group has unique capex and cash flow needs.For instance, Icahn's equity investment strategy is inherently lumpy, requiring significant capital outlays, activism, andMoreover, each sub-segment performs uniquely at a different stage of the business lifecycle. For example, the Energy Segment is flourishing, while the automotive is not. Still, as a unit, these operating segments are generating positive cash flows, as shown below.Icahn's commitment to dividends is clear. He holds himself at the same bar as he does from the companies in his portfolio when it comes to returning capital to shareholders. He has a grounded belief that, over time, the volatile nature of cash flows inherent in his activist strategy will average out to a net positive. This confidence has sometimes led him to borrow funds to sustain dividends, believing in a long-term favorable outcome. While some might argue that he's pushed the envelope, the annual cash distribution to public shareholders currently stands at around  250 million. This seems sustainable, especially considering the various operational levers he can pull. Hence, I remain convinced that IEP will maintain its dividend and give a Buy rating.As of the latest SEC filings, IEP holds  4.9 billion in a concentrated portfolio  mostly equity  and  3.4 billion in short positions  also mostly equity , bringing the total market exposure to  8.3 billion.There is little potential for extraordinary returns from the short positions, given that the maximum return is capped at 100 , and in practice, earnings are often much less. For this reason, I won't elaborate much on IEP's short positions except that they are down significantly as a proportion of total investment after peaking in 2022. Another point is that half of the short position is in the Energy Sector. Thus, IEP is hedging its CVR Energy  exposure.Moving on to IEP's long equity portfolio, we see that the top five investments constitute most of the portfolio. Below is a table showing how these holdings faired in Q3.Crown Holdings is a leading supplier in the aluminum beverage can industry. The firm has ambitious growth plans, as evident in its  1 billion capex program.The company has embarked on significant restructuring efforts under the influence of Carl Icahn's maneuvers. Earlier this year, SWX sold MountainWest, one year after it bought it from Dominion, in the wake of a  with IEP.SWX is also putting the final touches onThis spinoff will make SWX smaller. It is yet to be seen if the two companies will be worth more separately than together.After IEP exits Xerox, the question is  where will the approximately half a billion in cash be reinvested  Icahn will either amplify his stakes in the current portfolio, enhance his influence over management, or potentially introduce a new investment to the mix. Certainly, these are exciting times for IEP and its shareholders.For many investors, the question isn't just about high returns but also the sustainability of dividends. The recent dividend cut by IEP may offer an insight into the issue.Dividend safety traditionally hinges on two elementsCarl Icahn has shown a firm commitment to delivering dividends. He's consistently pressured the companies he invests in to return capital to shareholders. He is holding himself to the same bar, a commitment only tested recently when IEP  its dividend payout in August.The pressing question is  Can IEP maintain the quarterly dividend  which now stands at  1 per share  If Carl Icahn continues to accept his dividends in shares rather than cash, the firm would only need to distribute cash for about 15  of shares. This translates to roughly  236 million annually in dividends. With assets worth  22 billion, this seems feasible.The ideal metric to assess the capacity for sustaining dividends is positive GAAP net income, often accompanied by positive operating cash flow and, with good management, a long-run positive net operating cash flow.Over the past decadeThe energy segment, particularly CVR, requires closer examination. It is the engine of IEP's commercial segment, contributing the largest share of earnings.Earnings in this segment are intrinsically linked to the fluctuations in oil prices, making them inherently volatile. Nevertheless, this segment has mostly met expectations after Icahn's initial capex inflow, exhibiting intermittent but cumulatively positive FCF. If the current trajectory persists, IEP is on course to recoup its substantial investments made between 2013 and 2015. The graph below illustrates the FCF of IEP's Energy segment, with positive cash flows highlighted in green.My main concern is the businesses' viability under Icahn's leadership. CVR requires consistent care, given the wear and tear inherent in the petroleum refining and fertilizer business. Icahn's aggressive value extraction strategy is evident in the low capex figures compared to depreciation. Evidence of this can be seen in the recurring safety issues, most recently this year beingOne subsidiary is now  as a repeated safety violator by state regulators. These fatalities and injuries mirror a lack of a robust ESG framework, significantly limiting IEP's appeal as an investment.However, the suitability of the NAV as a proxy to share price is blurred, considering the complex dividend dynamics of IEP.Whether IEP can pay Icahn's dividend in cash is irrelevant, given his tried and tested commitment to return capital to the 'minority partners' holding the remaining units shares he doesn't own. With a 21  cash dividend yield to public shareholders, IEP's publicly-traded shares appear undervalued.Carl Icahn and his firm, IEP, have historically navigated Wall Street with impressive success. However, the ride has not always been smooth lately, sparking some impatience among investors, even those accustomed to the inherently long-term and unpredictable nature of the Icahn Strategy, characterized by lumpy returns. A multi-billion dollar win seems vital now to restore dwindling confidence.Sifting through IEP's five major equity investments, it is evident that several are tactically pivoting in ways that could potentially cultivate growth. Still, whether they'll turn into the multi-baggers the company is yet to be seen.Regarding dividends, I believe that IEP has many levers to sustain dividends. Carl Icahn has demonstrated commitment to sustaining dividend, and with the recent distribution cut, it has become much easier to do so.No one knows the future, but what is certain is a lot happening right now on the IEP front, especially with the exit of Xerox, the dividend cuts, and price declines. I believe we have reached peak pessimism, with share price trading at an attractive risk reward profile.With a 21.5  forward dividend yield, investors can recoup their initial capital in just five years solely from dividends while still holding only their shares.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Better High Yield Buy: Energy Transfer Or MPLX,"  and   are both high-yield BBB-rated midstream infrastructure businesses. Many investors prefer MPLX given that its distribution growth track record is much more consistent than ET's. Note that MPLX's large jump andThat said, ET has significantly outperformed MPLX in the nearly three years since we added it to our portfolioIn this article, we compare them side by side and offer our take on which is the best buy right now.MPLX owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure andMPLX's assets are typically strategically located within or close to Marathon Petroleum refineries and typically serve as the sole providers for the refinery's specific needs, creating economic barriers to entry for competitors. Moreover, MPLX's long-term 5-10-year contracts with minimum volume commitments for each Marathon asset give it a very stable cash flow profile, regardless of macro conditions in the energy industry and the broader economy.ET, meanwhile, owns and operates an extensive network of natural gas transportation pipelines, including interstate natural gas pipelines, storage facilities, and gathering and processing assets in multiple states. ET also sells natural gas to various customers, including utilities, power plants, and industrial users. Additionally, the company is involved in crude oil transportation, terminalling, and marketing activities, as well as the distribution of petroleum products such as gasoline and motor fuels. It also offers services related to natural gas compression, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide removal, and manages coal and natural resource properties. Unlike MPLX, ET does not have a parent that owns a large stake in it, nor is it beholden to a single large customer.Furthermore, ET has a much larger asset portfolio with an enterprise value that is nearly twice that of MPLX's. Moreover, it generates at least 11  and no more than 28  of its adjusted EBITDA from each of its five business segments  crude oil, NGL   refined products, natural gas interstate transport   storage, midstream, and natural gas intrastate transport   storage , giving it greater diversification than MPLX. Similar to MPLX, however, is the fact that it generates the vast majority of its cash flow  90  of expected adjusted 2023 EBITDA  from commodity price-resistant long-term fee-based contacts. As such, it has a fairly defensive business model that is quite resilient in the face of macro volatility.One important item to note is that - apart from a sharp dip during part of the COVID-19 and Saudi-Russian oil price war-induced energy market crash of 2020 - MPLX has consistently generated significantly better returns on capital than ET has. This indicates that its management team has been a better capital allocator than ET's has over the yearsBoth businesses have been deleveraging in recent years, and both have BBB credit ratings with stable outlooks from S P.ET's leverage ratio is now under its 4.5x long-term target and is likely to stay within the 4.0x-4.5x range for the foreseeable future depending on capital allocation opportunities for ET relative to the attractiveness of retiring rather than refinancing upcoming debt maturities.One major positive for ET is that it is expected to generate between  1.7- 1.8 billion in free cash flow net of distributions in 2024,  2.4 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2025,  3.1 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2026, and  3.5 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2027. This should enable it to cover most - if not all - of its upcoming debt maturities over that period of time. As a result, it enjoys significant flexibility in the face of growing uncertainty about the future outlook for interest rates. As a result, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.MPLX, meanwhile, has an even lower leverage ratio of 3.5x, down from 3.7x two years ago and 4.0x four years ago. Moreover, it has well-balanced and very manageable debt maturities in the coming years. Similar to ET, it is expected to generate very healthy levels of free cash flow net of distributions over that time period as well. It is expected to generate  1.2- 1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions each year through 2027, equating to a little over  5 billion in free cash flow net of distributions over that span. In comparison, it has about  6 billion in debt maturing over that period, giving it significant capital markets flexibility and minimal need to access bond markets if it chooses not to in the face of rising interest rates. As a result, as with ET, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.As already pointed out, both distributions appear to be on very sound footing thanks to the stable cash flow profiles and strong balance sheets for both businesses. Moreover, MPLX is expected to cover its distribution by 1.56x this year and ET is expected to cover its distribution by 1.95x this year, giving both distributions very adequate coverage.Through 2027, MPLX is expected to grow its distribution at a 5.0  CAGR while ET is expected to grow its distribution at a 4.3  CAGR. ET's distribution is likely going to grow at a slower pace than MPLX's because it has more growth opportunities in front of it, so management will be investing in those instead. That being said, it is interesting to note that ET is only expected to grow its DCF per unit at a 4  CAGR over that span whereas MPLX is expected to grow its DCF per unit at a nearly as strong 3.4  pace despite growing its distribution faster and not retaining nearly as much cash as ET is expected to. This is because MPLX tends to generate higher returns on its capital, thereby reducing its need to retain as much cash flow as ET does in order to deliver similar growth rates.ET appears to be significantly cheaper than MPLX on an EV EBITDA and on a P DCF basis, though both offer near identical current distribution yields.ET appears to be the winner here given that it is significantly cheaper than MPLX and its portfolio is also quite a bit more diversified. However, MPLX has generated consistently better returns on capital over the course of its history, its distribution payout has proven to be more consistent, and has grown at a faster clip over the long term. Moreover, MPLX currently offers the same yield as ET and is expected to grow its distribution at a slightly faster clip moving forward while also having a significantly lower leverage ratio. As a result, we can definitely see the case for holding MPLX over ET.However, what gives ET the edge in our view is that it is not beholden to a parent major client like MPLX is to MPC. Between its greater portfolio diversification, a wider array of growth projects, significantly cheaper valuation, and better governance structure, we give the edge to ET, though we rate both as Buys.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Kinder Morgan: Buy For Dividends And Hold For Sanity,"It s been a while since I last  Kinder Morgan  back in May with a  Buy  rating. The market has seen plenty of rough waters, to say the least, with inflation and interest rates serving as an ever-present backdrop.Plus, add in the AI-bubble that looks set to pop, with Nvidia  falling by 16  in recent weeks, and you have a recipe for plenty more volatility for the rest of the year.Perhaps that s why some income investors would want to stick with  logical  dividend paying stocks that simply make sense for achieving growing and recurring dividends to ride out the noise. KMI may be one such stock, with a 4.8  total return since my last piece, surpassing the 2.2  rise in the S P 500  over the same timeframe.As shown below, KMI remains at theKinder Morgan is a leading midstream company that s primarily tilted towards natural gas, with the largest transmission network in the U.S. This includes 70K miles of natural gas pipelines that move around 40  of U.S. natural gas production, and 700 bcf of working storage capacity, comprising around 15  of U.S. natural gas storage.Beyond natural gas KMI also transports and stores refined products and has the largest CO2 transport capacity in the U.S. with 1,500 miles of CO2 pipelines. AS shown below, KMI s infrastructure footprint spans from coast to coast, connecting end markets with producing regions.Of course, a key reason for why investors would want own KMI is for its steady business performance in varying economic climates. This is supported by 93  of its cashflows being take-or-pay, hedged, and fee-based, thereby limiting commodity price risk for KMI. This has enabled robust shareholder returns. Since 2016, KMI has grown its adjusted EBITDA by 18 , while reducing its net debt by 19  and returning  17.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, as shown below.This growth has continued in the near-term, as natural gas transport volumes grew by 5  YoY during the second quarter, supported volumes holding up well from the big producers. At the same time, natural gas gathering volumes were up by a robust 16  YoY, while refined products pipeline volumes were flat due to refinery maintenance and jet fuel volumes increased 9  YoY due to continued strong consumer travel demand.Concerns around KMI stem from its reliance on fossil fuels, which may run counter to the clean energy transition. Also, KMI is not the lowest levered company in the midstream space, with a 4.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, sitting higher than the 2.9x for the other industry giant, Enterprise Products Partners . This makes KMI relatively more vulnerable to higher interest rates. However, its leverage ratio still sits comfortably under the 4.5x level generally considered safe by ratings agencies, supporting its BBB investment grade credit rating.Nonetheless, natural gas remains a critical bridge fuel and it will be needed for the foreseeable future considering the intermittent nature of renewable energy. Between now and 2028, management expects U.S. natural gas demand to grow by 20  to 121 Bcf per day. In addition, global demand is expected to remain strong, and KMI expects for exports to ramp up with respect to LNG exports and demand coming from Mexico. As shown below, Global LNG volumes are expected to grow through at least 2050, with net import demand coming from parts of Asia and other regions around the world.Moreover, management isn t oblivious to the cleaner energy transition, and believes in a multi-pronged approach that will involve more than just solar and wind. This includes KMI s renewable natural gas projects that are underway as part of its Kinetrex acquisitions from a couple years ago. This is in addition to liquid biofuels and carbon capture projects such as the Red Cedar Gathering project, which is expected to capture up to 400K metric tons of CO2 per year to be delivered to KMI s existing Cortez pipeline.Importantly for income investors, KMI currently pays a 6.8  dividend yield and the quarterly dividend was raised by 2  this year to  0.2825. This equates to a very comfortable DCF-to-dividend coverage ratio of 1.88x, based on  in expected DCF share this year. This also leaves plenty of retained capital to fund growth projects and buy back shares. As of July, KMI has spent  330 million to buy back 20 million shares this year.Lastly, KMI remains a compelling value investment at the current price of  16.60 with a price-to-cash flow of just 7.1x, sitting below its pre-pandemic range of 9x to 10x. It appears to be undervalued at this price, based on my expectation that KMI can achieve around mid-single digit long-term EBITDA growth based on tariff increases and contributions from new projects underway.KMI s valuation also sits below that of natural gas-focused peers Enterprise Products Partners and Williams Companies , while just sitting slightly above that of MPLX , as shown below. As such, I reiterate a  Buy  rating on KMI shares.Kinder Morgan remains a logical dividend paying stock in a choppy market largely due to its attractive yield, stable business model, and visible growth prospects. Management also appears to be on top of the current environmental climate, as it has a number of cleaner energy projects underway that could drive cash flows down the line. With a high yield and plenty of retained capital after paying the dividend, the stock appears to be a solid bet for income and value investors alike.Gen Alpha has teamed up with to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.

Delta Air Lines Is Still Head And Shoulders Above The Rest,"Airline stocks have seen a very turbulent 2023. After low fuel prices early in the year and the promise of a strong summer, macroeconomic fears which includedUnited Airlines  CEO Scott Kirby grabbed the headlines when he stated in that company's 3rd quarter earnings call that the low-cost carrier model was broken and unsustainable and that the majority of U.S. airline industry revenue and profit growth would come from Delta and United. Scott Kirby's style has long included comparisons of UAL's performance to other airlines  when he took the helm at UAL seven years ago, he said his goal was to deliver performance comparable to DAL which has been regarded for years as the industry's financial leader. Not only did Kirby take a swipe at the low-cost carrier segment but also at American Airlines  where Kirby was employed before heading from N. Texas to Chicago to lead United.United's strategies over the past year have been very similar to those which Delta implemented over the past 15 years  increase premium revenue, improve operational reliability, improve the customer experience and onboard product, reduce the reliance on regional jets while growing the mainline  large jet  fleet, and increase aircraft gauge or the average number of seats per flight. United has its own distinctives including a historically larger percentage of revenue from large coastal markets than Delta and a larger percentage of revenue from international markets but the two posted not only the closest revenue and profits the two have recorded in years but also similar bottom line results. The following data highlights the revenue performance between the two megacarriers from  and 's 3rd quarter earnings releases.While Delta and United notched similar impressive results, competitor American didn't fare so well while smaller Alaska , also a legacy  pre-1978 interstate  airline had a decent 3rd quarter. The low-cost carriers including Southwest  have yet to report but are not expected to come close to the strength which Delta and United showed. The factors which have helped Delta and United outperform in the current environment include being able to grow revenue and profits in an aviation system that is heavily constrained due to new aircraft delivery delays esp. from Boeing  as well as Air Traffic Control staffing shortages which have cut the capacity which a number of U.S. airports can handle. Add in soaring labor costs and growing shortages of skilled aviation labor and the ability of the low-cost carrier model to effectively compete against legacy carriers has never been more challenging.   and 's guidance and full year 2023 earnings highlight some of the distinctives between the two companies. It is clear that, while United had a strong summer season, they underperformed Delta earlier in the year and are expected to do so in the winter as they usually do  United has one of the smallest positions in Florida among U.S. airlines and has a smaller Caribbean operation than American or Delta. In addition, Delta earns far more revenue in the  other  category than any other U.S. airline and likely any other airline in the world. We'll get into what is in that  other  category but it is clear that a big part of Delta's financial difference with United, even as well as United is operating right now, is due to a much greater level of revenue diversification which is a key driver behind Delta's higher profits.With an understanding of current industry dynamics, let's look at Delta's distinctives and how they position that company to remain financially at the top of the industry. The underlying principle that underlies Delta's financial success is that it has spent decades, esp. the two decades since 9 11 reshaping itself and thinking much further out strategically than any other airline. It has also intentionally articulated its goals and strategies to investors and has executed them to a level of consistently that has been rare in the airline industry. While Delta has had changes in leadership over the near century that it has been flying, there is a strategic consistency that is rare at a public company that has operated that long.Within the past 20 years, Delta recognized thatDelta used the covid pandemic to further strengthen its competitive and financial position relative to its competitors.In the coming months and years, Delta's revenue and profit growth will be supported byDelta will continue to maintain a strong domestic presence although international has been particularly strong  in 3Q2023, 67  of DAL's 2023 passenger revenue came from domestic and 33  from international markets. In contrast, only 58  of UAL's revenue came from domestic markets, making it the most vulnerable to global downturns.Delta will continue to develop its relationship with its global alliance partners. Its largest and longest partnership is with Air France-KLM  which faces the challenge of an increasing restless Dutch populace and government that wants to limit the size of Amsterdam airport where Delta operates more flights to the U.S. than KLM. Delta and Air France have shifted some flights to Paris. Delta is already reaping the benefits of its young joint venture with Latam, the multi-country S. American airline. Aeromexico is rapidly expanding after the U.S. lifted restrictions on Mexican airlines due to safety concerns. In Asia, Korean Airlines' merger proposal with Asiana, facilitated by the Korean Development Bank,  Delta execs said they expect to announce new Delta routes to Seoul where expansion has been on hold as Delta has tried not to negatively impact negotiations with regulators in the U.S. and the EU.Delta's purchase of a refinery in 2012 raised a lot of skepticism within the business community. Delta bought its 185k bbl day Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66 and tuned it to maximize jet fuel production using incentives from the state of Pennsylvania. Delta's intent was always for the refinery to reduce its jet fuel bill rather than be a to be profitable on a standalone basis  as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta, the standalone financials of the refinery have to be reported to investors and yet in 2022, Delta saved 23 cents gallon off of each of the 3.5 billion gallons of jet fuel its aircraft used, saving the company nearly  1 billion. While the savings are not expected to be as high in 2023, the refinery is now consistently saving Delta double digit cents per gallon. Although United considered buying its own refinery, that effort was not successful and Delta remains the only airline in the world that uses its own refinery, rather than crude oil hedges, to reduce its fuel bill. Since part of the savings that Delta gains via the refinery is attributable to the cost to refine crude oil into jet fuel, the reduced refinery capacity in the U.S. Northeast and the growing number of electric vehicles will likely ensure that Delta's cost advantage is not diminished and has the potential to grow even further.Delta will continue to grow its loyalty program and American Express  revenue from  7 billion to  10 billion.Two other major strategies that are still under development and awaiting public decisions are both fleet related.Delta is still expected to announce an order for new widebody international aircraft, one year after Delta executives told employees that they were seeking board approval for the purchase of approximately 20 Airbus  A350-1000s and additional A330-900s. Delta operates nearly every model of commercial aircraft flown by western airlines with the exception of the Boeing 777 and 787. Delta retired its fleet of 18 777s, composed of both the 777-200ER and the very long range and highly capable -LR model, during the pandemic. The A350-900 became Delta's flagship and primary long-range aircraft. However, as I have noted in other articles, airport boarding data shows that Delta has likely experienced significant payload restrictions on some of its A350 routes which include 8000 mile segments from Atlanta to S. Africa and S. Korea. It should not be surprising if Delta does experience payload restrictions  the majority of its current two dozen plus A350-900s are early production, less capable models, with a second set of more capable models, and just two of the newest and most capable models. Delta has 16 more A350-900s due for delivery over the next 3 years and all are expected to be the most capable models which should eliminate any payload restrictions as the airline can use its  best  aircraft on the longest and most challenging routes. Its  less capable  A350s still can comfortably fly 12-14 flights, comparable to routes the 777-200ER did, but with fuel savings of 25 . The A350-1000 is an even larger version of the A350 model and both operate some of the longest routes in the world.Delta also operates a fleet of 65 A330s including the -900NEO. Airbus re-engined its best selling widebody  second in sales only to the Boeing 777 family  with new generation engines similar to those found on the B787 but is able to build the A330-900 for much less than other new aircraft because the A330NEO is a derivative aircraft. Slightly smaller than the A350-900, the A330-900 is used by Delta for flights of 12-13 hours or less, leaving the A350s to focus on longer routes.Because Delta chose the A350 A330NEO combination, it has not ordered the 787, Boeing's popular new generation aircraft which, like the A350, is made of lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymers. As Delta's decision nears regarding another widebody aircraft order to extend its deliveries past 2026, the Boeing 787 might be a consideration at Delta even though Delta has not bought a widebody aircraft from Boeing in 20 years.Resolution of the aircraft order appears to be centered around Delta's ability to overhaul the engines on its new widebody aircraft in its own shops instead of sending those engines out to other facilities. Delta noted that the deciding factor in its decision a decade ago to buy its widebody aircraft exclusively from Airbus was being granted engine overhaul rights by Rolls-Royce  which exclusively powers all new-generation powered Airbus aircraft including the A330-900 and A350. The A350-1000 is powered by a modified version of the engine that powers the A350-900 which Delta operates  Delta has the rights to not only repair its own A350-900 engines in-house but also to sell its engine maintenance services to other airlines. Aircraft engine overhauls typically are required every 5-10 years but cost millions of dollars per engine  highly skilled work, engine overhauls command healthy double digit profit margins. The engine makers themselves operate their own engine repair shops but have a network of authorized shops, often affiliated with or derived from some of the largest global airlines. Delta had expected to be able to win the engine overhaul agreement for the A350-1000 but Rolls-Royce has apparently not been willing to grant Delta those rights.Sensing opportunity, General Electric , which has the largest sold engine share on the Boeing 787, has agreed to grant Delta rights to overhaul the GEnx engine that powers the Boeing 787 family. General Electric and Safran  granted Delta overhaul rights for the LEAP engine that exclusively powers the Boeing 737MAX order, leading to a 2022 order for the MAX 10, the largest member of Boeing's narrowbody aircraft family. Delta also won engine overhaul rights for the Pratt and Whitney RTX narrowbody domestic Airbus aircraft that Delta has on order. In total, Delta has rights to maintain the engines on every new aircraft it has on order as well as sell those services to other airlines.Delta's choice for its widebody order appears to be either for the A350-1000 but without engine overhaul rights or for the B787 or for more A350-900s, the latter two with engine overhaul rights. The A350-1000 is the largest and most capable new generation aircraft under consideration by Delta, carrying up to 350 passengers on 16  hour flights. The largest version of the Boeing 787 family, the -10, is highly fuel efficient and seats about 315 passengers in a configuration that Delta might use and can fly 12-13 hour flights but Delta would be giving up the opportunity with that aircraft to operate very long flights that are essential for many routes to Asia Pacific destinations. With the 787-10 and without the A350-1000, Delta would rely on its A350-900s, smaller than either the B787-10 or the A350-1000, for very long flights. The mid-size 787, the - 9, has range slightly less than either version of the A350 and seats approximately 25 fewer passengers in a comparable configuration to Delta's A350-900s  since larger aircraft size helps offset the higher operating costs of long flights and Delta already operates the similarly sized A330-900 but which is less capable than the B787-9, there are few reasons why Delta would order the 787-9 unless they completely walk away from Rolls-Royce - powered aircraft.Given that even some of Delta's Rolls-Royce powered engines have suffered from reduced time between overhauls and operational issues which have reduced the usefulness of the airplane, Delta's best bet to gain manufacturer credits such as are commonly given in the aviation industry when a product fails to perform as guaranteed is by continuing to order some Rolls-Royce aircraft. In addition, Airbus is undoubtedly fighting to not lose even part of a major order from a blue-chip company like Delta and could offer further incentives or even further reduce the price of its aircraft to compensate for Rolls-Royce's unwillingness to negotiate an engine overhaul deal on the A350-1000 which carries a list price of almost  400 million. Delta is the largest customer of the slow-selling A330NEO so Airbus has plenty of reasons to ensure Delta keeps ordering the A330-900 which could be a very suitable replacement for Delta's fleet of 66 Boeing 767s which will come to the end of its life over the next decade.Delta could also be telling Airbus that it will order A350s and more A330NEOs for delivery after 2030 when Rolls-Royce's exclusivity ends and GE can provide an engine.Delta appears set to gain not only a cost advantage in the acquisition of its new aircraft but also further develop its engine overhaul business revenue which they have said should increase to  5 billion over the next decade, further growing DAL's profits using unique strategies. While Delta execs downplayed that it might profit from the massive number of inspections and repairs to other airlines' Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan engines, it is clear that Delta's maintenance services will increasingly grow even indirectly from work done for its competitors and those services could deliver  1 billion more in profits for DAL in the next 5-7 years.Delta's most recent employee communications indicate that a widebody decision should come before the end of the year.Delta's final challenge is to continue to manage and grow the loyalty of its stakeholders including its customers, employees, and stakeholders. As previously noted, Delta's loyalty program, SkyMiles, has been extraordinarily profitable for the company and is closely tied to its relationship with American Express. Delta says it is on target to exceed  6 billion in revenue from SkyMiles this year and believes it can attain  10 billion in revenue by the end of this decade. Part of the benefit of airline-affiliated credit cards is increased accrual of elite benefits as well as access to Sky Clubs, DAL's airport lounges. Although all mainline and regional aircraft under its control offer premium cabins and Delta has more square feet of airport lounge space than any other airline, Delta has increasingly seen customer to enter Sky Clubs and long waitlists for elite upgrades. Recognizing that it doesn't have the ability in its system to serve the number of elites it has, Delta  to increase elite qualification and limit Sky Club access that it hoped would end the multiple piecemeal attempts it has tried over the past couple years. The points and miles blogosphere registered large levels of discontent although Delta says, predictably, that it has received it has also received much positive feedback. Nonetheless, Delta announced revisions to some of the changes it previously made while also noting that it is comfortable that it is moving in the right direction but moved too quickly. In its earnings call, Delta execs affirmed they are on track to reach their SkyMiles revenue goals, indicating that they and AXP not only were closely monitoring a number of indicators and decided, at the least, that modest revisions could help calm social media - and that has been the case since the revisions were announced. As the big 3 U.S. global airlines become stronger relative to their competition and as affinity credit cards are as heavily used by American consumers, it is not unreasonable to think that further revisions will be coming not just at Delta but also at other airlines.The second stakeholder group which Delta must ensure remains on its side is its employees. Delta led the industry with post-covid pay raises, first for its pilots and then for its non-union employees including pay during boarding for its flight attendants, a first for a large U.S. airline. In addition, Delta execs noted on its recent earnings call that it had accrued  1 billion in profit sharing for the first nine months of 2023, setting Delta employees up to receive a profit-sharing check on Valentine's Day 2024 amount to a healthy double-digit percentage of their 2023 earnings. Based if nothing else on Delta's earnings leadership in the industry, Delta employees will remain some of the best compensated airline employees in the world. Delta's founder has long recognized that paying and treating its employees well encourages them to take good care of Delta's customers. Given that Delta consistently ranks at the top of industry customer service metrics, Delta revenue and profits benefit from the company's generous compensation. Still, keeping 80,000 employees happy and engaged involves more than just money. The entire airline industry, like many American companies, continues to deal with higher levels of attrition, changed mindsets about work, and a greater desire to work from home, an option that most airline jobs do not afford. Nonetheless, Delta employees have put the company on Glassdoor's list of Best Companies to Work for seven years.The final stakeholder group that Delta must satisfy is its investors. Delta remains at the top of the global airline industry in terms of market cap, profitability, and total revenue. DAL reinstituted a dividend which sports a 1.24  FWD yield, just under half the level for Southwest.DAL's balance sheet looks healthier than its global competitors but not as healthy as stalwart LUV which is posting much lower profits both than Delta and what LUV historically has reported.DAL's aircraft capex of  19 billion is modest and should allow the company to not make incremental aircraft orders, particularly considering that DAL's aircraft spend is half of UAL's at its highest levels and one-third of UAL's levels in total. DAL generates sufficient cash to opportunistically reduce its debt and continues to pursue a return to investment grade credit ratings.Wall Street analysts still collectively rate DAL a strong buy with an average price target of  53 for a 66  upside.Although airline stocks including 2023 enjoyed a healthy first half of 2023, the selloff in the 2nd half of the year highlights that airlines are rarely viewed as long-term investments by most retail investors. Delta's risks include1. Macroeconomic factors including inflation and high interest rates appear to be impacting low cost carriers more than legacy carriers but Delta is not immune to travel reductions which might come from tighter business travel budgets.2. Jet fuel remains DAL and most airline's second largest expense. While Delta has strong fuel cost containment strategies, a sustained spike in fuel prices has been highly destructive to airline stocks and the same would be true today, esp. if it is part of global conflicts.3. Delta has led the industry in labor cost increases but the revenue generation that supports those higher labor costs could quickly reverse, esp. if legislation is implemented that reduces the ability of card issuers including AXP to pay rich rewards.4. While Delta has tried to diversify its fleet purchases from multiple manufacturers, production and durability issues in any model could quickly erode profits and Delta's operational reliability such as been seen impacting some low-cost carriers.5. Customer backlash to Delta's SkyMiles changes could turn out to be much more significant than the company believes so far, eroding loyalty program revenues and creating opportunities for competitors.While I believe that Delta has managed each of these risks, the historic swings in the airline industry indicate that managements rarely can accurately predict and manage all risks they face.In the midst of an uncertain world and economic environment and in an industry that rarely holds onto success, Delta Air Lines stock continues to earn a STRONG BUY rating, one of the very few in the industry.I believe a  43 price target for DAL is possible within the next year and  55 within three years.

The results are presented on a 6-month and a full-year basis, and they are very complex. Additionally, the majority of the results are shown in South African Rand, a currency that fluctuates frequently. To make things easier for readers to understand, I will combine the 6-month and full-year results in this article. Although it isn't ideal, it's the only solution I could think of.Impala Platinum Holding has significantly underperformed Sibanye Stillwater Limited . One exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that could be great to follow in this platinum palladium segment is the Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF  NYSEARCA  .IMPUY has dropped significantly since the beginning of 2023 due to a painful slide in palladium prices. IMPUY is down  on a one-year basis, underperforming SBSW and PALL.IMPUY is a solid PGM producer despite this massive slide that started in early 2023 and may continue until next year. The company is a pure PGM and, therefore, looks more volatile and subject to long periods of depression, which is what we have experienced in 2023.On the other hand, I think this bearish cycle is about to end, and IMPUY appeals to me. Of course, patience is the key.The industry is going through some tough times. For instance, Sibanye Stillwater recently announced it  its PGM mining and close four loss-making platinum group metal shafts in South Africa, which could result in the loss of 4,095 jobs.Also, the Chief Executive, Nico Muller, In addition, mining in South Africa is difficult and fraught with problems  a faulty electricity grid, unstable labor, etc. , which complicates the problem.Consequently, I advise trading LIFO for roughly  of your long-term stake, even though IMPUY is an attractive stock with strong growth options.By doing this, you can build on weaknesses and significantly reduce risks.The 6E production  concentrate  originates from three different groupsAlso, the attributable Mineral Resource estimate decreased by  to  due to production depletion and a model update to the Zimplats Hartley Mineral Resources.As I mentioned in my previous post, acquiring ownership of Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited was the year's high point.

Cenovus Energy: Massive Buybacks And Dividends Are Around The Corner,"In May, I started  Canadian integrated oil   gas giant  as part of my plan to focus more on the CanadianOne of the issues I had with Cenovus is its poor performance. Over the past ten years, NY-listed shares have returned negative 15 , which includes reinvested dividends. This performance was way behind the already slow performance of Exxon Mobil  and Chevron -which dominate the weightings in the Energy ETF .The good news is that the past is in the past. Looking forward, CVE shares are in a much better spot.Since my article in May, NY-listed CVE shares have returned 20 . Over the past three months, CVE shares are up 22 , beating the aforementioned XLE benchmark by roughly 7 points.In this article, I'll update my thesis, as the good news for investors keeps coming in. The company is seeing improved operations, and we could be looking at special dividends on top of aggressive regular dividend growth and buybacks.So, let's get to itCenovus is one of the few high-quality integrated oil and gas companies on the market. With a  38 billion market cap in New York, the company is the smaller peer of giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.This year, the company is expected to produce 785 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Roughly 600 thousand barrels of oil are expected to come from its oil sands operations.Furthermore, in light of my oil thesis of long-term supply growth challenges and ongoing demand growth, it needs to be said that Cenovus has top-tier assets with long reserve lives.Whereas most shale companies are slowly running out of Tier 1 drilling assets, Cenovus has close to 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves. This translates to roughly 31 years without incorporating consistently rising new discoveries.On top of that, the company has refining exposure through six refineries. These have the capacity to turn roughly 745 thousand barrels into value-added products each day.During the second quarter, the company mentioned progress in its operations. All U.S. refining assets are now fully operational. Furthermore, the Canadian refining assets are fully operational and expected to maintain high utilization rates through the remainder of this year.In its upstream operations  oil production , the company's sand assets are running at pre-turnaround rates, with a strong execution expected in the remainder of the year. The impact of wildfires was roughly 10 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.However, in the Asia Pacific region, the company faced challenges resulting in lower volumes due to planned and unplanned outages. An unauthorized vessel collision with an umbilical line at the Liwan 29-1 field caused a shutdown of subsea wells.Despite this incident, production was restored by the first week of June, with no environmental impacts observed.Going back to Foster Creek, this asset is expected to see a production increase of more than 30 thousand BOE by the end of 2027. Christina Lake and Sunrise are also expected to see production growth over the next 2-3 years.Going forward, I expect Canadian players to increasingly use their advantage of being able to boost production without having to be careful due to resource depletion.Having said that, in the second quarter, the company continued to reduce debt. It generated roughly  900 million in free cash flow, allowing it to reduce net debt by  275 million to  6.4 billion.The company also repurchased outstanding warrants and boosted its dividend. Buying back warrants allowed the company to reduce the diluted share count by roughly 2.4 .Speaking of dividends and buybacks, the company hiked its dividend by 33  on April 26, resulting in a dividend of  0.14 per Toronto-based share per quarter.This translates to a base dividend yield of 2.1 .2.1  is boring and nothing to write home about.However, there's a lot more where that came from.Thanks to an increasingly healthy balance sheet and high free cash flow due to elevated oil prices, shareholders are in an increasingly good spot.As of the second quarter, the company has a BBB-rated balance sheet with no major debt maturities until 2027.The average weighted maturity of its debt is now 14.1 years, which is remarkable.Having said that, the company has a clear framework. Currently, the company has  6.4 billion in net debt, which means it uses roughly half of its free cash flow  after its base dividend  to reduce debt. The other half is used for buybacks and special dividends.In the second quarter, all of its excess cash  after debt reduction  went to buybacks.Once the company has lowered net debt to  4 billion, it aims to distribute every single penny of free cash flow to shareholders. This is one of the most shareholder-friendly plans in the entire oil and gas industry.Bear in mind that once the company has achieved its desired net leverage target, there's no need to reduce debt even further. After all, no major M A is needed to keep operations running for many decades.Analysts expect the company to reach its leverage target in 2025, which I expect to be reached next year, as I believe that oil prices will remain elevated, allowing the company to generate more free cash flow than expected.Furthermore, the company commented on the use of special dividends to distribute cash. In the oil and gas sector, I LOVE special dividends as a way to get rid of excess cash. I don't care much for buybacks in this cyclical industry.Below is a conversation between Menno Hulshof, an analyst at TD Securities, and Jonathan McKenzie, Cenovus' President   CEO. Mr.  asked about the use of special dividends during the In other words, Cenovus believes that the mid-cycle price is still close to  60. Even based on that assumption, the company believes that its shares are significantly undervalued, meaning it will prioritize buybacks over special dividends.Once its share price becomes less attractive, special dividends make more sense.Technically speaking, I agree with this. It seems like the way to go and a win-win for long-term shareholders either way.Imagine you're buying now. The company buys back stock to boost its share price. Once the share price is high enough, special dividends are used to get rid of cash. That's a win for shareholders, as they are likely sitting on a very juicy yield on cost.Adding to that, the company's dividend is sustainable at prices as low as  45 WTI, which is impressive. This also beats a lot of pure-play upstream companies.This brings me to the valuation.The valuation part of stocks tied to the price of certain commodities is tricky. After all, even small changes in the price of the underlying commodity can have a major impact on expected sales, EBITDA, net income, you name it.In the case of CVE, the company is expected to generate  6.3 billion in free cash flow next year - using the current oil price trajectory.This would translate to a free cash flow yield of 12 .I believe that is attractive but not close to what the company can generate if oil prices remain elevated.It also means that after 2024, shareholders are in a great place to receive a double-digit distribution yield, consisting of dividends and buybacks - eventually, special dividends will be added.NY-listed shares are currently trading at  20, which is 10  below the current consensus price target of  22.While I cannot predict what oil prices will do over the next few quarters - I have a longer-term view - I believe that CVE shares are poised to move towards  26 in the next 12 months.My strategy for oil and gas remains unchanged. In light of general economic challenges, I buy corrections. I bought in recent months and will buy again if we see 10-20  weakness in certain oil stocks. This would apply to CVE as well.In my recent analysis of Canadian integrated oil   gas giant Cenovus Energy  in May , I noted a remarkable turnaround. Despite past underperformance, the company is now shining with efficient production, substantial oil reserves, and a debt reduction focus.Shareholders are set to benefit from CVE's focus on reaching its net debt target by year-end, with potential buybacks and special dividends on the horizon after an impressive 33  dividend boost.With improved operations, projected production growth, and a clear capital return framework, Cenovus is poised to deliver significant returns in the energy market.Personally, I remain bullish, foreseeing CVE shares potentially reaching  26 within the next year.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

FTAIP: A Probable 18% Yield To First Call Seems Worth The Risk,"FTAI Aviation  is the result of a spin-off between it and FTAI Infrastructure  which occurred in August 2022. Post spin it is a Cayman Islands exempted company which  is one of a number of preferred issues of FTAI including FTAIO,  and . It is an  issue currently tradingMore importantly, FTAIP is likely to be called. The preferred will switch to floating at 3-month Libor   6.88  in September 2024. At about 12.5  for current Libor, this is a very unattractive rate for the firm relative to other preferred and debt. Rather than letting that occur the firm is likely to call FTAIP which would produce a 18  return to first call for current investors. We believe this is an attractive return verse the risk investors are taking on.If FTAIP were allowed to switch to floating at 3-month Libor   6.88 , the firm would have to pay approximately a 12.5  yield at current rates. However, FTAI has been able to recently issue new preferred at 9.5  fixed  FTAIM  potentially saving FTAI 3  in interest by refinancing FTAIP into new preferred. Alternately, FTAI debt is currently rated BB- by Fitch. While not investment grade, borrowing for other similar BB- debt is currently available at about 8 . This implies FTAI would save  4  by refinancing this preferred into debt instead of letting it switch to floating. Finally, management has been using excess cash flow to buy back discounted debt in the recent past  200 million worth of discounted 2025 debt was bought in 2022 . Hence there is a lot of incentive for management to refinance this preferred rather than to let it float, and a number of potential different alternatives for them to do so.As stated, similar debt to FTAI's BB- has been refinanced at 8  recently. Also, the firm itself was able to issue new preferred FTAIM at 9 . Both imply the debt and preferred market remain open to the firm. Furthermore, the firm has been producing a decent amount of cash flow from both ongoing operations and asset sales. Finally, FTAIP's debt schedule is reasonably spaced, and its coverage is good.Fitch likely rates FTAI below investment grade  BB-  due primarily to its high debt load, a whopping 83  of FTAI's book assets  CFM56 plane engines and airframes . However, these assets are of high quality, in high demand and very likely undervalued. As most will be aware, airlines have been doing very well post Covid. Their problem is not having enough usable airframes and crews, not too many. Furthermore, FTAI leases exclusively CFM56 engines and airframes to these airlines. These engines are not only the most popular aircraft engine in the world, but they are also .Sales of these  used  assets further support the notion they are more valuable than what is reported under GAAP accounting rules. In 2022, FTAI's aviation leasing segment showed a substantial net profit from asset sales. They received  208 million in asset sales revenue, but the cost of these assets on the books was only  159 million. This is more than a 30  premium to book value, strongly suggesting GAAP reporting undervalues FTAI's assets. Fitch can't give a firm credit for this implied value, but we can. I estimate true debt to assets is approximately 58  much lower than the 83  implied by standard GAAP required balance sheet depreciation. This occurs because GAAP depreciation on these assets tends toward 15-25 years thanks to bonus depreciation and MACRS despite the average CFM56 engine having more than a 30-year useful life. Were GAAP to record FTAI's net debt   assets as being 58 , they would undoubtedly receive a higher rating than BB- from Fitch.FTAI's Debt   EBITDA is also a pretty solid 3.5x and expected to continue to stay within the 3-4x range by management. This too implies a rating much better than BB-.Unfortunately, Fitch can't consider implied asset values above book. It must use GAAP accounting figures. Hence the discrepancy which knowledgeable investors can take advantage of.We would be remiss if we didn't also note FTAI's stock can be sold at a 123  price higher than this time last year if necessary and that is unlikely to be necessary as its debt is reasonably well spaced out.The first  653 million doesn't come due until 2025  after FTAIP switches to floating , and the majority does not come due until 2028. This 2025 debt carries a fixed rate of 6.5  so to be clear with a BB- rating it would likely carry a 1.5 - 2  higher rate. However, it's worth noting that the company made significant progress in reducing its debt load by paying off or buying back approximately  200 million of the 2025 debt at a discount last year. Thus, if they continue at this rate, the debt should be significantly reduced or potentially even paid off by the time it matures. This would greatly mitigate refinancing risk.Alternatively, if I were CFO, I would at least consider buying back some FTAIP at a discount on the open market instead of the 2025 6.5  debt. While this preferred yields 9  currently, not that attractive vs. buying back 2025 debt at an effective 8  savings, the CFO should also consider this particular preferred will soon turn into 12.5  floating. Thus, it may also make sense to use some cash flow to buy back some of it.Regardless, FTAI's Net Debt   EBITDA, the ability of other BB- Fitch rated firms to refinance at 8  and FTAI's ability to pay down debt with cash flow implies an ongoing ability to refinance the fixed-to-floating FTAIP preferred to a significantly lower rate as necessary.Another aspect to consider is the  128 million in common dividends paid by FTAI each year. If push were to come to shove, this cash flow can be used to pay off or refinance debt. Furthermore, not only would the common dividend have to be eliminated before any preferred dividends are cut, but the preferred dividends also represent less than one-fourth of the common. I note in past situations where preferred payouts are relatively small compared to the common and a covenant is breached, it is not unusual for the common dividend to be cancelled but not the cumulative preferred.In conclusion, investing in FTAIP currently offers an attractive 9.1  yield, and the possibility of a 12.5  floating yield in late 2024, but more likely a 18  yield to first call. We further note FTAIP would need to trade at around  24.50 to produce about the same return as FTAIM. Considering this, FTAIP appears to clearly offer a more favorable deal compared to FTAIM and FTAI's other preferred.Potential investors will of course need to conduct their own further due diligence, taking into consideration the risks associated with the company's leverage. However, we think the risk is significantly less than Fitch's BB- rating implies. Ultimately, FTAIP's appeal lies not in the lack of all-risk, but rather in the potential for an above average return vs. the risk actually being taken. Each investor will need to make an assessment of their own risk profile and their appropriate allocation tolerance level prior to making an investment.The primary goal of the  is to produce an overall yield in the 7  - 10  range.

Wake Up And Smell The Cash Flow: ECC Yield 17%,"This past Mother's Day, I splurged on a gift for my wife. My wife and I are both heavy coffee drinkers. We love the smell. We love the taste. We love the experience of having a goodSome of you may remember that this past spring, I was in an accident that caused me to be injured and unable to write for a number of months. During this time, my wife was forced to not only take care of our household but also all of the various animals that weSince I have further recovered, I have taken great joy in being able to ensure that there is a coffee-based drink for her every morning. She gets to wake up and enjoy the smell of coffee being prepared or already prepared for her. When it comes to the market, there is little more that I or many investors enjoy than receiving cash into our account on a regular basis. One of the first things I do when I look at my portfolio is review what dividends have been paid to me because these are irrevocable returns from the market. It is cash in hand that can never be taken away from me. So when I find a fund or a company that is paying me strong double-digit yields that are entirely covered by cash flow, I like to think of waking up to a hot cup of coffee. Enjoying the smell of coffee is just like waking up and enjoying the smell of strong cash flow.Today, I want to look at one great opportunity that does just that.Let's dive in , yielding 17.4 , had the  problem  of making too much taxable income last year. CEFs  Closed-End Funds  are required to pay out most of their taxable income, and when they fall short, they have to pay an excise tax and distribute the excess the following year.  made more taxable income than they could distribute in 2022, and as a result, ECC has been showering us with extra dividends. On top of the already impressive  0.14 month, ECC paid out two large special dividends in 2022 and has been paying an extra  0.02 month in recent quarters. The  0.02 month extra has already been declared for the remainder of Q4.We certainly cannot count on the  0.02 month supplemental dividend to continue into 2024. We might have to settle for  only   1.68 in annualized dividends next year, for a yield of over 16  on today's current price.Since its IPO, ECC has paid out over  19.03 share in dividends, and it IPO'd at  20. How is ECC able to provide such a huge income  ECC invests in securitized vehicles called  Collateralized Loan Obligations  or CLOs. When a CLO is formed, the manager buys up a portfolio of leveraged loans. These are senior secured loans that are issued by publicly rated companies. CLOs focus on the market segment that has slightly below investment-grade credit in the B B  range.Senior secured loans are the most senior debt that a company usually has. It is senior to unsecured bonds and common equity, which is what you are buying when you invest in a common stock.Typically, senior secured debt is going to be lower yielding than unsecured bonds - after all, it is significantly lower risk. However, even with  lower  risk, there is a limit to how much debt any bank or other financial institution wants to have invested in credit risk assets. After a bank originates a loan, they usually want to sell it off. A very large number of these loans are sold to CLOs, which frees up capital for the originator, and provides investors with an opportunity to invest in a portfolio of loans, rather than take the risks of a single loan.Of course, there needs to be a way for CLOs to ensure they have enough demand that they can raise enough capital to buy up loans. To attract investors, CLOs  securitize , meaning they sell various tranches to investors in payment priority. The senior debt investors pay a premium and accept a lower yield than the borrowers are paying in order to be first in line. This ensures that they have minimal and usually no credit losses. They get a much lower yield, but it is much more predictable.The payments then cascade through the structure, with each tranche getting paid in full before the next lower tranche can be paid.The  equity  tranche is the last one to get paid. As a result, it carries the most variability and the highest yields. These are the tranches that ECC buys, and the cash yield has been sky-high. ECC has received  3.18 in cash distributions from CLOs from the end of Q2 2022 to Q2 2023  its NAV at the end of Q2 2022 was  10.08. So ECC realized an actual cash yield on its NAV of 31.5  That is looking backward at actual realized cash flows.This has been enough to easily cover the fund's expenses and its elevated distributions.It is worth noting that cash flows from CLOs are variable. If a borrower defaults, the equity portion absorbs the impact. In the case of late 2022, there was an expansion in the difference between 3-month LIBOR SOFR and 1-month LIBOR SOFR, which had a temporarily negative impact on CLO equity which pays interest based on 3-month LIBOR SOFR, but borrowers have the option to pay either 1-month or 3-month.Today's environment is creating a very unique opportunity for CLO equity positions because CLOs are not static investments like other securitized investments you might have heard of. For example, if you invest in a CMBS  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security , you are investing in a specific portfolio of mortgages, in some cases, only a single mortgage. If that mortgage defaults, your returns can go up in smoke. You are entirely reliant on the performance of the specific assets that were in the CMBS when you bought it.CLOs are dynamic. The manager actively manages the CLO. There is a  reinvestment period  where if a borrower refinances or otherwise prepays the principal of a loan, the manager reinvests it in new loans. If a particular loan is downgraded, or the manager determines that a loan is too risky, the manager will sell the loan and replace it with a different one. Managers are incentivized through the covenants with the senior debt tranches to minimize the number of C-rated loans in the portfolio. Remember, the manager owns much of the equity tranche and so is incentivized to maximize the returns for the equity.What is happening today  A lot of loans are trading below par. And it has little to do with the particular risk of a loan  it has to do with the Fed and how quickly they have raised interest rates causing the pricing of most loans to be below par. Yet companies still need to refinance and push out maturities. When a loan is trading at  95 out of  100 par, the borrower still needs to repay  100. So when they repay the loan, the CLO receives  100 for something that was valued at  95, plus gets the opportunity to buy a new similar loan that is also trading at  95. So instead of having  100 in par value that has a market value of  95, after a repayment and reinvestment, the CLO would have  105 in par value at a market value of  100. The amount the CLO owes to its senior tranches remains unchanged. The gain goes to the equity tranche.Repayment rates have slowed down, but repayments are still happening at a 14  rate.Why would loans repay in such a high-interest rate environment  Various reasons - companies want need to deleverage, some are acquired and the buyer might have access to cheaper capital, and others might be willing to refinance early even in a high-rate environment to extend their maturities and avoid having a wall of debt that might be challenging to refinance in the future. This activity is directly beneficial to CLO equity positions and will result in gains that will help to offset any rise in defaults that might happen.ECC has responded by raising capital, taking advantage of trading at a premium to NAV to issue shares, plus retaining the excess cash flow it has after paying the dividend and buying more CLO equity positions.The cash is flowing into CLO equity positions and into ECC. We are ecstatic to take advantage of this high yield. It's time to wake up and smell the cash flow.It is uncommon to find a closed-end fund that is generating so much cash flow that it has been forced to pay special dividends on a regular basis. While many funds will underpay throughout the year in order to have a special dividend at the end of the year to entice investors, ECC is generating so much cash flow that they are not only paying special dividends at the end of the year but also every month.In the context of agriculture, farmers will often refer to a bumper crop as a crop that has been harvested in excess of what is typical and considered a very prosperous year for that crop. Similar to this, ECC is reaping so much cash from its investments and its ability to reinvest excess cash flow to buy new positions that they are forced by regulations to put more money into your pocket, while the rest of the market seems to be struggling against high-interest rates and trying to be able to cover their spending in cash flow.When it comes to retirement, I can think of no better opportunity than a fund that is forced to pay me more because they're doing so well at earning cash. When they pay me special dividends, I'm able to use those for whatever I want, whether that's to buy more shares, go out on a fancy dinner with my wife, buy her flowers, or splurge on a nice coffee machine so that I can treat her to something special every morning.When was the last time that your portfolio treated you to something special because the holdings you have are so successful that they were forced to pay you extra  My Income Method is not designed simply to make you a living that you can scrape by on, but rather, it's designed to help your portfolio generate so much cash flow that you have an abundance of excess income.

NextEra Energy: One Of The Best Times In 5 Years To Buy This Dividend Aristocrat,"It's been years since   was finally reasonably priced or a good buy.NextEra hasn't been reasonably priced for five years. For the first time in half aNEE is about 15  undervalued and a potentially strong buy for anyone who loves this business and is comfortable with its risk profile.But does that mean you  run out and buy NEE right nowNot necessarily. Let me show you why the 25  bear market in NEE might not be over just yet, and even if it is, NEE isn't likely to maintain the 13  annual returns of the last decade.NEE was founded in 1925 as Florida Power   Light.It consists of two parts, the regulated Florida Power   Light, or FPL, and the faster-growing NewEra Energy Resources or NEER. Combined, it owns 67 GW worth of power generation capacity enough for a total of 50.3 million homes.FPL has 5.8 million customers and 34 GW of that capacity, with 33 GW representing the renewable power business spread across the US.By 2025 NEE plans to invest  33 billion into growing its regulated business, as it expands its ability to power Florida's rapid economic growth.NEE has a long-term plan to shift its baseload power for FPL to renewables. Specifically, it plans to be 83  solar, battery, and hydrogen, along with 16  nuclear by 2045. That's compared to 71  natural gas today. The company is confident that as the world's green energy leader, it can save money and grow profits while making this 23-year shift.How does FPL plan to accomplish thisFPL has benefited from years of very low costs for consumers, and very happy customers. However, in recent years, the company has faced challenges. Regulators have started to crack down on what has historically been one of the friendliest regulatory regimes for utilities in the country.NEER is one of the industry leaders in green energy. It typically obtains 20-year purchase power agreements with regulated utilities before building a new renewable asset.NEER has 31 GW of capacity and is now selling off all of its pipeline assets. That's part of a long-term financing support package for NEP, its yieldCo, which has run into growth concerns in an era of higher rates.NEP is like an old-school MLP whose sponsor would sell its assets in order to recoup part of its initial investment  capital recycling  while still owning a significant amount of the cash flow.The trouble today is that NEP's price has plunged.NEP is in a 40  bear market, the third worst in its history. During the pandemic, it fell 50 , and in the 2015 industry apocalypse created by SunEdison's bankruptcy, Brookfield ended up profiting by acquiring its yieldCos for pennies on the dollar.NEE kept NEP afloat during this period when NEP's cost of capital soared, and it could keep growing its distribution at 3  per quarter  15  annually .50  of its renewable customers are regulated utilities, 39  are large industrial customers  like Target , and 11  are municipal governments and coops.How big is NEE in green energy  It currently produces 56  of all the wind power in the US, and its plans for the future are even more impressive.NEER has 31 GW of capacity today. Worst case management thinks that in the next two years alone, it will build 33 GW more. That's over 100  capacity growth, and NEER isn't just building to build. Every project has a long-term  20 year  contract before a shovel goes into the ground.Over 50  of that new capacity is solar, NEE's new world to conquer.In fact, by 2026, NEE thinks it can add 41 GW, more than doubling its renewable power capacity, to 69 GW, enough power for 52 million homes.To give you an idea of how big 69 GW is, it's approximately 6  of all US power capacity. From one company's renewable power capacity. Imagine 1 15th of all US power running on NextEra's green power capacity alone. That's what management plans for 2026 and says they're on track to achieve.To give you an idea of how potentially massive NEE's growth market is, there's about 7,000 GW of power capacity in the US economy, and eventually, all of it is expected to go zero carbon. NEE owns 31 GW of that, or 0.4  of its potential growth market. And this is the industry leader, and NextEra has barely begun to tap into its growth market.By 2030 alone, an estimated 250 GW of new capacity for renewables is expected, and NEE, with all its massive spending power, is expected to provide just 23  of that.When the No. 1 player is providing 23  of new capacity and has tapped into 0.4  of its growth potential, you can see why Wall Street was so in love with this stock for so long.OK, but what if you don't get excited by GW and industry terminology  How about this. NEE estimates that its growth market is  4 trillion in investable size, and it plans to invest about  40 billion in the next few years.That's 1  of the growth potential through 2025. This opportunity is so large that even when the industry titan drops cash by the tens of billions, it barely makes a dent.That's how big this growth runway is. It's not years long, its decades long.We're not even just talking solar, wind, and batteries. NEE is now breaking into green hydrogen, thanks to tax breaks from the Inflation Reduction Act.Green hydrogen is a potential  3.2 trillion global market by 2030 according to Cummins, and includes such industrial uses as agriculture  fertilizers , refineries, petrochemicals, alternative fuels  like aviation fuel , and even powering forklifts.Yes, NEE might end up helping Amazon run its fast-growing business pretty soonIn total, NEE is expected to invest about  80 billion through 2027 into its regulated and non-regulated businesses, driving around 9  rate-based growth and some of the best overall EPS growth in the sector.NEE has been a Wall Street darling for over a decade, turning 8.3  annual EPS growth into 10  annual dividend growth and then converting that into almost 700  gains in its stock price since 2007.That's courtesy of the multiple expansion you often get when rates seem only to go down, and the growth potential of solar and wind seems almost infinite.NEE is not overvalued for the first time in five years. But that doesn't make it an ultra-value buy, or a very strong buy, or even a strong buy. It's merely a potentially good buy for someone seeking reasonable, though hardly knock your socks off, returns from the green energy utility king. That's about 50  higher return than the S P 500 is expected to deliver.Yes, it can roughly triple your money in a decade, which is great, unless you have inflated expectations that could cause you to panic sell or sell out of disgust at the wrong time.For many years NEE was growing at double digits, fueled by free money and being able to issue new shares at a 20 , 30  or even 40  historical premium.When money is free or virtually free, even utilities' growth rates can be remarkable.Management now expects to deliver about 7  EPS growth and roughly 10  long-term returns at current dividend yields. Why the slower growthThe bond market now doesn't expect any rate cuts until June of 2024 and expects the Fed to still be 4.75  by the end of next year.Just a few months ago, the Fed going to 4.75  at all would have seemed insane, and now the bond market thinks the Fed will go to 5.5  and stay higher for nearly an entire year.NEE doesn't borrow from the Fed, it borrows from bond investors, but you get the idea. The golden era of  there is no alternative  and NEE being able to command a sub 2  yield is done.The days of it minting free money via ATM share issuances are gone for the foreseeable future.NEE's cost of capital is still lower than most utilities, thanks to its A-credit rating. But the days of 10  to 12  growthWith its cost of capital now much higher than when 10-year yields were 0.5 , NEE is now expected to grow around 7  over time. That's still very good for a utility. For context, the REIT industry is growing by about 6 . That's in line with management guidance.Within a minimal margin of error, management never misses guidance, or analyst estimates  which are based on its guidance .NEE is expected to deliver 9  to 10  long-term returns, again, very REIT-like, and a solid return from an A-rated dividend aristocrat industry leader.And given its historical track record, you can be pretty confident you'll earn 9  to 10  returns in the coming years.And that green energy bonanza NEE has as a tailwind means it could potentially sustain above-average growth rates  for a utility  for decades to come.In the short term, through 2025, you might even earn impressive 45  total returns, or about 16 , about 3X what analysts expect from the S P.Over the last 19 years REITs and utilities have done about 9  average annual returns and around 7  to 8  annual returns over 15 year periods.These are pension fund-like returns that this sector is supposed to deliver.NEE  It's averaged 17  annual returns pretty much across every time period. That's compared to the S P 500's 9  to 10  annual returns.Do you know how a utility can deliver almost-Buffett-like returns for 15 years  Fast growth yes, but NEE has grown at 8  to 9  over the last 15 years.It was multiple expansions and a PE that went from 12 to 22 that generated about 25  of those gains. 75  of NEE's total returns over the last 15 years were justified by its yield plus growth.Those are the 12  or so annual returns that are sanctified by the righteousness of fundamentals.The remaining 4  per year  Well, that was speculative mania. Does that mean that NEE must keep falling until it returns to a PE of 12  Or even a 20-year average of 19X  Probably not. The management team has proven that it's the master in green energy, and that it likely will be able to sustain above-average growth rates for decades to come.However, if rates do end up staying higher for longer  Well, then things could get a bit nastier for NEE. And let's take a look at that in the risk section.There are no risk-free companies, and no company is right for everyone. You have to be comfortable with the fundamental risk profile.NextEra Energy has been around for nearly 100 years and has survived interest rates as high as 20  and 10 year treasury yields as high as 16 .The main concern isn't with NEE surviving or being able to service its debt.Bond investors are pricing in just a 0.3  risk of a default within a year and just a 3.5  risk of a default within 30 years.NEE's fundamental risk of bankruptcy has declined 10  over the last three months, according to bond investors.Bond investors were willing to lend tens of millions to NEE for 60 years during the pandemic for 2082 maturing bonds. If they were worried about NEE's ability to survive, they would not do that.When the US Treasury asked bond investors if they'd like 50 or 60-year bonds, the bond market laughed. When NEE asked if anyone wanted to buy 60-year bonds, bond investors couldn't get enough.Note the yield on the 60-year bonds it sold in 2021, 3.8 . Selling a 60-year bond at 3.8  means just a 1.8  inflation-adjusted or real rate.That's basically nothing, as NEE is earning over 10  on its investments. Now it's expected to earn about 7  thanks to a higher rate world.That's still fine, but here's what NEE investors need to understand.NEE's average borrowing cost is 0.76  right now.That's how much it benefited from our freakish low-rate world.NEE's average borrowing cost, including different kinds of bonds like convertibles  aided by a booming stock price , allowed it to lock in a real rate of -1.5 .It could borrow at negative rates and mint money.NEE has a lot of debt maturing in 2024 and 2025. In fact only  30 billion of its  72 billion in total debt matures after 2033. That means NEE is going to have to refinance this debt at much higher rates.How highThe bond market currently thinks that the Fed will cut to 3.75  long term and then stay put. That's the new normal, 3.75 , not 0 .Can NEE handle that  Of course, it's dealt with 20  rates in the past. But is anyone buying NEE in the last ten years ready for almost 4  rates as the  new normal  Only time will tell.How do we quantify, monitor, and track such a complex risk profile  By doing what big institutions do.DK uses S P Global's global long-term risk-management ratings for our risk rating.The DK risk rating is based on the global percentile of a company's risk management compared to 8,000 S P-rated companies covering 90  of the world's market cap.S P's risk management scores factor in things likeSource  DK Research TerminalNEE's risk-management consensus is in the 38  of the world's highest quality companies and similar to that of such other blue-chips asThe bottom line is that all companies have risks, and NEE is average at managing theirs, according to S P.There are no sacred cows. Wherever the fundamentals lead, we always follow. That's the essence of disciplined financial science, the math behind retiring rich and staying rich in retirement.NextEra Energy is a beautiful company, but it's essential to have realistic expectations and not fall in love with any stock.After being a Wall Street darling for so long and earning a green energy halo premium as high as 40 , some investors expect NEE to pull an Nvidia  and rocket back to record highs and beyond the moment it touches fair value.That's not likely. Right now, utilities are out of favor as fears of higher for longer rates have been weighing down the sector for a while, and that's not likely to change.Should you buy NEE right nowThat depends on your goals and needs.Are you looking for a relatively fast-growing utility with rock-solid management, a great balance sheet, and potentially decades of 7  growth ahead of itYes.Are you looking to earn potentially 45  by the end of 2025 and possibly triple the market's returnsThen, yes, NEE suits your needs.If you want a way to earn 16  long-term returns or think that NEE is a coiled spring because it's down 25  off record highsThen you are likely to be disappointed.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,"Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock  The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at  59.5B. This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang, the market didn't seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover, many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance, you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes, transaction costs or asymmetric information about management's intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations. The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the company's future investment opportunities. For example, one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musk's company isn't known for paying dividends but the market  rightly or wrongly  puts a very high value on its investment opportunities.The Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified. Investors pay taxes and transaction costs  a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining management's ability to invest in negative present value projects. Last but not least, many individual and institutional investors simply need current income. You could theoretically generate income from a non-dividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costs.In practice, companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities. Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities . You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of management's confidence in the stability of the business. Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isn't obliged to maintain them in bad years.Importantly, a very high dividend - or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage - doesn't by itself make for a good dividend stock. If anything, leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project. The dividend may also be at risk of being cut, i.e., the stock may be a  dividend trap.At the end of the day, oil   gas is a cyclical industry and producers can't control the price of their output. For this reason, large U.S. independents like Marathon Oil , APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividends.Exxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said, integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays, but it's still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staples.It depends on your time horizon. Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years  this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter   Gamble However, a nice  dividend growth series doesn't mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from -250  to  250 . The financial leverage also tends to yo-yo a bitUnsurprisingly, the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if you're a buy-and-hold investor though  I would say yes. Even if you never sell any stocks, you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever. To illustrate this point, I ran a backtest that assumes you started with  1,000 in January 2001 and invested another  1,000 each month thereafter, all the way through September 2023. I compared Exxon to PG, as a typical consumer staples company, and to Devon , as a more risky, upstream player. I assumed all dividends were reinvestedUltimately, XOM and PG got you to a similar place but arguably PG did so with fewer sleepless nights. A XOM-only portfolio was more stable than Devon but still lacking compared to a pure defensive stock.Here are also the XOM drawdowns underwater periodsIn 20 or so years, there were 3 drawdowns of 25  or greater with underwater periods of 2, 3 and almost 8 years  In contrast, PG had only one drawdown of 25  or more that continued for three and half years.So does this mean XOM is bad dividend stock  No. However, it shows that it should be managed actively.To some extent yes. The  dividend discount model  or DDM is one of the basic valuation tools that can be applied to a dividend paying company. Exxon grew its dividend from  0.23 per quarter to  0.91 over the last 22 years. This implies a CAGR  compound annual growth rate  of about 6.5 . Assuming 10  cost of equity, XOM may be close to its intrinsic value  however, note the sensitivity to minor changes in the growth assumptionWe have been trading in a  100- 120 range for over a year now, so the DDM approach isn't very useful.A simpler approach is to look directly at the dividend yieldHistorically, for Exxon it has averaged about 3 . At the  110 or so stock price now, XOM yields 3.31 . For the yield to converge to its historical average, the stock price would need to appreciate to  120. The caveat is that a 3  yield in a 5  risk-free rate environment isn't the same as a 3  yield when the risk-free rate is close to 0 .The problem with the DDM is that Exxon is a capital intensive business. A dividend paying consumer staples or utility company can focus on maintenance capex with predictable returns. This is why we can base our valuation considerations on the dividend. Exxon certainly has maintenance capex too but oil fields get depleted and new ones need to be discovered and developed. The success of Exxon's business is more sensitive to its capital allocation decisions, whether they are poor, as XTO, or good, as many consider Guyana to have been.Exxon's ROCE  return on capital employed  may therefore be more informative as I have discussed in a different Prior to 2008, Exxon achieved higher ROCE compared to the 2009-2021 period when adjusting for the oil price. It looks that 2022-2023 may have broken away from the  lean  period and are more consistent with the profitable years before 2008. This is why I am bullish long-term on the stock.Tactically, XOM's stock is a bit in no man's land right now. We've been stuck in a  100- 120 range for over a year. I would be more comfortable recommending a buy if we were closer to  100 or moving back up after hitting  100Secondly, in the last few days we have seen another geopolitical conflict unfold, this time in the Middle East and oil went up on the risk premium. However, most geopolitical events start with a spike in oil prices early in the crisis  e.g., 1991 Gulf War, Russia-Ukraine last year  after which the impact fades. Barring an escalation involving more actors that may bring us to WW3  XOM stock won't be my primary concern if that happens , I would expect oil to give up some gains. This may affect XOM's stock price too although it may also not given equities have not fully participated in the latest oil rally.In summary, I do think  140 is possible but I don't have a view if we are going to see  100 or  120 first. Personally, I am long XOM but trimmed 25  of my position at  120 when we failed to break above that level for the third time in a row this year.Wall Street's average target is  132, which makes sense, but note the dispersion around the averageThe  274 by the way seems to be a data feed error. It is the target an analyst  to Pioneer based on a XOM target of  118 and the exchange ratio agreed in the all-stock deal. Nevertheless, the range of forecasts is indeed broad.The short answer is no. The XTO deal didn't derail the upward trajectory in Exxon's dividend and I don't expect the PXD one to do so either. If you seriously consider opening an Exxon position, I encourage you to check out the entire acquisition , but here I will focus on just one slide that shows some of the strategic rationale for the dealWhile Pioneer is known to be one of the U.S. independents with longest shale inventory runway  perhaps 15-20 years , the deal isn't just about the upstream aspect. Pioneer will also be integrated into Exxon's downstream infrastructure which should reduce further the volatility of the combined company's cash flows. So, if something does change, I think it will be greater diversification cash flow stability which is helpful from a dividend perspective - to the extent of course things can ever be  stable  in energy.XOM has been a reliable dividend player but that doesn't mean the dividend was always safe. Investors need to differentiate between ex ante and realized risk. Just because we lucked out doesn't mean things couldn't have gone badly. Currently, XOM's business is improving structurally  higher returns on capital, adjusted for the oil price  so that bodes well for the dividend too.However, while Exxon is much safer as an investment than a pure upstream oil and gas player, it isn't a buy and forget stock. Despite the diversification that comes with the integrated model, energy remains a volatile sector. Even if you never sell stocks, deciding when to buy XOM will be more consequential for your long-term returns compared to the impact of the entry point on an investment in a traditional defensive stock.

I'm So Very Bullish On Canadian Pacific Kansas City,"Roughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled . In that article, IWhile I wasn't planning on writing a follow-up so soon, I just had to cover the just-released quarterly earnings.The report wasn't just a regular quarterly update  it showcased the company's remarkable potential in this tough market. Apart from surpassing expectations, the company also managed to limit the increase in its operating ratio and stuck to a fantastic long-term outlook.It also maintained a positive outlook for the full year, thanks to its consistent growth, and is well-positionedGiven the recent stock price decline, I can also make the case that its valuation has gotten much more juicy.On a side note, I'll sometimes refer to Canadian Pacific Kansas City as Canadian Pacific or CPKC. That's much easier.So, let's get to itI'm impressed by the performance of Canadian rails in this environment. The other day, I  Canadian National's  quarterly results, which saw a mix of headwinds in intermodal and tailwinds in certain bulk segments that are expected to allow the company to keep its full-year earnings decline limited.Canadian Pacific had similar results - just betterIn the third quarter, CPKC generated  3.3 billion in revenue, with a 3  decrease in volumes compared to the previous year. They achieved an operating ratio of 61.7  and a core EPS of  0.92.The operating ratio of 61.7  is way too high. However, given pressures from weakening economic demand and sticky inflation, it's a terrific number in this environment. In this economy, some rails are dealing with high-60  operating ratios, which gives me so much confidence in the way this railroad is dealing with headwinds.While some of the aforementioned numbers may seem poor, it's much more than analysts expected. Consensus  for the company's revenue were roughly  900 million lower. GAAP EPS expectations were  0.26 lower.This is a terrific performance, given the economic environment of declining economic growth.For example, while the leading ISM Manufacturing Index has been in an uptrend lately, it's still in one of the longest periods of contraction since the Great Financial Crisis, after going from expansion to contraction in the second half of last year.On top of that, consumer sentiment is a total mess, as multiple factors, including elevated inflation, rising rates, and student loan uncertainties, are putting tremendous pressure on purchasing power.Having said that, the revenue decline was caused by a 5  decline in total carloads, a 3  decline in revenue-ton-miles  volumes adjusted for distance , and a 1  decline in   per RTM.Please note that these numbers are adjusted for the merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern. Without these adjustments, revenues would have been up 44 , which is a useless number to assess the health of the new railroad.With that in mind, let's take a closer look at the company's transportation segment. This not only tells us a lot about the company's revenue growth and opportunities but also a lot about the markets it serves. That's even interesting for people who may never invest in CP.In the grain business, CPKC saw a 7  increase in revenues due to a 9  growth in RTM.Canadian grain volumes were up 13  thanks to improved harvest conditions, while U.S. grain volumes increased by 6 .Furthermore, the expansion of the destination market reach enabled CPKC to capture new and unique grain flows.While projections for the current Canadian grain crop harvest have decreased, CPKC has the capacity to offset this with shipments of U.S. grain. The U.S. grain market now constitutes over half of CPKC's grain revenues.Note that bulk accounts for 40  of the combined company's 2022 business, which is one of the reasons why I invested in CP  pre-merger . I wanted bulk exposure, and this railroad may have the best bulk business in North America.Continuing with agriculture, potash  which is a fertilizer  revenues declined by 22  as a result of a 28  volume decline.Factors impacting potash volumes included the  at the Port of Vancouver and the continued outage of the Canpotex Portland terminal.Despite these challenges, CPKC expects a strong demand outlook for Q4 and is working to maximize volumes through all available terminals.Revenue in the coal business remained flat despite a 7  volume growth. Favorable comparisons in Q4 and higher met coal prices suggest strong growth in coal for the rest of the year.Moving over to the merchandise business, the energy, chemicals, and plastics portfolio experienced a 3  decline in revenue, primarily due to a 5  volume decrease.This was influenced by a decrease in crude business, partially offset by growth in refined fuels and plastics.However, positive RTM growth is expected in energy, chemicals, and plastics in the fourth quarter.The forest products sector saw a 6  decline in revenues, but CPKC is optimistic about the development of long-haul forest product shipments and the growth of its transload network.In the metals, minerals, and consumer products portfolio, revenues increased by 2 . Metals performed well, while consumer products and frac sand were down.Despite the economic weakness, one sector shines  automotive. Automotive is a fascinating topic, as CPKC not only has access to American automotive producers but also Mexican producers, which comes with tremendous re-shoring and outsourcing opportunities.Revenues in the automotive sector increased by 21  with an 11  volume growth rate.According to the company, the high demand for finished vehicles and challenges in the auto industry have led to strong performance.Now, CPKC is working on improving rail efficiencies and increasing capacity to better serve higher demand.Having said that, one major issue was intermodal transportation.Revenue in the intermodal sector decreased by 19 , thanks to a 10  volume decline.Domestic intermodal volumes were affected by soft market demand, higher inventories, and competitive over-the-road rates  truck versus rail competition .Despite these challenges, CPKC remains optimistic about the uptake of the new 180 181 cross-border service.In the international intermodal space, volumes faced challenges due to the Vancouver port strike and softer demand. CPKC expects near-term headwinds in this sector, as the consumer is simply too weak to allow retailers to boost inventory levels.The company's operating expenses declined by 4 , which was roughly in line with the decline in revenues, causing the increase in the operating ratio to remain limited.Fuel expenses saw a substantial decrease of  86 million  21  when adjusted for currency fluctuations  compared to 3Q22. This drop was driven by lower fuel prices and reduced GTMs compared to the previous year.However, a  188 million headwind resulted from a decline in combined fuel surcharge revenue.Equipment rents, on the other hand, increased by  24 million  34  when adjusted for currency fluctuations , primarily due to higher car payments resulting from the aforementioned automotive volume growth, lower use of CPKC intermodal equipment by other railways, and increased use of pooled equipment.Moving over to cash, CPKC reported cash provided by operating activities of  1,027 million in Q3. The company also reinvested over  700 million during the quarter, consistent with its expectation to invest approximately  2.7 billion in combined capital in 2023.Furthermore, they generated  454 million in adjusted combined free cash flow during the quarter, and year-to-date figures showed that they had generated just under  1.4 billion in free cash flow.Almost all of this free cash flow will go toward debt reduction, as it won't likely engage in buybacks until the end of next year or hike its sub-1  dividend before it has achieved a more favorable leverage ratio.Based on that context, during its earnings call, the company provided insight into its leverage, which is currently at 3.6x  EBITDA  and on a trajectory towards its target leverage of 2.5x, which is when shareholder distributions will accelerate.As we can see in the chart below  based on analyst estimates , the company is expected to reach that leverage number in 2024.Having said that, the company also excelled when it comes to its operations.On a full-year basis, the company expects core adjusted combined diluted  that's a mouth full  EPS to be flat to slightly positive, which would make CPKC the strongest Class I railroad in North America.Furthermore, during the earnings call, the company emphasized that nothing has changed regarding their long-term goals.They anticipate achieving double-digit EPS growth, which aligns with their previous statements.Over the four to five-year guidance period, they plan to increase synergies.In the later years, they expect even stronger performance, driven not only by synergy ramp-up but also by the ability to buy back shares and reduce the share count, leading to EPS accretion.As we can see in the chart below  it's a bit small - my apologies for that , the company is expected to grow its EPS by 20  next year, followed by 18  growth in 2025.Beyond that, it is extremely likely that EPS will continue to grow by double-digits on an annual basis, boosted by synergies, cyclical and secular growth, and buybacks.While the company has the highest forward EV EBITDA multiple, I believe this is fully warranted, as none of its peers are likely to generate long-term double-digit annual EPS growth.The current consensus price target for NY-listed CP shares is  92, which is 32  above the current price.I agree with that price target and believe that CP is poised to outperform its peers on a long-term basis.Needless to say, I'm buying more at current levels and will deploy more cash if temporary economic headwinds pressure the stock further in the months ahead.Despite economic challenges, CPKC managed to surpass expectations, maintaining an impressive outlook for the full year.CPKC's diverse portfolio reveals its resilience and growth potential. The company's strong performance in the automotive sector, coupled with the expansion of grain and coal businesses, signals a bright future.While intermodal transportation faced setbacks, CPKC's strategic moves in the international space show promise.Additionally, CPKC's disciplined approach to expenses and strong cash flow generation is positioning it for long-term success.With a clear path to debt reduction and promising growth prospects, it's no surprise that CPKC stands out among its peers.It remains one of my all-time favorite dividend growth holdings.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Bunge: The Top Pick For Dividend Growth In Agriculture,"The agriculture sector is a minefield for investors looking for consistent dividend capital growth.That's because agriculture is a highly volatile business at the very top of a number of supply chains, including food  obviously  and energy. After all, a lot of cropsHence, the industry tends to come with low margins and a very cyclical nature, which makes it hard to find companies that are able to deliver consistent returns.For long-term investments, I prefer two industries in this sectorIn the second group, I like two stocks, Archer-Daniels-Midland  and , the giant that announced a somewhat groundbreaking merger this year.As I haven't  BG since May, it's time for another deep dive, as I believe that BG is one of the best dividend stocks in this sector. The company is doing tremendously well in a challenging environment. It is investing in growth, the Viterra merger significantly expands its moat, and its valuation is highly attractive.So, let's get to the detailsBunge Limited is a large global agribusiness and food company with vertically integrated operations, spanning from farmers to consumers.The company operates through four main segments  Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy.These segments cover a wide range of activities and are further categorized into Core and Non-core operations that help farmers sell their goods, allow food producers to acquire important input products, and allow for global agriculture trade to move smoothly.Now, the company is taking things to the next level.In June, the company announced the merger with Viterra, the agriculture division of mining giant Glencore .The deal adds new capabilities, allows to capture a bigger part of global agriculture demand, and increases earnings capabilities.For example, whereas Bunge has a major footprint in processing and downstream operations, Viterra is a giant in merchandising and handling.Viterra has more than 270 global storage facilities, the ability to market more than 134 million metric tons of grains, 29 port terminals, and both grain and sugar mills.It also has 15 crushing plants and seven biodiesel plants.Thanks to this deal, BG also acquired a bigger trade footprint in the U.S., Canada, the EU, and Australia. Prior to the merger, it was mainly focused on grain origination in Brazil.The headquarters of the merged company will be in St. Louis, Missouri.BG shareholders will own 70  of the combined company and assume  9.8 billion of Viterra debt, which is associated with  9.0 billion in readily marketable inventories  RMI .Also, as we can see below, while Viterra has more in annual revenues, it has a lower net income and EBITDA, suggesting much lower margins  related to a different footprint in the industry .The combined company will have  17.2 billion in net debt and a net leverage ratio of 1.6x. I believe the combined company will have an investment-grade credit rating, as both Bunge and Viterra are investment-grade companies.This brings me to the Bunge dividend.BG is no high-yield company. It currently pays a  0.6625 per share per quarter dividend. As investors have to pay  106.70 to buy one share, this translates to a yield of 2.5 .If we take a closer look at the overview below, we see that this dividend is protected by a sub-20  payout ratio. The company also has very satisfying grades on its Seeking Alpha dividend scorecard, which means it is scoring favorably compared to its consumer staple peers.Over the past five years, the dividend has been hiked by 6.2  per year - on average.The company has a track record of two consecutive years of dividend growth. If it weren't for the pandemic, the company would have had an uninterrupted streak of dividend growth since the early 2000s, when it started paying a dividend.BG is a play on dividend safety, not dividend growth.I also believe that BG is a great combination with other peers. For example, when combining BG with a stock like PepsiCo   meaning to own both , we own one company that benefits from inflation  Bunge  and one company that benefits from lower inflation  PepsiCo .Since 2002, a 50 50 investment of BG and PEP has returned 9.7  per year. The S P 500 returned 8.2  per year during this period. The market correlation of the 50 50 investment was just 58 . The standard deviation  volatility  was barely higher.This isn't a call to buy PEP. It's just an example of how a company like BG can be integrated into a dividend growth portfolio to mitigate inflation risks.Financially speaking, BG continues to do extremely well.Earnings per share for the second quarter was reported at  4.09, compared to  1.34 in the same period of 2022. Adjusted EPS was  3.72 in the quarter versus  2.97 in the prior year.Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  for the quarter was  893 million compared to  709 million the previous year.In processing, higher results were reflected across all value chains, driven in part by strong Brazil soybean origination, which contributed to higher crush results in Brazil and destination crush operations in Europe and Asia. Results were also higher in the U.S. due to a significant portion of capacity being locked in at higher margins at the beginning of the quarter.In general, earnings are very strong after the post-2020 inflationary period started providing much-needed tailwinds.Furthermore, the company's balance sheet remains rock solid. I already briefly highlighted this in the merger part of this article. The company has  3.6 billion in net debt and more than  7 billion in RMIs  inventories .Thanks to its tailwinds, the company increased its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to at least  11.75 per share, showing confidence in its performance for the rest of the year.During the earnings , the company highlighted its guidance update.Valuation-wise, we're dealing with a very interesting development.Before the surge in inflation, BG shares used to trade close to 16x earnings.Now, shares are trading at less than 9x earnings.The market is either saying that earnings will come down again or that BG is massively undervalued.Undervaluation makes more sense, as current macroeconomic headwinds keep many stocks from trading at the valuations they deserve.If we were to apply a 15x multiple, the stock would  technically speaking  have the potential to return 25  per year through 2025 - despite an expected decline in earnings.The same is visible when looking at the EBITDA multiple. BG is trading at 6.5x NTM EBITDA, which is well below the longer-term median of 9x EBITDA.The current consensus price target is  136, which is 27  above the current price.I do believe that BG is significantly undervalued and in a good spot to generate long-term outperforming returns in an environment of sticky inflation, strong agriculture margins, and the massive potential it has to enhance the margins of the Viterra business in the future.The problem is that the market is nervous. Economic growth is declining, the Fed has to maintain high rates to fight inflation, and credit markets are showing cracks.This could keep BG from reaching the valuation it  likely  deserves.Investors interested in owning BG may be better off buying in intervals. If the stock keeps dropping, investors can average down. If the stock takes off, investors have a foot in the door.Also, consider how BG might fit into your portfolio before buying. As I said, it makes a great addition for portfolios with consumer defensive exposure that does well when inflation is low.Bunge stands out as a powerhouse with its vertically integrated operations, and its recent merger with Viterra positions it for global agriculture demand capture.Despite its modest dividend yield, BG's strong financials, undervaluation, and potential for long-term growth make it an attractive prospect for investors seeking stability in an unpredictable market.When it comes to dividends, BG may not be a high-yield player, but its sub-20  payout ratio and impressive dividend growth record make it an appealing choice for dividend safety.Moreover, combining BG with stocks like PepsiCo can provide a unique hedge against inflation.Given economic risks, I suggest interested investors buy gradually.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Shell: Out Of The Doghouse,"One of the first articles I authored in Seeking Alpha was on  , . It was a natural for me to cover the company, as I had worked closely with themSenior Shell management began to utter blather like this in . If you can follow this unintelligible gobbledygook, you're a step ahead of me.Then-CEO Ben van Beurden just said they were going to sell less oil and gas,  Ok, so I followed it. . This was the one thing they were really good at, with a skill and finesse developed over 100 years of experience. Shell and I were in business together. I had given them some capital, their job was to give me a regular return on it. When you find out a partner isn't who you thought they were, that your capital might be diminished, you change partners. I sold out of Shell the next day.Shell has new leadership now. Wael Sawan, who took over as Shell CEO in Q4 of last year, significantly moderated the tone of the company in his first outing, and was  espousing a realistic view of the energy path forward-That is an encouraging standpoint that embraces the company's core strengths, and as a potential investor compels a new appraisal of the company. I can work with that.Shell's pivot back to a rational, more balanced approach to energy delivery is encouraging. It reminds me of what a powerhouse company it is in the gas and deepwater markets. Shell is the biggest producer and explorer in the GoM, and has made one of the most significant . It also revalidates a huge decision that Shell  under Ben Van Beurden  made years ago to buy . That added  20 bn in cash to debt, and about 1.8 bn shares to their float.  Shell Float  2015-6.4 bn shares, 2016-8.2 bn shares .Much of the financial impact of the BG buy is still carried on the , but on the good side of things, so are the gas reserves that came along with it. Shell is heavily leveraged to LNG with its LNG Canada liquefaction plant in Kitimat, Canada, and the .All but the most Lenin-esque climate radicals will grant there is a long-term role for gas in the  Energy Transition.  More moderate voices, even our current leadership, sees the need for gas as a  bridge  fuel. The future of LNG is underpinned by this reality, and as the hollow promise of most renewables - solar and wind in particular - begins to wreak havoc with the energy grid, gas should remain in high demand for base load capacity. LNG is here to stay, and that bodes well for Shell.One negative you can note in the slide below for Shell is their lack of quick-turnaround shale reserves, as the Van Beurden regime in a fit of induced madness from the  sold their Delaware acreage to ConocoPhillips  for  9.5 bn. The company has a massive  45 bn cash balance that should be burning a hole in their pockets.This pivot is timely. Shell's oil and gas production was 12 and 15  lower respectively , vs 2021. That is not a favorable trend and moves their capital cost to produce oil and gas about  3.00 per BOE higher in '22 vs. '21 using BOE production and Capex expenditures for those years. Whatever other metric you use EV EBITDA-which is a function of prices, or flowing barrel valuation-again, a function of prices, Shell's unit cost is rising and that's a bad thing in a commodity business. It shows up in their Cost of Revenues as well. For Q2 2023, this ran 77 , for Q1 2023 it ran 74 , for Q4 2022 it was 71 . This is a snapshot of a small sampling that can be impacted by a lot of things, but it's also impacted by capital costs and they are going up. Things need to turn around. And, with  45 bn they could make a tasty bite out of one of the E P's on the  graph below.Hess , Devon Energy , and Diamondback Energy  are performing at a higher level than Shell, and could be bought with Shell's cash hoard. Not that Shell necessarily would plunk down all that cash - although I think we can agree, they should be doing something with it. They could follow the Exxon Mobil  route and just print stock for most of it. One way or another, Shell needs short cycle barrels.Food for thought anyway.Shell's focus will be in areas where they have  advantaged capabilities,  meaning installed infrastructure to leverage new production. Shell notes they have very low breakeven costs in the range of  30 per barrel for these projects, which put them firmly in the black even under bearish price scenarios. GoM crude is in high demand by refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast, due to its mid-30's gravity. Shell is also a big operator and retailer in Brazil.  I used to buy my gas at Posto Shell on Avenida das Americas in Barra de Tijuca, just south of Rio.Shell is also able to take the host designed for Vito and replicate it for similar deep water projects, each project learning from the last. Should Sparta  formerly TotalEnergies'  North Platte  get FID'd, the upfront engineering cost will be lessened.With its footprint in convenience fueling stations across North America, South America, Asia, and Europe, Shell is in a premium spot to leverage electric vehicle  EV  charging as it grows in importance. Shell projects  1.5 bn in EBTIDA from this source by 2030. There is no question EV charging will become a major revenue generator in the near future, and I think Shell is doing the right thing to gear up for it.Other renewable pathways for Shell on the way to 2030. Most of this is too nascent to discuss here, but provides a look into the company's thinking.No one is coming out and saying it right now, but Namibia's offshore reserves, now estimated at , could set the stage for this country to become the next Guyana. As  put out by the National Oil Company of Namibia, aka NAMCOR, shows, dozens of companies are participating in this emerging boom. It's no secret any longer that drilling on either side of the Atlantic Margin is guiding exploratory drilling on either side, and causing geologists to reassess what they think they know about it. The slide below shows the Atlantic Margin relationships between the Latin American side and the West African side.Shell has completed its  with a successful show of hydrocarbons, and has 10 more delineation wells permitted.Could Namibia become a million barrel a day producer for Shell, the way Guyana has for Exxon Mobil  The companies are pretty tight-lipped as of now, but the early results are interesting.Shell is big enough that it is a frequent target for the Climatocultists. The Dutch court decision made that clear. Shell has redomiciled to the UK, but there is no shortage of Green anti-fossil fuel crusaders in ol' Blighty. Adverse legislative impacts cannot be ruled out.Shell has rallied from the mid- 40's a year ago, staying mostly in the upper- 50's to low  60's during that time. Currently the company is near the upper end of its recent range.If Shell were to make a big acquisition using stock, current holders, would be diluted. In the case of XOM, shareholders are taking a 15  hit.I think Shell plc stock is investable with the current management's commitment to rational hydrocarbon development. Oil and gas still pay the bills around Shell and it's nice to hear some recognition of that as a prospective shareholder. As previously noted, new CEO Wael Sawan has modified the corporate rhetoric and shown himself willing to stand up to the fringe elements demanding sharp cuts in petroleum output. I am letting Shell out of the DDR dog house.Analysts rank , with a price target range of  60-88.00 per share. The median is  75, suggesting that most of the seagulls view the company as having some tailwinds in a higher oil price scenario. On an EV EBITDA basis the company is stunningly cheap at 2.47X, but fairly pricey at  108K per BOE. As noted, Shell has an incredible  45 bn in cash on its balance sheet, and if I was a shale CEO at Devon, EOG , or Diamondback on down, I would be feeling the hot breath of Wael Sawan on my neck.For reference, key competitor BP  trades at 2.36X and  106K per BOE, suggesting it too needs to up daily output. , sweetening the deal still further.The analyst cadre is calling for  1.86 per share in Q3, with would put Net Income in the  15 bn range and imply EBITDA in the neighborhood of  35 bn. Put a one-year run rate on that and Shell's multiple drops to 1.5X. To keep the multiple at 2.46 the shares will have to rerate toward  85 each, implying significant upside. It's understood this is all contingent on Brent staying above the  80 level .Shell announced a  3 bn share buyback in conjunction with its earnings release. That's about 50 mm shares, so not a real dent in their current float. It also raised the dividend to  2.31 a share and will likely continue this practice with the cash flows it's experiencing now.All of that said, if we get any significant pullback in Shell plc stock, it should definitely be viewed as a buying opportunity. I would probably set my entry point around  60, and encourage investors with modest risk tolerance looking for growth and increasing income to consider doing the same.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Lake Area Corn Processors: High Dividend, Low Volatility Company You've Been Looking For","Lake Area Corn Processors  is a South Dakota-based firm that produces ethanol, corn oil, and distillers grains. 75  of their revenue is derived from ethanol production and sales with the remainder coming from distillers dried grains, distillers modified wet grains, and corn oil. ThroughLKCRU shares are traded OTC and can either be purchased directly through  or through major brokerages. LKCRU shares are not actively traded on the open market  however, holding units does offer the benefit of a high dividend distribution yielding 28 . Because of the low liquidity due to the lack of an active trading market, I provide LKCRU shares a HOLD rating with a price target of  4.25 share based on the substantial distribution.Lake AreaThough this figure sounds miniscule, it has yielded Lake Area Corn Processors  295mm in revenue for the trailing four quarters with an EBITDA of  10mm for a margin of 9 . The two main costs in their production are corn and natural gas. Given this, Lake Area Corn Processors is well hedged in their two biggest commodity inputs with commitments to purchase 6.1mm bushels of corn at an average price of  6.16 bushel and 1,304,000mmBtu of natural gas at an average price of  3.65 MMBtu. Given the current price of  of corn and natural gas futures priced below , Lake Area Corn Processors  hedge book is expected to be reporting a loss for the duration of the year.Lake Area Corn Processors markets their products through a 3 party, Renewable Products Marketing Group, whom Lake Area has a 5  equity stake in. This partnership works to their benefit in which RPMG brings their products to the broader market that is typically traded through forwards and futures contracts.Corn oil is a byproduct of ethanol production and is a  20mm business for Lake Area Corn Processors. This product is typically sold to refineries as an alternative input to soybean oil for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel. As the refining industry more heavily focuses on renewable diesel for the automotive industry, prices for corn oil and soybean oil should respond positively. According to their SEC reports, corn oil prices will respond positively to price increases in soybean oil.Distillers grain is their other byproduct from the production of ethanol. Distillers grain produces  15mm in revenue for Lake Area Corn Processors and is typically used as animal feed. The firm produces two types of distillers grain, modified wet and dry grains. Modified wet is typically sold to local markets as the product has limited storage life. Dry grains can be sold on a broader scale as it can be transported and stored for longer periods of time. Their biggest export markets include Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam.Lake Area Corn Processors  business is heavily dependent on the macro and geopolitical environment. Through the E10 regulation, 10  of fuel must be blended with ethanol. In total, the US consumes roughly 135b gallons of gasoline each year, equating to 13.5b gallons of ethanol. Given the static growth in fuel blends and fuel consumption, the industry dubs this as the  blend wall  as the market will generally neither grow nor shrink without public policy or an exogenous event. This creates a major challenge for ethanol producers in the long-run as fuel sources turn to more environmentally friendly fuels, such as hydrogen or battery electric. As discerned in  on PHINIA , hydrogen-fueled commercial trucks are expected to grow at a rapid rate beginning in 2027 and reach 850,000 vehicles on the road by 2035. Though this will represent roughly 6.5  of the total commercial vehicles on the road, it will take part in moving the needle for fuel consumption. The same can be said for electric vehicles. , 8.6  of US new car sales through August 2023 were electric vehicles.Another challenge outlined by management is the increase in ethanol production in anticipation of country-wide E15 fuel standards. In June 2019, the Trump administration approved the use of E15 year-round  however, the rule was challenged in court and revised to make E15 unavailable in certain markets during certain times of the year. A February 2023 proposed rule that will prevent E15 use during summer months starting in 2024 was brought forth by the EPA, making the higher blends more challenging to market.Higher fuel blends may be a challenge. According to a  published by Reuters on February 14, 2022, the National Academy of Sciences found that corn-based ethanol fuel blends have been found to be 24  more carbon intensive than pure gasoline, completely contradicting previous research commissioned by the USDA. Whether this study has any effect on the ethanol market has yet to be seen, but it could potentially be impactful to fuel blends as decarbonization becomes heavily focused upon by the automotive and energy industries.On the geopolitical front, tariffs have become a bigger challenge for producers as China implemented an anti-dumping rule on distillers grains back in 2016 and has extended this tariff through 2028 with a tax premium of 66 . Brazil has done much of the same for ethanol with a 16  tariff through 2023, rising to 18  in 2024. This will likely result in limited-to-no exports of ethanol to Brazil unless the tariffs are lifted.One piece of regulation Lake Area Corn Processors has on their side is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standards which creates a baseline requirement for the amount of renewable fuels produced each year. The EPA began regulating this market in 2022 and may continue the renewable requirements going forward.One of the biggest challenges faced with this regulation is that the EPA may further increase the non-corn-based renewable fuel requirements as cellulosic biofuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions by -60  when compared to corn-based fuels  alleged -20 . The ethanol industry as a whole has raised concerns that their 20  target may not be met based on the environmental impact model used to measure emissions.This has created some challenges for Lake Area Corn Processors as environmental compliance costs increased from  182k in FY22 to an expected  240k for FY23. Whether this charge increases for years to come is to be determined  however, an article cited by Reuters may be the silver lining.Given the macro effects on the firm s operations, it is prudent to include management s market sensitivity metrics to fully understand the effects of price swings.To summarize this, a 10  price change in ethanol will lead to a 7  increase decrease in total revenue. A 10  price change in bushels of corn affects COGS by 8  and a 10  price swing in the cost of natural gas will affect COGS by less than 1 .Though the outlook for ethanol production is a mixed bag, the firm can be valued similar to the tobacco industry or the midstream industry in which they can continue to produce to meet market demand and distribute proceeds to unitholders. It s challenging to infer any growth opportunities in this market as fuel utilization changes, whether it s through battery-electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, hybrid vehicles, or just better fuel economy ICE vehicles. I don t believe there will be any immediate changes and that this will be a slow burn. Regardless of the outlook, the changing market might create a new market opportunity for Lake Area Corn Processors through the use of corn oil and feedstock.Being a unitholder of LKCRU comes with its perks, including a stable share-base and a distribution upwards of 75  of net income. The downside risk to holding units includes low liquidity in the public market, limited to no exposure to institutional investors, and the potential challenges in exiting a position. The firm has a market cap of  125mm and is valued at 5x EV EBITDA. The trailing annualized dividend rate as of q2 23 came in at  1.21 for a yield of 28 , which has the ability to both make up for muted capital gains and offers a stable source of income through a turbulent market.The dividend has paid out relatively high in recent years. Despite the distribution paid in FY22 exceeding net earnings, Lake Area Corn Distributors did hold an excess amount of cash to allocate to unitholders in place of operating cash flow.Two directors of the firm, Todd Brown and Lloyd Hansen Randall acquired 5,000 and 7,500 units, respectively, in October. Todd Brown had also previously increased his holdings by 11,500 units in July to increase his ownership to 423,000 units, or a 1.4  ownership in the firm. With the information provided, I give LKCRU stock a HOLD recommendation with a price target of  4.25 share.Given how challenging collecting information LKCRU has been, here are a few links relating to the firm  , , Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Tesla announces pay raise for German plant workers amid union dispute,"Tesla  announced on Thursday its plans to offer an increase in compensation to employees working at its German manufacturing facility, where unions have voiced concerns about wage levels falling below industry standards.The U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer disclosed that itIn contrast to many other automotive manufacturers in Germany, Tesla currently lacks a formal collective bargaining agreement governing wage structures. Under the terms of last year's collective bargaining agreement, employees at Volkswagen , Mercedes-Benz , and BMW  were granted a 5.2  pay raise in June 2023, along with an additional 3.3  wage hike scheduled for 2024. Full-time workers were entitled to an inflation premium of 3,000 euros  3,160 .The situation has sparked concerns from the German labor union, IG Metall, which has asserted that Tesla's wage offerings have consistently lagged approximately 20  behind those outlined in the established collective bargaining agreement.Currently employing around 11,000 individuals at its German facility, Tesla is gearing up for an extensive expansion plan set to commence in the first half of the upcoming year. This expansion aims to double the plant's battery capacity and overall vehicle production.IG Metall has reported that Tesla communicated the impending pay raise to its workforce through a series of meetings held at the plant during the past week. These meetings were organized in response to the union's intentions to visit the site and inform employees about potential union membership.Last year, the -led company raced past BMW to take the top spot in U.S. luxury car sales. And, in Germany, where Tesla is producing vehicles outside Berlin, the company is seeking approval to double the plant s capacity to around one million cars a year. Tesla  will post its financial results for the third quarter of 2023 after market close on October 18.",47,2023-10-12T16:25:15.000-04:00

Medical Properties Trust: Why I Am Selling At The Lows And Downgrading To 'Strong Sell',"Medical Properties Trust  is an example of just how bad things can go wrong for a net lease REIT when things go wrong. At this point, investors should no longer be focused on valuation given the elevated risk ofWhile all netI  MPW in October of 2022 where I rated the stock a buy on account of the 11  yield. I obviously greatly regret this and my other buy recommendations on the stock. Net lease REITs offer the potential of solid dividend income, but tenant health  and high leverage  is the main harbinger of bad news. In August of this year, MPW finally bit the bullet and  to just  0.60 per share annualized. The stock is once again trading at an 11  yield based on the new dividend amount, but I am now of the view that the problems here go far beyond just the potential of another dividend cut.There are many other articles on MPW that thoroughly cover the company. In this report, I will focus primarily on the reasons for my sales and ratings downgrade. First, MPW has a large amount of debt maturing over the coming years.  446 million is maturing in 2024 at 3.6  average interest rate,  1.4 billion in 2025 at a 2.7  average interest rate,  2.9 billion in 2026 at a 4.2  average interest rate, and  1.6 billion in 2027 at a 5.2  average interest rate.MPW will likely have to refinance these debt maturities at double-digit yields if interest rates remain this high. Just as one example, the 4.625  coupon bonds maturing in August 2029 are yielding 11.6  as of recent trading. At a 11.6  refinanced yield, MPW would see a drag of  35 million,  124.6 million,  214.6 million, and  102 million in 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.MPW is expected to earn around  1.57 in FFO per share for the full year, implying around  1.10 in AFFO per share after accounting for straight-line rents. That implies around  658 million in full-year AFFO. We have just calculated  476 million in drag from refinancing debt through 2027 alone. Given that MPW has cut its dividend, can it use retained cash flow to pay down debt instead  After deducting around  360 million in projected dividend payments, we arrive at approximately  298 million in retained cash after the dividend - and I note that the actual number may be less given that MPW accepted equity in lieu of cash from tenant PHP holdings  which totaled  68 million in the second quarter . We can see that  interest and rent receivables  have been increasing in recent years  it stood at  62 million year to date .That  298 million in retained cash flow is arguably not enough given the drag outlined above and in itself is a clear signal that MPW is likely to cut its dividend sometime next year in anticipation of its 2025 maturities. Some readers may be wondering why MPW is seeing so much refinancing risk - shouldn't other REITs see similar struggles  Absolutely, but MPW has a far higher leverage ratio than most REITs as well as a high concentration of maturing debt within a short period of time.There's more, though. If the prospect of dwindling cash flows due to refinancing debt isn't hard enough, investors should also keep a close watch on potential debt covenant risk. As of the latest quarter, financial leverage stood at 50.3 .As stated in one of the   all the prospectuses that I checked had similar language , MPW is restricted from issuing debt if it would lead to financial leverage being  greater than 60  of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries.  With financial leverage already close to that 60  number, this means that in the event of any asset value write-downs, MPW may suddenly find its financial flexibility severely limited as it would be unable to increase its leverage ratio  meaning, for example, that stock dilution at lows may be on the drawing board .At first glance, MPW looks deeply undervalued at around 3.5x FFO. Even after deducting straight-line rent, the stock trades at around 5x AFFO, still a notable discount to peers. Investors looking to buy  deep value  stocks should look beyond sticker valuations. For instance, the put options of MPW are pricing in extreme downside - the  1 strike put options expiring in January 2025 are selling for around  0.14 each. Short interest stands at above 20 . Wall Street is clearly expecting a big downside ahead and appears to have labeled this stock as an obvious short.We also mustn't forget the high debt load. As of the latest quarter, there was  9.5 billion of net debt for an enterprise value of around  12.5 billion. Placed against  1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, that implies an EV to EBITDA multiple of 9x, but after accounting for straight-line rent, that number jumps to 11x. Suddenly the stock does not look so cheap against peers like Spirit Realty , which trades at 13x and is not financially distressed. Enterprise Products Partners , a consistent distribution payer in the pipeline sector, trades at 10x EBITDA. While we're on the topic of peer comparables, my top pick in the REIT sector NewLake Capital  trades at under 8x AFFO with a net cash balance sheet position  and a 12  dividend yield . My point is  MPW is still not that cheap here.If we exclude equity value, the debt of MPW is worth around 8.6x EBITDA. That is not quite egregious but in this higher interest rate environment, an 11  liquidation yield is not  that crazy,  and would imply zero residual value for equity holders.What might be the downside catalyst  besides the refinancing of debt maturities outlined above  MPW has high tenant concentration with around 20  of its revenues coming from Steward Healthcare and 20  coming from Prospect Medical Holdings.We do not have the latest audited financials for Steward Health Care, but , the company had slim profit margins and a highly leveraged balance sheet. It stands within reason to expect that the company  and many of the other tenants  may also face issues with refinancing debt maturities, and I am doubtful that MPW will be able to offer the same cash support to its tenants as it did in the past given its own tight financial position. I am less pessimistic about the outlook for the tenants given the recession-resistant nature of medical expenses, but the main point here is that MPW is already facing issues from its own balance sheet - any further issues from its tenants may pressure its covenants and its ability to issue more leverage.The stock is cheap and can work out if interest rates suddenly plummet and MPW is able to reduce leverage through equity sales. But outside of that moonshot scenario, my mathematical analysis indicates that both the dividend and cash flows are likely to come under extreme pressure in just a handful of years. I am downgrading the stock to  strong sell  as Wall Street appears to have been right on this stock all along, and remains right today. The stock looks cheap on a dividend yield and FFO basis, but this is a debt problem with potentially dire consequences for equity holders.After a historic valuation reset, the growth investing landscape has changed.

"United Auto Workers calls for strike at 38 GM, STLA locations; progress in Ford talks","The United Auto Workers said it has made significant progress in its talks with Ford  as it called for strikes at 38 General Motor  and Stellantis  locations.We ve made some real progress at Ford, Union President Shawn FainSTLA and GM negotiations remain problematic, Fain said.The union called for strikes at 38 U.S. locations starting at 12pm ET. Strikes at Ford's  Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, General Motors'  Wentzville Assembly Plant in Missouri, and Stellantis'  Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio continue.Among the agreements made with Ford  are the reinstatement of a cost-of-living allowance, the elimination of a wage tier and the right to strike. Fain said GM and STLA have rejected job security and profit-sharing proposals, among others.If Ford  were to work out a deal, the expectation is that GM would trail closely behind. F is up  on Friday, GM is up and STLA rose .However, a potential plan by Stellantis  to close or sell up to 18 facilities in the U.S. could complicate its process. Bank of America analyst John Murphy said Stellantis  may look to the European Union to utilize excess capacity to replace U.S. unibody capacity and may leverage capacity in Mexico and Canada for body-on-frame trucks to avoid the tariff on light trucks.The UAW also took action against a key Mercedes-Benz AG  supplier on Thursday, with about 190 workers with ZF Chassis walking out of their jobs in Alabama.

"Global spending on power grids must double to meet climate goals, IEA says","Annual global investments in power grids must double by 2030 if governments around the world are going to reach their climate and clean energy commitments, according to a new .Global spending on renewables hasNearly 50M miles of new or refurbished power lines - the equivalent of the existing global grid - will be needed by 2040 in order to integrate the planned increases in electricity generation from renewable sources, and allow for the phaseout of fossil fuels, according to the report.Grids are becoming a bottleneck for transitions to net zero emissions,  the IEA said, as infrastructure investment and regulatory reform delays could cause economies to increase their dependence on fossil fuels, slowing the energy transition.According to the report, renewable projects with at least 3,000 GW of power are waiting for connections to national grids, the equivalent to 5x the amount of solar and wind capacity added globally in 2022.Without sufficient grid investment and regulatory support for clean energy solutions,  grids risk becoming the weak link of clean energy transitions,  the IEA warned.ETFs  , , , , , , , , ",141,2023-10-21T20:25:00.000-04:00

More on this below in the subsection dedicated to the company.Second, if you think my total costs are too high, then take a look at the Total Costs for Albemarle  with its integrated production from the best brine and spodumene deposits in the world.  This may be the topic of a future article for me.  Moreover, Albemarle's 2027 targets imply a total cost of  19,000 per tonne. Under these economic scenarios, these projects still end up with net margins in the mid-20  to mid-30  range. My broader, long-term view on the lithium industry is that we are going to see higher prices and higher costs than consensus.Australian-based Green Technology Metals is targeting an ambitious, multi-deposit, integrated project in Ontario.Green Tech is led by CEO Luke Cox who was involved in the development of the Wodgina spodumene deposit in Australia. The  boasts Chairman John Young who was co-founder and Executive Director of Pilbara Minerals  PLS.AX  and Executive Director Cameron Henry who helped Primero Group earn recognition for its expertise in developing lithium processing facilities around the world. otesBeyond this, Lithium Americas has taken a 5  stake in the company and I can envision them eventually trying to partner or buy the company to expand their North American footprint beyond Thacker Pass.I have estimated initial CAPEX of  2.5 billion for Green Tech to deliver its fully integrated goals. This could be aggressive and is the key risk to my view. The company will soon deliver a preliminary economic assessment which will shine light on this, followed by a feasibility study next year which provide even more details. The individual investor will most likely have time to pull the trigger quickly when these details are announced before a potential big swing up or down in the shares. Although, with a  70m market cap, I don't see much downside and the shares are approaching longer term support. Here is the log chartThe Directors and Management own a little over 7  of the company.The U.S. does not have any significant amount of domestic lithium production. Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is destined to change that. Its recent separation from Lithium Argentina reflects how seriously management is taking the U.S. move to develop its own domestic supply chain.LAC's  300  million cash position speaks loudly for the strength of its leadership team. President   CEO John Evans previously held executive and operational management roles with FMC's lithium division  as an interesting aside, he just sold a big chunk of Lithium Argentina  shares . VP of Growth   Product Strategy Rene Leblanc is highly regarded. He has 17 years of experience in lithium process development, operations, and battery supply chain development including with FMC's lithium division and with Tesla .LAC has  a lithium testing facility in Nevada which Mining.com notedThis is not something that a Junior does unless they have serious technical capabilities. The reference to  is also interesting as it speaks to the longer term ambitions of the company.LAC's technical capabilities could eventually be further leveraged through an eventual acquisition of Green Tech. Its management has a history of making wise, strategic investments in Resources on the cheap  e.g., Arena Minerals, Millennial Lithium, and Green Tech  instead of buying high with shareholder capital at the top like Albemarle with Liontown and Patriot.LAC as a 2-phase strategy to produce 80,000 tonnes of LCE in Nevada using commonly used  i.e., highly likely to work  processing technologies and not some unproven  i.e., gimmick  process which is an important consideration, especially since this will likely be the world's first major clay project.General Motors  is the largest shareholder and Thacker Pass may end up being a significant source of Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  compliant lithium for its domestic EV supply chain.Brine projects get no respect in the current market environment and Australian-based Galan has the highest grade brine resource in Argentina. Its flagship project Hombre Muerto project sits adjacent to the other producing Hombre Muerto projects controlled by Livent , Alkem  AKE.AX  AKE.TO , and POSCO . Galan's Board includes Non-Executive Director Daniel Jimenez who has 28 years of experience with lithium major SQM . Its management team includes lithium consulting, exploration, and geological expertise from time spent at Alkem, Lake Resources , NEO Lithium, and SQM.Galan's strategy is to gradually scale production to 60,000 tonnes. This will take quite some time and brine expansions are notorious for taking longer than expected. Because of this, I'm only targeting the 20,000 tonnes of LCE from the first phase of production but also significantly less CAPEX.The Directors and Management own 13  of the company.Everyone who reads financial news knows who Australian-based Liontown is now. I have them ranked  4 due to limited valuation upside, but they have a huge high grade Resource at Kathleen Valley and strong management. Their only weakness would seem to be the technical capability required to integrate and produce the refined product. Albemarle would have been a logical acquirer in this respect. Hancock Prospecting won't help here. At present, the company is analyzing a potential downstream partnership with Sumitomo  , as stated Liontown is expected to ship its first ore soon so time is running out on this company continuing to be included in my junior list. This is one to keep an eye on longer term though.A solid 17  of shares are held by the Board and Management.Shares of Patriot soared last year after significant high grade drill results at its Corvette project in James Bay, Quebec led to an Inferred spodumene Resource which is now the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Note that the Resource size I used above is only a higher grade portion of the overall, much larger Resource.Patriot is Chaired by Ken Brinsden who was previously the CEO of Pilbara Minerals and thus knows a lot about building a large scale spodumene operation. Like Liontown, Patriot doesn't have any notable technical expertise when it comes to refined lithium processing and a potential takeover would likely be the best option for shareholders. Moreover, this appears to be the strategy of the company, keep drilling to define a very large, high-grade Resource and then sell out. A lot of this is baked into the valuation cake.Patriot has yet to produce an economic study. Importantly, this will shine some light on the potential capital costs to develop the project. Patriot can likely benefit from hydroelectric power but it is in Northern Quebec which could present labor challenges.Board and management only owns about 2  of the company.My rational for ranking Patriot a sell is  1  rich valuation,  2  uncertainties remaining around project economics and permitting challenges, namely around the requirement to partially drain a lake, and  3  lack of any path to becoming an integrated producer  on its own . This is definitely one to watch though because once solid amount economic studies have been completed, a buyer could quickly emerge. Potential acquirers have to be cognizant of the former Nemaska disaster in Quebec where there was an embarrassing lack of due diligence completed. This could lead to a slower acquisition process.Lithium shares are in free fall but a nice buying opportunity is coming. Two gauges that I am watching to help me determine when are the  log charts of Albemarle and Mineral Resources   MIN.AX , shown hereAlbemarle has huge long-term support at  110 which points to the potential for another  20  or so of downside given the downside momentum that we are seeing.Just like Albemarle, MinRes also has about 20  more downside to its significant long-term support. I also eyeballed the monthly charts of SQM and Pilbara Minerals and they have similar downside potential.I think long-term investors should consider initial or additional stakes in Green Tech, LAC, and Galan as this bottoming process occurs.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Something Will Break Soon,"It seems every time you believe 2023 can't possibly get more bizarre, some unknown deity says ''. Last week, weAs far as the market is concerned, the NASDAQ managed to ride a huge rally Friday to post a gain of 1.6  for the week. The S P 500 also broke a four-week losing streak with just under a half percent gain. However, breadth in the market was lousy, as it has been for mostThe Russell 2000 was off two percent for the week and the small cap index is now in the red for the year. Only two  Technology and Healthcare  of the 11 sectors in the S P were up on the week with the energy sector getting shellacked thanks to a better than  7 a barrel drop in oil during the week.During the week, the yield on the 10-Year Treasury moved past the 4.8  mark for the first time since just before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. Average mortgage rates also hit their highest levels since the beginning of this century. This pushed housing affordability to all-time lows. A  500,000 home is now approximately  1,400 a month more  than it would have been with a three percent mortgage that was being handed out like candy through most of 2020 and 2021.Jamie Dimon of  was out earlier this month  that Chairman Powell might have to take the Fed Funds rate all the way up to 7  to crush inflation. I do not believe that will be the case as I think that if the Federal Reserve takes interest rates up to six percent or even leaves them where they are now for a significant amount of time, it will push the country into a recession. This, in turn, will crush inflation and allow interest rates to eventually come down. Unfortunately, the economy and the markets will bear the pain of the coming economic contraction.However, it is hard to see a scenario where inflation gets to the Fed's official two percent target any other way. Interest rates where they are already are playing havoc across the economy and the full impacts of recent rate-hikes are not even fully reflected yet. Something that is called monetary lag.Now higher interest rates are and will continue to have significant impacts across the consumer discretionary space, which I recently covered ''.I have also covered the coming debacle in commercial real estate due to higher interest rates many times on these pages starting with an article entitled '' A quick synopsis of the CRE space is that some  2.5 trillion of CRE loans need to be rolled over during the next five years at much higher interest rates. Roughly 30  of that is against office properties, where asset values are imploding in major cities across the U.S. This is due largely to explosion of the virtual workforce since the pandemic as well as well-documented crime surges since then as well in places like San Francisco, New York City and Chicago.Delinquency rates on loans tied to office buildings shot up to 5.58  in August, according to , after starting 2023 below the two percent threshold. The best-case scenario is that increasing write offs will cause some sort of '' as banks pull back on lending and raise credit criteria further. The worst-case scenario is anybody's guess at this point.However, the impact on the federal government budget of higher interest rates has not garnered nearly the attention in the media that it deserves.Through the first 11 months of the federal government's fiscal year  ending September 30th , the interest cost to service the Federal debt was  808 billion, some  130 billion more than the same period a year ago. Given the Federal Reserve has to refinance approximately 30  of the  33 trillion in federal debt over the next 12 months and just over half of it over the next three years, the number is likely move substantially higher in the years ahead. To put this in context, the United States spent only  376 billion to service all of its debt in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. The U.S. will pay more interest on its debt in FY2023 than its massive military  if one wants to look at it another wayGDP grew at roughly two percent in the first half of the year and is likely to do the same or slightly better when the initial third quarter GDP estimate comes out at the end of the month. However, a good portion of this 'growth' has been powered by massive government spending programs  Ex, The CHIPs Act, The Inflation Reduction Act, etc... . To enable this, the government has added some  2 trillion to the national debt just in the four months since the debt ceiling was lifted.Obviously, this isn't sustainable and frankly is downright scary given we are not even in a recession yet. I expect fourth quarter GDP to be down from the third quarter and believe we will see negative economic growth in the first half of 2024, much like the U.S. experienced in the first half of 2022 when the central bank first began lifting its Fed Funds rates. Except this time around, there will be no new huge government spending programs to help reverse the economic direction. Therefore, I think overall GDP growth in FY2024 will be negative.Obviously, the markets are not priced for that scenario. As investors give up their hopes for a '', equities will head down from current levels. This is why half my portfolio is short term treasuries that currently yield 5.5 . I also think we will see at least a 20  pull back in the S P 500 from its recent peak levels on July 31st. This would put us roughly at the 3,700 level on the S P 500.Anticipating this, I built up a solid holding of out of the money, long-dated bear put spreads against the  in June and July when the  traded in a range of just 12-14 during those months. They were cheap '' as they will pay out 8 to 12 to 1 if my prediction of a 20  decline in the S P 500 comes to fruition by next summer. A scenario whose likelihood seems to be growing each week in recent months as higher interest rates continue to take a cumulative toll on the economy.Live Chat on  has been dominated by discussion of lucrative buy-write or covered call opportunities on selected biotech stocks over the past several months.

Kinder Morgan: Get Paid 6.5% To Own America's Energy Infrastructure,"This may sound like an extremely obvious statement, but I love companies with wide moats. Companies that will likely be around many decades from now, thanks to large footprints in important supply chains.One of the most importantWhile the energy transition is progressing gradually, I am convinced that fossil fuels will be the cornerstone of our energy needs for a very long time.As explained by Enterprise Products Partners , the goal is to somehow undo more than 120 years of fossil fuel growth within roughly 30 years - during an expected global population expansion of 1.8 billion people.Don't get me wrong. I'm not againstHowever, especially with the rapid middle-class growth in Africa and Asia, I do not see a situation where demand for fossil fuels is fading anytime soon.I believe the opposite will happen.This means the United States is in a great spot. Not was the U.S. the backbone of oil supply growth since 2009, but it's also the world's largest natural gas producer, expected to boost production beyond 105 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.Energy production and export require infrastructure. Without infrastructure, energy production growth or energy export isn't possible.This brings me to the star of this article, , one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the world.Founded in 1997, it offers a 6.5  dividend yield and is one of the biggest energy networks of oil and gas pipelines and terminals in North America.Furthermore, this midstream company does not issue a K-1, which means it's treated as a normal C-Corp.In June, I  KMI in light of the LNG  liquid natural gas  bull case. Back then, it was part of a two-ticker article.In this KMI-focused article, we'll discuss the company and its potential to reward its investors with juicy income and capital gains based on the bigger picture, including LNG, natural gas, commodity price fluctuations, and current economic developments.So, let's get to itFounded by Rich Kinder and William Morgan in 1997, Kinder Morgan has become one of the largest midstream companies on the planet.While size doesn't automatically translate to outperformance  I haven't seen evidence that it does , it does mean that the company has a wide moat, as its operations are key to maintaining America's energy security. On a side note, energy security is national security, which always helps to establish a moat.The company makes most of its money in natural gas  62 , as it owns roughly 70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, managing 40  of U.S. natural gas flows.At the risk of sounding repetitive, KMI manages 40  of the natural gas flows of the U.S., the most important natural gas producer in the world - especially in light of the Ukraine war. That's a mind-blowing number.On a longer-term basis, the company projects substantial growth in U.S. natural gas demand, with an estimated increase of about 20 billion cubic feet per day between 2023 and 2028, equivalent to a 20  rise.This growth is expected to be driven by a variety of factors, including LNG exports and demand from Mexico.Roughly 13.5 Bcf per day of the projected growth is anticipated to come from LNG exports and Mexico exports, with additional demand from the power, residential, and commercial sectors.On top of that, the company manages 1.7 million barrels of refined products to West and East Coast markets, it manages 140 terminals and 16 vessels, and it has the capacity to ship CO2 for various purposes, including enhanced oil production in the Permian, America's fastest-growing oil basin.Another benefit of buying midstream companies is the fact that commodity price fluctuations aren't that influential. Upstream companies  oil producers  are highly sensitive to oil price changes. Kinder Morgan is not.61  of its cash flows are from take-or-pay contracts, which entire KMI to payments regardless of whether its pipelines are used. It's like paying for Netflix . You pay each month regardless of whether you watch its series and movies.On top of that, 26  of its contracts are fee-based. These contracts pay the company based on volumes. Meaning even if gas prices were to fall, it wouldn't matter to KMI - unless prices fall so far that producers reduce output.When looking at the company's EBITDA history, we see that EBITDA is steady. While 2020 caused a decline because of lower energy production and much lower demand, we see low volatility.Having said that, there are two things to keep in mind here.With that in mind, as we slowly head toward the dividend discussion of this article, it needs to be said that midstream operators are in a much better spot compared to a few years ago.Especially during the volatile oil price years of 2014-2016, most midstream companies were heavily investing in new pipelines. Back then, midstream expansion in the U.S. was booming.One of the reasons why companies like KMI have a wide moat is the costs tied to running and expanding a pipeline terminal network. Between 2014 and 2016, the company spent roughly  4 billion per year on capital expenditures.The good news is that KMI was still generating positive free cash flow. Most of its peers did not generate positive free cash flow back then, which led to massive stock price declines when oil prices collapsed in 2015.Investors feared that midstream companies would soon see a toxic mix of negative free cash flow and lower pipeline demand.The good news is that KMI is now in a much better spot. CapEx requirements are now below  2 billion, and its past investments have led to a rise in operating cash flow, leading to elevated free cash flow.This is great news for its dividends.In the 2020-2022 period, the company spent roughly  1.7 billion per year on CapEx. That number is expected to rise to  2.5 billion in 2023-2025.Free cash flow is expected to be close to  3.0 billion, which translates to a free cash flow yield close to 8 , covering the 6.5  dividend yield.It also helps that the company has a healthy balance sheet.At the end of the second quarter, the company had  30.8 billion in net debt and a net debt  vs. adjusted EBITDA  ratio of 4.1x. The company has a BBB credit rating.The company is satisfied with its debt levels, which translates to opportunistic buybacks.When adding rising free cash flow and healthy debt levels, we get fertile ground for shareholder distributions.Over the past three years, buybacks reduced the share count by less than 2 . However, the company is just now starting to ramp up buybacks.I expect buybacks to slowly rise to 2-4  of its market cap  per year  in the next 5-8 years. This is solely based on lower growth CapEx down the road and consistent growth in operating cash flow.Also, note that buybacks are opportunistic. In times of an elevated valuation, the company may refrain from buying back stock. It is likely to accelerate repurchases during share price declines.Having said that, while buybacks will likely help the company to outperform the stock prices of peers with higher debt levels and the inability to buy back stock, I don't care much for these buybacks.The dividend is way more important here, and I would like to see higher dividend growth in the next few years to let KMI better compete with higher-yielding peers like Enterprise Products Partners, Energy Transfer , and Enbridge .While KMI has outperformed the Alerian MLP ETF , it has lagged behind some of its bigger peers with higher yields. Please note that ET and PLD are Master Limited Partnerships  they issue 1-Ks  and that ENB is a Canadian-based midstream C-Corp.Having said that, I'm not surprised that KMI is buying back stock. It has an attractive valuation.KMI is trading at just 9.3x NTM EBITDA, which is a highly attractive valuation for a company that tends to trade close to 11-12x EBITDA.Analysts seem to agree, as the company has a  20.30 consensus price target, which is 17  above the current price.While I do not believe that KMI's stock price will take off unless economic growth shows a strong rebound in the next 1-2 months, I do believe that the stock is a good buy at prices between  15- 17  and everything below that .Given the tough economic environment, I do not rule out a few more buying opportunities down the road that could potentially cause its yield to rise toward 7 .I give KMI a  rating to reflect its attractive valuation.Furthermore, while KMI won't turn into a total return monster anytime soon, it has a good yield and a moat that can be seen from space.Although it has some good peers with higher yields, I think KMI is a good buy for midstream investors looking to buy natural gas-focused companies without having to deal with K-1 forms.In a world where energy supply chains are essential, Kinder Morgan emerges as a strong contender for income-oriented investors.With a focus on reliable infrastructure, KMI's massive natural gas operations position it for long-term success.Despite the energy transition, the demand for fossil fuels remains robust, especially with global population growth.KMI's extensive pipeline network and terminals solidify its moat, while its dividend yield of 6.5  offers juicy income potential.Managed as a C-Corp and backed by steady cash flows, KMI sidesteps commodity price volatility.Rising free cash flow, healthy debt levels, and planned buybacks create fertile ground for consistent shareholder distributions returns.The company's attractive valuation makes it a compelling buy for those seeking reliable income without the complexities of K-1 forms.Major risks are depressed commodity prices that reduce oil and gas drilling activity, prolonged elevated interest rates that make new projects more expensive, and overseas competition for LNG refined exports.",55,2023-08-21T02:26:01.000-04:00

Do Not Buy NextEra Energy Partners: High Interest Rates Broke The Growth Story,"NextEra Energy Partners , once a high-flying dividend stock, has seen its stock price languish amidst higher interest rates. With the stock yielding nearly 7 , dividend investors may be wondering if it is time to  back the truck up  so to speak. Investors mayHeading into 2022, NEP was one of the biggest winners in the dividend space, offeringI see that my colleagues have a very bullish view of the stock.With the stock offering its most attractive valuation ever  in terms of dividend yield , I searched hard for reasons to join the bandwagon - but unfortunately came to the conclusion that downside or at least underperformance appeared more likely here.I don't intend to rehash the business story here - my colleagues have written . But here is a quick refresher on the company and recent financial results. NEP is an energy company mainly focused on renewable energy generation. The company does have some pipeline exposure, but it is working on selling off those assets to become a pure-play renewable energy investment.The idea is that its customers sign long-term contracts, agreeing to pay for a base amount of energy generation at a certain price. NEP typically acquires these assets from its parent company NextEra Energy . In some sense, NEP can be thought of as being quite similar to net lease REITs  'NNN REITs'  due to the long-term contracts and similarity to sale and leaseback transactions. NEP's counterparties have an average BBB  credit rating and the company has increased its customer roster rapidly over the past several years.In its most recent quarter, NEP saw both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution  'CAFD'  decline YOY as growth from new projects was unable to offset declines at existing projects.Management expects growth to pick up in the second half of the year, with up to  860 million in projected CAFD for the full year. Management has reiterated expectations for 12  to 15  average distribution growth through 2026, but on the  noted that it may be more at the low end of that range.I suspect that the commitment to the distribution growth guidance is what's helping many investors maintain their conviction in spite of the growing warning signs from the macro environment.At first glance, NEP looks like an outright steal, trading at its highest distribution yield ever at around 7  while management is guiding for at least 12  forward growth.But that is not the right way to look at it. Instead, investors should be asking how believable the guidance is. Consider that essentially all the cash flow growth in 2022 came from new projects. With NEP seeing declines at existing projects this year, it is clear that we should not be expecting growth, if at all, from existing projects, at least not on a consistently recurring basis. This is one way in which NEP differs from NNN REITs which typically have annual lease escalators  and thus can post some growth even without external acquisitions .The stock currently yields just shy of 7 . Based on the high end of CAFD guidance, NEP will generate around  4.52 in CAFD per share in 2023  for those checking the math, I note that the market cap commonly reported is not including the units owned by NEE . The stock is trading at a roughly 9  CAFD yield. Property, plant, and equipment increased by , implying around an 8.5  yield on new acquisitions. The acquisition yield is even lower if we compare 2022 results with those from 2019 at around 6.8 .That calculation suggests that funding new acquisitions through retained cash flow will not create excess shareholder value. Another way to put it, if NEP only used retained cash flow to fund new acquisitions, then the best that shareholders could hope for is around 2  growth. Issuing stock to fund acquisitions may be dilutive or only mildly accretive, at best.But with management still committing to their 12  distribution growth guidance, that implies that they may be looking to issue debt to fund acquisitions. I note that NEP has  6.3 billion in long-term debt and management expects to be near the high end of S P's metrics by the end of the year. In other words, I don't see much capacity here from a debt perspective to fund accelerated acquisitions.What's more, the average yield for BB-rated issuers hovers around 7 .Unlike in past years where NEP might have enjoyed higher investment spreads as well as the ability to ramp up leverage, the path forward looks more challenging. Between NEP's high leverage load and the high cost of capital, I struggle to see how NEP will come remotely close to generating 12  cash flow growth on a sustainable basis. Yes, NEP could in theory sustain solid distribution growth in the near term by elevating its payout ratio, but that cannot be sustained over the long term.There's yet another issue. NEP is set to see around  3.4 billion of debt mature through 2027. These debt securities were initially issued with very low interest rates.Assuming a 7  interest rate is used on new debt to refinance these maturities, that would lead to roughly  150 million in extra interest expense, which would make up over 17  of full-year CAFD guidance. Averaged out over four years, that implies around 4  of annual drag that may hold down growth rates. I wouldn't be surprised if interest expense headwinds alone are able to keep CAFD growth rates very close to zero  let alone far away from 12 .Where does that leave us  NEP looks like a 6.7  yielding stock with poor growth prospects. Yes, a 6.7  yield is higher than the stock has yielded historically, but forward growth rates aren't likely to resemble those of the past. If anything, this is a name which may present further downside to around 8 , as that would be more in line with expected returns from the broader market  and many other high yielders are hovering around that level . Perhaps one might want to buy NEP due to views that interest rates might fall. However, there are arguably more compelling ways to express such a view, and one mustn't rule out the possibility that NEP continues to trade at a discount due to investors now realizing that the company is so exposed to rising interest rates. Is this a short  At these valuations, I see a greater case for underperformance rather than an outright implosion. It is possible that many investors are OK with a flat 6.7  yield, at least long enough to make financing a short unreasonable. With the downside at around 14   excluding the dividend , the risk-reward does not look favorable for short positions. I rate NEP with a neutral rating as the high yield is more than offset by poor growth prospects.Julian Lin is a financial analyst.

Why I'm Convinced Energy Transfer Is The Best 9%-Yielder On The Market,"I decided to go with a very catchy title. While I obviously like some attention for my articles, I'm not using clickbait. I honestly believe that  is the best 9 -yielding stockOn June 20, I wrote an  titled Since then, the stock has returned 11 , lowering the dividend yield to 9  for new investors.Hence, I considered going with the title . However, that would have been a bit too much. It would also suggest that the stock might go up without any corrections.I cannot promise that.What I can say is that Energy Transfer has become a high-yielding gem. After having issues in the past, causing the companyAmong midstream companies with a market cap of more than  5 billion, Energy Transfer has the highest yield  9 .Given its improved fundamentals, dividend safety, and strong business, I honestly believe that ET is the best place for investors seeking a 9  yield. Not just in the energy industry.Now, before we continue, I need to mention that Energy Transfer is a Master Limited Partnership  MLP , which means that the company is not a traditional C-Corp. These companies are tax-exempt if 90  of their income comes from qualifying resources - it's a bit like REITs. Hence, MLPs issue K-1 forms.For some investors, this has tremendous benefits. However, it also means that some foreign investors may not be able to buy ET.ET shares are called units, and their dividends are called distributions. To avoid confusion, both terms may be used in this article. So please forgive me if it's not entirely correct.What's great about capitalism is that we can choose how to invest our money.For example, when dealing with the energy sector, there are three main ways to get the job done.In this case, I left one segment out  midstream.Here's an overview of how contracts are often structuredLast year, Goldman Sachs  came out with a  making the case for midstream companies.Although I usually don't use comments that old, it needs to be said that everything Goldman mentioned is still valid.For example, midstream fundamentals are the healthiest on record.Higher energy prices have supported faster earnings growth and healthier clients. Also, to add my own comment, shifting global geopolitics has caused North America to become an even more important export nation.Before the pandemic, most midstream companies were still aggressively expanding their networks. Most are still expanding, but we're now at a point where most companies are self-funding operations, as past investments have resulted in strong free cash flow. Hence, the chances of dividend cuts are also much lower.In general, midstream companies are in much better shape compared to a few years ago.Also, because midstream companies are not directly dependent on oil and gas prices, they have a subdued correlation to crude oil.Using Goldman Sachs data, we see that midstream has the highest correlation with global infrastructure stocks and value equities.This brings me to Energy Transfer.With a market cap of more than  40 billion, Energy Transfer is a giant.Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company is a highly diversified midstream player operating a number of key segments, including equity investments in companies like Sunoco LP , which is engaged in motor fuel distribution to dealers and customers, operating a number retail stores.For example, in its biggest segment, the company's operations cover pipeline and trucking transportation, operating terminals, and acquisition and marketing services. ET operates approximately 11,315 miles of crude oil pipelines and has equity interests in various pipeline systems. Revenue generation is through tariffs and crude oil acquisition and marketing activities.Energy Transfer also manages around 11,600 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines and owns storage facilities in Texas and Oklahoma.Their services involve transporting natural gas from production sources to end-users and storage facilities. Revenue is generated through capacity reservations, actual gas transportation, fuel retention fees, and gas sales to customers.Furthermore, Energy Transfer operates a substantial network of nearly 20,000 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines, serving customers across the United States. This segment provides pipeline and storage services regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC .Additionally, Energy Transfer's subsidiary, Lake Charles LNG, is involved in LNG import and export activities. This allows the company to benefit from what may be the biggest secular trend in energy  LNG exports, especially in light of the war in Ukraine.Roughly 90  of the company's EBITDA is fee-based, which means commodity fluctuations have a minimal impact on its earnings.On top of that, the company is about to close the acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners .Last month, Crestwood and Energy Transfer entered into a definitive merger agreement. Energy Transfer will acquire Crestwood in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately  7.1 billion, including debt and preferred equity securities.Each Crestwood unitholder will receive 2.07 common units of Energy Transfer for each Crestwood common unit.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, resulting in Crestwood unitholders owning about 6.5  of Energy Transfer's outstanding common stock.One of the reasons why Crestwood is so upbeat about the merger is because it offers Crestwood unitholders several benefits, including ownership of 6.5  of Energy Transfer's common units, access to Energy Transfer's diversified and integrated asset base, and increased distribution per unit.Additionally, Energy Transfer's strong financial position, including an investment-grade balance sheet, provides Crestwood unitholders with the potential for accelerated distribution growth and cost savings through lower capital costs.Bear in mind that ET has a net leverage ratio of less than 4x EBITDA and an investment-grade credit rating of BBB-. The company's target leverage range is 4.0 to 4.5x EBITDA. Below this range, it will use buybacks to distribute additional cash.Most investors like consistently rising dividends - preferably with decent yields.This is what ET's distribution history looks likeLike many of its peers, the company cut its dividend during the pandemic. Uncertainty and economic risks were just too high. Also, most MLPs were not as mature as they are today.Now, ET is back. It is now paying  0.31 per unit per quarter. This translates to  1.24 per year. As units trade at  13.90, this gives us a yield of 8.9 .The company targets to spend more than half of its distributable cash flow on distributions with the aim to grow this payout by 3  to 5  per year. That's a great proposal, as it would protect investors against average inflation rates and have a major impact on an already juicy yield.This dividend distribution is well-protected by a rock-solid business.During the second quarter earnings call, the company discussed the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA in the NGL and refined products segment, reaching  837 million in 2Q23, compared to  763 million in the same period in the previous year.This boost was mainly due to higher transportation, storage, and terminal services margins driven by increased volumes and higher rates.The company also highlighted the growth in transportation volumes on owned and joint venture NGL pipelines, which increased by 13  to a record 2.2 million barrels per day.In contrast, the midstream segment saw a decline in adjusted EBITDA, amounting to  579 million in 2Q23 compared to  903 million in 2Q22, mainly due to lower natural gas and NGL prices and increased operating expenses.The company also provided updates on the Lake Charles LNG project, the Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals, and the Mont Belvieu expansion, projecting the addition of up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity.It also highlighted recent developments, such as the placement of the Grey Wolf and Bear processing plants in the Delaware Basin into service and the Gulf Run pipeline's utilization. Midstream will receive roughly 40  of the company's 2023 growth capital of  2 billion.Additionally, ET emphasized its focus on alternative energy initiatives, such as carbon capture and storage projects, CO2 pipeline endeavors, and potential ammonia facility development discussions.With all of this in mind, this year, the company aims to spend  3.3 billion on CapEx. Roughly  2 billion of this is growth CapEx.The great news is that analysts expect the company to end up with  5.7 billion in free cash flow. This translates to a yield of 13 .This number is expected to gradually increase to  6.4 billion in 2025  14.6  yield .So, even after taking care of both maintenance and growth CapEx, the company has complete dividend coverage. It even has room to boost its yield to 11-12  without having to risk cutting the dividend.Also, because the company's leverage ratio is near the lower bound of its target range, the company does not need to prioritize debt repayments.If anything, investors could soon benefit from both a high yield and buybacks.When looking at the ET stock price, we need to incorporate its dividend  total return . Without the dividend, the stock looks like dead money. Including the dividend, we see that everyone who bought after 2015 would have made money.Bear in mind that compounding an almost double-digit yield really adds up over timeOver the past twelve months, ET shares have returned 28 , beating the S P 500, the ALPS Alerian MLP ETF , and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF .I expect outperformance to continue as the market figures out how great of a deal this 9 -yielding MLP is.As I said in the introduction, I truly believe that ET offers the best ultra-high-yield on the market.While I do not want to use this as an argument to get people to rush into ET, I do not believe that the company will yield 9  much longer.Also, among the biggest midstream companies  both MLPs and C-Corps , the company has the lowest forward valuation. I expect that gap to be closed over the next 12 to 24 months.The current consensus price target is  17.30. This is 24  above the current price.The only reason why I do not own ET is because I'm not yet at the stage of my life where I'm focused on income over growth. While I believe that ET will outperform a lot of dividend growth equities as well if inflation remains sticky, my main focus is on upstream companies. I'm very bullish on oil and prefer special dividends, at least for the time being.Energy Transfer stands out as a high-yielding gem in the energy sector, offering a peer-beating 9  yield.Despite past challenges, the company has re-established its dividend at an all-time high, supported by secure funding and a compelling bull case driven by global energy demands and the quest for yield.Positioned as a midstream industry leader with a market cap exceeding  40 billion, ET operates an extensive network of pipelines and assets, catering to both natural gas and crude oil markets. With a focus on fee-based revenue and strategic acquisitions, ET demonstrates resilience against commodity price fluctuations.The impending acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners further bolsters its position.Backed by a strong financial foundation and plans for steady dividend growth, ET presents an attractive opportunity for income-focused investors, likely to outperform in the foreseeable future.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Unleashing Tesla's Potential: Strong Execution Yet To Find Its Full Value,"Despite Tesla's consistent success in various aspects of its business, including vehicle deliveries, technological innovation, and expanding market share, in my opinion, the stock price might not yet fully reflectTaking a positive outlook on the growth trajectory of the electric vehicle market, in this article, I am going to delve into the best-case scenario. This involves envisioning a future where electric vehicles experience rapid and widespread adoption across global markets. In this optimistic view, Tesla could potentially benefit significantly from being a frontrunner in the EV industry.Furthermore, Tesla's ongoing commitment to innovation, expansion of its product lineup, and potentially successful launches of highly anticipated models like the Cybertruck and affordable electric vehicles could contribute to robust growth in both sales volume and profitability.Before diving into the best-case scenario - Let s break down some of the reasons for the recent stock's sluggish performance in detailTaking these factors into account, the decision to downgrade to a  Neutral  rating reflects the assessment that much of the positive developments and execution are already priced into the stock, limiting the potential for significant short-term gains. However, it's important to remember that market dynamics are futile, and investors should stay updated on the company's performance and any new developments that could influence its trajectory.Let s delve deeper into each of the points for a more comprehensive understanding Tesla's auto gross margin  excluding credits  at 18.1  indicates that the company has been able to improve its profitability on each car sold. This improvement is attributed to better cost management and operational efficiencies. The  500 per car improvement in COGS suggests that Tesla has been successful in controlling production costs, which is crucial for maintaining healthy margins. The unexpected  0.3 billion increase in operating expenses can impact Tesla's bottom line. Opex includes costs related to research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative expenses. Such an increase can reduce profitability, especially when it outpaces revenue growth or gross margin expansion. It's important to analyze the reasons behind this uptick in operating expenses to understand its potential implications on the company's financial health. Tesla's free cash flow of  1.0 billion, lower than consensus estimates, can be attributed to higher working capital requirements. Working capital includes elements like accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. When these components fluctuate, they can affect a company's ability to generate cash. Understanding the specific reasons for the increase in working capital is crucial for evaluating the sustainability of Tesla's cash flow generation. Tesla's confirmation of the projected 1.8 million deliveries for 2023 is significant, especially given the company's history of delivering on its promises. However, the mention of Q3 production cuts indicates that achieving this target might involve certain fluctuations in production and deliveries throughout the year. These production adjustments could be due to factors like supply chain challenges, component availability, or operational adjustments. Despite the variations in margins, expenses, and production plans, the overall earnings outlook for 2023 has remained relatively stable. This suggests that the company's internal expectations for growth and profitability for the full year have not significantly changed based on the results and developments reported.Let's go into more detail about each of the points in Tesla's roadmap Tesla's plan to start delivering the Cybertruck by the end of the current year signifies a significant step for the company. The year 2024 is projected to be a ramp-up phase for Cybertruck production. This model marks Tesla's entry into the electric pickup truck market, which has substantial potential in terms of both sales volume and profitability. The anticipated dilutive impact on gross margins in 2023 and 2024 could be due to initial production challenges and investments in manufacturing and supply chain for this unique vehicle design. However, the expectation of gross margin improvement starting from 2025 suggests that Tesla aims to optimize its production processes and achieve economies of scale over time. The speculation surrounding Tesla's intention to introduce an affordable electric vehicle platform priced . If realized, this move could democratize electric mobility and broaden Tesla's customer base. This model's , with production targeted for 2025, signals Tesla's commitment to expanding its market presence. Entering the more affordable price range is a strategic decision that aligns with Tesla's mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Tesla's emphasis on autonomy, particularly Full Self-Driving  FSD , represents a bold vision for the future of transportation. Achieving full autonomy would mean vehicles can operate safely without human intervention in various conditions. While Tesla has made remarkable progress in autonomous technology, achieving full autonomy remains a complex challenge. The company's iterative approach to improving its Autopilot and FSD features underscores the incremental nature of this journey. Advancements like Navigate on Autopilot, Autosteer, and Summon are steps toward this larger goal. Tesla's introduction of the Dojo supercomputer reflects the company's determination to leverage cutting-edge technology to accelerate its autonomous driving capabilities. Dojo's immense processing power can process vast amounts of data, enhancing Tesla's ability to refine its neural network algorithms for self-driving. The supercomputer could significantly accelerate the training and development of FSD systems, enabling more rapid improvements in autonomous features and safety. Achieving full autonomy is a multi-dimensional challenge that extends beyond technical aspects. Regulatory approval, public acceptance, safety validations, and real-world testing are all integral components of this process. The potential financial upside of full autonomy is substantial. Tesla's vehicles could transform into autonomous robotaxis, generating revenue for their owners when they're not in use. However, given the complexity and regulatory considerations, this transition is expected to take several years to fully materialize. It is expected that Tesla will successfully achieve its delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. This aligns with current market projections and reflects the company's strong operational performance. Attaining a 50  growth in 2024 to meet the volume CAGR target hinges on the smooth and timely ramp-up of the Cybertruck, contributing around 45  of the growth. The execution of this ramp-up is uncertain due to the complexity of such endeavors within a tight timeframe. The introduction of a new affordable platform signifies a transformative phase for Tesla and the industry. Enabling the creation of a global  25,000 mass-market electric vehicle, this platform sets the stage for Tesla to potentially fulfill its 50  volume CAGR target beyond 2025.Except for BYD , no other major automaker appears to rival Tesla's cost structure and comprehensive vertical integration. This strategic positioning allows Tesla to capture market share from traditional internal combustion engine  ICE  vehicles and offer competitive pricing, all while generating positive Free Cash Flow  FCF  sufficient to cover growth capital investments. The long-term outlook suggests Tesla's potential ascension to one of the world's largest Original Equipment Manufacturers  OEMs  by 2030, accompanied by notable profitability and market share.Achieving full autonomy within the next 12 months is unlikely for Tesla. Despite having an advantageous position to leverage AI capabilities with its purpose-built supercomputer, Dojo, the journey toward Full Self-Driving  FSD  is expected to continue with multiple iterations over the coming years. The realization of full autonomy will likely commence in North America and is anticipated to be a gradual process before it substantially influences Tesla's financial landscape.Relying on comprehensive Electric Vehicle  EV  teardowns, I have a strong level of confidence in Tesla's sustained technological and cost leadership within the industry. I anticipate that Tesla will emerge as the frontrunner, potentially even the sole global Original Equipment Manufacturer  OEM , that can achieve profitability within the affordable EV segment, starting from 2025 and onwards.In summary, the outcomes of extensive EV teardowns lend robust support to Tesla's continued dominance in technology and cost efficiency. The company's potential to generate profits in the affordable EV segment, the recognition of its technological leadership among consumers, and the evolving competitive landscape all contribute to a comprehensive perspective on Tesla's position within the global EV market.Additionally, the market's valuation multiples for Tesla have become more demanding, with a Price-to-Earnings ratio of around 60X projected earnings for 2024.Using Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  model and incorporating improved visibility into the price elasticity of demand led to an upward adjustment in projected post-2025 volume growth. This more optimistic outlook for volume growth prompts Tesla's roadmap involves a range of ambitious initiatives, from introducing groundbreaking vehicles like the Cybertruck and affordable platform to advancing autonomous capabilities with the Dojo supercomputer. While these endeavors offer great potential, it's important to acknowledge that they come with challenges and uncertainties, and their ultimate impact on Tesla's trajectory will be influenced by various internal and external factors over time.However, it's essential to note that I maintain a positive stance on Tesla's long-term prospects, acknowledging that the stock offers a substantial opportunity over an extended horizon. The recent performance of Tesla's shares has not adequately accounted for the success of Tesla's pricing strategy, which resulted in a robust response in demand and a moderate decline in margins.My valuation target is derived from a Discounted Cash Flow analysis. A notable concern revolves around the broader deceleration in the global economy and discretionary spending, which poses a substantial risk to automotive manufacturing and subsequently impacts TSLA stock. Additionally, there are significant risks tied to the pace of electric vehicle adoption, the potential inability to meet targets for battery cost reduction and performance enhancements, and vulnerabilities in the supply chain concerning battery active materials such as cobalt and nickel. The company's capability to swiftly expand production capacity, shifts in electric vehicle regulations  particularly in major markets like China, the US, and Europe , the potential for warranty-related issues, and an elevated level of general execution risk are all additional major factors that could impact the outlook for TSLA stock.

BDC Weekly Review: How A Rising Term Premium Will Impact BDCs,"Welcome to another installment of our BDC Market Weekly Review, where we discuss market activity in the Business Development Company  BDC  sector from both the bottom-up - highlighting individual news and events - as well as the top-down - providing an overview of the broader market.We also try to add some historical context as well as relevant themes that look to be driving the market or that investors ought to be mindful of. This update covers the period through the second week of October.BDCs were marginally up this week as markets whipsawed on geopolitical concerns and higher-than-expected inflation readings. Despite a positive week, the sector remains down around 2.5  on the month.Valuations have recovered slightly from the recent slide but stand around 5  below the recent peak.ManyWe can see this rise in the term premium a couple of different ways. One academic definition of the term premium shows that it's moved into positive territory and is not far off the top of the range.Perhaps a more intuitive definition of the term premium is simply the difference between 10Y and 2Y Treasury yields as shown below. This has risen as well but remains well below its longer-term range.What drives the term premium  A common answer is the debt load - the higher the debt, the higher the term premium investors require and vice-versa. US debt outstanding has been rising sharply over the past couple of years which has now been followed by a rising term premium.However, today's dynamic is unusual as, historically, the term premium behaved in the opposite way than we would expect - higher debt loads coincided with a falling term premium and vice-versa. This is likely because higher debt loads have been associated with recessions and during recessions inflation falls, giving investors more confidence in buying longer-dated bonds, while at the same time investors also seek safety in higher-quality assets, boosting demand for Treasuries.Rather, the historically down-trending term premium appeared to be driven by a stronger level of inflation anchoring due to increased Fed credibility and transparency. A subdued level of inflation volatility, until recently, has also helped as well as strong buying of US Treasuries by foreigners, particularly foreign central banks given an increase in global FX reserves.Foreign holdings as a share of America s national debt have now been on the decline, falling to around 27  while commercial banks have been sellers as well  BTFP has mitigated this somewhat  and the Fed itself is allowing Treasuries to roll off its balance sheet.Inflation volatility has jumped sharply though it appears to be slowing down once again. Fed's credibility has been dinged however long-term inflation expectations remain low, suggesting that inflation remains well anchored across markets and the sharp hawkish turn by the Fed has helped shore up its inflation-fighting credentials.Overall, the term premium will likely remain elevated and higher than what we saw in the decade preceding COVID, however, two of the three pillars remain mostly in place which suggests that the term premium is unlikely to move back to the top of its multi-decade range.The most direct impact of an elevated term premium on BDCs is through their cost of debt. Many BDCs were able to refinance their fixed-rate bonds in 2021 at, what now look like, incredibly low levels. This was because both Treasury yields and credit spreads were both very low in 2021.For example, BXSL issued 5 bonds in just over 14 months starting in July 2020 at coupons that are miles below today's Treasury yields, locking in an amazing net interest margin for years.One of these bonds already rolled off in July and others will follow in subsequent years. Unless rates collapse from here this means that many BDCs will be refinancing bonds with coupons of 2-3  to bonds with coupons of 6.5 , in effect more than doubling their cost of funding on each issue.Some BDCs, like BXSL, have longer-term debt than others so those will be better off for a while however after 2-3 years nearly all will be forced to refinance the majority of their low-coupon bonds.BDCs will have an option whether to refinance with 3-5 year bonds or whether to borrow via a floating-rate credit facility and that will depend on the shape of the yield curve - a very upward sloping curve will push many to use the credit facility over issuing bonds. This might make more sense as a credit facility has a lower credit spread, being secured and shorter-term, and can be terminated in short order whereas a bond, even a callable one, can sit on the balance sheet for years.Overall, a higher cost of debt is almost inevitable and this will create a headwind to BDC net income over the coming years.BDC Saratoga Investment Corp  is reporting early results in the sector. Recall that SAR doesn't follow typical calendar quarters but quarters that are shifted by one month from nearly all other BDCs.The NAV fell marginally as retained income mostly offset unrealized depreciation  which was around 1 . Non-accruals rose to 2 from 1  out of 55 portfolio companies  and stand at 1.6  on fair-value   4.5  on cost.Overall, it was a good quarter from the company and, while anecdotal, suggests that the sector should deliver decent Q3 results. While borrowers are feeling some pain from high base rates, so long as the economy hums along, sector portfolio quality should remain stable overall.BDC Main Street  said that in Q3 it originated  107m of new commitments and funded  137m of investments. The larger fundings figure reflects commitments made prior to Q3 and funded only in Q3. This compares fairly well against fundings of  148m in Q2 and just  44m in Q1.All of this suggests that the lending market is fairly favorable - borrowers aren t too scared to borrow, repayments aren t falling off a cliff and lenders have the confidence to put money to work.BDCs have remained relatively expensive in aggregate over the past couple of months so our focus has been more on modestly downshifting exposure and looking out for relative value opportunities. The upcoming Q3 earning results period is likely to lead to additional volatility in the sector with more opportunities opening up for investors.Check out  and explore our , engineered with both yield and risk management considerations.

Medical Properties Trust: A Disaster Investors Should Have Seen Coming,"Short sellers have a bad rep these days. Well, they always have, but it seems to have reached a fever pitch in recent years.Shorting is a hard way to make money  losses are infinite while profit isBut my view of short sellers is a positive one. Shorting is important for a well-functioning market, helpful in discovering fraud and serving as a check on overly promotional management teams. When there is significant short interest in a stock I own, rather than getting mad atSounds simple enough, but it takes a lot of intellectual flexibility to do this. You need to approach the situation with an open mind, and not just look for additional confirming evidence to support your existing position. This is hard and takes discipline.When a  for Medical Properties Trust  was released by Rob Simone of Hedgeye in late July 2022, the majority of the investors and SA analysts dismissed it  and I'm putting that mildly  and clung to their existing positions. I saw  on SA consider it thoughtfully and change their mind. Most bulls doubled-down on existing talking points, with some criticizing Rob's motives and credibility. They cost themselves money by doing so.When the Hedgeye piece broke, Medical Properties Trust  MPW  traded around  17 and yielded in the mid 7  range. This was down from its all-time high, but still well above where it traded prior to mid-2018.So shares were down, but hardly distressed, especially considering the S P500 was also down over that timeframe.Even if you dismissed the majority of the points in the Hedgeye analysis  and you shouldn't have  there were several items that were both and MPW was unlikely to ever be a multi-bagger trading at  17. The upside case then was maybe  10 year if everything worked out perfectlyThis was a clear sell and where MPW investors should have thrown in the towel.It's certainly a better buy here at  6.36 than it was at  17. At least here, it could be a multi-bagger if everything works out. But there's also a reasonable chance the equity is worthless.I think the likely outcome is that MPW is a mediocre performer going forward. Further dividend reductions, or an elimination altogether, is still on the table, as the bonds are showing signs of severe distress. If I owned this, I'd want them to eliminate the dividend entirely and repurchase debt.The 2027 5  bonds have a yield to maturity of nearly 13 , significantly higher than the equity at 9 .In May of this year, these same bonds yielded 10 . So even after cutting the dividend by nearly 50 , which would normally be a major positive for the bonds, they've actually sold off even further.With good reason.If all of the historical disclosure and related party transactions weren't bad enough, it's 2nd largest tenant Prospect is now paying them in equity.As desperately as MPW needs cash, it was forced to accept equity as payment. Whether this equity would result in any cash flow, When backing this out, normalized FFO for 2Q was down 19.5  compared to the same period in 2022, and this comes before the negatives impact of asset sales and higher debt costs.Warren Buffett famously quipped that  You never know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out.  We can probably rewrite that as  You never know what businesses were just glorified carry trades until interest rates rise.MPW has a major problem. It's about to hit a major wall of maturities in the next 24 36 months. With the 2027's trading at a YTM of 13   75 cents on the dollar  the market is telling MPW that its appetite for refinancing their debt is non-existent.Even if you assume that all of the issues with Prospect and Steward are resolved, the coming wall of debt maturities is going to be a major challenge.MPW's  shows this well. Yes, it addresses next year's refinancing risk, but results in losing  54 million in rental income while only saving  20 million in interest. They're being forced to sell off the better performing assets while increasing concentration in Steward and Prospect. This is not what you want to see as an investor.With Hedgeye's bear case playing out with shocking accuracy, including the dividend cut, only recently did some of the SA MPW bulls finally give up. This could still be a zero, but the risk-reward is almost certainly better at  6.36 than it was at  17.That said, I still can't find a compelling bull case to change my mind, so maybe giving up here is still the right move. Most of the bullish arguments I've read are combinations of the followingVery few bull cases even discuss the debt load and who is going to refinance their upcoming maturities when the 2027 debt is yielding 13 . Everyone is hanging on to the optically cheap P FFO and ignoring thatWhen you own a stock that's down significantly, you're at a big psychological disadvantage. Every time you login into your account and see the loss, in red font, you're reminded of your mistake. Most want to sell, take the tax loss, and get it off their screen. Ironically, this is often the time to buy.But it's even better to try to avoid the loss in the first place.The backlash against short sellers has been counterproductive for most investors. Instead of evaluating the business they own, some investors instead think they're in a battle against nefarious short sellers. Why focus on the fact that you're hopelessly underwater on a highly leveraged movie theatre operator  in a era where less people are going to the movies  when we can obsess over  burning the shortsMPW is a landlord. They have no special technology or moat. That's not bad, per se. But like many landlords, they were a clear beneficiary of a decade of zero percent rates. They're also a landlord that has to keep propping up its top two tenants, and a landlord that has to sell performing assets to pay down debt they can't refinance.At  17, this was never a value investor's dream, and it didn't scream BUY-BUY-BUY. The cracks in the investment case were becoming pretty obvious to anyone looking at them objectively. At  6.36, this is a speculative purchase with both significant upside potential and downside risk, which is not usually what REIT investors are attracted to.Rather than accusing shorts sellers of stoking fear, I'd encourage investors to say  thank you  and take the time to read their analysis. Many short sellers are pretty sharp  you need to be to swim against the general rising tide of the market  and are pretty good at identifying mediocre businesses trading above their intrinsic value. They're not always right, but they're usually worth listening to.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Is Albemarle Stock A Buy Amid Electric Car Market Expansion,"Albemarle Corporation  is one of the leading companies in the global specialty chemicals market. The company is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.The company operates through three business segments, EnergyStorage, Specialties, and Ketjen, whose products and servicesAt the same time, the Energy Storage segment is a crucial segment of the company, contributing approximately 74.4  of its total revenue for the second quarter of 2023, focused on producing, developing, and commercializing lithium-based products.Lithium, an alkali metal, has many unique chemical properties that make it in demand in the production of medicines for the treatment of mental illness, glass, plastic products, and lithium-ion batteries, widely used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles.WeBased on 2022 results, electric vehicle sales reached a new record of 10.2 million units, up 56.9  year-on-year. Since 2012, when only 118 thousand electric vehicles were sold worldwide, there has been a noticeable trend of exponential growth in their sales. Simultaneously, China is a country that plays a key role in the development of the electric vehicle industry, thanks in part to the rapid deployment of charging infrastructure and the Communist Party's supportive industrial policy.According to the Before delving into Albemarle's Q2 2023 financial results and our expectations for the second half of 2023, we'd like to bring your attention to its institutional investors.Despite the continued decline in lithium carbonate prices in recent months, Albemarle's , including financial organizations Vanguard Group, State Street, Bank of America, Capital Research Global Investors, and Blackrock, maintain a collective stake of 32.33  of the company's shares.These Wall Street giants continue to believe in the company's bright future, and, more importantly, the total proportion of  holding Albemarle shares has remained stable in recent quarters.The  showed mixed results, as Albemarle's revenue declined from the previous quarter due to lower prices for its lithium-based products, but it continued to beat analysts' consensus EPS estimates in recent years. As a result, this is one of the factors confirming the continued effectiveness of Albemarle's business strategies despite the growth of geopolitical tensions and the deteriorating global macroeconomic environment., Albemarle will publish its financial report for the third quarter of 2023. , Albemarle's revenue is expected to be  2.09- 2.95 billion, up 15.8  year-over-year and 7.1  higher than analysts' expectations for the prior quarter. On the other hand, according to our model, the company's total revenue will be above the median of this range and reach  2.62 billion.Albemarle's quarterly and year-over-year revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased sales volume in the Energy Storage and Ketjen segments and higher prices for performance catalyst solutions  PCS . These two factors partially minimize the damage from strengthening the US dollar against major foreign currencies and lowering lithium carbonate prices.Additionally, we forecast that Albemarle's operating income margin will reach 30.4  by 2023. Moreover, in 2024, this financial metric will rise to 34.1 , mainly due to an increase in lithium prices and sales volume as a result of an increase in the production of electric vehicles, optimization of labor costs, improved mining efficiency, and a weakening US dollar relative to other foreign currencies., Albemarle's Q3 EPS is expected to be  2.17- 5.29, down 10  from the consensus estimate for the second quarter of 2023. At the same time, according to our model, Albemarle's EPS will be  4.58, a decrease of 38.9  compared to the previous year.Furthermore, the company's Non-GAAP P E  TTM  is 4x, which is 67.97  lower than the sector average and 84.14  lower than the average over the past five years. Meanwhile, Albemarle's Non-GAAP P E  FWD  is 5.19x, which is one of the factors indicating its conservative assessment by financial market participants during the period of continued growing demand for electric cars in the world.Unlike many companies in the materials sector, Albemarle's debt remains relatively low, allowing it to attract significant interest from institutional and retail investors as the world transitions from internal combustion engine  ICE  vehicles to electric cars.At the end of the second quarter of 2023, Albemarle's total debt was about  3.66 billion, an increase of  1.11 billion over 2021. Thanks to the significant increase in EBITDA over the past two years, the company's total debt EBITDA ratio decreased from 2.95x to 1.01x.Albemarle Corporation is one of the leading companies in the global specialty chemicals market.Due to a sharp decline in the company's margins in the second quarter of 2023 and concerns among financial market participants about the higher growth rate of lithium supply in recent weeks, Albemarle's share price has declined by more than 25  over the past six months.We believe that some of the main risks to the company's financial position are the continued downward pressure on lithium prices caused by the sluggish Chinese economic recovery and the sharp increase in US household debt, which could ultimately lead to lower demand for new electric vehicles in the short term.However, while Mr. Market is extremely pessimistic about Albemarle at the moment, we believe that the company will play a crucial role in the development of the fast-growing battery market for electric vehicles. In addition, its management has continued to increase its dividend payments year after year for 29 years, providing another investment thesis that makes Albemarle an attractive asset over the long term.We initiate our coverage of Albemarle with an  outperform  rating for the next 12 months.

"A seismic shift is happening in the airline industry, says United CEO","Low-cost airlines will have to change their business models to attract customers and not go out of business, as higher fuel costs and other cost pressures are impacting the aviation industry as a whole, said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.Higher fuel costs, much higher labor costs  than any of us expected at the start of the year,  and supply chain challenges in all aspects of the business are the main issues causing cost pressures, he said.United Airlines  third quarter earnings report on Tuesday showed, on an adjusted basis, pre-tax income of  1.6B, pre-tax margin of 10.8  and diluted EPS of  3.65.Their cost per seat mile is up 3.5 5 , compared to last year.Their fourth quarter EPS guidance, however, dropped to a range of  1.50 1.80.In a CNBC interview, Kirby said that United is taking 15 fewer aircraft deliveries, producing less capacity, although the costs associated with those expenses are still in their books. In addition, cancelled flights to Tel Aviv   regularly with flights from D.C., Newark, San Francisco and Chicago, which are 2  of the airline s capacity   are causing a big impact,  but it s transitory,  he said.  Presumably, we ll be flying to Israel again.He said he feels confident that United will earn double what the consensus was at the start of the year.The world is developing almost exactly like we thought it would for aviation, both for United and for the rest of the industry, and the stress that's happening at the low end of the industry is going to lead to changes and restructuring,  he told CNBC.  That's going to leave us at a much better, sustainable, much more structurally profitable industry.In a LinkedIn post on Tuesday, he wrote that  the adjustments are an inevitable economic reality, and I expect them to happen again by  the second half of 2024 . What s different this time, however, is that the lowest-margin airlines are the so-called low-cost carriers, and that s where I think the changes are going to occur.This would be a seismic shift in the structure of the airline industry, he added,  and that leaves us pretty excited about the future.Kirby said that Delta  and United  are going to account for about 98  of the revenue growth and 90  of the total expected industry pre-tax profit.Delta  reported record earnings last week, with a revenue of  14.55B, and net income rising by 59  year-over-year.He also said that both airlines are about 15 25 margin points ahead of the low-cost carriers  Frontier , Spirit , Allegiant .",89,2023-10-18T12:18:53.000-04:00
Plains All American Yields Over 7% And Looks Undervalued,"Whenever I write about Energy Transfer  or Enterprise Products Partners , the one company that consistently turns up in my valuation models as an undervalued opportunity is Plains All American . IPAA is an interesting energy infrastructure company as its focus is predominantly throughout the centralized region of North America. While PAA provides critical infrastructure to our economy, it provides significant takeaway capacity and access to the U.S. and global energy markets for Canadian crude and NGLs. PAA operates 18,300 miles of  pipelines and has 74 million barrels of commercial crude storage capacity. PAA has 4 marine facilities and operates 7 crude rail terminals. On the  side of its business, PAA operates 1,620 miles of NGL pipelines, 9 fractionation plants, 4 processing facilities, and 16 NGL rail terminals. PAA is a full-service energy infrastructure company providing takeaway capacity through pipes, trucks, and rail, and storage for upstream exploitation and production companies to connect with refiners and exporters to international markets in the crude markets.Above is a picture of PAA's energy infrastructure across its asset base. Below is a map of all the petroleum pipelines and export import facilities in the lower 48 portion of the U.S. according to the Energy Information Agency  EIA  . PAA's assets are at the heart of the American crude industry as they connect several basins to the most densely populated export import location for American crude. Oil and gas aren't going away, and I feel investing in hard asset's is a theme that will become more popular as the years progress. PAA's infrastructure is next to impossible to be replicated by another company as the barriers to entry are immense for new companies to enter the space.PAA could have significant growth running through their pipes as the 2023 Annual Energy Outlook from the EIA  indicates that production levels in their reference cases for petroleum and other liquids, and natural gas will increase through 2050. The EIA also projects that the U.S. will remain a net exporter of oil and gas through 2050. My logic is simple as I follow what the government agencies responsible for energy are publishing. If the U.S. will grow its oil and gas production for the next 3 decades, then it will need excess transpiration capacity for these fuels. If the U.S. remains a net exporter, growing its oil and gas exports, then more fuel will have the Gulf Coast as a final destination. These are not my projections  they are the U.S. government projections, and I want to invest in companies that have infrastructure in these areas that can capitalize on the future growth in these areas. PAA is positioned to benefit from a growing domestic and international energy demand, and I feel unitholders can be rewarded with an appreciating unit price and growing distribution.PAA finished its  generating  33.67 billion in revenue,  2.5 billion in cash from operations,  1.32 billion in FCF,  10.22 billion in total debt, and having 728 million units outstanding. Based on the trailing twelve-month  TTM  numbers, PAA has grown its revenue by 52.16   17.56 billion  to  51.23 billion, its FCF by 76.64   1.01 billion  to  2.34 billion, reduced its total debt by -19.79   - 1.92 billion  to  8.3 billion, and repurchased 29.6 million units, decreasing its shares outstanding by -4.07 . Today, you're able to purchase units below where they were prior to the improved balance sheet, financial growth, and lowered unit count.PAA has also strategically strengthened its company to capitalize on the future of American energy.  closed on its 43  acquisition of Diamondback Energy's  interest in OMOG JV LLC for approximately  225 million. This was funded through excess FCF, and further aligns PAA with FANG in the Midland Basin. PAA has updated its 2023 guidance and expects to come in the high end of its range for Adjusted EBITDA of  2.45 -  2.55 billion while decreasing its leverage to under 3.5x. PAA is expecting its FCF to come in around the  1.6 billion level in 2023, which will allow it to further reduce its debt load and should help provide future distribution increases.Like some other energy infrastructure companies, PAA reduced its distribution in 2020. Since then, PAA has improved its financial position, reduced debt, and provided 2 distribution increases. The quarterly distribution has grown from  0.18 to  0.27 in less than 2 years, and considering PAA is expected to retain  600 million of its  1.6 billion of FCF in 2023 after distributions, there is no reason for me to believe that increasing the distribution further isn't part of the gameplan. The current valuation looks discounted, provided the progress PAA has delivered.For Midstream Operators, I look at the enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA, total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, the market cap to Adjusted EBITDA, market cap to distributable cash flow, and distribution yields. This helps me determine if there is an opportunity in one midstream units over another. PAA has always looked strong, and I am specifically looking at PAA based on these metrics.I will compare PAA to the following companiesPAA trades at the lowest valuation on an enterprise value to Adjusted EBITDA methodology, slightly under ET. The peer group average for this metric is 9.31x, and PAA is trading well below this at 7.86x.From a market cap to Adjusted EBITDA perspective, PAA also looks undervalued, trading at 3.53x compared to a 5.52x peer group average. PAA trades at a slightly higher multiple than ET but significantly below the rest of its peers.I want to pay the best multiple I can for DCF, and PAA is trading at 5.8x its DCF compared to the peer group average of 7.19x. ET is the only other company from the peer group that trades under a 6x multiple on its DCF.From a debt perspective, PAA trades at the lowest ratio as its total debt to Adjusted EBITDA is 2.77x. The peer group has an average of 3.3x, and PAA is the only peer that trades under 3x. From a leverage position, PAA looks attractive.PAA has a distribution yield that exceeds 7 , but it's under the 7.78  peer group average. While I love a large yield, I am willing to invest in a smaller yield where the company has strong underlying fundamentals and ratios.PAA looks very interesting, and while I am not a unitholder, I am certainly considering adding PAA to my income-producing portfolio in the future. I think PAA is undervalued as its assets provide critical infrastructure to the oil and gas industry and are positioned to benefit from a growing demand for traditional energy. As the U.S. continues to increase production and exporting loads, I think PAA will see increased amounts of fuel running through its system and ultimately drive revenue and FCF higher. Based on the valuation, PAA could be an interesting acquisition target in an industry that has seen continuous consolidation through M A activity. At a  23.5 billion enterprise value and  10.56 billion market cap, PAA looks interesting for an investment and as a target for an acquisition.

Enterprise Products Partners: One Of The Better Dividend Payers In The Space,"If you are looking for a dividend-distributing company that has perhaps some of the most solid margins in the energy sector then a top pick of mine is Enterprise Products Partners L.P.  right now. TheEPD serves as a vital player in the midstream energy sector, providing essential solutions to producers and consumers in both the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments. Moreover, the company extends its reach into other critical sectors such as crude oil, petrochemicals, and refined products. This diverse operational scope is structured into four distinct segments  NGL Pipelines   Services, Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, and Petrochemical   Refined Products Services.The last for the company showcased strength as the DCF remained high at  1.7 billion. There were fewer favorable commodity prices in the last quarter as compared to Q2 FY2022. But that hasn't stopped EPD from still being a strong dividend distributor.The company has managed to accelerate the total asset growth of the business and over the last decade, it has averaged a . If this can be maintained as a result of acquiring more companies and yield pipeline expansion then I think EPD looks very attractive as an investment. But it won't be just expansion that will result in higher valued assets. The fact that they already have the assets and the necessity for natural gas and crude oil growth each year is sufficient enough to result in it growing too.As for how EPD has been able to leverage this into stronger earnings I think that they have done a great job as commodity prices of both oil and gas have appreciated in the last couple of years. Both seem to be trending upwards as well and production cuts are resulting in higher prices.Even though there is a general sentiment that renewables are going to make up a larger portion of energy generation, EPD is still investing quite heavily in  related to oil and gas pipelines. Approved and under-development projects have a total value of  4.1 billion so far. Looking ahead several projects are expected to be in service as of 2024 and 2025, which supports the prospects of growing distributable cash flows as EPD expands the asset base.Even as the company has been growing its FCF over the years the relation between it and the price has been declining. EPD still posts a premium in p fcf in comparison to the sector of about 52.13  on a FWD basis. I don t think that should construed as the buy case here though. EPD is still a very appealing company to be in given the reliable dividend it has maintained through the years, that is what investors and the market are valuing. On a p e basis, it looks a little more realistic as it trades more or less in line with the broader sector median right now. EPD still equals a buy in my book primarily because of the dividend yield of over 7  and the fact there are still several ongoing projects in the pipeline that further solidify the position of the company in the markets.I think that for EPD the dividend remains incredibly stable as we will see below, the FCF of the business has been incredibly stable throughout the commodity cycle of oil for example. With the last quarter having  1.7 billion in distributable cash flows, it more than covers the TTM dividends paid of  4.1 billion on an annualized basis.Volume elves remain stable for the company and I think this underscores the capability the company inhabits to possibly post even stronger earnings in the coming quarters. If commodity prices keep ticking upwards going into the colder months of the year I think EPD is ripe to post higher distributable cash flows then the previous  1.7 billion. Over the last 24 years, the dividend has been raised and this would add more support to that practice and let EPD perhaps continue doing it for another 24 years, as long as they maintain this fortress of assets they have accumulated.EPD's unitholders are exposed to a significant risk factor that arises from the company's growth trajectory closely aligning with broader macroeconomic trends within the United States. EPD's expansion efforts are intricately intertwined with the overall economic climate, which can impact the volumes of energy resources it handles. However, it's worth noting that EPD has taken strategic measures to mitigate this risk effectively.EPD engages in several smaller sub-segments, such as propylene and octane enhancement. These specialized areas can be challenging for investors to predict in terms of sales margins and volumes. The limited availability of data in these niches may introduce additional uncertainties for investors who are trying to evaluate the company's performance within these specific markets. It seems unlikely though that these would heavily construe the earnings results and capabilities of the business so the risk it presents is rather slim.Investors who seek a solid dividend addition to a portfolio should be considering EPD right now. With a massive presence in the energy sector as a pipeline owner and operator for natural gas and oil, it has managed to grow into a dividend aristocrat over the years. 24 years of consecutive raises speaks volumes about the value shareholders have in the company. With plenty more projects and expansion plans in the pipeline, I remain bullish on EPD and will be rating it a buy as such.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Controversial Midwest CO2 pipeline project canceled in blow to Biden climate plans,"Navigator CO2 Ventures said Friday it has  aimed at reducing emissions from the U.S. corn ethanol industry, citing the  unpredictable nature of the regulatory and government processes involved, particularly in South Dakota and Iowa.The Heartland Greenway project would have captured 15M metric tons year of CO2 emissions from more than 20 plants across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, carrying it through 1,300 miles of pipeline for permanent storage deep underground in Illinois.The cancellation of the ambitious proposal is a  to the development of carbon capture and storage projects in the U.S. - a critical component of President Biden's climate strategy - and to the ethanol industry, which sees CCS as key to cutting emissions from producing the fuel.Yet the project was opposed by environmental groups who say CCS is a lifeline for continuing the use of fossil fuels, and landowners who said developers tried to steamroll them into accepting new pipelines on their property.ETFs  , , , , , , , The project was backed by investors including asset manager BlackRock , top ethanol producer Poet LLC and oil refiner Valero Energy .",100,2023-10-20T18:26:06.000-04:00
SQM: Buying Opportunity Even With Margin Pressure,"The fundamentals of lithium investing are anchored on a strong EV transition, expected to continue through the next decade. This increasing demand may create room for strong top-line growth and healthy long-term prices for lithium miners and refiners, despite the recent observedUp to this point, no newsOn the other hand, Tesla's last quarter report unveiled a continuous margin pressure. As this trend consolidates, it may become important to evaluate the resilience of lithium fundamentals in a scenario that results from an enhanced cost focus by EV makers, impacting the profitability of the entire supply chain.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile  is a leading lithium producer, striking 20  market share, according to the numbers published in its last quarterly report. MoreThe company scores an . The 63.5  topline increase in the last year comes after a 105.5  jump in 2022. Even though some of this expansion can be attributed to a situation in the fertilizer business after the events in Ukraine in early 2022, it is undeniable that lithium was the growth engine for the firm. In Q2 2023, 99.92  of revenue growth can be traced to the lithium business, as can be noted in Figure 1.In the last 12 months, lithium represents 76.6  of revenues, up from 25.5  2 years ago. The CAGR in the period was 288 , mostly related to the strong price movement observed in the mineral. Even so, the company also increased volumes consistently in the last 2 years, at a 32  yearly rate. Figure 2 depicts the quarterly production amounts and average pricing.This dynamic was particularly favorable to the margins. In the firm's business mix, lithium can be seen as a high-margin product, second to iodine but still solid compared to plant nutrition or industrial chemicals. This effect was exacerbated, moreover, by the price upsides in 2022 as shown in Figure 2. The combination of the revenue boost, improved nominal margins, and diluted operating leverage rendered the firm a .Despite the solid storyline, there are evident shifts occurring in the lithium market that may be incorporated into the valuation of assets such as SQM. In the last years, supply expanded consistently as a result of many new projects and there are many more in the pipeline. SQM, as an example, reports  2.2 Billion in investment from 2023 to 2025, including the Mt. Holland project in Australia and refinery capacity expansion in China. As a result, a certain oversupply is observed in the current market, and near-future expectations are consistent with this scenario.On the other hand, demand strength keeps increasing. Recent numbers depict exponential . This train already left the station in the largest global EV market, China. In such a situation, the momentary oversupply may not be seen as a long-term trend. As a last point, lithium can not be understood as a scarce element, meaning that potential price spikes, such as the one identified in 2021 will be compensated by prompt supply increase, only constrained by the timing needed for a new project to get mature.Additionally, the competition in the EV market is ramping up. Automakers such as Tesla have consistently announced price discounts. In business economics, this is called price skimming. This strategy consists of charging the highest price possible as a product is introduced to capture early adopters and, as production increases or competition heats up, reducing prices to include more price-sensitive customers in the demand. As the strategy is used, gross margin compression has been reported. Naturally, automakers will run their procurement machines to secure cost-effectiveness and guaranteed access to lithium supply, creating margin pressure on the whole supply chain. Some will even try to vertically integrate, as we have seen.With all these ingredients together, I am moving down some parameters to evaluate SQM. In terms of sales growth, the nominal lithium market increase is shortened by 5 p.p. from 20  to 40  per year, resulting in an initial growth estimation of 10  to 25 , all products considered. Moreover, revenue increase will decline to single digits already in 2025 in the lower band and 2028 in the upper band.In regard to gross margin, current levels are also expected to contract from the current 52  to a range from 40  to 45 . This assumption represents the convergence to a margin level still not seen since the lithium onset in the results of SQM and therefore is consistent with the above-mentioned scenario of supply chain grind.Considering these parameters, I ran a Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 simulations based on the FCFF model to understand the distribution of fair value. Additional assumptions for this model include stability in the current parameters of SG A and depreciation. Moreover, capital structure is considered to be at a long-term level, with around 33  financial leverage. A final assumption refers to Capex per Sales also at historical levels, a bit north of the above-mentioned guidance, as a result of massive development moment for supply increase.In parallel, I also ran a DDM model using some dividend growth assumptions. These assumptions range from the constant dividend model at current levels to a double-step dividend growth model, in which the first step would generate a 5  yearly growth  for 5 years  and the second step would register a 2  constant growth, in line with the long-term economic environment. It is important to note that SQM has an  and these assumptions may reflect the future lithium market situation as commented in this article.As a result, SQM is still a buying opportunity with a fair value of more than  100 per share, for the FCFF model, with a standard deviation around it of   20.90. Considering the dividends, the fair value would be between  67 and  93 per share, another solid upside potential. These results are depicted in Figure 3.It is important to notice that such estimation was severely impacted by the more conservative assumptions discussed in this article. In general terms, there is potential that investors may notice reducing price targets for SQM and other lithium producers. Such movements may induce short-term volatility in the stock but, up to this point, do not affect the investment prospect in the long term.Moreover, in the short term, strong volatility may be expected as the asset seems to correlate with . Current valuation metrics are still rich compared to the sector and further price reductions may occur. On the other hand, current price levels are a buying opportunity for the long-term investor and have the potential to offer a premium for patience and volatility resilience.

Better High Yield Buy: Kinder Morgan Or NuStar Energy?,"Kinder Morgan  and NuStar Energy  are two high yielding midstream businesses. In this article, we will compare them side-by-side in light of their Q2 earnings calls to determine which is the better buy at the moment.KMI's Q2  included management maintaining full year guidance, including projections of adjusted EBITDA at  7.7 billion, distributable cash flow coming in at  4.8 billion, DCF per share of  2.13, and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio hovering around 4 times at year-end.Moreover, Kinder Morgan reported that it is engaged in discussions about expanding its Gulf Coast Express pipeline and will move forward with it pending confirmation that it can generate sufficient returns on the project.Meanwhile, NS  roughly flat year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. However, its pipeline segment EBITDA was up by 5 , its refinedMeanwhile, its adjusted distribution coverage ratio was a very healthy 1.64x. Management also continued to advance its optimization program which seeks to reduce any excess spending on operational expenditures and G A while also high-grading investments on growth projects. Thus far since the program's inception in 2022, management has identified  100 million in cost and spending reductions and they believe more savings are likely to be unlocked in the coming quarters. Given that their Q2 EBITDA was  169 million, this is a significant amount of cost savings.KMI has one of the more impressive business models in the midstream space, with a large and well-diversified portfolio of assetsIt is North America's largestIt also owns a growing  energy transition  portfolio that includes up to 6.4 bcf of RNG production capacity by mid-2024. Overall, its business mix is skewed heavily towards natural gas with 62  of its business mix weighted in that category, 15  of its business mix weighted towards products, 12  towards terminals, and 11  towards CO2.It generates very stable cash flows due to the combination of its mission-critical, competitively positioned and diversified set of energy infrastructure assets, its multi-year contracts, and the fact that 93  of its cash flow comes from take-or-pay, hedged, and fee-based cash flows. This makes it quite resistant to short-term swings in commodity prices and also sets it up to weather recessions fairly well.Moreover, it has a promising long-term growth profile, with a  3.7 billion project backlog that is 80  focused on lower carbon investments such as natural gas, RNG, liquid biofuels, and CCUS infrastructure. When combined with its ongoing  3 billion share buyback program, KMI is well positioned to generate attractive returns for shareholders moving forward.Investors can also take solace in the fact that  13  of KMI's equity is owned by management and the board of directors.NS, meanwhile, also has a somewhat diversified business model, albeit a much smaller one than KMI'sIts renewable fuels segment is strategically located on the West Coast of the U.S. The demand for NS's midstream logistics services is growing due to the carbon emissions reduction goals and regulatory priorities focused on renewable fuels in regions like the West Coast and Canada. This demand is further amplified by challenges in obtaining permits for new projects, making existing assets more valuable. NS's strategically located West Coast terminals are well-equipped to handle the distribution of renewable fuels in the region, providing access and flexibility.Anticipating growth in 2023, NS projects an expansion in Renewable Fuels EBITDA and a concurrent increase in market share. This growth will be driven by the completion of ongoing projects and those currently under construction. NS plans to adapt its tankage for renewable fuels in response to market needs. Its strategically situated facilities are poised to capitalize on emerging projects related to renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel  SAF , ethanol, and other renewable fuels in the region.NS's extensive Ammonia System covers about 2,000 miles, stretching from Louisiana up the Mississippi to Missouri and then northwest to Nebraska and Indiana. It serves as a cost-effective solution for transporting both imported and domestically produced ammonia for crop fertilization in key agricultural regions. The system currently runs at approximately 30 million barrels per day  MBPD , with operational capacity nearing 50 MBPD. This system accounts for 5-10  of pipeline segment revenues, and strong growth is anticipated in its utilization and revenue contribution starting in early 2024. NS also has short-term opportunities for low capital expenditure projects to significantly enhance system utilization. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding larger, longer-term ammonia opportunities for both the system and the St. James facility.NS's Refined Products Systems play a pivotal role in serving critical markets across the Midcontinent and Texas regions. Within the Midcontinent Systems, the Central East network extends over 2,500 miles, offering versatile delivery options. The East Pipeline component supplies flexible refined products to Midwest West markets, sourced from refineries in McPherson, Kansas, El Dorado, Kansas, and Ponca City, Oklahoma. Meanwhile, the North Pipeline ensures refined product delivery from North Dakota to the Twin Cities, addressing both rural and urban markets through supply from the Mandan, North Dakota refinery. In the Central West system, covering approximately 2,000 miles of dedicated pipeline, supply stems from the McKee, Texas refinery, serving markets in Texas and neighboring states. In the South Texas Systems, a network of around 700 miles of dedicated pipeline receives supply from Corpus Christi and Three Rivers, Texas refineries, effectively meeting the needs of markets in Texas and northern Mexico.Finally, NS' Permian System remains advantageous due to the robustness of the Permian Basin. This is due to its favorable geology and cost-efficiency, resulting in low breakeven costs for shale production. As of the end of 2022, the Permian Basin's shale production reached 5.5 million barrels per day  MMBPD , constituting approximately 46  of the nation's total shale output. Projections indicate that by the end of 2023, this production will further increase to 5.7 MMBPD, reflecting a 3  growth compared to the previous year's exit. Since its acquisition in 2017, the performance of our Permian System has been promising, and NS anticipates it will continue to yield robust results throughout 2023 and beyond.NS has some high quality assets with decent long-term growth potential. However, we give the edge to KMI given that its contracted cash flows and investment grade counterparty exposure is superior to that of NS' portfolio, it enjoys significantly superior economies of scale, and it has greater exposure to natural gas as opposed to oil-based commodities, which positions it better for the ongoing energy transition.KMI's BBB credit rating sets it apart from NS, which lacks an investment grade credit rating  BB-  and has quite a bit of leverage on its balance sheet via its substantial use of both debt and preferred equity. KMI expects to exit 2023 with a 4.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio and currently has a 4.1x leverage ratio, which gives them plenty of flexibility below their long-term target of 4.5x. Since when Q1 2015, KMI has aggressively deleveraged its balance sheet, reducing net debt by over  11 billion during that time period. Moving forward, KMI plans to continue self-funding capital expenditures and dividends as they have for the past seven years.NS's main focus in recent years has been on strengthening its balance sheet by reducing leverage and redeeming its Series D preferred units. Management has been moving extremely aggressively towards this end and now believes it will complete these redemptions by the end of this year after just beginning to redeem them in November of last year and over 12 months ahead of the original plan.One of the reasons why they have been able to complete this redemption so rapidly is that management issued nearly 15 million common equity units at an average price of  15 per unit in order to accelerate the Series D preferred redemption process. The reasoning behind this was that it would save NS cash flow since the distribution yield on the Series D is higher than the distribution yield on NS common units. Furthermore, it would be accretive to leverage metrics, setting NS up nicely to achieve a debt to EBITDA ratio of under 4x by year-end 2023. However, on a DCF per common unit basis, it was a dilutive move and weighed on the unit price considerably after being announced.Both businesses are headed in the right direction on their balance sheets. However, overall KMI definitely is in better shape at the moment.KMI has been growing its dividend quite slowly in recent years as it has been using much of its retained cash flow to fund growth capital expenditures, buy back stock, and strengthen its balance sheet. Moving forward, its dividend growth is expected to accelerate slightly, but remain quite slow at a forecast 2.9  CAGR through 2027, supported by an expected 3.7  DCF per share CAGR over that same time span as the company will likely use the extra DCF to buy back stock and fund further growth projects. Dividend coverage in 2023 is expected to be a very conservative 1.9x, making the payout quite safe.NS's focus on redeeming its Series D preferred units in-full will free up considerable cash flow to flow to the common units in 2024 and beyond. What management does with this cash flow remains to be seen, but it is certainly possible to envision them beginning to grow the distribution again. Management even mentioned in its latest investor presentation that they are working to position NS to  return increasing value in the future.Its full year 2023 distribution coverage ratio is expected to come in at a very healthy 1.8x. That said, analysts have very weak expectations for distribution growth through 2027, forecasting a meager 0.8  CAGR over that span.Both KMI and NS appear to have safe distributions for the time being, but overall we give KMI the edge for both expected distribution growth and distribution safety.As the table below illustrates, NS is quite a bit cheaper than KMI across each of the major valuation metrics, though KMI appears a bit cheaper relative to its historical averages than NS doesWhile NS is making great strides in improving its capital structure by rapidly paying down high-cost preferred equity while also targeting its leverage ratio, it owns a quality portfolio of midstream assets, and offers a very attractive and well-covered distribution, we give KMI the overall edge in this comparison for the following reasonsThat said, for investors who already have a large and well-diversified midstream portfolio with plenty of exposure to natural gas, NS could be a better addition given its higher yield and exposure to unique refined products and ammonia assets. We rate both stocks as a Buys at present, but give KMI a Low Risk rating and NS an Average Risk rating.

"Well-Covered 7-10% Yields To Hide From Rising Rates, Unrest, And Recession","Three of the biggest concerns facing investors right now are rising long-term interest rates, growing unrest in the Middle East, and growing fears of a meaningful economic downturn. You can see these three concerns manifesting themselves in the following chart, which shows long-termAs a result, many investors are dumping stocks - particularly interest rate sensitive dividend stocks - in favor of the greater safety offered by bonds, particularly short-term treasuries , which enjoy safety from both interest rate fluctuations and recessions while still offeringWhile we certainly understand why investors want to take this path, we believe that there is an even better opportunity that is poised to survive the three-headed monster of rising long-term interest rates, rising oil prices, and a likely economic downturn while offering a much higher yield and solid long-term growth potential. In this article, we will discuss this opportunity and share two of our six top picks of the moment in the sector.We believe that energy midstream infrastructure  is the ultimate high-yield investment in the current environment for the following reasonsWith these strengths in mind, here are two midstream businesses that we believe are particularly well-positioned for the three-headed monster facing the markets todayEPD checks all the boxes in the current environmentEPD offers an attractive current yield of 7.3 , which is significantly higher than the 5  yield currently being offered by 10-year treasuries. Moreover, EPD's distribution is considered very safe as it has never been cut, is expected to be covered 1.74x by 2023 distributable cash flow, and has increased every year for 25 consecutive years. Lately, management has been growing its distribution at a  5  CAGR and appears well-positioned to continue growing it at that rate for years to come. This growth rate is well in excess of the current rate of inflation  on both a headline and core CPI basis  as well as of the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation rate target of 2 .The company also boasts an A- credit rating, the best in the energy midstream sector. With a low leverage ratio of 3.0x,  4 billion in liquidity, and a stable cash flow profile due to its diversified, highly contracted business model, EPD has little to worry about when it comes to meeting its financial obligations. Moreover, its low leverage ratio, very well-laddered debt maturities  weighted average term to maturity of 19.7 years on its debt with a whopping 51  not maturing for 30 or more years , 96.7  of its debt being fixed interest rate, significant liquidity, and substantial free cash flow generation leave it well-positioned to pay off debt as it matures should it decide it does not want to refinance it at higher interest rates. Alternatively, should it decide to refinance its debt, its A- credit rating positions it to do so with relative ease.Last, but not least, for a company with its impressive list of credentials and robust fundamentals, EPD is fairly inexpensive at the moment. In addition to its juicy distribution yield and solid growth profile, EPD's EV EBITDA ratio is only 9.49x, which is well below its 10-year average of 12.24x. This indicates that EPD could generate attractive capital appreciation for unitholders alongside its attractive and growing distribution.Like EPD, ET also has a lot to offer investors in the current environmentIt has a stable cash flow profile thanks to its significant diversification by geography and energy commodity as well as the well-contracted nature of its cash flows. Approximately 90  of its expected adjusted 2023 EBITDA comes from commodity price-resistant long-term fee-based contracts, making its business model fairly defensive and resilient against macro volatility.Moreover, ET's balance sheet recently received an upgrade to BBB from S P, reflecting its substantial deleveraging progress over the past several years. Moving forward, management expects to manage its debt burden and capital investments in a manner that keeps the leverage ratio within the company's 4.0x-4.5x target range for the foreseeable future. However, ET could quite easily use its free cash flow net of distributions to pay off most - if not all - of its maturing debt in the coming years if it so chose and decided to cut back dramatically on growth spending and distribution growth. While management is likely not going to take that path, it is nice that it has that option in the event that interest rates soar materially higher.Finally, ET's distribution is very attractive and well-covered by cash flows, making it attractive to investors looking for equity exposure without taking on excessive risk and yet still wanting to generate a substantial yield premium to what is currently being offered by cash and treasuries. With a 9  NTM distribution yield, an expected 1.95x 2023 distributable cash flow coverage ratio, and a projected 3-5  CAGR on the distribution for the foreseeable future, ET offers investors a compelling combination of yield, growth, and safety. With an EV EBITDA of just 7.8x, ET remains one of the cheapest midstream businesses on the market today and - compared to its 10-year average of 10.72x - it also offers investors substantial valuation multiple expansion potential.Currently, investors are grappling with how to handle three significant challenges to their portfolios  the upward trajectory of long-term interest rates, escalating tensions in the Middle East, and mounting concern over a potential economic downturn. While short-term treasuries through funds like SGOV can protect an investor's principal against recession and rising interest rates while still delivering a real yield net of current inflation rates, the total return is still nothing special at only slightly above 5 . Moreover, the potential for soaring energy costs remains unhedged in such a scenario.Another option is to invest in the energy sector through funds like XLE or via buying the stock of a major oil producer like Exxon Mobil  or Chevron . However, you are then exposing yourself to the potential for a dramatic decline in energy prices if a recession were to hit. Of course, triple net lease REITs like Realty Income , utility stocks , and long-term bonds  can protect against the downside of a recession while offering an attractive yield in most cases. However, they fail to guard against further increases in long-term interest rates or soaring energy prices.As a result, we believe that investing in midstream infrastructure businesses that offer very attractive and sustainable distribution yields, have very strong balance sheets with relatively little exposure to rising interest rates, and boast recession and energy price volatility-resistant business models is one of the best moves an investor can make today. Based on these criteria, EPD and ET are among the best options available right now for investors who are willing and able to deal with K-1 tax forms.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,"There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer. ThisWe've already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger   acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired. There will be more similar opportunities in the future. For now, let's take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the U.S. energy sector.In the past 15 years, U.S. energy production has skyrocketed. Since 2007, we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter. We have increased naturalBut today   we don't hear much about this from politicians or in the media. It may be that, with today's political alignment, the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations   and, for other reasons, the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that fact.This article deals with the general effects of this development. Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022. Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time period.There has been a major decline in coal production, but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources. On a Quadrillion BTU basis, the decline in coal production has been roughly 11.458  while the increases in petroleum, natural gas, solar, and wind production have been respectively 13.969, 17.320, 3.504, and 1.814 for a total net increase of 25.149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly one-fourth of our total annual energy consumption. This has not been a demand-driven increase in production. During these same 15 years, the annual energy consumption in the U.S. has stayed roughly equal, actually declining slightly from 100.9 Quads to 100.3 Quads. There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables. But an equally important shift has been that the U.S. is no longer an energy importer and, in fact, exports petroleum  on a net basis , natural gas, and coal.Back in 2007, the massive U.S. oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which, in turn, was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices. Heading into the Panic of 2008, oil prices briefly reached  145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach  200 a barrel. When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day,  200 a barrel means more than  700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits. This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates, confidence in our economy, and economic growth.There is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy. Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of  choke chain  on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil, which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which, in turn, produced a recession. An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973, 1979, 1990, and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases. There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middle-income  and other  Americans who had to pay more money for gasoline.While the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them, the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental. Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lower-middle-income Americans especially hard. Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spend higher than average amounts of take-home pay on gasoline. The drain created by gasoline price increases may have increased the number of residents who defaulted on the mortgages that backed the securities whose failure led to the Panic.Now that we are no longer major importers of oil, it is still possible for world oil prices to increase and for that to increase U.S. gasoline prices. But there is an important difference. In 2007, the money being spent to buy more expensive imported oil was going overseas and, in some cases, was not easily recycled into the U.S. economy. If we had a major price increase today  as we had in 2022 , the money would stay in the U.S. economy and go to higher royalty payments, higher tax collections in oil-producing states and localities, increased CAPEX by oil producers, and increased dividend payments to owners of U.S. oil companies. This immediate recycling of funds within the U.S. economy may have the effect of reducing the negative impact of higher oil prices on growth and reducing the danger of a deep recession. This may be a factor  although certainly not the only factor  in the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy in the current cycle.It should be noted that the U.S. economy can still be impacted by a cutoff in oil imports or a massive increase in the world oil price. While we are net exporters, the petroleum market is complex, and we still import crude and export refined products. Refineries are generally set up to refine certain types of crude, and transportation economics often leads to imports in one part of the country and exports in another part. Due to this complexity, an abrupt cessation of oil imports would be disruptive, and it would take time and expense to adjust. But the degree of disruption would pale in comparison with the impact we would have suffered in 2007.Now that the U.S. is actually a net exporter of energy rather than an importer, an increase in energy prices will tend to reduce the U.S. trade deficit rather than increase it. This would tend to strengthen the dollar. Most of our trading partners are actually net importers, so their currencies may be negatively impacted by higher oil prices. The net effect in the long term may be a stronger dollar which tends to reduce inflationary pressures.The fact that the dollar is not likely to be negatively affected by the rollercoaster of oil prices, although competing major currencies  the euro or the yuan  may suffer negative effects, is likely to cement the dollar in place as the global reserve currency.The fact that we are no longer dependent upon oil imports will likely enhance our national security. In the 20th century, oil was a major factor in the cause and the course of World War 2. Our oil independence may give us more leverage in confronting various oil-exporting countries  including Russia . The Strategic Petroleum Reserve   originally set up to ensure that our military would have access to oil in the event of a cutoff of imports   now does not really need to serve that purpose. Instead, it can be used to cushion the market from price fluctuations and also to generate profits simply by buying at low prices and selling at high prices. The Biden Administration seems to have adopted this policy.As noted above, the petroleum market is complex, and we should take measures to protect ourselves against the disruption that an abrupt cut-off would entail. It is also the case that many of our allies are net importers, and we would try to help cushion the impact upon them by increasing our exports if their imports were disrupted. But   again   the impact of an import disruption upon us from a national security perspective today would be sharply reduced from the impact we would have suffered in 2007.The above factors lead to certain conclusions from the perspective of investment. They definitely make investment in the U.S. more attractive than investment in markets which would be subject to severe impact from higher oil prices or an oil import disruption. The enhanced resilience of the dollar makes investment in dollar-denominated assets comparatively attractive.The U.S. energy sector also becomes more interesting because of its ability to serve as a source of exports to our allies  especially in the natural gas-oriented sector, certain names should command investor attention.

Energy Transition And Robots - Why MP Materials Has So Much Potential,"I have some fantastic investments that I was able to time perfectly. However, I also have some investments on my radar and in my portfolio where timing has turned out to be tricky - for various reasons.One of these companies is the . The company, which is named after the Mountain Pass mine it manages in California, is down 26  since I wrote an  titled on July 6, 2023.Here's a part of my takeaway back then  emphasis addedOne of the issues the world is facing is the acceleration in demand for rare earth metals. For example, electric cars need more than 200 kilograms of minerals per vehicle. A conventional car needs less than 50 kilograms.Offshore wind turbines need close to 16 tons of mineralsWhile this is already a challenge, it gets worse as China dominates the processing of most of these minerals, which adds a whole new layer of geopolitical risks - especially in the current environment of increasing tensions.That's where MP Materials comes in.In this article, I'll elaborate on the bull case and the risk reward in light of both challenges and opportunities.As bullish as secular growth may be, the company faces cyclical weakness, hurting pricing and demand.Timing a potential bottom in cyclical demand could lead to tremendous long-term results.So, let's dive into the detailsAs great as the long-term bull case may be, cyclical demand is what drives earnings.In the second quarter, revenue decreased by 55 , mainly due to lower realized pricing and a small amount of rare earth fluoride sales in the prior year.Adjusted diluted EPS declined to  0.09, primarily due to the lower adjusted EBITDA.In light of these poor numbers, during the earnings call, the company noted the ongoing weakness in NdPR pricing but highlighted the robust growth in electric vehicle and e-mobility sectors, expected to continue at least 20-30  annually.However, industrial applications like wind turbines and consumer electronics have experienced weakness, partly due to economic conditions in China.Management also showed how big the impact of cyclical demand is, easily offsetting secular tailwinds.The company emphasized the short-term impact of traditional industries on the accelerating EV demand but underscored the long-term growth prospects for the rare earth industry, which makes sense, as it's the cornerstone of America's strategy to produce rare metals at home.MP also commented on an issue currently flying under the radar  robots.As it turns out, if we get a situation of mass robot adoption, it could be an even better opportunity for MP than the EV revolution.Having said that, operations continue to run smoothly.Despite a semiannual plant shutdown, concentrate production and product grade saw a modest year-over-year increase in the second quarter.This success was attributed to fewer unplanned downtimes and the intense cross-training efforts during Stage II commissioning.The company emphasized the importance of consistent and safe execution for Stage II operational performance, focusing on increased uptimes and identifying and resolving temporary bottlenecks.Management also expressed confidence in the progress of commissioning, particularly in the hydrometallurgy, rare separation, and product finishing circuits.In the next earnings call, we can expect updated production numbers, as the company planned to initiate shipments of NdPr oxide and other products in the third quarter.With that in mind, on September 21, almost two months after its 2Q23 earnings call, the company updated investors on key issues like pricing and production during the D.A. Davidson Diversified Industrials   Services Conference.For example, the company focused on the three stages of production This is where they mine the material and concentrate it from 6.5  to 60-65  rare earth content. Stage 1 is vital as it serves as the feedstock for downstream processes. In this stage, they refine the concentrated material, allowing them to access a broader market since refined products are more versatile. They're building a facility in Fort Worth to produce magnets. This move will complete their supply chain, from mining to magnet production, and they've already secured GM as a foundational customer for this facility.The company also discussed the pricing dynamics of NdPr, which has seen fluctuations from a peak of  175 kg to a low of  60 kg and is currently in the low  70s kg. As I already briefly discussed, this is due to cyclical headwinds offsetting secular growth.However, this also keeps new rare earth supply from entering the marketAccording to the company, new supply won't enter the market with prices below  120 per kilogram. MP believes that even established operators in China are now operating at a loss.MP has a very healthy balance sheet. The company is expected to end this year with  220 million in net cash, which means it has more cash than gross debt. Next year, the company is expected to generate positive free cash flow, allowing it to maintain a healthy balance sheet despite investments in growth.During the aforementioned conference, the company was asked about its healthy balance sheet and how it looks at near-term and longer-term capital structure plans.This is what the company said  emphasis addedHaving said that, putting a valuation on this company is tough. Very tough.After all, MP trades based on expected fluctuations of the commodities it produces.This is what I wrote in my prior articleRight now, MP is trading at the lower bound of my expected bottoming range. I expect that this may hold, and I remain bullish.I also stick to my  60 target, which I expect the company to blow out of the water the moment both cyclical and secular drivers provide tailwinds.However, it needs to be said that investors need to be careful. MP is highly volatile and not right for investors who cannot handle this kind of risk.So, please be aware of these risks before buying a single MP share.MP Materials Corporation, a company dedicated to reducing America's reliance on China for rare earth materials, faces a mix of challenges and opportunities.While the company's stock may seem speculative and volatile, the long-term prospects are promising.The demand for rare earth metals is on the rise, driven by industries like electric vehicles and robotics.Despite cyclical weaknesses, MP Materials remains well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth in this sector. Its operations are running smoothly, and a healthy balance sheet, coupled with an optimistic outlook on pricing dynamics, adds to its appeal.However, investors should be cautious, as the stock's high volatility might not be suitable for everyone.

Keurig Dr Pepper: Tapping Into The Converging Beverage Market,"The merger between a coffee-making and a soda-making company in 2018, which formed Keurig Dr Pepper , has proven to be a strategic move that substantially enhanced the company's market share, elevated its sales performance, and boosted its stock value. InvestorsWhile it's important to note a recent decline in sales volume and the link between increased revenue and rising prices due to inflation, as well as the stock's year-to-date loss indicating some negative market sentiment, several positive factors should be considered. Amidst the current market uncertainty, Keurig Dr Pepper has demonstrated resilience by raising its sales outlook for 2023. The company maintains profitability, diligently reducesIn a significant merger five years ago, Dr Pepper, Snapple, and Keurig Green Mountain came together to form Keurig Dr Pepper. The company currently operates across three distinct segments  U.S. Refreshment Beverages, U.S. Coffee, and International. Among these, the Refreshment Beverages segment stands out as the primary revenue driver. Notably, Keurig Dr Pepper ranks as the  company worldwide in terms of market capitalisation.Keurig Dr Pepper is strategically focused on achieving organic growth through three primary pillars. Firstly, it aims to foster growth in its core brands. Secondly, it seeks to enhance its portfolio and optimise omnichannel strategies. Thirdly, it concentrates on refining its selling and distribution systems. Looking ahead to the next five years, the company is poised to capitalise on the evolving landscape of the beverage industry, with plans to bolster its core business and diversify its brand portfolio. Keurig Dr Pepper has identified growth opportunities in expanding its product offerings, particularly in segments such as energy drinks, ready-to-drink coffee, and sports hydration. anticipate sales growth of 5-6 , surpassing the earlier 5  estimate, while adjusted earnings are expected to increase by 6-7 . Investors can gain further insights during the Q3 2023 Earnings Conference call scheduled for .Keurig Dr Pepper has demonstrated growth in both its revenue and profitability over the past half-decade. Notably, the company has bolstered its financial position, consistently generated positive levered free cash flow, and recently augmented its dividend payouts. Although the company has encountered a decline in sales volume, it has effectively leveraged its robust core brand portfolio, harnessed the power of premiumisation, and capitalised on expansion opportunities in segments like  This is evident in the company's impressive revenue, which has surged to a trailing twelve-month total of  14.57 billion.When we assess Keurig Dr Pepper's growth trajectory in comparison to several major industry players like The Coca-Cola Company , PepsiCo , Anheuser-Busch InBev , Starbucks , and Monster Beverage , the company's performance stands out prominently. Over the past five years, Keurig Dr Pepper has achieved an impressive compound annual growth rate  CAGR  in revenue, recording a robust 24.60 . Furthermore, its net income has exhibited substantial double-digit growth at 11.26 , surpassing the performance of key competitors such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Monster.The company's net income, currently at TTM  1.6 billion, has displayed a generally upward trajectory, with the exception of a decline in one FY.It's evident that the company consistently generates positive levered free cash flow over the past five years, although the TTM figure of  1.55 billion is slightly lower than that of FY 2022. This surplus cash provides the company with opportunities for reinvestment in its business, rewarding investors, and reducing its debt load.The company has successfully reduced its debt load over the past five years, although it still maintains a relatively high level of debt. Below are details regarding the upcoming debt maturities that the business needs to address. It's worth noting that the company initiated a  4 billion  in 2022. The company's current ratio stands at 0.39, suggesting potential challenges in meeting its short-term obligations.The company has recently  by 7.5 , resulting in a forward dividend yield of 2.86  with a payout ratio of 46.51 .The stock currently holds a Buy rating of 3.77 from Wall Street analysts, and it is trading significantly below its  of  38.39, presenting a potential 27.67  upside. When comparing the FWD price-to-earnings ratio to its larger industry peers, the company appears undervalued, boasting a ratio of 19.53. Additionally, the stock's price-to-book ratio stands at 1.66, which is favourable compared to its peers. Given the company's expectations for revenue growth in FY 2023 and its promising long-term prospects in both hot and cold beverages, this could present an attractive investment opportunity, particularly as the stock has recently experienced a  value year to date.Although Keurig Dr Pepper has outlined a positive forecast for FY 2023, there are risks we should be cautious of including the potential impact of an economic recession in 2024, ongoing inflationary pressures affecting pricing strategies, disruptions in the supply chain, stiff competition in the coffee market, shifts in consumer preferences and health trends, interest rate volatility affecting borrowing costs, execution risks in mergers and acquisitions, succession planning concerns, changing market and consumer trends, regulatory and environmental factors, potential brand and reputation risks, and geopolitical uncertainties associated with international operations. These could all negatively impact the growth of the business.Keurig Dr Pepper has revised its sales projections for FY 2023, demonstrating consistent top-line growth since its merger five years ago. While it's important to remain vigilant about potential economic downturns and persistent inflationary pressures, the company has showcased its capacity to expand market presence, introduce innovative products, and foster growth through organic and inorganic means. With the promise of long-term advantages and a presently appealing stock value, coupled with a more favourable price-to-earnings ratio compared to some of its larger counterparts, investors might consider adopting a bullish perspective on this stock.

Energy Storage Makes Tesla Stock A Strong Buy,"Since I last detailed the energy storage division of  in my  in April, the pace of development has continued ever more rapidly.Demand for the company's commercial and residential energy products continues to surge. Tesla's manufacturingThose who continue to value Tesla as a simple auto company are failing to see the wood for the trees. As my  in January detailed, Tesla's auto business is flourishing worldwide. It is energy storage, however, which makes TSLA stock a Buy over and above its current stock trading range.The company has a number of other potential big revenue hitters in the non-auto sector. These include  Optimus,   Dojo   which alone is receiving  1 billion investment in the coming year  and Insurance. These are still only potentialThat is very speculative. In comparison, energy storage is here and now. The revenue and the growth path are apparent. The company has always stated that its energy revenues could match their auto revenues. This is becoming increasingly clear and measurable. The stock is undervalued because most observers have not recognized this fact.Tesla's growth in energy storage comes at a time of secular market growth everywhere in the world.  Wood Mackenzie, installations in Q3 in for instance the USA rose to 1.680MW 5.597 MWh. That was a 116  increase on the previous quarter. The figure would have been higher if it had not been for supply chain constraints and delays in interconnecting the grid.The Inflation Reduction Act in the USA provides for substantial funding and encouragement for the nation's transformation to renewable energy. This is small fry compared to subsidies enjoyed by the fossil fuel industry, but it is a start. By comparison an  in August estimated that fossil fuels are subsidized to the tune of  7 trillion per annum, or  13 million per minute.According to some , Tesla currently has about 30  of the global BESS  Battery Energy Storage System  market. Bearing in mind the size of the market a few years hence, it is not surprising that Tesla is ramping up huge production. It is also not surprising that those who understand the market emphasize the influence this could have on company revenues and the company stock price.CEO Elon Musk has stated that he thinks they can in the long run capture 15  of the total energy market with Megapacks. These are pictured belowThat might be typical Musk over-exuberance. However as this  detailed, if they were to capture 5  of the total energy market, that would produce an astonishing  4.2 trillion in revenue in the long term.In the whole of 2022, Tesla's auto revenues rose 40  and energy storage revenues rose 64 . The differential between the two has increased markedly in 2023 and this gap is expected to continue to increase.At the the rise in energy generation and storage revenues reached 74  year-on-year. These revenues comprised only 6  of total company revenues. That percentage is changing rapidly. Megapack business over the  has grown by 62 , by 152  and by 360 . Deployments actually increased 222 .At the earnings call Musk got it about right concerning the company's achievements, and what makes it still a good BuyEnergy storage growth will only add to the already very impressive free cash flow figures from the company.Energy storage profitability is improving while auto revenues profit margins are in fact declining somewhat. Its revenue is growing much more rapidly than the admittedly healthy auto business, but that does have a measurable glass ceiling.My  in February detailed how the planned 40GWh capacity of the new Megapack plant to  in Lathrop California could contribute about  20 billion of revenue annually  by comparison, the company's auto revenues in 2022 were  81.462 billion . That  20 billion would equate to the sale of approximately 570,000 Model 3 autos. For comparison, in Q2 this year the company sold 466,140 cars.The company is  a similarly sized Megapack factory in Shanghai. This will be fully up and running sometime in 2024. The resultant 80 GWh of capacity would provide Tesla with revenue value of  40 billion and profits of  10 billion.This forward-thinking capital expenditure is based on solid grounds. A  expects capacity of 1.143GWh by 2020 by which time the market size will have increased 15-fold. Tesla intends to remain one of the market leaders in this transition and is perfectly placed to do so.When Lathrop and the new China factory are both fully up and running, this should produce an immediate  40 billion in sales and  10 billion in profits. Already current lead-times for Megapack are about 18 months to 2 years ahead.The 50 50 split between autos and energy is no longer a pipe-dream. At the  call Management had stated that stationary storage growth would  significantly  exceed auto growth. This aim continues to be the case and one can see a clear road map towards it. The company expect energy storage margins to reach mid 20  range, about the same as autos. The aspiration is to reach this margin in 2023, but perhaps the more likely expectation should be to reach this in 2024.The projects keep rolling in. Sceptics say these are one-off low-profit projects, but they are mistaken and they leave out software from their calculations. The company expects 20 years of ongoing revenue from the  Powerhub  monitoring and control software for each project. This package comprises  Autobidder,   Opticaster,  and  Microgridder  programs. Although such matters are confidential between supplier and customer, this detailed  reckons the software revenue for Tesla will amount to approximately 5  of the project value.Credits that will come from the U.S Government's program under the Inflation Reduction Act will add to the profitability.One might summarize the following advantages that Megapack has over the competition High efficiency. Fast and easy installation. Optimization of land use. State of the art software integration and management. Easy integration with solar.Some recent projects include Eveco 53 MW  using 53 Megapacks  value about  84 million . CS Energy 100 MW  Australia using 80 Megapacks  value about  128 million . Sierra Estrella , which will be the largest in that State. It is thought that the Megapack value could be as much as  300 million though exact numbers have not been confirmed in public. NGEN Smart Grid System at  the largest such project in Austria so far, at 10MW. It is worth about  16 million to Tesla. Cranberry Point Energy Storage   Medway Grid projects in These are thought to involve approximately 300 Megapacks  value about US 480 million . in Australia. The latest to be awarded is the 197 MW Collie Battery in Western Australia for AEMO. The country's largest project manager in this field, Neoen, has worked on 6 projects together with Tesla. Currently they are installing on the 200 MW and Blyth Battery and the 200 MW Western Downs Battery. Tesla and Neoen originally worked together on the famous  world's largest battery  project at Hornsdale. Tesla's software integration abilities are a central driver of the co-operation of the two companies.In an indication of faith in their own products, the company is installing 68 Megapacks at their own  plant. This is thought to have a power of about 131 MW.This list is by no means intended to be comprehensive but to give an idea of the types and global reach. An interesting site, ,  gives a more comprehensive picture of this. They identify projects amounting to 5,204 MW 12725 MWh.Earlier this year it was confirmed that the company had installed over half a million residential Powerwalls. VPP's around the world are gaining pace. Even in fossil fuel-based Texas, customers are reducing bills by about one-third by participating in VPP's. These provide much needed grid support to ERCOT  Electric Reliability Council of Texas  with the ability for bidirectional charging. As extreme weather becomes more frequent due to climate change, VPP back-up to often-creaking utilities becomes crucial.The regulatory framework from State to State is about the only impediment to more rapid business which in actuality financially benefits both the utility and consumer. This seems to suddenly be changing.In Colorado recently, utility   set up a VPP scheme, open to households using products from Tesla or SolarEdge  NASDAQ. Xcel is active in 8 different States, and this move shows how U.S. utilities are finally actioning large-scale VPP's after some years of trials.One forward-thinking utility that has already accrued clear benefits is Green Mountain Development Corp.  of Vermont. They have had a  since 2015 of gradually bringing Powerwall users into a VPP. It has been so successful that it is now being opened up fully statewide. Just with 4,800 residences, it has built up 27 MWh capacity and enabled the utility not to have to invest large capex in new generating capacity. The utility and the residence owners have both saved substantial amounts. It is a win-win game. Vermont now expects to have 100  renewable power by 2030 at the latest.Australia is where Tesla got the VPP project business off the ground, and they continue to grow the South Australia VPP. This is shown . The long-term aim is to have 50,000 homes in the VPP there. That alone would provide 250 MW of solar energy and 650 MWh of battery storage capacity and have a value of perhaps  5 billion on the basis of  10,000 per Powerwall.In California, VPP's are established and have  strongly in the past year, as the graphic below showsThis shows even faster growth than California's , as illustrated belowTesla-based VPP's are expanding worldwide. They are only constrained by the company's ability to supply product. As with Megapacks, waiting times are up to 2 years for product. As Tesla's capacity has built up, and as they no longer need to prioritize autos over storage, revenue figures will rise very rapidly.It was recently that Tesla are setting up a VPP in Puerto Rico. There are already about 50,000 units there, much of it from Elon Musk's charitable assistance to the country following the weather catastrophe of recent years.There have been  of a major drive for the use  and potential manufacture  of Tesla Powerwalls in India. This has not been either confirmed or denied by the parties involved. It would be highly beneficial in a country where blackouts are frequent and where there is huge production of polluting coal-based plants.In the UK, Tesla received a license in 2020 to be an electricity generator to complete with established players like Octopus. They have recently been on a recruitment drive to go full out as a This comes at a time when what would be the complementary auto division has been seeing soaring sales in the country. It may well be that Tesla will do this in country after country as and when their autos have sold well  which is virtually every country in Europe in 2023 .In fact, world leader after world leader seems to want to meet Musk to discuss investments. For example Musk has  with President Erdogan to discuss facilities for both autos and energy storage.As with the Megapack, there is a substantial order backlog for the Powerwall. Tesla's plans to ramp up production have not been itemized as clearly as for the Megapack, but the ramp-up has begun. There will be a more powerful  coming online in the coming months. Tesla's ability to supply, and the whole pace of the inevitable transition to renewables, could be slowed down by insufficient supply of minerals such as lithium and nickel. The dominance of Asia, especially China, in the market as explained  could be a problem. However Tesla's increased investments in Asia could stand them in good stead against the competition and are no doubt a reason for Musk's recent push in the continent and meetings with political leaders in India and Indonesia.Lithium battery power might get superseded by other battery technologies. Unknown possible world economic or political crises that can hamper an international giant like Tesla.The future of energy is a picture of renewables replacing fossil fuels. Storage is the natural concomitant of renewable sources such as wind and solar. EVs are the critical way in which greenhouse gases can be reduced and air quality improved. The two complementary technologies are growing together hand-in-hand and Tesla are leading players in both.Storage, though, will in my opinion come close to matching autos in revenue in the medium term. By next year, the Megapack production should provide revenue potential of  40 billion. This compares to total revenue for the company in 2022 of  81.5 billion. The 50 50 divide between autos and energy is now foreseeable long term, as the growth picture for renewables is far greater than that for autos.Tesla's capital investment in storage and their strong share of the market should enable the company to remain at the forefront. It makes their stock very attractively priced, as the current price is based mainly on auto revenues. The long-term future for substantial growth may lie with storage. Other new areas outlined above may of course also contribute substantially long term, but they are by no means certainties in my opinion.Energy storage is without doubt a rapidly growing worldwide market. It seems to be unstoppable due to worldwide secular trends. The benefits to Tesla, Inc.'s revenue and are cash flow may come sooner than expected. As outlined in this article, for Megapack alone this should amount to  40 billion in sales and  10 billion in profits within a couple years. That is very likely to have a strongly bullish effect on Tesla's stock price.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Phillips 66 - What To Make Of Its 4% Yield,"In May, I wrote an  titled . Since then, the stock has risen by 23 , almost hitting my first  120 target in recent days.Hence, in this article, we'll take a closer lookSo, without further ado, let's keep this intro short and get right to itWith a market cap of  50 billion, Houston-based Phillips 66 is one of America's three major pure-play refinery stocks. Its main peers are Valero  and Marathon Petroleum . I'm saying pure-play because it also has competition from integrated oil and gas companies like Exxon Mobil , Chevron , and others.One of the reasons why PSX has lagged behind its peers is its focus on other areas. As I wrote in my prior article, the company generated 66  of its full-year 2022 revenues in the Marketing   Specialties segment, followed by Refining  25  and Midstream  9 .As a result, it has one of the most well-diversified portfolios among its peers - anywhere in the world. This includes major operations on the Gulf Coast and a pipeline network connecting other facilities to customers. On the Gulf Coast alone, it has the capacity to process more than 520 thousand barrels of crude per day.With regard to its strategic priorities  as seen in the overview below , over the past year, the company returned 14  of its market capitalization  5.4 billion  to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.The company is on track to achieve the goal of returning  10 to  12 billion over the 10-quarter period from July 2022 to year-end 2024.The Refining segment contributed significantly to the cost savings that make this possible, with over  300 million of the  550 million run-rate savings attributable to Refining operations.Furthermore, according to the   emphasis addedA closer look at its balance sheet shows that the company has  8.6 billion in available liquidity,  3.0 billion of this coming from cash. Its net debt ratio is close to 1.2x  EBITDA  and is expected to remain subdued. Hence, it has an A3 BBB  credit rating.Furthermore, in addition to advancing the renewable fuels project at its San Francisco refinery to produce 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels, the company is seeing improvements in its Chemicals segment.During its 2Q23 earnings call, the completion of the 1-hexene unit in Texas and the impending start of operations by the end of the third quarter were mentioned.Additionally, the new propylene splitter at the Cedar Bayou facility is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter.Please note that the company's chemical operations under CP Chemical are a joint venture between Phillips 66 and Chevron. As seen in the overview below, this segment is seeing a steep increase in CapEx to grow the segment more rapidly in the future - hopefully with economic tailwinds.The company is also actively engaged in joint ventures with Qatar Energy to establish significant petrochemical facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar.Phillips 66 currently pays a  1.05 dividend per share per quarter. This translates to a yield of 3.7 .This dividend is protected by a 21  net income payout ratio, a healthy balance sheet, and a boatload of free cash flow.The company is expected to maintain a free cash flow yield of over 9  through 2025 - despite an expected moderation in free cash flow. Even including net debt  FCF EV , that ratio remains elevated.The chart below confirms this, as dividend payments are just a very small part of operating cash flow. The biggest part is spending on growth.Even sustaining CapEx is very low, which means once growth spending declines, free cash flow is likely to accelerate.Additionally, the company has a history of buybacks. Since the spin-off from ConocoPhillips , the company has spent more on buybacks than dividends, buying back close to 30  of its shares.The five-year dividend CAGR was 6.6 . The most recent hike was 8.2  on February 8, 2023.Adjusted earnings decreased by  199 million during the second quarter, primarily due to lower results in Refining and Midstream.While Refining's adjusted pretax income decreased by  460 million, Midstream's adjusted pretax income was down  52 million due to declining commodity prices in the NGL business.Chemicals' adjusted pretax income decreased by  6 million.Marketing and Specialties, however, experienced a  218 million increase in adjusted second-quarter pretax income due to higher global marketing margins.Going forward, in Chemicals, a mid-90s global O P utilization rate is expected in the third quarter.For Refining, a mid-90s worldwide crude utilization rate is expected, along with projected turnaround expenses of  110 to  130 million.Corporate and Other costs for the third quarter are estimated to be between  280 million and  300 million.During its earnings call, the company also mentioned that the full-year capital spend is expected to exceed the  2 billion budget due to additional spending on projects like Rodeo Renewed and the recent acquisition of West Coast marketing assets.While margin normalization is somewhat hurting refining income and slower economic growth should keep a lid on organic growth in chemicals, the company remains in a good spot.The company is trading at 8.9x 2024E free cash flow. Using the 10x multiple I applied in the past gives us a 13  upside.The current consensus price target is  127. That's 12  above the current price, in line with my target.However, I wouldn't jump into PSX at these prices. While I will apply a  rating, the recent stock price jump has lowered the dividend yield to 3.7 . That's not a lot, given the cyclical risks that come with it - despite consistent dividend growth.If I didn't own Valero already, I would be looking to buy PSX for close to  100 per share.Given the weakness in economic growth, I do not rule out reaching that target.Phillips 66, with its diversified downstream portfolio and strategic priorities, stands as a significant player in the industry.The company's well-managed balance sheet, commitment to shareholder returns, and ongoing projects underscore its resilience.However, the recent price surge prompts caution, as the cyclical nature of the energy sector calls for prudent evaluation of the risk reward.While my  rating is maintained, the current dividend yield may not satisfy income-focused investors.Should the market offer an opportunity to buy shares around  100, the cyclical risks might be better cushioned.As economic uncertainties persist, the journey to that mark could well be worth the wait.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

"Mizuho ups Chevron and two others on positive view of E&Ps, cuts two refiners","Chevron , Matador Resources  and Permian Resources  all trade higher Wednesday as Mizuho upgraded the stocks, maintaining a constructive outlook for oil and gas prices outside of refiners.Mizuho analysts led by Nitin Kumar said Chevron With the PDC Energy acquisition now closed, Kumar expects Chevron  will resume a more aggressive pace of stock buybacks into Q4.Mizuho sees Matador  positioned for greater than 20  oil growth next year with modestly lower total capex Y Y, which is differentiated among small-to-midcap E Ps, while Permian Resources  continues to demonstrate a strong operational track record post-merger with Colgate, boosting confidence in the ability to hit its  10  end-to-end oil growth target from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023.The analysts also added Pioneer Natural Resources  to its top E P picks, while removing Devon Energy  but keeping a Buy rating.ConocoPhillips  is one of several energy companies getting a price target bump from Mizuho, to  135 from  127, while APA Corp.'s  target is increased to  47 from  30, Exxon Mobil's  PT is changed to  131 from  130, and Occidental Petroleum  is raised to  75 from  68.Although near-term refining margins are likely strong, Kunar said he is less constructive on U.S. refiners in the near term given margin headwinds and valuations, downgrading refiners Marathon Petroleum  and HF Sinclair , as well as Magnolia Oil   Gas  Valero  is Mizuho's only Buy-rated refiner.",6,2023-08-16T12:42:33.000-04:00
Exxon Mobil: Risk/Reward Isn't Appealing With Profit Slump,"Investors probably shouldn't be surprised that   missed analyst estimates  for the first time after announcing a major acquisition. The energy giant has now seen energy prices return to normal levels andBefore the market open on Friday, Exxon Mobil  as followsThe bad news is that the energy giant missed both EPS and revenue targets. The good news is that Exxon Mobil produced  9.1 billion in earnings and  16.0 billion in cash flow from operations during the quarter.The company is now reporting margins  blue diamonds  in theExxon Mobil is now producing an annual EPS of  9, and investors have to question whether energy prices go higher or lower. The ultimate risk is that WTI now heads lower again from trading currently around  83.Over the prior 10 years, WTI traded below  75 from late 2014 until late 2021. The current higher oil prices  are not the norm, so anyone buying Exxon Mobil at a current price of  107 has to consider the reality that the stock is slightly expensive at 12x normalized EPS with the risk of much lower prices. Even with multiple wars ongoing now, oil prices don't appear headed higher.Exxon Mobil initially jumped due to the BoD approving a  to  0.95 a share. Investors should be cautioned against overreacting to dividend hikes in the midst of a company missing financial targets and watching EPS plunge over 50  YoY.Exxon Mobil now offers a 3.5  dividend yield, but the energy giant was already paying out  3.66 billion in dividends quarterly. The company has a capital expenditures requirement this year trending towards  25 billion, calling into question the wisdom of focusing too much on more payouts.The energy giant will now pay over  15 billion in annual dividend payouts. Along with the  25 billion in capex expenses this year, Exxon Mobil has  40 billion in financial commitments.The company has mostly maintained oil production at around 3.7 Moebd despite some small divestments. The fear here is that Exxon Mobil is spending billions of dollars to buy non-organic growth.A few weeks back, Exxon Mobil announced the  to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  for  60 billion in an all-stock deal. The deal was consumed at an 18  premium and was quickly followed by   agreeing to acquire   for a nearly similar  53 billion valuation.The historical energy sector deals typically top-tick the market. Though energy prices aren't necessarily elevated here, Exxon Mobil had nearly 7 years to acquire companies when prices were depressed, and now the energy giants are acquiring assets for premium deals when profits are falling.Exxon Mobil was reporting an EPS topping  4 per share and now the quarterly profits are down around  2. The market should question the logic of the energy giants suddenly finding Pioneer appealing near all-time highs.The  253 stock price values Pioneer at  12x EPS targets for 2023. Exxon Mobil forecasts extracting  2 billion in pre-tax synergies, mostly from drilling efficiencies. The deal valuation isn't horrible compared to the valuation of Exxon Mobil's stock, but the company now has to spend years integrating the business and additional drilling efficiencies only amount to higher oil production leading ultimately to lower energy prices.Shareholders wanted Exxon Mobil to focus on the energy transition and capital returns while this deal shifts the focus right back to energy production, especially short-cycle projects in the Permian Basin.The key investor takeaway is that current profit trends and the Pioneer Natural Resources deal leave us bearish on Exxon Mobil stock. The risk is that energy prices head lower in the next year while these energy stocks trade around all-time highs already.Stone Fox Capital  aka Mark Holder  is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

"RTX: Q3 Earnings, Still A Smart Choice Amid Ongoing Engine Issues","I  about  , formerly known as Raytheon Technologies Corp.  a little over a year ago, in the midst of the bear market of 2022, when RTX stock was trading atTen months later, RTX stock, which had been trading at about  100 for most of the time since my first article, fell in response to the manufacturing issue identified, particularly with the company'sIn the meantime, the company has provided more , and yesterday, October 24, 2023, it released its .In this update, I will share my view on RTX's third quarter earnings report and whether the jump in the stock price to nearly  80 is justified  RTX stock was trading for less than  70 not too long ago . Given the increasingly high visibility of the costs associated with the engine issue and the fact that management does not expect any further significant impact, I have updated my valuation and share whether I think RTX stock is still a buy after the third quarter results.For the third quarter of 2023, RTX Corp. posted non-GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of  1.25 and adjusted revenue of  19 billion, both slightly ahead of . Given the company's , the earnings beat was no surprise. But RTX also delivered mostly better-than-expected results over the .However, RTX's solid third quarter earnings were not just another result of management's tendency to under-promise and over-deliver. The company is benefiting greatly from the recovery in commercial aviation since the pandemic and the current geopolitical uncertainties.On a consolidated basis, RTX has narrowed its reported and adjusted sales guidance and now expects full-year sales at the high end of the range  68.5 billion and  74 billion, respectively , representing adjusted organic sales growth of 10 . The difference between the expected GAAP and non-GAAP sales figures is reflected in the third quarter numbers and is due to a sales charge related to the Pratt   Whitney engine issue. The company narrowed its full-year EPS guidance to a midpoint of  5 per share - so RTX is currently trading at a P E of 15.6, which is definitely not bad for a leading commercial aerospace and defense company - but more on that later.Free cash flow  FCF  is now expected to be  4.8 billion -  500 million higher than previously and attributable to recent R D capitalization guidance received from the IRS. RTX Corp. can immediately deduct a portion of the previously capitalized R D costs it incurred in 2022  1.7 billion, p. 99,   . The remainder of this cash-flow-benefiting effect will be harvested by 2026. However, investors should not interpret the increased 2023 FCF guidance as a sign of better overall cash profitability than previously expected, because the  1.7 billion future income tax benefit was already reflected in the 2022 year-end balance sheet. RTX has merely pulled forward a portion of the tax benefit.Now that the PW1XXXG turbine disk issue is not expected to have any further incremental impact, the company has maintained its  of  7.5 billion, but keep in mind that RTX was still expecting  9.0 billion when it first addressed the issue in its .RTX's order backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2023 was  190 billion, split roughly 60 40 between commercial aerospace and defense. Clearly, RTX's products are in high demand - the company recorded a whopping  22 billion in new orders in the third quarter. The Q3 book-to-bill ratio of 1.19 is also very reassuring, but down from the previous quarter  Q2 ratio of 1.34, slide 4, . Figure 1 shows that Raytheon's commercial aerospace backlog continues to grow not only in absolute terms, but also in relative terms, in part due to the continued recovery from the pandemic.The  segment contributed adjusted sales of  6.7 billion  1  variance from reported sales  to RTX's sales, representing 17  year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand from the commercial original equipment market  27  year-over-year  and particularly from the aftermarket  30  year-over-year . The slight decline in military sales  -1  year-over-year  is due to timing of deliveries. Full-year sales growth is now expected in the low to mid-teens, slightly above the previous guidance. The 38  year-over-year growth in operating profit is also due to the continued strong recovery, while the full-year guidance has been maintained, largely due to higher SG A and production costs. reported adjusted sales of  6.3 billion for the third quarter, up 18  year-over-year, also driven by strong demand from commercial original equipment  25  year-over-year  and aftermarket  21  year-over-year . Military sales increased by 7  year-over-year, partly due to strong F135 production and sustainment bookings. Full-year sales are now expected to increase in the mid-teens compared to the prior year, near the high end of the previous range. Adjusted operating income was up 30  year-over-year, and management also increased full-year guidance. As noted above, P W segment results have been adjusted for the impact of powder metal issue on sales of  5.4 billion and on operating income of  2.9 billion. The remainder of the expected gross financial impact of  6 billion to  7 billion will be recognized over the remaining life of the contract  more on the powder metal issue later .Despite the solid results and outlook, and the continued recovery in passenger demand  e.g.,  in total traffic in August , a word of caution is in order. As we approach pre-pandemic traffic levels  95.7  in August 2023 , commercial air travel demand growth is expected to slow through 2024. However, as RTX management keeps a close eye on the many changing factors in the airline industry, I expect that the expected slowdown in growth has been appropriately factored into the forecasts.  formerly Raytheon Missiles   Defense and Raytheon Intelligence   Space  sales were  6.1 billion, up 3  year-over-year, but not due to an immediate increase in demand from Ukraine and Israel, but due to higher volume in Raytheon's Naval Power programs. Of course, I do not want to be misunderstood here and claim that Raytheon is not one of the beneficiaries of the current conflicts. In addition to the strong bookings for F135 production and sustainment mentioned above, RTX continues to benefit from replenishment orders for Ukraine  3 billion to date since the invasion began . The company expects another  4 billion worth of orders over the next two years, which should show up as revenue over the next 24 to 36 months.The fact that Raytheon reported sales growth of only 3 , but recorded a very high order intake of  7.4 billion for the quarter  book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 , once again underlines that there is a significant lag between the current demand for warfighting equipment and the resulting corporate profits. Investors should therefore be cautious when including the White House's  for  106 billion in additional funding in their valuation estimates - although more than  40 billion is expected to be allocated for Ukraine.In terms of segment operating profit, guidance has been lowered due to ongoing productivity challenges and, in particular, high inflation negatively impacting certain fixed price development programs. However, I would not over-interpret these headwinds as management expects these programs to reach key milestones over the next 12 months.As evidenced by the roughly 8  jump in RTX's share price within a day of the company's third-quarter earnings release, investors were relieved to read that the company had completed most of its analysis and did not expect any significant additional financial impact. As noted, the previously reduced 2025 free cash flow guidance of  7.5 billion has been maintained, but investors should still keep in mind the  1.5 billion difference from the second quarter guidance of  9.0 billion, when the issue was expected to have a negligible impact on 2025 FCF.As previously disclosed, the PW1XXXG engine is the most affected and will result in the most aircraft on ground. However, the V25XX fleet and F135 engines are also affected. Of course, this was already expected for the V25XX - after all, the issue was first discovered in 2020 when a V2533 engine installed on an Airbus A321 had an  during takeoff, causing debris to penetrate the engine cowling. However, given the maturity of the V25XX program, the number of spare engines available, and ongoing inspections, RTX expects very little operational or financial impact. Only about 100 incremental removals are expected in the next four years. Similarly, for the F135, RTX expects .RTX has previously indicated that it expects to replace as many high-pressure turbine  HPT  and compressor  HPC  disks with long-life disks as engines visit maintenance, repair and overhaul  MRO  facilities. While this results in higher upfront costs, it greatly improves the on-wing time after inspection. Retention of non-defective HPT and HPC disks - according to the refined analysis tools - would result in lower material costs, but also in lower remaining flight time of the inspected engines before the next service is due. The more-or-less sudden increase in demand for HPT and HPC disks in turn puts pressure on RTX's manufacturing and testing facilities, which the company is currently expanding. , COO, the necessary capacity for powder metal fabrication, forging and heat treatment is now in place, but adjusting machining and testing capabilities will take some time. The wing-to-wing time required for inspection and replacement will continue to be about 250 to 300 days, and investors should not misinterpret the COO's remarks . These were smaller scale visits for engines that were eligible for project visit work scope only. When confronted with this number during the Q A, Calio noted that he wanted to show how RTX is focused on streamlining and speeding up the process.RTX has made good progress in expanding its MRO facilities. So far in 2024, the company has brought online six workshops, and including the three additional facilities scheduled to come online by 2025, RTX has 19 locations worldwide. Considering that the number of planned shops has not been increased, this means that RTX is bringing forward planned investments. Therefore, some of the current negative impact on cash flow should not be over-interpreted as RTX will benefit from today's investments well into the future.To close out, the most important message   in my view   was the announcement of an additional  10 billion share buyback program. Compared to previous guidance, management now expects to repurchase  12.8 billion worth of RTX shares, of which  1.4 billion has been repurchased so far in 2023. This is strong testimony that further significant negative cash impacts are indeed unlikely and that management's long-term view of the profitability of the GTF franchise is not impaired.That said, I'm not a particular fan of debt-fueled share buybacks. However, it should be added that RTX recently agreed to sell its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services business for  1.3 billion, so the company will not increase its debt load by the entire  12.8 billion. In addition, the announced intention to begin reducing debt in 2024 underscores management's confidence in the company's cash-generating abilities.Finally, I'd like to note that I'm generally a bit leery of management beating the drum for its company's stock valuation  although it may indeed be appropriate here . That said, I agree that RTX stock represents compelling value at current levels  see below , but I'll still be keeping a watchful eye on the potentially upcoming Form 4 filings by RTX executives and directors with the SEC.Since my last article, the near-term expectation for RTX free cash flow has declined from  9 billion in 2025 to  7.5 billion. However, given management's comments during the conference call and the September update, I do not expect the future of the GTF engine business to be materially impacted and therefore expect free cash flow growth to return to the previously expected numbers later than before, which of course has a  slightly  negative impact on the stock's valuation due to the time value of money.However, there is another aspect to consider - the risk-free interest rate, as measured by the , has increased by about 110 basis points since my last article. In theory, it seems reasonable to add the 110 basis points to the expected cost of equity  calculated as the risk-free rate plus some equity risk premium . In my last article, I used a cost of equity of 9.0  due to the high uncertainty associated with the P W engine issue. Under normal circumstances, I would be satisfied with a cost of equity of around 8 , given the high quality of the company. Considering that much was clarified in the September update and also during yesterday's earnings release, I therefore reduce my expected cost of equity to 8.4 , and adding the increase in the risk-free interest rate, a discount rate of 9.5  seems appropriate for the discounted cash flow model.Figure 2 shows my updated discounted cash flow valuation for RTX stock. As expected, the additional negative impact of the powder metal issue has not significantly affected the valuation  -1 . However, due to the increase in the risk-free rate, the fair value estimate is lowered by an additional 6.7 percentage points.Attentive readers will have noticed that this fair value estimate does not take into account the massive share buyback program that RTX is expected to complete this year. However, as a conservative investor and given the current high interest rates  RTX will likely need to raise up to  10 billion in debt to fund the buybacks , I do not expect a material increase in fair value. That being said, as the company repays some of the debt and refinances the rest when interest rates eventually fall, a long-term positive effect cannot be dismissed. After all, the remaining repurchase authorization represents 10  of RTX shares currently outstanding at a price of  78 per share.RTX Corporation reported solid third quarter results on Tuesday. The company now expects to achieve adjusted sales of  74 billion in 2023, representing organic growth of 10  and underscoring the continued solid recovery in commercial aviation. However, a deceleration of growth in commercial aviation is expected in 2024. RTX saw very solid defense order intake, and including commercial aerospace  orders totaling  22 billion for the quarter , the company had a backlog of  190 billion at the end of the third quarter. Although the book-to-bill ratio decreased compared to the previous quarter, it is still quite high at 1.19. Bookings related to the Ukraine conflict were significant, but most of these, as well as potential orders related to the conflict in Israel, will not show up on the income statement for another 24 to 36 months.Free cash flow guidance was surprisingly raised by  500 million to  4.8 billion, but this should not be interpreted as a sign of better overall cash profitability than previously expected. With new IRS guidelines on the deductibility of previously capitalized R D costs, RTX simply pulled forward a portion of the income tax benefit.Management did not report much new on the powder metal issue, which was not surprising given the detailed September 11 update. The wing-to-wing time is still expected to be about 250 to 300 days, but management is focused on accelerating the process. Certain smaller scale visits for engines that were only eligible for a project visit showed promising results. Due to the powder metal issue, RTX has brought forward significant investments in its MRO facilities and will have 19 facilities in operation worldwide by 2025. Therefore, investors should not over-interpret some of the near-term capital and other expenditures, as these investments will benefit the company for years and decades to come as the GTF program is increasingly adopted and the GTF Advance engine is rolled out.The most important news during the earnings call was the announcement of a  10 billion accelerated share buyback program that will begin immediately. Management expects to repurchase  11.4 billion worth of RTX shares by the end of 2023, representing 10  of market capitalization at the current share price. This is a clear indication that further significant negative cash flow impacts related to the powder metals issue are unlikely and that the long-term profitability outlook of the GTF franchise is intact.Having factored in the news from the September 11 update and the increased risk-free rate into my valuation, I still consider RTX stock a solid buy. Even with a comparatively high cost of equity of 9.5 , the stock is undervalued by around 15  - and that's without the positive effect of share buybacks, which I like to include in my valuation as a  hidden margin of safety.  My RTX position currently represents 1.0  of my total portfolio value, and I expect to increase it to between 1.2  and 1.5  over the course of the year and depending on the availability of investable cash.Thank you for taking the time to read my latest article.

HighPeak Energy: Successfully Refinances Its Debt,"HighPeak Energy  has successfully refinanced its debt, pushing its next debt maturity  based on the springing maturity of its existing credit facility  out by around three years with a new .This givesThe rig restrictions do have the benefit of forcing HighPeak to spend less on capex and focus on generating more free cash flow, which it should be able to do decently with  80s oil.I believe HighPeak is roughly fairly pricedHighPeak successfully refinanced its debt by entering into a term loan agreement with a  1.2 billion commitment capacity. This term loan matures in September 2026 and carries an interest rate of SOFR   7.5 . The term loan has a first-lien security interest in substantially all of HighPeak's assets.With SOFR at around 5.3 , the term loan's current interest rate would be 12.8 , which is quite high for first-lien debt.HighPeak is using the proceeds from the term loan to repay its 10  unsecured notes due February 2024, its 10.625  unsecured notes due November 2024 and its existing credit facility borrowings  maturing in June 2024, but with a springing maturity to October 2023 .At the end of Q2 2023, HighPeak had  970 million in net debt, although with no working capital deficit its net debt would be closer to  1.25 billion. Proforma for its July equity offering, its net debt with no working capital deficit would be approximately  1.1 billion.HighPeak will likely continue to carry at least some working capital deficit and it mentioned that it is now generating positive free cash flow, so its  1.2 billion term loan should give it sufficient  albeit limited  liquidity, given that the term loan also imposes restrictions on how many active drilling rigs it can have.HighPeak is also allowed to enter into a super senior revolving credit facility for up to  100 million.HighPeak mentioned that it was adding a third drilling rig to take advantage of strong oil prices, but it will soon  in 2024  be limited to no more than two drilling rigs  outside of obligation wells  as long as its net leverage is 1.0x or higher. If its net leverage is between 0.75x to 1.0x, then it is allowed to have three drilling rigs.At current strip, HighPeak seems likely to be restricted to two drilling rigs into mid-to-late 2024, but should get its net leverage below 1.0x during 2H 2024. It may be able to get its net leverage below 0.75x by the end of 2024 at current strip, potentially allowing it to increase its rig count above three.I've modeled a scenario below where HighPeak runs a two-rig drilling program through most of 2024 and spends  600 million on capex. In this scenario HighPeak will likely see its production fall a bit from its 2023 exit rate  with guidance midpoint currently at 57,000 BOEPD .Thus I am currently modeling HighPeak's 2024 production at 53,000 BOEPD  83  oil  with the belief that it will exit 2024 with around 50,000 BOEPD in production if it continues with a two-rig drilling program. However, there is significant uncertainty around HighPeak's production levels due to its large number of recent wells and currently high base decline rate.At the current strip of  82 WTI oil for 2024, HighPeak may generate  1.382 billion in oil and gas revenues before hedges.HighPeak's 2024 hedges  from the end of Q2 2023  have approximately negative  14 million in value. This doesn't include the new hedges that HighPeak will add soon  if it hasn't done so already .As shown above, HighPeak is now required  as part of its term loan agreement  to enter into oil hedges covering at least 27,000 barrels per day in oil production for the twelve month period ending September 2024, with a floor price that is at least 85  of strip.I am modeling HighPeak's 2024 lease operating expenses  including workover expense  at  9.00 per BOE at 53,000 BOEPD in average production. HighPeak's cash interest costs may end up at around  146 million if it only makes its  30 million per quarter in scheduled repayments. It may be able to reduce its interest costs with accelerated repayments.This results in a projection of  354 million in 2024 free cash flow at low- 80s WTI oil and modest production declines.HighPeak also has  13 million in annual dividend payments at its current quarterly dividend of  0.025 per share. It is also required to make  120 million per year in term loan repayments.HighPeak estimated that its proved developed reserves had a PV-10 of  2.81 billion at  80 oil. This was based on estimated reserves from the beginning of August 2023.At  16.75 per share, HighPeak's market cap would be approximately  2.5 billion assuming that its outstanding options and warrants were exercised. It would have approximately 149 million shares outstanding along with  850 million in net debt. This  3.35 billion combined total is nearly 1.2x HighPeak's proved developed PV-10 at  80 oil. At  80s oil, HighPeak should be able to increase its proved developed reserves while also reducing its debt.I previously estimated HighPeak's value at  13 per share in a long-term  75 oil and  3.75 gas scenario. I've increased its estimated value to  14 per share with long-term  after 2024   75 WTI oil. This increase is due to higher near-term oil prices as well as the improved stability of HighPeak's finances.At long-term  80 WTI oil instead, I'd consider HighPeak's current share price of around  16.75 per share to be roughly fair. HighPeak's insiders have  at around its current share price, but I tend to take a more conservative view towards longer-term oil prices.HighPeak Energy successfully refinanced its debt and it now has three years until its new  1.2 billion term loan matures. It is paying close to 13  interest on that term loan though, and is also required to make  120 million per year in term loan repayments.At  80s oil, HighPeak should be able to make significant progress in reducing its net debt and leverage though. It will be restricted in terms of the number of active drilling rigs it can have until it reduces its leverage below 0.75x.I believe that HighPeak is currently fairly valued for a long-term  80 WTI oil scenario and is worth approximately  14 per share at long-term  75 WTI oil instead.We are currently offering a free two-week trial to .

My name is Carla and I will be your operator for today s call.  Operator Instructions  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today s call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO  Kevin Mitchell, CFO  Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals  Rich Harbison, Refining  and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today s presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today s call. Actual results may differ materially from today s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are pleasedSlide 4 shows the evolution of our portfolio. We are much more than a refining company. We are differentiated by an integrated and diversified Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, Marketing and Specialties portfolio that generates free cash flow through the economic cycles. Our global commercial supply and trading organization leverages our assets to generate incremental value. We continue to execute our strategy to increase more stable cash flows in Midstream. We see more growth opportunities as U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids production is expected to outpace crude oil. The demand fundamentals are strong as NGLs and petrochemical feedstocks remain the fastest growing segment of liquids demand.The DCP acquisition earlier this year strengthened our competitive position by integrating our NGL wellhead-to-market value chain and adds over  1 billion to mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA. Our current synergy run-rate is on pace to deliver more than  400 million. Midstream s stable cash generation covers the company s dividend and our sustaining capital. We will continue to capitalize on our integrated and diversified portfolio to deliver results.Moving to Slide 5. At our Investor Day in November 2022, we targeted  3 billion in mid-cycle EBITDA growth by 2025. This included NGL wellhead-to-market, Rodeo Renewed, business transformation and CPChem growth projects. Given the substantial progress employees across the company have made, we are raising the bar. We now expect to grow mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by  4 billion between 2022 and 2025, reflecting a  1 billion increase from our original target. This includes additional value from business transformation, midstream synergies and commercial contributions.We are increasing the business transformation target to  1.4 billion from  1 billion. We are enhancing our commercial capabilities to extract additional value, maximizing return on capital employed and increasing refining market capture. We are committing to higher shareholder distributions. Our new target is  13 billion to  15 billion between July 2022 and year end 2024. This is an increase from our original target of  10 billion to  12 billion. We will return over 50  of our operating cash flow to shareholders. Lastly, we plan to monetize assets that no longer meet strategic long-term objectives. Proceeds from monetizing these non-core assets are expected to be more than  3 billion. We will deploy the proceeds to advance strategic priorities, including accelerating cash return to shareholders.Slide 6 shows progress on distributions to shareholders and improving Refining performance. We returned  6.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since July 2022, representing over 50  of operating cash flow during the same time period. Strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to exceed the pace to achieve the original  10 billion to  12 billion target before year end 2024. The increased target of  13 billion to  15 billion equates to 25  to 30  of current market cap.Our Board of Directors approved a  5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This is in addition to the previous authorization, which had approximately  3.1 billion remaining as of September 30. Since 2012, the Board has authorized  25 billion in share repurchases. These higher distributions to shareholders will be supported by  4 billion of mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA growth between 2022 and 2025. We are laser-focused on improving Refining performance.Third quarter crude utilization of 95  was the highest utilization since 2019. Our refining system ran above industry average utilization rates for the third straight quarter. We continue to advance high return, low capital projects to improve reliability and market capture. We are executing 10 to 15 projects a year to improve market capture by 5 . Last year, we completed several projects that added 2  to market capture and we expect the 2023 projects to add a further 1.3 . We reduced costs by  0.40 per barrel and will achieve a  0.75 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2023. Our people have fully embraced business transformation and we are raising our target to a  1 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2024.Slide 7 provides an overview of the business transformation program. We are increasing our business transformation target to  1.4 billion, comprised of  1.1 billion of cost reductions and  300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. The incremental reductions are  300 million in costs, over half of which benefits Refining and  100 million of sustaining capital. We are on track to achieve the targets this year and next.Slide 8 summarizes our strategic priorities and enhancements. Last November, we announced six priorities to increase shareholder value. These were ambitious and consistent with investor feedback. Our achievements to-date provide us with the confidence that we will not only meet these targets, but we ll exceed them. So with the support of our Board, we are increasing our commitments to shareholders. Delivering on the commitments will generate additional free cash flow from our integrated and diversified portfolio, positioning us to increase cash returns to shareholders now and in the future.Now I ll turn the call over to Kevin to review the third quarter financial results.Thank you, Mark. Adjusted earnings were  2.1 billion or  4.63 per share. A  9 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by  0.02. We generated operating cash flow of  2.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of  285 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of  361 million.Capital spending for the quarter was  855 million. We returned  1.2 billion to shareholders through  752 million of share repurchases and  465 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 33 . Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 17 .I ll cover the segment results on Slide 10. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased  304 million, mostly due to improved results in Refining, partially offset by lower results in Chemicals and Midstream as well as higher corporate costs.In Midstream, third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was  569 million, down  57 million from the prior quarter. The decrease related to our NGL business and was mainly due to the timing of cargo freight costs as well as higher utility, integration and employee costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher margins from increasing commodity prices. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income decreased  88 million to  104 million in the third quarter. This decrease was mainly due to lower margins. Global O P utilization was 99 .Refining third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was  1.7 billion, up  592 million from the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher realized margins and strong utilization. Realized margins increased due to higher market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, lower secondary product margins and lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations. Inventory hedges and losses from secondary products mainly reflect the impact of rising crude prices during the quarter. These market factors negatively impacted capture rate, which was 66  in the quarter.Marketing and Specialties adjusted third quarter pre-tax income was  633 million, a slight decrease of  11 million from the previous quarter, reflecting continued strong margins. The Corporate and Other segment s adjusted pre-tax costs were  59 million higher than the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher net interest expense related to acquiring DCP Midstream s public common units on June 15 as well as employee-related expenses. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24 . The impact of non-controlling interest was improved compared to the prior quarter and reflects a lower non-controlling interest since our acquisition of DCP Midstream public common units.Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a  3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was  2.4 billion, excluding working capital. During the quarter, we funded  358 million of pension plan contributions, which comes out of cash from operations. That was a working capital benefit of  285 million. Year-to-date working capital is a use of around  2 billion, primarily related to inventory that we expect to mostly reverse by year-end. We received  280 million from asset dispositions, mainly reflecting the sale of our interest in South Texas Gateway Terminal. Total proceeds from asset dispositions of  370 million through the third quarter of 2023.We funded  855 million of capital spending. This includes  260 million for the acquisition of a U.S. West Coast marketing business. We repaid approximately  500 million of debt, mostly reflecting lower borrowings on DCP Midstream s credit facilities. Additionally, we returned  1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was  3.5 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results.Next, I ll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-90s and turnaround expenses to be between  90 million and  110 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between  280 million and  300 million.Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Please ask your question.Thank you. Good morning, team. This was very helpful, particularly the commentary on the strategic priorities. And so I want to   on the bullet about maintaining financial strength and flexibility, you talked about moving from  3 billion to  4 billion of EBITDA growth and greater than  3 billion of non-core asset dispositions. So wondering if you could take some time to talk about what are the key drivers of the move from  3 billion to  4 billion  And then as you identify non-core asset sales, what are some of the parameters that you re evaluating as we think about what assets could be part of that discussionHi, Neil. Good morning. This is Mark. When you think about the additional billion-dollar increments in EBITDA, that really comes from the enhanced business transformation work that we re going to do as well as the additional synergies we intend to capture from the DCP roll-up, supplemented by the enhanced capability and value creation that we re going to see out of the commercial organization. Regarding asset dispositions, this fundamentally is about creating focus and redeploying capital. We re not going to comment on specific assets today, but we generally have some high-performing assets that may be more valuable to others and maybe more strategic to others and we are going to explore that. And if we can capture value greater than our whole value, we ll do so. But the bottom line is this, that we re committed to managing the portfolio to drive focus that s consistent with our strategy and simplifying our business.Okay. Alright, thank you. And then on the quarter itself, the Refining capture rates probably came in a little bit lower than street was expecting. Was that just timing effects with crude  Or is there anything else that we need to keep in mind as we think about what it all means for 4Q and 2024Yes, Neil. It s Kevin. Let me just make a couple of comments on that. So we did have a few things moving around in the quarter that impacted capture to the negative. And so we saw regional price differentials that differed from the benchmark that we use in terms of the market crack. And so those worked against us that during the quarter, for example, the Chicago market, which became disconnected from the group, and we move product into that market. We also had an impact from the effect of inventory hedges in a rising price environment. So that crack component, this all showed up in the central corridor. We expect about  100 million to  150 million of that to come back in the fourth quarter as we see the physical gain on those barrels that offsets the paper loss that we took in the third quarter.It s very helpful. Thank you, Kevin.Thank you, Neil. Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes, thank you. Good morning and appreciate the winding up of the changes here, improvements, I should say, overall. The question I have, to start with, you mentioned  3 billion of target disposition proceeds, but you ve upped your overall EBITDA target. So I m just curious, what EBITDA is associated with those ops, if any  And what does that imply about the sort of extra growth in the overall performance of your raised EBITDA targetYes. Roger, it s Kevin. So just for clarity on that point, the growth that we laid out there, the incremental  1 billion is excluding the impact of dispositions. And so clearly, dispositions will reduce EBITDA. We re not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. I mean, you can come up with an assumption on where you may think we will be selling assets and make a multiple assumption from that. But we re not giving any specific guidance on the dispositions, other than we expect to realize in excess of  3 billion.Okay. And I assume based on the idea that there is always a larger pool of assets that could be sold, that s why it s unclear right now what the net impact would be.That s right. We will do what makes the most sense for us.Okay. And then a follow-up to Neil s question on Refining margins, but maybe looking forward rather than back. The shift here, where diesel margins are well above gasoline, I think about generally a diesel yield improvement for you versus industry standards. Is that the right way to think about Q4 here  Or is there anything else that we should be paying attention to that would work against thatYes, Roger, this is Rich. As we ve indicated over the years, our kit has shifted towards distillate production. There is nothing that s changed on that, other than some of our flexibility to move back and forth between gasoline and distillate. So we still maintain a kit that is favorable to distillate margins in the market.Great. Thank you.Thank you, Roger. Manav Gupta from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.Good morning, guys. My question here is, and I know kind of answer, most likely you will not answer it, but we get this question a lot. A very strong result on the West Coast again. A weaker default in price environment. Is there a possibility you could let Rodeo Renewed a little longer and capture higher margins and then just wait for LCFS to rebound later in 2024  So is there a way you could   is there a possibility you could move the timing of startup of Rodeo to better coincide with higher LCFS prices and, in the meantime, make more money on the West CoastManav, I ll start that answer and then maybe give   hand it over to Brian here to add a little color on the backside. So at Rodeo, maybe I ll just step back a little bit and level set on everything that s going on at Rodeo here. So Rodeo, there was two NGOs that filed a suit against at Contra Costa County, alleging that the Rodeo Renewed project environmental impact report insufficiently address project impacts. The ruling for the suit was received earlier this year. And actually, there were several issues in our favor, but there were three issues identified as insufficient in the county-certified EIR. The judge explicitly allowed construction to continue with the project while Contra Costa County works through and addresses the three deficiencies that were identified in the EIR. The county actually posted that revised EIR update on October 24. That initiated a 45-day public comment period. The county will respond to the comments and then likely issue a final EIR early 2024. So right now, our project construction remains on track to complete in the first quarter, and we re committed to that time line.However, I want to add, we have options. We ve talked a little bit about this, but let me be a little bit more explicit on this one. There is flexibility to continue crude operation in the event that circumstances beyond our control prevent the start-up of the project. I want to say we are committed to the start-up of the project. But if, for some reason, we don t have that authority, we will continue to operate in crude operation. This is a staggered conversion process. In the past, we ve called this a ramp-up plan, so that creates natural flexibility for us. It allows us to continue to process crude, or it allows us to start up the Rodeo Renewed project, which, I want to remind people, that s equivalent to removing emissions of 1 million cars from the roads. So we remain pretty confident. We remain confident, I should say, that we will start up the operation of Rodeo Renewed at the end of the first quarter. And we re focused on executing that conversion plan. But we have this planned flexibility, and we will continue to process the crude oil, if necessary. Now the outlook on the market and what your   the other part of your question is really this outlook of LCFS and   in this relationship. I m going to hand that over to Brian, who can explain that relationship a little bit more. It s more complicated than just the LCFS credit program.Hi, Manav, it s Brian. So when you think about the RD margins, you have to think about not just the credits but the price of the feedstock, the price of the RD when it comes to market. So even though we ve had lower LCFS and RINs, we ve had these distillate prices that have outrun soybean prices. In fact, soybean prices are off. We have more low CI feedstocks that are making their way into the U.S. Kinder Morgan pipeline is allowing RD on their pipelines now, so that means more reach of RD into the California market for consumption. We ve had   domestic demand is expected to continue to grow. We ve converted all our stations. We re seeing RD demand in Oregon and Washington continue to mature as those programs mature. We ve been seeing RD moving to states like Texas and Illinois and Colorado, where they have tax abatement and tax reduction programs. And I think traders believe that the U.S. harvest is looking good. And if you remember last year, in Argentina, they had a drought. And this year, we expect a more normal crop level condition. And then finally, what a lot of traders and folks have on their minds is SAF or renewable jet. And as those incentives make more sense to produce renewable jet, you ll see some of this RD that s being produced move away and become SAF. So we re expecting about 200,000 barrels a day of RD at the end of this year, but we will see some of that RD in the future become renewable jet.Thank you. That was very detailed, and I think the key is the flexibility part which you expressed. My quick follow-up here is, in your opening comments, you said you are more than a refiner, and yes, you have a very strong Marketing and Specialties business. Can we have some visibility, on the near and medium-term, how that business is looking, both in Europe and in the U.S., if you could elaborate a little bit on the near-term outlook for that business  Thank you.Hey, Manav, it s Brian again. So I ll say we had a really strong quarter in the third quarter. In fact, it was our fourth best quarter on record. Q2 and Q3 are usually stronger seasonally than Q1 and Q4. And as you remember, starting 2019, we ve added a lot of retail to our retail joint ventures in the U.S. We re up to 700 retail stores now, and they performed really well this quarter. We re also focused on what we ve called the last-mile strategy internally, which is getting Rodeo complex RD to the market, directly to the market, and getting that value chain value at Phillips 66. We ve seen product volumes in our businesses relatively flat, but we continue to optimize those volumes through higher-value distribution channels.So as a reminder, we have a wholesale business, we have a branded or franchise business, and then we have a retail business. And the branded or franchise business and the retail business, those margins are significantly higher than the wholesale margins. And then finally, on the lubricants base oil business, it continues to perform really well. So I d say, for Q4, we think that earnings will be in-line with our normal Q4 mid-cycle expectations.Yes. Manav, I would just add over the top that Brian and his team have been just quietly and consistently executing their last-mile strategy and this opportunity to invest a fairly small amount of capital to get very high returns and to enhance our exposure to retail margins in a very accretive way. And it s   you re seeing the value show up, and you re seeing a consistent performance there that we really appreciate.Thank you.Thank you, Manav. Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And appreciate all the updates this morning. Mark, I wonder if I could try the disposal question again. I just want to be clear where you guys are in this process. Have you internally identified the assets for sale  I just wanted to be clear on that. And maybe what your expectations are of time line  I don t think that s been touched on, and I ve got a quick follow-up on Refining.The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is, it really is a function of the market appetite. We understand the value that these assets provide us, and they provide good value. So we ve got to find willing buyers that have a greater affinity for those assets than we do. And so we re not in any rush. We re not performing any fire sale, but we believe there is opportunities out there in the market today to execute that plan.Thank you. My follow-up is on Refining, and I m going to ask for a little forgiveness on this one ahead of time. But I think you know where our position has been on the strength of the Refining sector, the Refining cycle going forward, volatile as it may be. And we ve kind of challenged you guys a few times on what you re assuming as a mid-cycle sustainable EBITDA for your business. So I m curious if you could walk us through   and expedition s always possible, given we re on this call, what the moving parts are behind the contribution of Refining to the new mid-cycle targetsThe capture rate is one part, but you ve been running ahead. When your facility has been running, you ve been running ahead for quite a while now. And similarly, your utilization rates were not great. Now they are better. Is that a big factor  I m just wondering what the key kind of moving parts are in the assumptions and what the contribution is from Refining in your new targets. Thank you.Yes, Doug, let me try and unpack some of that. So our mid-cycle Refining EBITDA, as we laid out at Investor Day, was  4 billion. That reflects a historic average assumption around where the market will trade. And that s   we haven t changed that assumption. What we are doing is increasing our ability to capture value across that system through lower costs and increased contribution from our commercial organization and the EBITDA uplift they provide   that, that organization provides to the system will predominantly show up in Refining. It won t all be Refining, but it ll predominantly show up in Refining.We haven t tried to make a call on if we actually think the go-forward mid-cycle margin environment is stronger now than it has been historically. Clearly, we ve been in above mid-cycle conditions for most of this year and last year. And that s all   we view that as upside, so we re still pretty optimistic for the near-term. We re probably above mid-cycle in the near-term, but our fundamental view of mid-cycle hasn t changed. But our belief in terms of what that business can do in a mid-cycle environment is going up with the enhancements we re putting in place.Kevin, has your utilization assumption changedWell, not really because, if you think back to where we were running for the years prior to the pandemic and then we took a hit during the pandemic, we re really assuming we get back to that kind of level of operations that we were at before. And so some of the things   some of the Refining performance priorities that Rich has talked about in the past that were outlined in Investor Day a year ago, we did not include those in as increases to mid-cycle. We view that as we have to deliver on these to get back to that level of operations that we ve historically been at.Terrific. Thank you very much.Thank you, Doug. Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thanks. Maybe if I could, a question on the shareholder return target. Thanks for the positive update there. I mean, at the midpoint, it implies, I think, roughly  1 billion a year of buyback a quarter to year-end 2024, which is a nice step-up from what we saw during the third quarter, pretty close to the pace that you ve had year-to-date in 2023 in what has been a   obviously is like   certainly an above-mid-cycle environment. So can you maybe talk about your confidence in   what drove your confidence in being able to lean into the shareholder return target in that way, maybe what it implies in your view of the outlook from here  And on the   should we think   you ve been above pace on   your prior mid-cycle target has been above mid-cycle. Should we think of it the same way, where, if we continue to stay above mid-cycle in 2024, that you ll drive towards the upside or beyond and that type of targetYes. Ryan, this is Mark. Glad to answer that question. To answer your last question, the answer is yes. If we re outperforming our   our desire is to hit the high end of that target, and we ve provided the flexibility in the event that there is less cash available because of market conditions, we can pull back a little bit. Another thing I would point out is our  3 billion in asset dispositions, we have not factored that cash into the  13 billion to  15 billion. So there is another level of assurance there that we can hit that. And we really are focusing on the things that we can control. As you look at the business transformation, we see those numbers, we see the reality of those numbers, and we can capture that and use that value to drive those returns. And we also see line of sight to the additional increments of EBITDA, the  4 billion that s coming into play. And of course, that could be impacted by market as well. But when you factor all those things in, the risk of underperforming is fairly muted. So we ve got a high level of confidence that we can deliver.Okay. Perfect. That s very helpful. And then maybe just a question on the Midstream. You ve had a little bit of time now with the consolidated position there, DCP under your belt at this point. Synergies have moved a little bit higher from  300 million to  400 million. Maybe can you talk about how you view the opportunity set there, both in terms of what you re seeing in terms of your ability to drive commercial improvements there and maybe incremental growth down the lineYes, sure. Ryan, this is Tim. So yes, great question. Glad you asked. If anything else, business transformation   and I ll talk about that because business transformation, we started that process. And as we got into it, we just found more. We re doing the same thing with the DCP integration. So as we brought this thing together   and by the way, we won t be complete with the integration. We will get all the IT stuff done by the end of the first quarter. And I think it s important to say that because once that s done in the end of the first quarter, one, we can get some redundancies in people that will move away in supporting two different systems. The other is our commercial team and our ops team will all be reading off the same screens, the single source of data. It will all be one versus trying to look at two different systems and trying to make some decisions there.So we think the real catalyst for optimization is going to happen   or further optimization will happen in that 1Q. But probably worth me giving an example here on the commercial side, so we are really excited about what   this venture and putting it together, really excited about it. And we also think the   as we have gotten into it, as I have mentioned, we really felt like we are finding more and more as we go. And the example I want to give you is one that just came up a couple of weeks ago for us, where commercially, we were able to move barrels. I won t put any names in here, we were able to move barrels off one pipe, put it onto another pipe and allow more volume to go on the pipe we moved off of. And that net impacts an additional  10 million a year for us. So, we could not have done that if we were two separate entities. So, yes, are we believers, yes. And do we think there is more there, yes. And are we encouraged once we get past the first quarter about there being more opportunity, absolutely.Yes. And I would like to throw another example out there, Ryan, that last week, a group of us visited the Sweeny Complex, and we got to stop by the control room that operates all of our fractionators. And I asked a couple of frontline operators how they felt integration was going, and they were ecstatic because they see the ability to improve their ability to perform. They see it in real time. They said we can run at harder rates because we get better information, there is greater collaboration. They can run without concern or surprises coming at them. And so the whole mindset around business transformation, synergy capture, being more competitive has evolved all the way to the front line. These folks want to win, and they want to figure out every day how to do better and how to drive more synergies and capture that and deliver value. So, it s real, and it s out on the front line.Thank you.Thank you, Ryan. Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thank you. Good morning guys.Good morning Paul.Good morning. A couple of questions. Marketing, the business seems like continued to do better than expected in a number of quarters. You have been adding retail stations and everything. So, should we look at that your base and then what s considered mid-cycle have a structural improvement because of your   the way that how you guided maybe changing the way how you run or adding to the asset  And if it is the case, what is the new good baseline that we can assumeYes. Paul, what I think you are asking is you are applauding the good performance you have seen in the marketing group, and it continues to increase, as Brian and his team execute their strategy. And you are asking, is there a reset in the mid-cycle performance of the marketing business, is that the questionThat s correct. Because I mean I think historically, that it s sort of like mid-cycle is  400 million a quarter. But you certainly have done much better than that in the past 2 years. I think that one quarter, you can say, maybe it s one risk, but it seems like it s pretty consistent that you guys have been performing better. I was just curious that, is it structurally that the business is stronger today as you add more retail station and everything, or that this is truly that you think is just the market condition is much better than averagePaul, this is Brian. I would say we did raise the mid-cycle a couple of years ago, and we will continue to watch it. And if we need to raise it again, we will. But obviously, the business is performing better and we are proud of the business performing better. We are going to continue to look for opportunities to add to the last-mile strategy and some of our other initiatives. So, as we see that value hitting the bottom line, we will indeed, at some point raise the mid-cycle.So, Brian, that you don t feel comfortable that we have seen enough of the improvement, saying that the mid-cycle is that, indeed, that is now even better than what you had in mind, say, a couple of years agoI would say keep watching the bottom line, and you will see the dollars there. And when we feel comfortable, we will move mid-cycle up.Yes, Brian never lacks confidence.Okay, fair enough. And maybe this one is for Rich. Rich, can you share with us that   what s the Phillips 66 turnaround activity look like for next year  Is it comparing to this year, whether it s going to be higher, lower or about the same  And also, what s your view about the industry turnaround activity for next year  Thank you.Yes, Paul, appreciate the question. We generally give that guidance out fourth quarter, and so stand by for that outlook on the fourth quarter.Thank you, Paul. John Royall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is on the net debt target. You had guided to hitting the top end of your range on leverage by year-end. It was a pretty modest tailwind from working capital in 3Q, and Kevin mentioned you will catch it up and get most of that 1H build back in 4Q. Do you need any help from price to hit that working capital number, or could price conversely be a headwind that prevents you from getting it all back  And then does the worsening environment that we have seen here in 4Q in refining potentially impact your ability to hit that targetYes. I mean, John, the market environment will impact profitability. It will impact cash generation. But the bulk of the working capital benefit we expect to see in the fourth quarter will be driven by inventory impacts, and that s pretty solid in terms of that impact. So, while there will always be other parts moving around in this equation, I feel pretty confident that the top end of that targeted range is   we will be around about there at the end of the year. I am not too concerned by that.Okay. Great. Thank you. And then I was just hoping for your latest views on WCS differentials. You should get some tailwinds from the widening we have seen here in 4Q. But where do you think the differential goes from here, particularly as we get close to the start-up of TMX, although there is some debate over the timing there  But just any thoughts on WCS as we head into next year would be helpful.Hey John, it s Brian. So, like you said, the WCS dips are very wide, minus  25 now. That s a benefit to us. We are the largest importer of Canadian crude, nearly 500,000 barrels a day. The reason the dips are wide is because you have more production than you have pipeline egress. And you also have the diluent blended into   starting in September, into the crude, which adds or swells volume. We would expect to see the dips remain seasonally wide with more barrels than egress as traders also sell barrels to meet the year-end inventories. TMX has announced the start-up in April. We will take them at their word. Currently, we don t think the pipeline will run at full capacity. But if you take a look at the forward curves currently, Q2, Q3 average is about minus  15, and that s about where we think it might end up.Thank you.Thank you, John. Jason Gabelman from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on refining capture, and we have seen co-product headwinds continue now for a second quarter. Last quarter was a pretty high headwind, and then this quarter was even higher. And the oil price moving up obviously impacts the co-product headwind, but was wondering what else is going on in that bucket  If you could give us some visibility into that and if you think any of that is structural in nature.Jason, this is Rich. Are you asking about the co-product bucketYes.Secondary products.Secondary products, yes. Yes, so the primary   in refining, that primary mover there is petroleum coke, right. That s the product that generally drives that secondary product margin for us. And it generally lags behind crude pricing, right, and it s tied to the coal markets that can pressure it up or pressure it down based on supply and demand requirements there. The other subtle component that plays into secondary products for us is NGL pricing. And that s bigger in some markets than others for us, but it certainly does play into it, and that s been depressed for some period now. And that s   our outlook continues to not be real strong on NGL pricing on the forward curves. The balance of the secondary products, which are fuel oil intermediates and some other products that probably aren t worth mentioning, those have been relatively flat, really, over the period. So, we don t see   so, we see those coke and NGLs as the primary movers right now for us in that area.Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up is on the  3 billion divestment target and not really where that s going to come from, but use of proceeds. You mentioned in the earnings press release that those proceeds will be deployed to strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. But I was wondering if there is a desire to use some of that cash to continue to grow and just, kind of in broad strokes, what type of growth you would prioritize  Thanks.Yes. Thanks Jason. The cash that we might receive from those asset dispositions will be allocated consistent with our premise capital allocation process. It always includes a growth element. And if there are things that we can accelerate in our growth agenda, we can look at that. But certainly, also would be a factor is opportunities around our balance sheet and then opportunities to hit the high end of our cash return to shareholders target. So, it s all in play, just like any dollar of cash that we would turn over to treasury.Got it. Thanks for the color.You bet.Thank you, Jason. Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the chem side. Could you talk about some of the dynamics in PE  Inventories have cleaned up a little bit here, but what s your margin outlook for both the U.S. and international heading into Q4  Could you give a comment on  Technical DifficultyHi Matthew, unfortunately, your line is breaking up, so we will have to move to the next question. If you would like to rejoin the queue and potentially try dialing back in.Yes. We heard the first part, so Tim is going to take a shot at the first part around PE margins and inventories.Yes, let me do that. Sorry, Matt, with the breakout there. I got the front end of it. And so I could take a wild guess on the back end, but that probably wouldn t go well. So, from a chem standpoint, look, it feels like a little bit of a broken record. We still have a supply-demand imbalance. Clearly, China, Asia is not where we would like it to be. Over time, we expect that to come back around. But you are going to have to see a correction in the new capacity that s coming onboard, coupled with demand picking up. So, we do think that s going to be hard to see at least through 2024. But to your point, I mean when you have things like we have seen a little bit of improvement on polyethylene, you see a couple of price increases, which have been good. I don t know if they are sustainable, but nonetheless, they have come through, which has helped. And we have seen inventories coming off slowly, but coming off. So, from that standpoint, there is a little bit of, I am going to say, constructive, but we know that balance has got to get fixed. Now, the one thing that I think is really important we stress here is, though, that CPChem s kit and their assets, 96  of their assets are utilizing advantaged feedstocks. So, while there may be a lot of pain in the chemical space, those that are leveraging advantaged feedstocks are doing okay. We would love to be doing a lot better, but they are doing okay. Our assets at CPChem are running hard as well as probably their competition using light feed in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East. But those that are using naphtha in higher-cost regions are probably challenged at this point. Our teams are running hard, running well, taking advantage and are well positioned to actually benefit from this low-margin environment because of the feedstock we are in. So with that, we still think, though there is some more lifting to do with regard to getting the supply-demand balance where it needs to be, but if we can continue to see some green shoots like the GDP that we saw earlier this week, maybe you put a couple of those together, and we can start moving that forward.Thank you. Joe Laetsch from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to just start on the demand side. So, recognizing the DOE demand data has been really volatile, could you just share what you are seeing in your system across gasoline, diesel and jet  And then if possible, just your outlook for the remainder of the year, realizing that it s really volatile right now. Thank you.Hey Joe, this is Brian. Let me take a stab at that. In the U.S., inventories remain low for distillate, 17  under 5-year averages. Gasoline has come back up now close to 5-year averages. So, maybe starting on the distillate side, cracks are now in the mid to high  20 range when adjusted in U.S. Gulf Coast, New York and Europe. To be reminded, European refiners need distillate cracks at higher levels because of the higher net gas price to incentivize production. We are seeing distillate demand globally at about 2  higher than last year. In the U.S., we will start   we see demand a little bit off, although we have been watching the manufacturing sector, and we think it s probably bottomed. Truck tonnage index has begun to rebound as an example. So, for   on our outlook for diesel, we would say it s supported from here with the low inventories and potential shortages in Europe. And as a reminder, this is Europe s first year without Russian distillate supply, so we will have to watch that as well. And on the gas cracks, gas has been coming along for a ride as refiners have produced   continue to produce diesel with the strong diesel margins. We have also had butane blending startup, which has increased the volume of gasoline. And the summer has kind of been devoid of any hurricane issues. What we have seen is, especially on the Gulf Coast, we started to see plants cutting FCC units. So, we think that will be a help to clearing up the gasoline. On the demand side, we are seeing global gasoline 2  year-over-year and particularly strong, Asia and Middle East, Europe, about flat. U.S. demand seems to be about flat, too. Latin America has been really strong, about 5  over last year. So, on our outlook for gasoline, we would say demand relatively flat through the end of the year as the markets work to clean up some of the gasoline supply.Got it. Thanks. Appreciate your response on that. And I just wanted to ask, on the dividend, so we have   it was good to see the increase in the target. We have touched on the buyback a bit. But could you just remind us how you are thinking on dividend growth from hereYes. Our position there is consistent, secure growing dividends. We have grown the dividend every year since spin, and that s not going to change.Great. Thanks. Appreciate it today.You bet.Thank you, Joe. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mark Lashier for closing comments.Thank you and thanks to all of you for your questions. Our integrated and diversified portfolio continues to perform extremely well and it creates unique competitive advantage. Our strong performance and confidence in execution drives us to increase several of the original commitments in our pursuit to achieve superior returns for our shareholders. We will return  13 billion to  15 billion to shareholders by year-end 2024. We will reduce refining operating costs by  1 per barrel. We will capture over  400 million in Midstream synergies, and we will deliver  1.4 billion of cash savings by year-end 2024. We will monetize over  3 billion of non-core assets and we will enhance our commercial capabilities generating additional earnings. Our plans are ambitious. We are raising the bar and continuing to reward shareholders now and well into the future.Thanks Mark. If you have any additional questions, please call Owen or me. We appreciate your participation on the call today. Thank you.",1,2023-10-27T16:35:27.000-04:00
MBB: Better Ways To Buy MBS,"The era from 2008 to 2020 saw the lowest interest rates in history and many asset allocators were chasing for yield but also taking excessive risks in the process. Myself and many others often callWith many long-duration bond funds which were previously perceived as low-risk, such as down 50  from their highs, there's a large opportunity for yield investors to purchase long-duration fixed-income assets with a significant real rate of return.A market where investors can get a high single-digit return with no risk is the MBS market.Most investors are familiar with the basics of what MBS are, but for those who aren't, I'll give a quick high-levelMortgage-backed securities were created by the The idea was that banks could package up and sell mortgages at a slight premium to what they underwrote them at to get capital to make more loans. Then investors in the secondary market would have a way in which to participate in what was long thought of as a low-risk asset class.The classic MBS is pass-through in that it completely passes through all principal and interest payments.CMOs are another type of MBS which is categorised according to different maturities and credit ratings, which are referred to as tranches.Most retail investors will focus on pass-through MBS.Due to the subprime mortgage crisis, many investors who don't have a full understanding of this market have been concerned about investing in it. What many of these investors don't know is that there are two primary MBSs  agency-backed MBS and private-label MBS.Private-label MBS are mortgages that are non-conforming, meaning they don't adhere to the government guidelines and because of that have no government backing  examples are jumbo loans or commercial mortgages.With agency-backed MBS there are two types  Fannie Mae   Freddie Mac which are now private sector firms but are government-sponsored enterprises  and Ginnie Mae which is wholly owned by the US government, hence any agency MBS from Ginnie Mae is completely risk-free.When most refer to MBS they are referring to Ginnie Mae Agency MBS and that is what we will be referring to in this article. Since it is risk-free if held to maturity, its yield is equal to that of a US Treasury plus a call premium as mortgages can be refinanced when rates go lower.Since mortgages can be refinanced, they have a built-in call option, giving them a treasury bond premium.Below is a chart that shows mortgage rates relative to the US 10-year noteThe areas highlighted in grey are when the spread between the two is over 200 basis points.The above chart goes till Q1 2023. Since Q1 2023 the spread between mortgage rates and treasuries has widened. At the time of writing, the , and in many locales, the 30-year fixed rate on an FHA loan has gone above 8 . Compare this to the current 10-year treasury at 4.79 . This has brought the spread to 3 .A spread of 3  is very wide, and it's essentially the market's way of saying that many market participants are paying a large premium to make a bet on lower rates. This is why, as rates have gone higher, the call premium has gotten larger.Another key thing to remember is that the yield curve is inverted on the front end and has a slight steepening from the 10-year to the 30-year. If the yield curve normalizes by steepening across the whole curve, then both the 10-year and 30-year would be above the Fed Funds Rate, which is at 5.5 . In that situation, we could potentially see both the 10-year and 30-year above 6.5 . And if we add the current call premium on it, then mortgage rates could be at 9.5 .In my opinion, the call premium is very overpriced.There are really only two ways I see the tail risk on rates playing out.1. Growth is more robust than expected, unemployment continues to stay low, and inflation stays elevated. In this case, we could see the right tail risk of rates going a lot higher than expected.2. We see a collapse in growth leading to higher unemployment and the Fed reacting by going back to a zero interest rate policy.Of course, there is a more probable in-between scenario too.The main reason such a large call premium exists is because many in the market believe that rates will go lower so those with mortgages will refinance at lower rates, hence MBS will get their principal back early with no upside.The issue with this view is that it presumes that housing prices will stay the same. For example, if you bought a home worth  1mm with an 80  LTV mortgage of  800k at a high interest rate and later on rates went down, you could look for refinance, but the appraisal could come back and say that your home is only worth  500k then, so a new 80  LTV mortgage with a lower rate would only be  400k. In this case, even if you wanted to refinance, you wouldn't be able to unless you had 400k of cash to put in.Scenario number two, which involves the left tail risk on rates playing out, would also likely result in far lower housing prices due to a severe recession.About two weeks back, I wrote an . The gist of the article was that the current housing market is being driven by low volume, so the pricing isn't accurate. The low volume is because buyers are weary of buying due to high prices or can't they simply afford it, and sellers don't want to sell as they've locked in low rates. This means that there is little volume in the residential housing market, making for what has been a frozen market.An argument I made in the XHB article was that if rates come down, we would see housing prices come down. This is because homeowners who are locked in a low rate don't want to sell thus letting go of a low-rate mortgage, but if rates went down then they would sell, hence bringing more housing inventory.This is why I believe if rates go lower so do housing prices, and that means homeowners won't refinance into a lower rate as they have negative equity on their homes. For this reason, I find the call premium on MBS to be overpriced.There are a few issues I have with  . The first is that not all of the MBS that the fund holds is Ginnie Mae Agency MBS, which as we discussed earlier is the only true risk-free MBS.The second and biggest reason why I don't like MBB is that its weighted average maturity is 8.38 years. This means that the average mortgage that MBB has exposure to will mature in 8.38 years.Shorter duration mortgages are those that have been issued many years back when rates were lower, so those mortgages have very little call premium. The mortgages with the most call premium are the newest issuances at the highest rates. For the reasons that I mentioned previously, I would prefer those new mortgages, since I think the risk of those mortgagors refinancing is low relative to older mortgagors who have a lot more equity in their homes and a lower cost basis.This is why I think it's best for investors to directly purchase new issuances of pass-through MBS.

30-Year Fixed Mortgage Tops 8%: Interest Rate Landslide Continues,"The  continued this week, with both the 10-year Treasury and the 30-year fixed mortgage hitting fresh post-2008 highs. 30-year fixed-rate , with jumbo mortgages clocking in at 8.06 . On a  500,000 mortgage, buyer paymentsThe iShares Home Construction ETF  had a huge rally in 2023 that didn't make much sense, and it now seems like it's being rapidly unwound. Key to why this might have been  Hundreds of thousands of new U.S. homes . The National Association of Realtors' tagline was that buyers should ,  buying property at an uncomfortable monthly payment but looking to refinance down the road. However, interest rates just keep going up, meaning that not only can buyers not refinance, but if they want to sell and get out, it's increasingly difficult to qualify new buyers. Now these teaser rates are starting to expire, and home buyers are finding themselves in a shotgun wedding after thinking they'd just date their mortgage for a year.Likely yes. I've repeatedly argued that homebuilders are value traps despite trading for low P E ratios. Lennar  trades for 8.1x earnings, PulteGroup  trades for 6.3x, Toll Brothers  trades for 6.1x, and D.R. Horton  trades for 7.9x earnings. There are a lot of cyclical stocks out there trading for 5-10x earnings. Airlines, automakers, and homebuilders are prime examples. If they can consistently make the earnings they've made in 2021 and 2022, then they're a mathematical slam dunk as value investments. But if the business cycle still exists, which it does - then these profits will likely turn into losses at some point.Currently, there are about 1.67 million units of housing under construction in the U.S. But the working-age population . So with mortgages at 8  and the working-age population declining, who's going to live in these 1.67 million housing units  Every new working adult looking to buy a house should be matched by an older person passing away or looking to downsize from this point forward, that's just how the demographic shift works. And the COVID real-estate panic pulled forward years of housing demand, so many of the buyers who would be buying now already bought.Is there really a demographically-driven housing shortage  Or is today's market the consequence of years of speculative excess  We know for a fact  has grown faster than the working-age population and is at levels higher than in 2008. There's no demographic shortage, only a shortage driven by speculation with low-interest-rate mortgages.I'm doubling down on my housing call here. Without interest rates suddenly dropping back to pandemic levels, homebuilders are likely to get stuck with a ton of inventory they can't sell. And it's hard for interest rates to go down with massive budget deficits  the loanable funds market. It's the classic economics debate over  reimagined. I wouldn't necessarily recommend making short bets on homebuilder stocks, but the writing is clearly on the wall to sell here after an irrational run in 2023.At a  100,000 level of income, no existing debt, and a 36  DTI, buyers  to buy a house worth  721,000 at a 3  rate of interest. At 4 , this drops to  649,000. At 5 , it's  587,000. At 6 , it's  533,000. At 7 , it's  486,000. Now at 8 , it's  445,000. Take mortgages to 9 , and purchasing power falls further, to  410,000. That's good for a roughly 43  drop in buyer purchasing power on the interest rate change alone. This is based on what buyers can qualify for. I've made this point before but I'm making it again here just because it's so mind-blowing. Sure, mortgages were higher in the 1980s and 1990s. But home prices compared with salaries were quite low, such that overall debt-to-income ratios for new homebuyers were far better overall than now. Additionally, the working-age population was booming and  in the U.S. at that time.One of the most overlooked pieces of the post-war housing market was that roughly 1 5 of the total U.S. population moved from rural areas to cities between 1960 and 2000. Additionally, the overall population was growing quite rapidly, creating a need to continuously build millions of houses in cities. That's not the current situation at all. With some limited exceptions, you generally can't buy property now anywhere in the U.S. and count on demographics to make it more valuable. With a rapidly aging population, there will be no  to sell to unless prices come down.Housing is thought to be a fairly sentiment-driven market and it is. But what's interesting about this huge interest rate landslide is that it shrinks the buyer pool geometrically with each 1  interest rate increase. If the banks won't qualify the buyers for the loan, they can't buy. That means that the real estate agent and loan officers aren't getting a commission, the title company isn't getting its money, people aren't dropping  40,000 on new furniture to furnish the house, and people aren't buying a second or third car to put in the garage. Because so many people are employed directly or indirectly by the housing industry, housing sales are a very  for the rest of the economy.Here we see that  have dropped below even the levels of 2008. 2008 had more to do with unemployment and today's market has to do with skyrocketing interest rates, but new mortgage applications rapidly dropping is something worth noting. Note that this is an index, not a tally of mortgages originated.Is this because people are rich and they're suddenly paying cash for everything  The answer is no, and this is easily cross-verified by looking at existing home sales as well as the mix between cash and financed buyers.  about 25  of the market, this number goes up a little when rates are higher and down a little when rates are lower. Some wacky data from Redfin  notwithstanding, cash buyers represent about 27-28  of the current market, and are largely divorcées and older homebuyers looking to downsize. When investors pay  cash,  it generally just means they're getting their financing from somewhere else than a bank mortgage.Here we see  have dropped from a bit over 6 million to an expected number of under 4 million for this month's release. There are only really three sustained downturns here in existing home salesNote that prices lead sales. We can say that there have been three major down cycles in U.S. real estate over the past 50 years, and we're in our third one. If you line up the housing under construction graph from above with the existing home sales graph here, you can see that they turn at the same points.If you own a home with a cheap mortgage, the rational thing to do is to hold on to it. Anywhere you move is likely to create a higher mortgage payment for you now, even if you downsize. Also, note that moving from one house to another doesn't actually create any housing supply since you're moving from one house to another  1-1 0 . People staying put won't stop prices from falling, it will only delay it.What's also interesting here is the lack of elasticity with many home buyers. If you'd told me in advance that interest rates would go from 3  to 8 , my guess would have been that home sales would be down 50  or more, not a third like they are. The housing market isn't completely frozen - people are still moving. Unfortunately for them, today's interest rates are making them quite house-poor compared with their older neighbors with 3  mortgages and low-cost basis. The fundamentals of what buyers are able to pay have changed in the housing market, which necessitates a fairly large, steady drop in home prices. To get back to equilibrium, either buyer incomes have to skyrocket  not happening , interest rates have to fall back to COVID levels, or prices have to fall. Prices falling is the most likely outcome by far. The debt-to-income data also shows that millions of people are putting themselves in an  by getting mortgages with higher and higher DTI ratios.It seems to me that of the 6 million people who would ordinarily buy a house in a year, a little over 1 3 of them are running the numbers and deciding not to put themselves through the wringer. Many of the other 2 3rds might be doing what they're expected to do socially with no consideration for price and value. This mentality led to disastrous consequences in 2007 and 2008. There's no need to force anything as the same forces that are making buying a house exponentially more expensive are making it cheaper to rent, or simply travel the world with the strong dollar. As the old adage goes, don't fight the Fed, and perhaps don't try to compete for loanable funds with a Congress that needs to borrow trillions of dollars per year.Mortgages just topped 8 , mirroring a trend in the broader economy where financing is becoming much harder to get. If you don't think this will affect the housing market, think again. Other casualties of rapidly-rising interest rates may include money-losing junk-rated companies, regional banks, and automakers. Will mortgage rates hit 9  What would the consequences be  Share your thoughts in the comment section below.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Operator Instructions  Today s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. After our speakers  remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group s Vice President of Finance, Planning and Investor Relations, Ryan St. John.Thank you, operator and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release along with several accompanying slides detailing our results, which are available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today s call, you will hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q A portion of the call.This morning, Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of  139 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted netThanks, Ryan and good morning, everyone. Before getting to our results, I d like to start by acknowledging the human aspect of the work we do. This past quarter, close to home, we saw wildfires bring devastation to the West Maui community. More recently, we have been horrified by the terrorist attacks in Israel and we mourn the innocent lives lost. I want to acknowledge that people are hurting and while we share in the privilege of connecting families and communities, we also share in the pain of seeing those around the world suffer.Now turning to our results. Our third quarter performance continues to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model and our commitment to drive consistent, measured progress against our goals. During the quarter, we ran the best operation in the country, delivering a 99.7  completion rate and on-time rate of over 80 . On September 30th, we retired our last Airbus aircraft from service, marking our official return to single fleet. We drove unit costs down nearly 5  year-over-year, a strong performance that stands alone versus our peers in achieving year-over-year unit cost reductions. And our 11.4  adjusted pre-tax margin nearly led the industry despite our lower direct exposure to record international demand as well as significant fuel cost headwinds given our geographic exposure to the West Coast.Now moving to where we are today. Having been in this industry a long time, I know as well as anyone how volatile it can be and we are seeing this now. Crude oil has risen 12  from last quarter, while L.A. refining margins have increased 70  overall and 60  over Gulf Coast levels disproportionately increasing our economic fuel cost compared to peers, given the majority of our purchasing happens on the West Coast. While we expect this divergence to be temporary, it is nonetheless a near-term headwind. Absent this  50 million cost in Q3, we would have led the industry in adjusted pre-tax margin. Demand remains strong in peak periods, but shoulder periods are becoming more susceptible to lower demand without a full return of corporate travel.Despite these near-term headwinds that will likely make the next quarters more challenging, I continue to believe we have a strong fundamental long-term setup for several reasons. One, our teams continue to deliver reliability. We now have two solid quarters in a row of industry-leading performance, and I can confidently say we have our operational muscle back. I want to thank all our employees for their hard work and effort. They have done an amazing job prioritizing and delivering a safe and reliable operation for our guests. Our completion rate not only led the industry, but set 20-year company records in all 3 months of the quarter during peak summer flying continuing to surpass our planning expectations. Two, our relative cost advantage comes from decades of discipline and became a highlight in the third quarter. With visibility to another quarter of unit cost improvement year-over-year, we expect full year CASMex to be down 1  to 2 , likely the only carrier to achieve unit cost reductions for the year. Having retired our last Airbus aircraft in September, we brought our dual fleet chapter to a close and are poised to fully recognize the power of single fleet efficiencies as we move into 2024.Three, we have the most diversified revenue of domestic-focused airlines, generating 45  of our revenue outside the main cabin. Our investments in fleet and premium seating have given us a domestic product that rivals any in the industry, including first in premium class lounges and global partnerships that will continue to serve us well going forward. And four, our growth is rational and disciplined. Having closed out a strong summer operation, our teams are turning their focus to winter preparedness and continuing to deliver strong operational performance for our guests throughout the holidays. Capacity discipline is the most relevant lever our industry has and will be necessary to support off-peak periods going forward. We are focused on optimizing our flying and moderating growth as a prudent measure to deliver results. For 2024, we are actively discussing where within our long-term 4  to 8  target growth range as most optimal given the higher fuel environment.To close, we produced solid third quarter results. Without our refining margin headwind, we would have had the best results in the industry. Our product set competes with the best and as the international versus domestic demand mix and business travel ultimately normalize over time, we have the right business model to deliver strong results and outperform well into the future. Now more than ever, we are focused on extracting efficiencies from both sides of the profitability equation with all the elements in place to drive strong relative results within our evolving industry.And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.Thanks, Ben and good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on third quarter results, recent trends and our outlook for the rest of the year. Third quarter revenues reached  2.8 billion, up 0.4  year-over-year on 13.7  more capacity, which was approximately 1 point below our revenue guidance midpoint. Unit revenues were down 11.7  versus 2022 and up 12.2  versus 2019.We had three sources of headwinds impacting third quarter revenue performance. First, the strong close-in revenue performance we saw from April through most of August moderated as we moved into September. Close-in demand for leisure looks to have normalized and without further return of business demand, shoulder periods are more challenged than they have been in the past couple of years. Second, we planned our network for relatively strong demand from summer into September as we experienced last year. However, that did not fully materialize. This led to modest load factor weaknesses in areas of our network where we deployed more capacity than we normally would during the shoulder. Third, the devastating Maui wildfires impacted third quarter revenue and therefore, profit by approximately  20 million. For reference, Hawaii represents nearly 12  of our capacity, with one-third of that deployed to Maui. Following the wildfires in early August, bookings turned negative with high rates of cancellation. This reversed at the end of August as bookings to Maui began recovering. However, September bookings were still down 45  versus last year.As we move into the fourth quarter, we are seeing continuing recovery in Maui. However, we expect revenues to be negatively impacted by approximately  18 million and anticipate it will be several quarters before demand returns to normalized levels. Having cut a full frequency from Seattle and trimmed capacity from other hubs, we will continue capacity adjustments to match supply with demand while serving the people of Maui during the recovery process.Lastly, although not a part of our baseline, we saw no upside benefit from corporate travel as revenue continues to hold at about 85  of 2019 levels. Having covered our headwinds though, there were several positive results in the quarter as well. With respect to product, our premium cabins continue to materially outperform the main cabin with first and premium class revenues up 10  and 6  year-over-year respectively. Alaska is the only primarily domestic carrier to have both first class and premium economy across 100  of our mainline and regional fleets. These premium seats represent 25  of our total seats and continue to be an area of opportunity for us in sustaining higher yields and other domestic focus competitors, especially as travel preferences continue to move in a more premium direction.Total premium paid load factor was up 3 points year-over-year, but has increased over 10 points on 12  more seats versus 2019. Today, premium revenue represents 31  of our total revenue, contributing to the 45  of total revenue we generate outside the main cabin. Putting aside premium for a moment, we have also seen success with more guests buying out from saver into our main cabin product. This buy up has occurred at 22  higher fares versus last year. Loyalty remains a strong driver of revenue performance as well. Bank cash remuneration was up 11  versus the third quarter of 2022, outpacing system revenue that was only up 0.4 point. We continue to make solid progress on our strategy of being able to directly sell our oneworld and other partners on alaskaair.com. We launched 13 partners this year, bringing our total to 18 partners with over 500 destinations worldwide now being sold direct on our website. These efforts will continue as we enable selling all cabins on our partners and continue to upgrade the digital guest experience on our website and within our native app.This is another area where we are clearly differentiated from other domestic focused carriers. We are the only primarily domestic carrier that offers access to a portfolio of global partners where we offer elite status recognition, accrual and redemption and airport lounge access. This capability, along with our premium cabin offerings, gives me confidence that we will have built the right commercial offerings to meet our guests  preferences and drive long-term value to Air Group. As we shared on our last call, we have continued to see our guests take advantage of our global partner network with total accrual and redemptions on our long-haul partners, up 26  for the third quarter versus last year.Taking a step back, as illustrated in the supporting slides we published today, when comparing our unit revenue performance versus a 2019 baseline, it s clear that the differentiation of our products including our premium offering and international connectivity is a very positive story, which has resulted in unit revenues, up 12  on capacity growth of 6 . This is a testament to the soundness of our business model and the success of changes we have made since 2019.Now turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be up 1  to 4  on capacity that is up 11  to 14  year-over-year. In terms of bookings, holidays are in line with our expectations with load factors up a couple of points and yield up double-digits versus 2019. As I mentioned, non-peak shoulders are weaker than 2022 s historic demand levels in part driven by a return to more normal seasonality and a continued, but we believe temporary demand shift towards international travel. Today, we have approximately 58  of November and 35  of December revenue booked.Given our fourth quarter outlook and current demand backdrop, we are narrowing our full year revenue guide to up 7  to 8 . Our guide implies that our unit revenue trajectory is improving sequentially in the fourth quarter versus 2022, up 3 points. And we believe the gap to legacy unit revenue performance is also closing sequentially. Our most significant step-up in capacity occurred during the third quarter as we work to restore our pre-pandemic network. However, in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2024, our growth follows more in line with normal seasonal patterns. After growing 6  above 2019 levels in Q3, our growth moderates to less than 3  above 2019 levels from the fourth quarter through February of 2024, which we believe should better support supply and demand dynamics in our market versus the industry.Looking ahead, we remain confident in our commercial plan and cognizant of our environment. Our team has taken a hard look at our first quarter network amidst high fuel prices as part of our commitment to improving Q1 profitability. We are focused on managing capacity prudently, including capitalizing on leisure destinations, including 15 new routes such as Seattle and Los Angeles to Nassau, which will bring in new revenue while also constraining our total capacity growth to low levels, and reducing business heavy routes and frequencies. For example, we have trimmed our higher frequency Pacific Northwest and California business seats 22  versus January and February of last year.To wrap up, we have a solid commercial plan that is producing results. Our combination of premium products, valuable loyalty program and global offerings through our partnerships in oneworld allows us to provide guests with what they want while producing strong financial results. And we are looking forward to building on that moving forward.And with that, I ll pass it over to Shane.Thanks, Andrew and good morning, everyone. As we discussed on previous calls, for the past year, we have prioritized returning Alaska to operational excellence. This is what our guests deserve and it allows us to have more predictability across the company, which we can ultimately leverage to improve efficiency and cost performance. It was encouraging to see during the quarter that as we have delivered the industry s most reliable operation, our teams have begun to turn the corner on our cost profile as well. And while we acknowledge a more challenged near-term setup with temporary, but elevated West Coast jet fuel refining margin costs and a more typical demand profile in shoulder periods, we remain confident our business has the right configuration to deliver financial performance over the long-term.For the third quarter, adjusted EPS was  1.83 and we delivered an adjusted pre-tax margin of 11.4 . Unit costs were down 4.9  and economic fuel cost per gallon was  3.26, which was materially impacted by refining margins on the West Coast that averaged  0.30 higher than the rest of the country, which we believe will prove to be an anomaly, but materially impacted our performance relative to others. Absent this refining margin differential or the  20 million of lost profit due to the tragedy in Maui, Alaska would have led the industry in margin despite not enjoying the current surge in international demand or a further rebound of corporate traffic.Our balance sheet and liquidity, long-time pillars of strength for us through many cycles, remain stable and healthy. We generated approximately  270 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter while total liquidity inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit stood at a healthy  3 billion. Debt payments for the quarter were approximately  93 million and are expected to be  45 million in the fourth quarter. Our debt to cap remains at 48 , unchanged from last quarter, while net debt to EBITDAR finished the quarter at 1.1x, both within our target range. We have also revised our full year CapEx expectation to  1.7 billion for 2023 and fully expect 2024 to be below this amount as we are currently reshaping our near-term delivery stream with Boeing to accommodate a more conservative 2024 capacity plan. Our share repurchase program has, as intended, offset dilution year-to-date, with spend reaching  70 million, while our trailing 12-month return on invested capital ended at 10.7  this quarter.Moving to costs. The third quarter marked a turning point for us in terms of our performance. CASMex ended down 4.9  year-over-year, coming in below our guided range of down 1  to 2 . This result includes the impact of a larger than initially anticipated market rate adjustment for our pilots, which added approximately  20 million to the third quarter and will annualize at  90 million.Speaking of labor deals during the quarter, we also reached a tentative agreement with our aircraft technicians and we are in the process and looking forward to reaching the deal with our flight attendants. Our unit cost performance was the result of nearly every department of the company coming in on or below their plan, which has been no easy feat to do over the past 3 years as we have re-ramped our operation. We saw productivity improve 2  year-over-year and we will continue to work toward returning to 2019 levels. Other areas, we saw good performance relative to our plan included maintenance aircraft ownership and selling expenses. ASMs were slightly ahead of guidance on the continued outperformance in our completion rate, providing a small additional benefit to unit costs.And lastly, we have lowered our anticipated performance-based pay accruals given the tougher setup in Q4, which also benefited CASMex fuel this quarter. However, absent both of these last two impacts, unit costs would have still closed below our guide. As Ben mentioned, we crossed a significant milestone to end the third quarter as we retired our last Airbus from service. And in wrapping up our Airbus era, we announced this morning that we reached an agreement to sell the 10 A321s to our partner, American Airlines and expect deliveries to occur over the next two quarters.Lastly, as I mentioned, fuel became a significant headwind during the third quarter. L.A. refining margins diverged materially from Gulf Coast levels moving from less than  0.08 difference on average for the first half of the year to  0.30 during the third quarter and at times exceeding  0.90. While we have every expectation this divergence is temporary, it has created a material headwind to our near-term profitability. Our economic fuel costs increased from the midpoint of our original guide, adding approximately  110 million of total cost to the quarter with  50 million coming from refining margin disparity or an approximately 2 point margin headwind for the quarter.For the fourth quarter, we expect fuel price per gallon to be between  3.30 and  3.40 per gallon, which is an approximate 4-point impact to margin compared to our expectations back in July. Fuel, combined with pricing moderation, have led us to revise our full year adjusted pretax margin to 7  to 8 , approximately 3 points lower than the midpoint of our prior guide. We expect CASMex to be down 3  to 5  year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and our full year CASMex to now be down 1  to 2  on capacity, up 12  to 13 .To close, we have run an excellent operation for several quarters. Our pretax margin exceeded peers with greater international tailwinds despite a refining margin disadvantage and sizable impacts from the Maui wildfires. We delivered a strong unit cost result for the quarter and have visibility to another strong result next quarter. We remain focused on and very intentional about setting targets and ensuring we take the right steps to deliver against them. Our commercial offering with premium cabins and global access through our alliances is configured to compete in a way other domestically focused carriers cannot. Our operational strength has returned and our cost management is outperforming the industry, all of which are fundamental drivers of sustained long-term success.And with that, let s go to your questions.Operator Instructions  And our first question today comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.Hey, thanks. Good morning. So you gave an update, I think, a week or so into September. Can you just talk about what shifted over the latter part of the month  How that played out relative to kind of what you thought what, September 9Hi, Duane, it s Andrew. Yes, I think there was like at the beginning of September, I think we had reiterated our guide. I think two things. We were still getting our hands around Hawaii, which was deeply negative bookings, and we re trying to get clarity about where that was going to end up. And I think the other part was there was also right around that time with sort of that transition coming off the back end of a peak summer demand and also close in moving into the more traditional business season. And I think those couple of things combined. I think on  2.8 billion, it was probably like  15 million we re off. So that s the main reason. But fundamentally, the business was where we thought we were going to be.Okay. And then just segue to Hawaii. Can you maybe play back some history and talk about the current picture and maybe delineate between Maui and non-Maui bookings, that would be very helpful.Yes. I think like Maui obviously stands out significantly different, and we re making some of the capacity adjustments there. We did see during this horrible period of time, some bookings continue to move to other islands. But, as you know, Hawaii books well in advance. So essentially, pretty much the rest of the year Maui, we were sort of reset, but as we go into next year, we don t see any reason that Maui won t continue to recover, and we won t see traditional good solid demand to our Hawaii franchise.Okay. Sorry to be deliberate there. Hawaii bookings ex Maui, would you characterize that as stable normalThey re a little softer than historical, but we ve seen that for some time. I think just as   just the capacity into the islands and, of course, some of the pricing presses in Hawaii, the cost of going to Hawaii. But overall, we feel pretty good about it being somewhat stable.Thank you very much.And our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James.Hey, good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the revenue trend where you are seeing kind of a better improvement of some of the   your peers that have reported. And you talked about some of the components like how your capacity is developing, but I was curious if you can kind of provide a little bit more color on the contributors of that sequential improvement and how we should think about it then as you go into the first quarter and you make more adjustments as wellYes, thanks, Savi, it s very interesting. I think what s really positive and some of the sequential improvement is you just look at our capacity in the third quarter and how much higher it was versus  19 versus the fourth quarter. And then some of the   as I shared in my prepared remarks, where we had pushed summer capacity out into the fall in some of these Mid-Con markets and some of these other key areas. We brought that capacity back down starting in October, and we re already seeing the positive effects of doing that.Got it. That s the big driver. And if I might, on the growth plans that you kind of mentioned for next year, it sounds like you re still kind of evaluating between 4  and 8 . The first half kind of maybe on the lower end of that 4 , it seems like  Or how should we think about maybe early indications  I know you re probably not ready to give a full guide.Yes. I mean that s correct. And we ve been clear as we go into the first quarter, we re going to be around 3  or so over  19 levels. And again, we ve looked really hard at our lowest demand period for Alaska at least in the January, February time period, and we feel like we ve made some pretty good reductions there, and we made that well ahead of the bookings of those flight. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into the first quarter.Helpful. Thank you.Thanks, Savi.We will move next to Andrew Didora with BofA Global Research.Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew, in your prepared remarks, you said your   it seems like you re booked well ahead for November than another airline that reported earlier today is the 58  book sort of a normal cadence for you, or is it more of how you re looking at close in trending today and just wanting to book more of that a little bit further out than usual.I think our comments were a little bit related to when you compare it back to, say, 2019 sort of Thanksgiving sort of falls within the month. So   but if you average it out between Thanksgiving and Christmas sort of in November and December. We re probably a little higher on the bookings, but not very much. And right now, we re just making sure that we manage that coming in with good solid yield to close out the year.Okay. Understood. And then also, Andrew, on the last call, I thought you shared some good statistics on the shift you re seeing to international bookings on your partners over the summer, curious if you ve begun to see more of a normalization there and maybe share shift back to domestic, or do you continue to see that elevated international demand booking on your partners. Thanks.Yes. Thanks. I think we re seeing exactly actually what we saw on the domestic front, whereas last year pushed well into the shoulder season. I think that s what we re seeing, at least from our members on the international. So just to remind folks, in the summer, we reported in that we were up sort of 50  of our members year-over-year accruing and redeeming internationally. That number is only 26  for the fourth quarter. So we re certainly seeing it coming down. And so of course, the question will be, will that get normalized by next year. What we re seeing right now is it s on its way to normalization.Great. Thank you.Thanks, Andrew.And we will move next to Helane Becker with TD Cowen.Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Two questions. One, when you talk about   maybe this is for Andrew, when you talk about optimization of the network, can you just describe maybe more fully what you re talking about  I know some of it is not flying as much in the first quarter in  24 as you did in  23 because of the shifts in the way people are flying and the fact that corporate probably back as far as it s going to go, right  I can t imagine that there are a lot of day trips between Seattle and Portland or Seattle and San Fran or L.A. anymore given the unreliability of exogenous pressures, right  So how do we think about what optimization exactly meansYes, Helane, I think, what I would say, when I talk about optimization, look, we re at a place now where we see where fuel is at elevated and has been for some time. The whole industry has a new set of structural unit costs. And we re also seeing sort of a settling down of overall capacity across the country. So given those things, we re looking much harder where we   and business as you raise as another point, we re looking much harder about where we re putting our airplanes in high-frequency routes, leisure versus business time of year. Just to be frank, we ve probably been less concerned about being more surgical during summer. But the reality is this past summer, you can certainly see as we get back to normalized booking patterns, there is definitely between July and September, very significant changes in demand profile. So we re going to do a much better job going forward, and we re already on it, is just realigning our supply of aircraft. So I think that s what I m basically saying, and I think there s only good news from doing that.Okay. That s sort of helpful. Until things kind of revert to more normalized behavior, and you have to fix it again. But that s not a problem. My other follow-up question on the A321s that are being   I thought those were actually going to be leased in aircraft, but they re being transferred over to American. So I didn t see it in the press release, but that doesn t mean anything. It just means I didn t see it. Can you talk about the accounting for that  Can you comment on the cost of what they re paying you or any information that would help us think about that for you guys.Hi, Helane, it s Matt. Thanks for the question. I d say this transaction is probably one of the more complicated ones that I ve seen in my 25 years of doing this. But our thinking on it is really simple. We ve been public in that there s 6 to 8 years left on these above-market leases that Alaska acquired as part of the Virgin transaction. And our objective was just to find a transaction and build it that economically offset those remaining obligations. We ve been working it for 12 to 18 months and just happy to get this process to a close because as you know, this is the last unlock to truly get us to single fleet. Just like we don t comment on pricing on   in the airline. I m not going to comment on pricing of what American is paying us, but we feel good about the economics. And again, covering what our PV of lease obligations was through the extended period of those leases. And then I m going to kick it to Emily on the accounting side, just where that is.Thanks, Matt. Helane, we have taken the vast majority of which are depicted with these transitions to P L already. You ve seen those in special charges over the last 12 to 18 months, as Matt noted. Cash-wise, we re about two-thirds of the way through the cash that we re going to incur with is, of course, as we ve purchased the lease or the planes from the lessors and then we sell the planes to America, and there will be cash inflows and outflows. So about two-thirds of the  300 million to  350 million total cash exposure that we ve shared with you guys previously, we ve already incurred that. And then the remaining one-third will happen over the next two quarters.Great. That s very helpful. Thanks, Emily. Thanks, Matta and Andrew.Thanks, Helane.And we will hear next from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.Hi, everyone. Thank you. Helane, maybe you can submit those notes on the accounting.  Technical Difficulty  year, it seems like on cost side. Could you just talk about some of the moving parts as you think about headwinds, maybe in the content, so productivity offsets that you, that are clearly in the cost structure now. Thank you.Hey, Conor, thanks. It s Shane. Bringing up a tiny, but I think you were asking about 2024 sort of puts and takes on costs. I ll be high level, I think we re not quite ready to fully discuss  24 or cost guidance or anything like that. But the areas that we will have headwinds won t be a surprise. I think there s continued investment in airport infrastructure that we will see come into the P L next year. really across all of our major hubs, and that s just a generational reinvestment that is needed in these airports. There ll still be some labor cost headwinds. We ve got to annualize the market rate adjustment we did with the pilots. We re really hopeful we get the TA with our mechanics fully ratified. We will have that in the cost base next year. And then pretty much the entire industry needs to get contracts done with flight attendants, which we re really anxious to do and actively in the process of negotiating.I think on the other side, we ve now got truly a single fleet. We should have almost every Airbus pilot trained over to the Boeing by the end of the year. And really, we need to start looking at leaning out the operation and focusing again on productivity. That we started to do this quarter. I think we ve got a good trend through the end of the year. We ve been waiting for these trends. We re happy to see them now, and we just need to leverage them into next year. So it s really about making the more efficient, taking some of the buffer out that we ve got in there today. We will go slow on it. We re not going to risk operational resilience at all. It took us a lot to get to where we are in the operation, we re going to keep operating well, but lots of opportunity to get more productive over the next couple of years.Okay. That s helpful. And then you guys are being pretty rational in  24, it seems versus an industry that s really not at the current moment. Like when you think about potential share losses versus protecting margins. Does that matter to you in the near term if it s potentially just a temporary thing  Just curious how you think about it given the fact that you re pulling on so much growth relative to some of the others out there. Thank you.Conor, it s Ben. Of course, market share matters to us, especially in our key hubs. So we will protect our key hubs fiercely and maintain the market share. Of course, we re going to look at areas where there won t be such an impact to us. But again, this industry is very capacity-dependent, and it has a huge leverage on profitability. So we re going to take a hard look. The teams are out there looking at next year s capacity. And like Andrew said, we re going to look at Q1 really hard, fringing on days where we have to fringe and flying hardware, we can fly hard. So it s a delicate balance, but we re determined to get as close to right as we can on this.Appreciate, thank you.Thanks. Thanks so much, Conor.Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.Thanks, everyone. So I know we re all chasing what normal seasonality is, and they re already on a couple of questions on the call. But I m wondering to what extent do you think it s return to office that s kind of impacted shoulder season compared to the last couple of years  And kind of maybe that s restricting the ability of the so-called leisure travel, if you will, and that actually sets up for peak year peaks in the next couple of go-arounds.Ravi, so I just   you mentioned returned to office. And I think we all see the public statistics sort of think sort of slowly climbing its way back, but still a long way off. What I would share is that we have seen between September and October, especially in high tech, where we ve started to see in some places for some accounts, a decent uptick in travel, albeit overall general yields and not where we have seen them historically. So I think this is still a moving subject. But I think if you just look at the macro size of our network and traditional business versus leisure, I think for us, specifically, I think it s just beyond more   some of these bleeder traveler type conversation. But what we are seeing is beginning to see a little more strength come in on the corporate side. And again, we just have a lot of opportunity on our core high-frequency rates, getting those to a place where they can support the current demand as well as the new unit cost of production that the industry now faces.Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of you kind of   you spoke about how you re being more rational than many of your peers and capacity growth for next year. But you also kind of mentioned a few headwinds. So if you were to rank the current softness in the domestic demand environment, extreme capacity growth plans by our competitors or fuel headwinds  Like what s the order of those three headwinds that would make you kind of question your capacity growth plans next year relative to what you currently have in mindI think fuel for us is a big one, Ravi, especially with like we talked about, the LA refining margins on the West Coast, we re paying  0.30 a gallon more than everyone else across the country. So that is a huge headwind for us. In terms of capacity, we can t control what our competitors do. What I can say is we re confident with our business model. Andrew talked about it in the prepared remarks, we have a remarkable premium product. We are not we may be low cost, but we re a premium brand airline. And I believe that we can always extract the higher revenues because of the brand we have, our premium offerings, lounges and global access. So I would say fuel is the biggest headwind. The other thing I would say, when we cost up, we have cost discipline in our DNA. And we ve shown this year that we brought unit costs down. This is something that we re wired for. We re wired for high productivity of resources and assets. And so I feel confident we re going to get back to the place that we ve been in single fleet, I am just ecstatic starting October 1st that we re now back to an all-Boeing fleet, and I think you re really going to start seeing those synergy fees come in. So those are the things, I think, for us, that we can control. And I think we have the right setup in the business model to go executeExcellent. Thanks, guys.Thanks, Ravi.We will move next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew, you talked about   as you look out towards holiday travel, you mentioned that loads are up a couple of points, yields are up double digits. So obviously, that looks very good for the latter part of the year. Does that hold or do you think some of that also reflects the shifting of the booking curve or maybe in the past, we saw people booking closer in and maybe this holiday season  As you have said before, seasonality is returning, booking curves are becoming more elongated. How much of that is possibly going to shift or change because of those factorsYes. Thanks Mike. Just for clarity, the comments that you just shared that I had made was versus 2019. I think yes, because last year, obviously, was very different, very different fare environment capacity set up. So, we just wanted to anchor back in on 2019, which is a very stable, normalized year. And so we have been very encouraged by what we have seen. And I think as we have seen, I think when you look at the industry right now, when you look at 2019, our unit revenues sequentially flat Q3 to Q4, where the industry is down anywhere from 1 point to 5 points. And then if you look at  23, as we said, we are up 3 points where the industry is sort of flat to up 1 point. So, we feel like, number one, I would say that what we are seeing at least in our network is outside of this business travel matter, back to sort of normal booking curves, normal demand environment. And I think some of the reduced capacity and reallocation of capacity is serving us very well.Okay. Great. And then just a quick second one. I don t know if you mentioned this or it was Shane, who said, look, the goal next year is to return back to 2019 levels on a productivity basis, a little bit different than sort of a network optimization. But if we get back to 2019 productivity, help me translate that into like a CASM benefit. Is that like a point or 2 points of CASM tailwind  And how long does it take to actually get to 2019 productivity  Is that through the year, or is that a  25-type objective  Any color on that would be great. Thanks.Hey Mike, it s Shane. Yes.Hey Shane.One thing, let me   yes. Hi. I will clarify. I think it s going to take us a couple of years to 2019. We are going to work it methodically. And like I said a couple of answers ago, we are not going to overly stress the operation now that we have got it working really well. It s worth at least a couple of points, all else equal, of unit costs. If there were no other puts and takes, I mean I would say, minimally, it s worth that. I think we saw single fleet alone at  75 million of benefit, and then we have less productivity in many areas, whether it s aircraft utilization or other work groups. And all of those are opportunities to get better from where we are. I think we are doing better than the rest of our competitors generally. And I think our focus has been, will continue to be to come out of all of this with the best relative change in cost structure. And I think we are well on our way to doing that.Alright. Great. Thanks Shane. Thanks Andrew.Thanks Mike.Your next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.Hey. Good morning everybody. So, the 45  of revenue outside of main cabin, can you break that down into various buckets. Is it as simple as premium being 31  and then the rest is just loyalty in cargo. Also, as part of the main cabin, so it was part of the 55 . Any color on how basic   sorry, Sabre contribution has changed year-on-yearThanks Jamie. We are not going to go into the details of that, obviously. I think you have heard other airlines quote. We don t have MROs and other things, but we feel very diversified as it relates to what is not the main cabin. I think in our slides, we provide some of that breakdown there, about 35  of it is premium cabins and some carriers have 0 . So, I think as we have shared all along, we feel like we live more in the group right now that has premium product and global reach as it relates to our business model versus those that do not.Yes. I think Jamie, I think the point in here with those stats is just to differentiate us among domestic carriers. We are the only domestic carrier with that suite of offerings with the premium, again, lounges, the global access, this equivalent redemption of miles, we do separate ourselves from I think what do you call them low.LMA, low-margin airline.You came up with a new acronym. Like my point here is we are not in that group based on the offerings. We invested heavily in our product. We have over 300 airplanes in our fleet. Every airplane in our fleet, including regional has a first class, has a premium product. And again, when you add our oneworld membership, our global access, our lounges, it is a compelling product. And to be honest, Jamie, it s why our margin is equivalent to Delta and United in Q3 despite not having the international tailwinds and having the headwinds of Maui and the refining margins. So, the business model is resilient.And last, Jamie, you asked about Sabre, it s doing quite well, too. It s up strong double digits year-over-year. And I think it also speaks and you have heard this from other airlines, we can access the price-sensitive part of the market really well, too. So, we have been able toThat was one reason I asked. Yes. No, listen, I appreciate the color. But so let me press on premium, you cited   you are obviously enthusiastic about it. It s an area for growth. You leaned into this when you answered Robbie s question a couple of moments ago, should we think about premium growth more as yield upside, or as you think about that 4  to 8  capacity number, are you considering possibly expanding the cabin  I ask in part because American spoke to this just a couple of hours ago, so it s top of mind.Yes. I will take that. I think I don t think you are going to see like a wholesale refurbishment of the interiors. I will say that we are still working on our MAX 8 interior, and we would love to get 16 first-class seats, and that our 8s carry 12 today. The rest of the mainline fleet carries 16. And it s relatively small, but could have59 airplanes.Yes, 59 airplanes. And it could have a good impact, obviously, for us once we get there, but that s a couple of years off if we end up getting it done.Okay. Cool. Thanks gentlemen. Appreciate it. Take care.Thanks Jamie.We will hear next from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.Hey. Thanks. So, I just want to go back to this fourth quarter RASM re-acceleration just given the implied September trends. So, I just want to understand, are you seeing this already show up in October, or is this more of a November, December  And I guess that s a direct question. Just philosophically, like if we are slowing capacity and we are seeing sort of an immediate RASM benefit, like why you even think about 4  to 8  for next year  Why isn t it like we are not going to grow until we actually start grow at all until we see positive RASM againYes, I will let that Andrew. Yes. No, I think it s a good question, Scott. Andrew can speak to the   where we are seeing the sequential improvement if it s already on the books or sort of to come. I think on the capacity, I think the way to think about it is we have been pretty clear about our first quarter capacity being relatively modest, certainly versus 2019. Andrew mentioned in the script, we were up 6 points versus 2019 and Q3, 2 points in Q4. So, at least from our view, Scott, I think what you are asking is exactly what we are doing. We are not ready to talk about full year next year yet. But right now, given fuel and where we see pricing, we are making the right decisions in terms of capacity management.And the only other thing I would add there, Scott, and you don t see this obviously in the details, but even the reduction in growth relatively speaking has been helpful for sure. We also had some regions with some very significant growth. And I mean very significant. And I think we have abated those back down to more normalized levels, and that s where we are seeing the greatest upside with some of this slowing capacity. So, there is micro regions which we have really dialed it back, and we are seeing immediate help from that.So, you are seeing some of it already in October.Yes.Okay. And then, Shane, you talked about working on some pushing out some deliveries. What does that mean for overall CapEx next yearYes. Thanks Scott. Just for color, so you guys sort of understand, and I had mentioned this high level in the prepared remarks. We are going to be at  1.7 billion this year, down from our original thoughts about CapEx in 2023. And it s going to be under that next year. I think we are not quite ready to say how much, but I would think in the couple of hundred million dollar range minimally. We will say more about that in the January call. Matt can just very briefly speak to what we are doing with on the great partners in this. And it speaks to the flexibility that we were able to build into this order book with them.Hey Scott. We are working with Boeing just to reshape  24 and even into  25 a bit to a capacity level that we think maximizes profitability. One of the other variables that we are managing is the MAX 10 certification. So, better playing, originally scheduled to come to us next year. Certification, obviously, is its own story and pushing out to the right. So, good common ground with us and Boeing to sort through when does that airplane come. The economics, we have been really clear on how much we like the MAX 10, and we want to take as many of those as we can. So, it gave us to join impetus to then let s reshape  24 and as a result, manage our capacity down a little bit. You have heard us talk before, we leveraged the proximity with Boeing. We talk to them all the time, and it s really good partnership with great flexibility.Thank you.Thanks Scott.And we will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I heard some comments earlier about trying to be disciplined around growth. And I know you guys have mentioned that you are going to try to slow growth in the first quarter next year. But I guess just thinking through some of these trends that you are talking about with lower corporate shoulder demand being a little bit less than you would have thought. Is this just   looking forward, should we expect margins at Alaska are just going to be lower in 4Q and 1Q structurally  I mean they have historically, but should we expect even more volatility in the future  And does that reshape your commercial focus, I guess during your peak periods  Do you take more price then  I mean how do you reshape the formula to get the prior margin targets that you guys have set outYes. Thanks Brandon. I actually think about it a little bit the opposite. I think the work that Andrew is doing and his team are doing in the first quarter is meant to improve the margin profile of the first quarter. I think we talked two calls ago that Ben had given the commercial team a challenge over the course of a few years, move back towards breakeven in the first quarter. We are the most seasonal airline, the sort of peakest airline. We have been through basically all cycles. So, we understand when and where we make all of our money. And I think we are really good at managing capacity in the peak environments. Q4, honestly, I think this Q4 is a bit of an aberration. I think the results are really a consequence of this refining margin differential in fuel price and the continued but normalizing surge in international demand. And I think once that normalized business we are set up really well to do good. In Q4, we will probably be somewhat lower than some of the other carriers who tend to have less peakiness in the year, but I think we will be more competitive on a relative basis as we move forward.Okay. I appreciate that response. But I guess as you reshape the first quarter, that s kind of at odds with the prior view that long-term CASM could actually decline in the out years, right  Is that why I heard you say it s going to be   take a couple of years to get back to those productivity targets.Well, look, I think it s very correct to think that there is a correlation between capacity deployment and unit costs. The more we deploy capacity, the easier it is to see the cost decline. But we haven t lifted it off of the idea of unit cost ultimately going down over time. We will say more about 2024 and the trajectory when we are talking about guidance for next year, Brandon, but this is something we are thinking about a lot. I will just reiterate as we come out of all of this, we are going to have exposure to all segments of demand, including premium. We are going to increasingly be attractive from an international perspective to our partners. And I think we are going to have the best relative cost structure story of anybody in the industry. And so I think our setup is really good to continue to be a margin and financial performance leader over the long-term.Alright. Thank you, Shane.Thanks Brandon.And your next question comes from Catherine O Brien with Goldman Sachs.Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for the time. So, we have heard from two of your peers so far that the tech sector in San Francisco in particular have seen a recent uptick in corporate travel. It sounds like you didn t see that in the third quarter. I think your comment was stable. But then just mentioned to Ravi, there has been some momentum in October. Can you just help us size order of magnitude, that that improvement you have seen  And is that coming from San Francisco in tech or anything else you would want to highlight the recent improvement  Thanks.Thanks Katie. Yes, I mean and certainly some of the larger technology companies have seen quite a significant movement in volume. And of course, it depends where they fly. As I have said, some of the yield environment right now has offset some of those volumes. But for sure, there has been positive movement in California, Pacific Northwest, these big techs cover both regions actually. So, some promising signs there.Okay. Great. And then maybe for Shane, pardon the modeling question, but just trying to get a sense of the aircraft rent tailwind into next year. Is there further downside to 3Q,  48 million in aircraft rent and some of those aircraft exit in September  Can you just help us think about what the right exit rate is for this year on that line item  And are there any additions on lease aircraft, we should be thinking about into next year  Thanks so much.Hey Katie, this is Emily. What you saw this quarter in terms of aircraft point was a pretty good normalized level. We have now removed all the Airbus leased aircraft from the book, so you are not seeing that rent come through. We have taken delivery of all the MAX lease aircraft that we are going to have, which is the 13, I believe, 13 over the last year. So, that s pretty normalized now. You will start to see from an ownership perspective, depreciation will tick up to offset some of that as we have taken on so many new MAX aircraft and those will start depreciating through the book.Helpful. Thank you.And our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. Andrew, when I look at Alaska s network in California, it looks like the state is only about 80  recovered relative to the footprint that was there in 2019. So, it looks like a pretty big revenue hole that has yet to recover. And if I am not mistaken, I believe it accounts for about 23  of Alaska seats. So, my question really is that, that part of the network were fully restored, what is the size of that revenue hole that could eventually go away, or however you can size it would be helpful.Well, I think if I am understanding your question, Dan, I think again, we are not going to put seats into a state where there is no demand. So, your observations are absolutely correct as far as capacity, and we are down. And I think other carriers are down as well. I think what I am still seeing here is even on tech and non-tech, and I repeat non-tech business recovery has not been as good at all versus what s happening in the Pacific Northwest. So, we are going to   again, we talked about the network, we are going to be very disciplined and thoughtful about how we maintain our network and where we fly our seats. But again, as we have maintained for some time, I don t think that s going to be forever, and we are going to be very prepared and in a good position as demand begins to strengthen and crawl back up that demand curve back to 2019 levels to be able to serve that demand.Yes. Understood. And then, Shane, I think I might risk of kicking a dead horse here. My question is really the same as others here, and that s just to   really just to close the circle on the path back to low-double digit pretax margin. I think you touched on fleet commonality at  75 million. It looks like Maui annualized might be close to  80 million or so. So, it looks like maybe 1.5 points to pretax margins there, or please correct me. But from where you sit, what are the biggest revenue and cost opportunities that get you where you want to beThanks Dan. And I want to underscore what Andrew said a second ago, just so we don t lose the point. One of the things I think you all should be thinking about in terms of Alaska setup is we are still in the least recovered portion of the country and still fighting for industry s best margins. So, I just think there is goodness to come overall for the company. In terms of your question, yes, the cost side is really leaning out the company, getting rid of the   not all of the buffer we have put in, but starting to work that back, getting closer to the 2019 productivity levels. I think there is opportunity to further leverage technology and automate more of what the guests do, and we are certainly going to be working on that over the next few years as I think every company is going to be doing. On the revenue side, like once we see sort of where demand normalizes, and in addition to the recovery we expect in the international demand or international-domestic demand mix in the West Coast recovery and business recovery, there is a lot more that Andrew and his team are starting to think about and look at from a commercial initiative perspective. They have done a great job delivering, and we don t get to talk a lot about them on the calls, but delivering on many initiatives this year, we are selling things like exit row seats now that we have not done before, a huge uptick in first class and premium class load factors while yields in those cabins are going up. That is both demand and things that the e-commerce and distribution and pricing team are doing. And there is more of those types of things that we are thinking about for the next year or 2 years. And we will talk more about that as we firm plans up and include them in our guidance and or get to an Investor Day at some point in 2024.Yes. Pretty good. Thanks for the time guys.Thanks Dan and thanks everyone for joining us for our call. We will see you next   or talk to you next quarter. For those we didn t get to, our IR team will be in contact with you. Thanks everybody.This concludes today s conference call. Thank you for attending.",90,2023-10-20T07:01:14.000-04:00
Ares Commercial Real Estate: Loan Losses Expected To Soar As Property LTVs Rise,"The commercial real estate market activity is likely one of the most significant trends of 2023. After many years of decent returns, commercial property prices have begun to decline quickly. Nationally, commercial property prices are It is clearly a very poor time to be in the commercial property lending business. Mortgage REITs focused on commercial property loans, such as Ares Commercial Real Estate , have lost considerable value. ACRE is down by aroundCommercial property prices have had much greater strains than residential properties. Commercial property lenders have fared better than residential property lenders over the past eighteen months due to their lower interest rate exposures. As mortgage rates peak  which is not guaranteed , I expect residential lenders to stabilize while commercial lenders like Ares face greater delinquency-related strains.ACRE attracts many investors due to its 13.7  forward dividend yield, making it one of the highest-yielding assets, excluding those with low market capitalizations. Its yield is so high that ACRE's total return, including dividend reinvestment, has been flat since 2020 despite a nearly 40  decline in its price. See belowWhile its dividend record is impressive, ACRE has experienced a lot of volatility for delivering no positive returns to investors over this period. Further, its losses have seemingly accelerated over the past year despite a considerable rebound over the summer. Should that rebound reverse, ACRE may quickly decline by  15  as it falls back to its earlier support level. As such, it seems reasonable to take a closer look at the investment and its economic risk exposures.Ares' portfolio is primarily interest-only variable-rate senior loans on commercial properties. Most of those loans have maturity dates under three years, so borrowers must successfully refinance to repay Ares. Of course, should property prices decline, higher loan-to-value ratios will make refinancing more difficult for borrowers, creating loan loss risks for Ares. Around 38  of  is parked in offices, its largest overall segment and the most at-risk segment today. The rest of its portfolio is more diversified between other components  multifamily, industrial, etc.  with no solid geographical concentration. purchase loans at discounted prices from banks that are retreating from the segment. This is an exciting strategy because many regional banks with a high commercial property loan concentration face liquidity issues associated with declining deposits. Since many investors are concerned about bank risks related to commercial properties, banks are incentivized to sell commercial property loans, even if they're relatively safe, to regain public confidence. This situation creates a value opportunity for Ares as it can buy these assets at higher yields than are normal in originations.Commercial property delinquencies are starting to tick up, but they're not yet too high. That said, due to the surge in property prices in 2021, US bank exposure to commercial real estate loans rose dramatically as property owners refinanced at higher prices. However, the YoY growth of commercial property loans is nearly zero today, indicating banks do not want to increase exposure to these assets. See belowWhile commercial property prices are in free-fall  depending on segment , commercial property lending has not yet experienced tremendous difficulty as delinquency rates are still not too high. Of course, that figure seems to vary with data measurements. Other measures, such as the overall CMBS delinquency rate, are as high as  all segments. Office CMBS delinquencies are over  reaching the 2020 shock.Commercial property's core issue is the increase in interest rates, particularly in interest rates  inflation, as measured by Treasury inflation-indexed interest rates. As detailed in many of my articles, this figure is significant for commercial properties because their capitalization rate valuations are  in the long run. Inflation-indexed rates  or  real rates  are more important than interest rates because most commercial properties see their net operating incomes rise with inflation. Of course, as I recently , trends such as work-from-home and a lack of household discretionary spending capacity are causing many properties to see below-inflation NOI growth, causing those properties to lose value independent of changes in real interest rates.Still, the massive increase in real interest rates, particularly the most recent increase, will profoundly impact commercial property prices, creating strains for CMBS assets. See belowThe overall increase in 10-year real interest rates since 2021 is now up to nearly 3.3 , one of the fastest increases ever. All capitalization rates fell to around  of 2021, coinciding with the record-low level for US real interest rates. From 2020 to 2021, capitalization rates fell from 6.4  to 5.4 , just as real rates fell from  0  to -1 , validating the 1-to-1 relationship.Considering the relationship between real rates and capitalization rates, cap rates may rise to 8.7   3.3  higher  if real interest rates remain where they are today over the coming year or two. This would result in a  38  total decrease in property prices, given no change in NOI. That is a reasonable assumption,  that rents stagnate today while  rise with  or above  inflation. I do not expect property prices to fully react to these changes so quickly because transaction volumes are so low today. That said, we've already seen a 17  decline, nearly half of the total loss I expect in the commercial property market.Ares does not publish the LTV values of its loans, likely because it is purchasing them at a discount. Most commercial loans have LTVs around 70  at origination, so the property price shock should push LTVs up to 90  for most outstanding loans and over 100  for some. Depending on the discounts Ares receives, this could be a massive issue for the company as its borrowers struggle to refinance, given that most lenders will not lend at LTVs over 80 .I believe the commercial property market is in the early phase of the rise in delinquencies associated with failed refinancing due to the huge increase in LTVs. That said, Ares has already seen its allowance for loan losses soar considerably to  108M, far above the 2020 peak level. Currently, this equates to 15.6  of its book value. See belowImportantly, ACRE's book value already accounts for loan losses. The existing allowance for loan losses has already reduced its value, so the direct ratio of the two is not necessarily crucial. That said, it does illustrate the magnitude of risk. Loan losses have risen by around 5  of book value each quarter, indicating a negative loss trend for ACRE's importance. Further, allowance for loan losses accounts for relatively immediate loan defaults  defaults usually occur long after strains begin to exist, so I believe it is likely that its loan loss allowance will continue to rise at a fast pace.Default risks in commercial real estate should not be overlooked. Most of Ares' portfolio has unlevered yields of  9  or around 4  over the short-term borrowing rate. That spread is typical of the sector and implies that its loans are about as risky as most commercial properties. The company's portfolio is very short-term, which is a significant issue because interest rates will likely remain very high by the time its borrowers need to refinance. If its maturity lengths were longer, then we could expect interest rates to normalize  aiding property prices  by the time of refinancing.At this point, it is too early to give a clear outlook for the total expected loan loss, but I would not be surprised to see losses eventually consume up to 40  or more of ACRE's existing book value. The company's debt-to-equity is just over 2X today, so a 40  decline in its equity requires a  11.5  decline in its asset value. That is certainly not a small amount, but I do not believe it is unreasonable given the 17  existing decline in commercial property values and an expected total decline of over 30 , likely causing default issues with poor collateral. The significant determining variable will be changes in the economic outlook and interest rates, with stagflation  sustained rates and a weak economy  being the worst overall outcome, harming property NOIs while aiding higher capitalization rates.For the most part, investors should do their best to overlook dividend yields and income-related valuation metrics for mortgage REITs. This is important because mortgage REITs like ACRE can quickly boost their incomes by increasing their leverage  however, doing so creates immense risk for equity investors. Thus, price-to-book is undoubtedly the best valuation measurement for mortgage REITs with significant short-term loans because its book value should be close to its liquidation value. Currently, ACRE trades at a 24  discount to its book, usually trading at its book value before 2020. See belowACRE trades at a significant discount to its tangible book value, allowing for a relatively substantial increase in loan losses before it would be back above its book value. However, we must remember that interest rates and NOI strains  in some segments  are the greatest that the commercial property market has ever seen in recent history. Commercial property debt is also the highest it has ever been. Thus, this unprecedented situation could easily create loan losses much more significant than those seen in 2008.Is ACRE particularly overvalued  Based on its price-to-book ratio, I do not believe ACRE is overvalued, as it is priced for a relatively significant correction in the commercial property lending market. That said, I think that total losses will be worse than it is currently pricing for because the most recent spike in real interest rates should create added downward pressure on commercial property prices over the next year. If real interest rates had not spiked over recent months, I would not be too bearish on ACRE today. However, given its price rose while real rates increased, I firmly believe it does not account for the likely negative impact of higher real rates on property borrowers refinancing abilities. Thus, I am bearish on ACRE, but it is not so overvalued that I would bet against it.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
