"Albemarle, Livent move lower as Piper Sandler cuts on lithium supply/demand woes","Albemarle   in Wednesday's trading as Piper Sandler downgraded the lithium producer to Neutral from Overweight with a  155 price target,  100 lower than its previous PT, citing challenges in electric vehicle manufacturing and demand that may  significantly degrade  lithium's supply andLivent   as Piper analyst Charles Neivert also lowered the stock to Neutral with a  19 PT, cut from  33, although Deutsche Bank separately upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, seeing an attractive entry point following a 30 -plus decline since early June.Neivert said widespread downstream issues for the lithium due to slowing EV demand growth driven by macroeconomic factors and product issues within the OEMs and a relatively faster rate of lithium supply growth  will take the lithium market to a balanced to long situation vs. estimates of a decidedly short situation as recently as six months ago,  thus  lithium prices may remain under pressure and earnings growth may suffer.The risk reward profile for the two lithium producers has  dramatically shifted downward as a combination of rapidly expanding new capacity collides with slowing demand growth of the EV sector,  Neivert wrote.ETF  ",10,2023-10-25T12:27:26.000-04:00
Vale: Buy On Higher For Longer Iron Ore Prices,"Vale  has been range bound for the better part of 3 years driven by investor skepticism surrounding the future of China steel demand and the residential construction crises despite consistently high IO  iron ore  prices. IVale is one of the largest seaborne IO miners with the bulk of sales going to China. As such the price setters are Chinese steel companies and their demand for IO has been thought to be greatly dependentThere are 4 reasons to forecast higher for longer IO pricesThis means that the seaborn IO miners have entered maturity with a few resounding caveats, there main client depends on them, there are scant substitutes for exported iron ore and the Chinese steel sector can take share from other steel makers via pricing. In essence the iron ore miners are in symbiotic existence with the Chinese steel sector.Thus, the key to Vale fundamentals is the health and peculiarity of the Chinese steel sector. As with the case for many Chinese companies, the creation of shareholder value may not be a priority. Employ and produce is more relevant. As long as the steel companies can run production at near breakeven  with plenty of govt subsidies  they will make steel products for China and export the rest. The exports prices can and have been highly competitive, perhaps predatory or dumping but that's the operating model.Vale and the Australian IO miners see peak China steel production in sight and should limit capacity expansion or perhaps begin to reduce. This is similar to what many oil companies are doing, rationalizing capex, attempting to balance supply with demand and maintaining reasonable prices that permit very healthy FCF and dividend payouts i.e. capital discipline.China is 50  of global steel capacity  1bn tons  and it consumes most of the seaborn IO, about 85 . Thus, as real estate construction demand fell and continues to decline  massive over building  China steel companies will export and displace share in any market without high import barriers.Below are my estimates of the seaborne IO balance between supply and demand. There are many drivers and moving parts. Fundamental to seaborne IO demand is that Chinese steel output remains near peak or near capacity while its primary suppliers do not add significant capacity. Note that I assume global steel demand grows at half a percent in 2024 and 1  in 2025, any move higher means greater IO imbalance.The Chinese Steel sector is large and divers, I found data and consensus estimates for 9 companies. One of the largest is Baoshan with 50m ton capacity  5  of total .Contrary to headlines, the sample group, seems to be weathering the real estate construction sector decline well. Revenue and EBITDA has fallen up to 1Q23 and now turned positive in 2Q23. Steel prices seem to have stabilized at above US 500mt with the ratio to iron ore prices at 5x  4x is thought to be healthy . Balance sheets seem to be in good shape with leverage under control.The market, as judged by consensus estimates, seems to have a favorable outlook for the sector with over 20  upside and a significant EBITDA rebound in YE24. The demand side dynamics for iron ore looks robust or at least better than in YE22 and YE23.Vale compares well on fundamentals vs. its peer group of IO miners such as BHP  and Rio Tinto . We see similar growth and margin profile but at a lower valuation due primarily to lower business risk on product diversification and country risk i.e. Australia vs Brazil.The stock is cheap vs peers and relative to FCF generation and dividend payout trading at 3.7x EV EBITDA and 6.2x PE on YE24 consensus estimates. The US 16.5 price target is based on a 4.2x EV EBITDA target multiple, below peers such as Rio Tinto and BHP, which have a slightly lower risk profile as Australian companies.Vale is a BUY on positive IO price dynamics supported by Chinese steel exports which drives significant free cash flow and dividends share buy backs. The stocks valuation is discounted vs peers which further supports a possible re-rate and 25  upside potential.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"PDI: Complete Devastation, Massive Income","  is a closed-end mutual fund, or CEF, that seeks to provide investors with a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. The fund is actively managed by portfolio managers Joshua AndersonThe fund has some interesting holdings in its top 10, and that has led to some uncertainty, but after the most recent decline in shares down to  15.67, you can now buy and . Assuming the dividend is paidMake no mistake, income stocks have been crushed, but this is a name we were waiting for  16, and now we are below that level. For the long-term investor, now is the time to buy in our opinion.Let's be honest. That PDI chart is disgusting. If it was not for management and the shifting of holdings for income, we would likely be short  If this chart was one of a stock, we would be pretty bearish. However, the payout is simply so good, even if it were to be cut, PDI is just an income machine. While countless other investors have lost money on paper, we are picking up their slack.We now are wanting to come into the fund. Enough is enough here. While you can earn 5  in a bond or money market with no risk, but taking on some risk, you can collect over 3 times that with PDI. We like PDI as it invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities, including government and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and other debt instruments. The fund also has the flexibility to invest across various fixed income sectors, which allows the aforementioned fund managers to seek opportunities in different parts of the bond market.Now, the price of PDI has dropped in recent weeks with a surge in rates. To us, this is opportunity, despite expected short-term pressure. It is down due to fear over the leverage, as management uses leverage to enhance potential returns. This means that the fund borrows money to invest in additional securities, and the borrowing rates are only getting more expensive. The fear is further that it will hurt income. PDI is over 40  levered on its net asset value benchmarks, and is mostly doing so through reverse repos. That said, we like the port and the ability to shift it.As of the end of the last reporting period, PDI's portfolio was allocated to 70  U.S. investments, 5  in the UK, and the remaining in emerging markets, while 25  of the securities are invested in non-agency backed mortgages instruments. While the company does have nearly 1900 holdings, here is the look at the top 10 as of 2 week agoSo the holdings are many and diverse, but you get an idea of the major holdings above. Generally speaking, the company is invested in debt obligations and other income-producing securities. We did mention the mortgage-backed securities, but they also invest heavily in investment grade, and high-yield corporate dent, as well as in both developed and emerging markets' corporate and sovereign bonds. As of the end of the last reporting period the company had  4.7 billion in assets.So why is PDI fund getting crushed  It is all about the surge in rates, folks. You see, it is not just the so-called competition from bonds  savings accounts  money markets. There is certainly some fixed income competition happening, but the surge in rates has crushed a ton of income names. While some may have been telling you to buy for many months, we had been hesitant, saving you capital depreciation pain, even if it is on paper. Now we see the fund as a buy, as the income is just too good.But, the current economic environment is certainly a headwind for PDI's underlying assets. This is because PDI has an average portfolio maturity ranging from zero to eight years. With the rapid surge in rates  and, of course, the decline in the principal , the pressure is on the holdings, and as such, the value of the fund. At this point however we have very little concern over the bountiful payout. The investments made by the fund pay big time, which is why you get a bountiful monthly dividend and special dividends over time. Hold your nose and buy this for income.Why  Despite the carnage, PDI has a long history of providing its investors with very high level of income. Folks, this is not going to change, and with the sale happening, you need to take advantage. Scale into the fund in  0.50 increments from here. The investment will pay off. Readers, keep in mind that the fund has paid a monthly dividend for over 20 years now, and as we mentioned, it has also paid special dividends. The 16.4  payout is simply a very attractive yield, over 3 times that of most fixed income options. Of course, there is risk.But folks, do your due diligence. This is a quick pick for income, and one that we have looked at more in depth at our investing group, but the fact is that PDI is a very complex fund. It really is important to understand the risks involved before investing. First there is PDI's use of leverage, which can and does amplify gains, but can also magnify near-term losses. PDI is very sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions than a non-leveraged fund, and given the spike in rates, you have seen the value of the fund plummet to these buyable levels in the  15 range. Further this is a closed-end fund and, given the supply and demand for buying the shares, may trade at a premium or discount to the fund's net asset value. Right now, it is on sale. There is also credit risk because PDI invests in a variety of fixed income securities, including some that are issued by lower-credit quality borrowers, so there is risk of default.With that said, we think that PDI is a good option for further research and for investors who are looking for a high level of income. There is risk, and you have to be ok with the leverage, interest rate sensitivity, and credit risk, but the fund makes big money. You can see shares go to a penny in 6 years, but as long as the dividends keep getting paid  they should  you will make your entire investment back in dividends in just 6 years. Everything after that is simply gravy.So what do you think  Are you a reluctant shareholder  Have you been buying for months, or will this be your first purchase.

Tesla: My Long-Term Bull Thesis (Rating Upgrade),"A few days ago, I was in a discussion with a friend about his recent   stock acquisition and told him I thought he would likely be quite happy with his purchase a decadeAs much as I am quite bullish on their long-term prospects, when I wrote  on Tesla in April, I was hesitant to place a buy rating because of a combination of their margin contraction  and our . However, with the  providing significant , Tesla's shortTesla produces electric vehicles, solar panels and roof tiles, and battery storage systems. They are a leading developer of self-driving software, and have expanded into machine learning with the development of their own supercomputer . They maintain operations in the United States, China, and internationally. The company was founded in 2003 and and is currently headquartered in Austin, Texas.Tesla maintains an Automotive segment, and an Energy Generation and Storage segment. Their Automotive segment offers electric vehicles and ancillary products and services. This segment includes their network of Superchargers and service locations, in-app upgrades and mobile services, financing and leasing services, and warranties and extended service plans.Their Energy Generation and Storage segment provides photovoltaic generation, storage products, and related services. It maintains a website as well as stores and galleries, and also reaches customers through a network of channel partners. They offer various financing options to their solar customers.The global electric vehicle  EV  market is projected to have a  until 2030. The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to have a  through 2032. The global electric vehicle charging station market is projected to have a  until 2033. The energy storage market is projected to have a  through 2028. The global photovoltaic market is projected have a  during the forecast period.Tesla is in the process of improving its capabilities on multiple fronts. They have been working toward full self-driving  FSD  for many years. As part of this effort,  at their AI Day event on August 19, 2021.As progress continues on establishing superior reliability and safety capabilities, it will eventually become clear that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers. Once a certain statistical threshold has been met, insurance companies are going to be willing to offer lower rates to drivers who use proven autonomous driving software.What I believe frequently gets overlooked is the pressure this will place on entities who operate large fleets of vehicles. They will be financially incentivized to transition to autonomous capable vehicles. While most of the auto industry has been working toward  of autonomous driving, Tesla has a capability . If insurance companies are willing to offer users of Tesla's software better rates, this will incentivize Tesla's competition to manufacture vehicles which are capable of running a variety of software packages.Their Autopilot has access to more raw data than any of their competitors. This gives them a significant lead on reaching full capability more quickly than any other autonomous driving software provider.We could witness an era where it's common for people to buy a new Ford , General Motors , or Stellantis  vehicle equipped with Tesla's autonomous driving software. This may also produce an industry of third party entities which convert vehicles to be capable of using Tesla's software. Eventually, any capability gap should close for those of their competitors who continue developing their own software packages, so this period may only last a few years. However, the trend of vehicles being manufactured with multi-software capability may continue even after the gap closes. Being able to purchase a vehicle capable of using a variety of self-driving software packages may eventually become standard.While I am not clear as to when this threshold will be crossed. The idea that Tesla might find themselves with a much larger market for their software than their own vehicles is extremely appealing. The pressure would have to be significant for the other auto manufacturers to make the switch. If the discounts the insurance companies are handing out are not deep enough, we may not see an adoption or we may only experience a partial adoption.Tesla is well positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in our energy grid. The  is the most dominant factor at play when examining long-term energy infrastructure trends.When photovoltaics reached the status of  several years ago, additional renewable capacity seems inevitable. However, the adoption of intermittent sources warps the daily supply and demand curve for wholesale electricity. This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve. Excessive overproduction from solar will damage portions of the grid. This problem is severe enough that it is already common to disconnect portions of commercial scale capacity during the middle of the day. I went into further detail about how this is affecting long-term trends related to our grid in my recent .Tesla sits in a unique situation where they are involved in both grid scale storage as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In places where a portion of the grid is supplied by photovoltaics, storage providers are able to collect free or almost-free electricity in the middle of the day while the grid is overproducing. This electricity can later be sold back into the market in the evening when they are at their highest.With the electricity collected at no cost, or almost no cost, the margins for such an operation are a function of the sheer volume one can manage divided by the maintenance costs for the batteries. This means that storage providers are incentivized to gain access to as much overproduction as possible. Over the next several decades, I believe the electricity arbitrage industry has the potential to scale with the mass adoption of solar and will become incredibly lucrative. Although it's still far too early to tell how this situation will develop, Tesla is currently well positioned to become a major player in this emerging industry.Their Autobidder continues to find opportunities in Australia, Texas, California, and the UK. The company cites the clear advantages of growing their footprint, as each facility they build is expected to produce revenue for about 20 years.In 2022, their energy generation and storage segment , representing a 90  YoY increase to  1.310 billion, while the cost of revenues stands at  1.151 billion. This gives it a gross margin of 9.26 . According to a , Autobidder has made over  330 million in trading revenues since inception.Tesla's most recent earnings call spoke of several long-term projects they have in the works. They covered developments with the Cybertruck, which they plan to launch later this year, and also mentioned continued efforts toward developing a robotaxi. They are pleased about the adoption of the North American Charging Standard. Overall, things have been going well for them in recent months.Their forward looking statements indicate that they expect Q3 to have lower revenue due to scheduled upgrades causing down-time through the summer months.Tesla's  has been growing at an impressive rate. In 2013 they had an annual revenue of  2,013.5M. By 2022, that had grown to  81,462M. This represents a total increase of 3945.8  at an average annual rate of 438.4 .Their annual margins have been improving over the last several years. As of the most recent annual report, gross margins were 25.60 , EBITDA margins were 21.41 , operating margins were 16.81 , and net margins were 15.41 .Like many growing companies, Tesla has been diluting to help fund expansion. Total common shares outstanding was at 1,846.4M in 2013  by the end of 2022 that rose to 3,164M. This represents a 71.4  rise in share count, which comes out to an average annual rate of 7.93 . Over that same time period, operating income rose from - 61.3M to  13,692M. Because it has come with significant improvements to income, I view this dilution as accretive.Their debt situation has been improving over the last several years. As of the 2022 annual report, they had  106M in net interest expense, total debt was  5,748M, and long-term debt was  1,029M.As of this most recent annual report, cash and equivalents was  16,253M, operating income was  13,692M, EBITDA was  17,439M, net income was  12,556M, unlevered free cash flow was  4,327.5M, and levered free cash flow was  4,208.1M.Their total equity has been growing quite quickly.Annual returns have also been improving. As of the most recent annual report ROIC was 24.31 , ROCE was 17.64 , and ROE was at 27.36 .Their quarterly financials are showing significant revenue growth over the last two years. Eight quarters ago Tesla had a quarterly revenue of  11,958M. Four quarters ago that had grown to  16,934M. By this most recent quarter that had grown to  24,927M. This represents a total two-year rise of 108.4  at an average quarterly rate of 13.6 .Their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters. As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 18.19 , EBITDA margins were 14.25 , operating margins were 9.62 , and net margins were at 10.84 .Their dilution rate appears to have dropped in more recent quarters. The sum of their last eight quarters of dilution comes to 7.32  over the last four quarters this has dropped to 1.63 .Their debt situation is improving. This most recent quarter, Tesla had  210M in net interest expense, total debt was at  5811M, and long-term debt was at  504M.Their quarterly cash flow is inconsistent. As of the most recent earnings report, cash and equivalents were  15,296M, quarterly operating income was  2,399M, EBITDA was  3553M, net income was  2,703M, unlevered free cash flow was  894.4M, and levered free cash flow was  876.9M.When viewed on a quarterly basis, their total equity continues to rise.Their returns are trending in a similar pattern with their margins. As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was 4.66 , ROCE was 2.81 , and ROE was 5.18 .As of October 11th, 2023, Tesla had a market capitalization of  836.73B and traded for  262.99 per share. They do not pay a dividend, so using their  of 91.03x, and their  of 19.72 , I calculated a PEGY of 4.616x and an Inverted PEGY of 0.2166x. As the PEGY value is well above 1, this implies the company is presently significantly overvalued.However, TSLA has a history of trading at elevated valuations. They are currently trading with an EV EBITDA of 48.73x. When viewing their EV EBITDA over the last 5 years, it's clear that its present valuation is historically not as overvalued as it has reached in the past.Tesla faces a large number of competitors. A majority of the already established auto manufacturers on the planet are developing or already producing their own EV's and alternative fuel vehicles. This developing industry has also attracted a significant number of speculative startups. Because of Tesla's first mover advantage, and the time it will take to develop a viable product from nothing, I expect that the effects of this increasing competitive pressure will come on gradually.Autonomous driving may take longer to reach full maturity than they expect. Progress is expected to continue on its logistic growth curve, with most of the easy breakthroughs having already been made. The company already has a viable product, but they need a huge amount of additional data and time to fine tune it and make further safety and reliability improvements. It will likely be difficult to tell when they have actually crossed above the threshold where their FSD software can be called  fully mature.As always with innovators, Tesla runs the risk of overspending to stay relevant. Developing their own hardware and software for machine learning may end up costing more than they expect, or not be as profitable as they project. The push to develop A.I. is spawning development across the industry, and Tesla is merely one of many companies working on their own projects. While I believe the decision to move into machine learning was good for the long-term health of the company, it's always possible the additional cost of joining the first movers will not be worth the benefits.Tesla faces several catalysts, most of which are not near term. Tesla has cut prices several times earlier this year. This should produce additional demand and help them capture market share. Tesla has been normalizing electric vehicle use  at some point we will cross the threshold where it's more normal culturally to drive an electric or alternative fuel vehicle than a gasoline or diesel.Tesla's overall engineering quality is extremely high. Tesla is several generations into EV development and their design philosophy has them continuously making performance improvements. For a specific example of what I am referencing, YouTube has videos of Sandy Munro comparing the thermal systems of the Mach-E and the Model Y. They are eye-opening.As stated above, I believe demand for their FSD software will increase once the insurance providers are willing to offer discounts. Organizations which maintain fleets of vehicles will have to justify not transitioning to the cheaper option. This is likely to affect everyone from car rental companies and taxi services, to government employees and utility vehicles. Demand for FSD may also spur their competition into producing vehicles which are capable of using Tesla's driverless software.Tesla is joining several others in the . These types of batteries are significantly cheaper than the Li-ion we are all accustomed to. Tesla already operates a grid scale energy . The dramatic cost savings of Iron-Air batteries makes them a disruptive technology. Our electric grid currently requires a significant contribution from base load providers. As we increase its storage capacity, I believe the bargaining power the base load providers currently have will diminish as most of the negotiating power will shift to the storage providers.Also, storage providers will experience sustained tailwinds from the continued adoption of solar as they profit from . Because of their dramatically lower cost of production, the adoption of iron-air batteries should both lower cost of expansion and improve margins for their energy storage division.Tesla achieves rather high margins for a manufacturer. As producers in other industries realize that the reason Tesla is achieving superior margins and return on capital is due to their preference for automated manufacturing, the demand for Tesla-style facilities should rise. The company could eventually open a subsidiary which establishes automated manufacturing facilities for other companies.Normally, I refuse to place buy ratings on any company this overvalued. However, I believe the current UAW strike will provide continued tailwinds for Tesla, Inc.'s share price as it continues. Add to this the fact that they have a history of achieving unreasonably high valuations and its present valuation becomes less of a concern. This is one of the few occasions where I am willing to hand out a buy rating on a ticker when I am unable to clearly see that it's trading below its intrinsic value. I believe Tesla has unrecognized long-term growth potential, so it potentially may have a hidden margin of safety.Overall, Tesla, Inc. appears to be an extremely attractive investment because of their culture of adaptation and innovation. While I cannot guarantee that their current endeavors will lead to future moats, they have already established themselves as a premier EV producer and have the potential to find themselves with multiple high margin revenue streams. Although their margins have been contracting over the last several quarters, they have proven they are capable of producing attractive returns.I believe Tesla stock is likely to become the long-term compounder that its present investors hope it will be. So even if buying at today's prices ends up being a lackluster entry in the short or medium term, long-term Tesla, Inc. shareholders are unlikely to be punished for it.

The Catalysts Are Building For Bitcoin,"In this article, I'm going to provide an update on the catalysts that are driving the tremendous upward momentum in the Bitcoin  price. However, each of these comes with risks that could cause Bitcoin price to reverseI believe that these catalysts have contributed to the increasing price of Bitcoin. Furthermore, since Bitcoin's price is dependent on supply and demand dynamics, it is possible to argue that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the upcoming Bitcoin supply, the spot ETFs and increased utility will increase the demand for Bitcoin, and hence the price of Bitcoin should go up.Bitcoin is up 13.5  since I recommendedUsing Bitcoin as a back-end mechanism will serve to increase the demand for Bitcoin. Given that more financial institutions use Bitcoin as a payment rail, then these institutions will need to buy Bitcoin in order to process transactions. Block Inc.'s Cash App has integrated the Bitcoin lightning network onto Cash App and given Dorsey's comments above, I believe there is a significant chance that the company is working on a Bitcoin remittance solution.Another use-case that is evolving for Bitcoin is a so-called  sats economy . The sats economy refers to using satoshis  the smallest denomination of bitcoin  to send small tips of appreciation to others on social media. Damus used this model after it launched earlier this year, however, Apple  has forced Damus to shut this feature down during the summer . The problem with this use case is that it bypasses Apple's rules for in-app payments. This reflects the strength of the Bitcoin lightning network, but also the complete pushback it has received.For these reasons, I believe this catalyst is the weakest but also the most overlooked. Although nothing very concrete has materialized yet within the utility use case, it is likely soon to come... and if it does the scale could be vast.The payments industry comprises many large and powerful players, including Mastercard , Visa , and PayPal . How will they look upon Bitcoin as a future payment rail  Will these companies adopt the technology or build their own offering to compete against it  PayPal, for example, has a stablecoin called PAYUSD that developers are able to build new payment layers on top of. This is very similar to the Bitcoin ecosystem and directly the opposite approach that Block Inc. has taken. Instead of building on and integrating the Bitcoin network into Venmo and PayPal, the company has created its own. Actions like this could undermine the eventual increase in demand for Bitcoin.If you didn't already know, Bitcoin is set to halve in April 2024. This implies that the reward for mining one Bitcoin will be cut in half in April, effectively lowering the rate at which future supply enters the market.Historically, Bitcoin halvings have led to price increases in Bitcoin both  the halving occurs. Notice this dynamic in the image belowEvery halving has been front-run by significant price increases. This is likely due to the supply and demand effect. As more people realize that the Bitcoin halving is coming the more Bitcoin is bought, which raises the price of the asset due to higher demand. After Bitcoin halvings have occurred, the price of the asset has gone up even more dramatically in general.We are currently about five months away from the beginning of April and we've seen a very significant price increase over the past few months. Since its January lows Bitcoin has doubled and since the end of September the Bitcoin price has increased by around 35  with steep increases in the past few days.Although Bitcoin halvings in the past have historically always correlated with increases in the Bitcoin price, there is no rule that this has to be the case. One risk with looking at the historical price action of Bitcoin is that the digital currency really doesn't have a long history. Since its inception, Bitcoin has only halved three times. Why will this time be the sameThere are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs pending application   The applications are from Grayscale, 21Shares   Ark, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree  WT , Invesco  IVZ , Galaxy, Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X, Hashdex and Franklin  . These spot ETFs generally imply that investors will be able to take part in Bitcoin's price development without buying Bitcoin directly. Hence, we can think of these brokerages investment firms as distribution channels for Bitcoin. The more distribution channels Bitcoin has, the more consumers will be able to gain easy access to the digital asset. This will clearly increase the demand for Bitcoin.In fact, Galaxy estimated in a research report that inflows into a Bitcoin  ETF  could amount to  14 billion in year one,  27 billion in year two, and  39 billion in year three. Given the huge asset management industry, it is likely that asset managers begin suggesting customers allocate a small portion of their wealth into this quickly growing  digital gold .If we build upon Galaxy's logic quickly  12 spot ETFs with  14 billion in inflows in year one would result in total inflows of  168 billion during the first year. Galaxy found that the amount of Bitcoin held under management on September 30th was  21.7 billion, or 4.3  of the current supply at the time. If Galaxy's calculations are correct, the ETF adoption would imply an almost 8x increase in the amount of Bitcoin held under management with regard to monetary value. Personally, I believe that this could be a little bit of a stretch target, which the research report also admits   if Bitcoin spot ETF approvals are delayed or denied, our analysis would be altered by timing and access restriction. Or if poor price performance, or any other factor, leads to lower-than-expected access or adoption to a bitcoin ETF, our estimates could prove too aggressive.Insofar, the SEC has not accepted any of the spot Bitcoin ETFs which means that much of the Bitcoin price increase could be built upon a false sense of hope. The SEC still hasn't approved anything  citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud  . On top of this, the greed index which was mentioned in a recent Seeking Alpha news article suggests that the greed of Bitcoin-buying has reached the highest point since November 2021 .Based on the discussion of each of the three catalysts above, we can presume that if all of the catalysts fall in place around the same time, Bitcoin prices will receive strong momentum. This will likely not be the case for the utility catalyst for Bitcoin since I believe this is a long-term development that we may see as Bitcoin becomes more  built into  offerings at existing companies. However, the Bitcoin halving is certain. This catalyst is likely the strongest since it has historically always meant that Bitcoin prices will rise. If the halving event is coupled with the regulatory acceptance of spot ETFs, demand would increase  potentially by a lot as claimed by Galaxy  and the rate of supply will contract causing the price to increase.In all, I remain just as bullish on Bitcoin as a long-term investment as I did during the summer when I published my first article on the digital asset. As opposed to then, halving is nearly in sight, and the general reception of potential spot Bitcoin ETFs has been really positive. To me, these are signals that indicate that Bitcoin can continue rising, but the uncertainty of whether spot ETFs are accepted or not makes this catalyst relatively weak on its own. My belief, however, is that asset management firms are doing everything they can to influence the acceptance of these ETFs as it would give the institutions more money and a potentially broader customer base. For these reasons I rate Bitcoin a buy as a long-term investment with both short and long term catalysts on the horizon.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,"First and foremost, the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination. This article is not about politics, and it will not focus on what's right or wrong. Instead, we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent, as of this writing, are up  3 , with WTI  trading above  85 and Brent above  87. Initially, at the close of Friday, WSJ published a report noting that the U.S. is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high. Soon after, Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. If you want to thoroughly review the events, Some of you may wonder, what does this have to do with oil  Historically speaking, geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions. In this case, Israel is not a major oil producer, so what's the catch  The catch, in our view, has to do with Iran's potential involvement in this whole ordeal. WSJ published a piece noting that Iran's senior officials helped plan this attack months ago.While the U.S. has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet, it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on Iran.For starters, we need context to what we are writing. In June,  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market. Since then, IEA has confirmed via its figures that Iran's oil production is close to  3.1 million b d. Our supply   demand model assumes  3.3 million b d, and official Iranian figures support that production is around  3.3 million b d.Putting all of this together, Iran is exporting close to  2 million b d. Visible tanker exports account for  1.5 to  1.6 million b d, while shadow exports account for  400k b d.Since H2 2022, the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports. As we wrote earlier in the year, this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storage.With floating storage gone and crude exports back to  2 million b d  500 to  800k b d below the previous peak , what's the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward  Perhaps the U.S. does nothing and leaves Iran as is, but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view, while the risk of a major loss is low, we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months. We think the average would fall from  2 million b d to  1.6 million b d. In terms of visible tankers, this means Iran's crude exports would drop closer to  1.2 million b d.While it won't be much of a decline, it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into year-end and possibly well into H1 2024.Looking at our latest supply   demand update, we made a few important assumption changesIn essence, global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by month-end. And if the U.S. starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports, then our balance could surprise to the upside. But with a deficit of  2.2 million b d, the lack of production decline from Iran won't make that much of a difference, either.On the other hand, with no mega deal on the horizon  between Israel and Saudi , the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases. Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis won't be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least  110 bbl. With Brent trading at  87, we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a reality.In conclusion, global oil inventories should accelerate downward. But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession. Fund flows will ebb and flow, so oil prices won't skyrocket anytime soon. Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception. Until then, we see prices grinding higher, with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levels.For readers looking to add energy stocks, Q4 will provide ample opportunities. We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil. Consolidation and M A are heating up, so you will see more and more mergers announced. But more importantly, always remember that with these oil prices, the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist. Please be patient, fundamentals are on your side.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, .  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks.

Sibanye Stillwater Hopes To Offer A Metal Mosaic,"Sibanye Stillwater  is a South African metals company with hopes of significant expansion in the next 5 years. Through investment in both recycling and production initiatives globally, SBSW hopes to become a linchpin in the global metals market.Given its rising demand, significant investments in battery metals, especially Lithium, are critical for future growth. While electric vehicles are gaining popularity, a mix, including hybrids, will dominate the next decade, still providing tailwinds to PGM recycling and PGM mining businesses. SBSW will spend an estimated  500 million in FY23 on these expansion initiatives.Despite the challenges faced by SBSW in the short term, the company shows promising potential for long-term growth.EFV  Estimated Fair Value    E24 EPS  Earnings Per Share  times PE  Price EPSEFV   E24 EPS X P E    1.0 X 9.7   9.70P 2E PGM, containing Pt  Platinum  and Pd  Palladium , 3PGM contains Pt  Platinum  Pd  Palladium  and Rhodium  Rd . 3E is 2E plus gold. 4E is 3PGM plus gold.PGMs are not rare-earth metals, but are critical in numerous industrial components, particularly in the hydrogen and emissions management space. While fully-electric battery EVs receive the most attention, a mix of EVs, including hybrids, are needed to fulfil demand within the next decade. Light vehicle production climbs to 82.5 million units per year in FY23. The PGM market is expected to see significant demand recovery linked with the Chinese auto sales rebound expected in FY23. still originate from Russia, and there is still some uncertainty about Russia's place in the global economy. While much of Russia's PGM capacity remains unsanctioned, that could change and further affect the supply and demand dynamics of the market.American PGM operations are still ramping up, with SBSW ramping production to 700koz of 2E PGM by 2027. Short-term sustaining costs have surged amid regional flooding and a shaft collapse which caused a work stoppage, which will resume in 2H23. SBSW states this is temporary and expects leveling off of AISC by FY26 of under  990 oz. SBSW expects the American PGM segment to return to full profitability in late FY23 or in FY24 when all in sustaining costs return to normalized levels.The South African PGM operation is the largest segment by revenue and is considered mature. Currently, the segment has 4 active mines and 3 exploration operations. Expansion in this segment includes the K4 expansion to Marikana, South Africa facility. This will add 50 years of output, at an estimated 250koz per year, once full capacity is reached in FY29.SBSW PGM cost relative to peers. SBSW is highlighted in Blue.Before the acquisition of Stillwater, Sibanye was an exclusive gold producer. SBSW still seeks to streamline its operations in this area, acquiring a controlling stake in DRDGOLD   a tailings management company. SBSW will close underperforming mines to reduce capital costs and make room for new greenfield expansion. After FY23, SBSW expects the capital requirements to significantly decrease for the Gold segment, amounting to  54.7 million annually in savings due to these streamlining actions.Gold production for FY23 is expected to produce 756-788koz at an all-in sustaining cost of  1826 oz. The average realized price for 2Q23 for gold was  1864 oz.Expansion in this area is the Burnstone project, believed to be able to output 141koz per year at full capacity in FY25. Existing local infrastructure significantly reduces startup costs, with the first production output expected in 2H23. DRDGOLD is a tailings management company recovering residue metals from waste from the mine. It has a far lower sustaining cost of  1,528 oz with an annual output of 179koz. This portfolio addition could increase cash flow by  55 million per year at full production capacity in FY25.The battery metals segment encompasses Nickel, Copper, and Lithium operations. SBSW seeks to create a raw materials presence closest to regional United States and Europe ecosystems.In Finland, a concentrated 7 mine facility has been approved for mining and broke ground in March of FY23. SBSW has a 79  controlling interest in the operation and hopes to achieve 15,000 metric tons annually in FY25. The facility is concentrated on a deposit of Lithium Hydroxide which demands a price premium compared to Lithium Carbonate. The reason is extracting and refining Lithium Hydroxide is much more expensive. The current price assumption for the 15-year life of the mine is  26,034 per metric ton, with an average operating cost of  7,423 per metric ton in all in sustaining costs. Total capital expenditure, less sustaining capital, is expected to be  650 million. This has the chance to be a highly profitable venture in a strategic area close to numerous battery factories in Europe.The Sandouville Nickel Refinery was acquired with 100  controlling interest in FY22. The facility is designed to refine 16,000 tons of nickel and 600 tons of Cobalt. This location is strategically close to a site set to be France's first gigafactory, built and operated by Verkor in a partnership with Renault. SBSW invested  27.5 million in the gigafactory as well.Rhyolite Ridge in the United States is a lithium-boron project in Nevada. The project has a nameplate capacity of 22,000 metric tons annually, assuming an average price of  13,000 per metric ton for Lithium and  710 per metric ton for Boron. SBSW has pledged to contribute funding in exchange for 50  interest conditional to permitting approval. The permitting environment for lithium exploration has become more favorable in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, with the Department of Energy offering a loan of  700 million. The project has attracted large names, including the Toyota and Panasonic JV, Ford, and South Korean battery maker Eco Pro. Ford has committed to take 35  of production from FY25-FY30.The top two risks facing SBSW in the short term are labor disputes and South African power infrastructure.Numerous disruptions in FY22 caused by South African workers protesting poor working conditions and low wages. While these have settled, SBSW could be at risk of disruption again once the contract is up for renegotiation in FY25.The South African power company ESKOM has been plagued with fuel supply problems, sabotage, and aging components. This has caused them to embark on a program of  load shedding,  turning off power after peak hours. Mining, smelting, and refining consume roughly 30  of ESKOM's net power output. Thus, ESKOM, on top of load shedding, has increased power prices by 20 . In the medium term, ESKOM will remain a primary power supplier to the SA Mining segments. ESKOM expects load shedding to ramp up through FY23, which could result in 15  production losses. At the end of FY24, SBSW expects enough private-sector electricity generation to eliminate load shedding for the mining industry. To this effect, SBSW has acquired the largest solar farm in South Africa, set to enter initial production in FY25 with 89MW in nameplate capacity.Underpinning these is ongoing political instability in South Africa. While SBSW is quickly diversifying out of South Africa, it is still a South African company. We will likely see some form of price action after the .Lithium demand will grow by . There will be a 55  gap between supply and demand for Lithium at the current global capacity. The story is similar but not as grim for nickel, with an 8  gap between supply and demand. This fact will put upward pressure on the prices of nickel and Lithium as the decade continues. Additionally, PGM metals in use with existing non-battery EVs and traditional ICE vehicles will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Even at an aggressive growth assumption, EVs of all types are not expected to pass 40  market share Despite lower-than-expected output in FY22 and 1H23, the foundations for significant long-term growth are in place. SBSW has a very strong balance sheet, with only a reported 0.14x debt to adjusted EBITDA and around  630 million in free cash flow. Additionally, it pays out a sector high 8.54  yield targeting 35  of earnings paid out to shareholders.SBSW is undergoing a transformative effort to broaden global holdings and cut stalling operations. For this reason, we think it is attractive at its current price for the dividend investors.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy The Big Dip In The Utility Sector With 9.8% Yield: UTF,"Have you ever heard the saying,  all theories are great... in theory  The truth is that most theories or ideas rarely play out as pre-planned or expected. The cold harshness of reality can wreak havocMovements in the stock market can be viewed as a series of competing theories or ideas that collide around companies or sectors. Some view bond alternatives as terrible investments when rates rise, while others view them as excellent companies now trading at more attractive prices - perspectives and theories crashing into each other.The reality is that an excellently run company can rapidly see its price decline due to no other fact than investors with a herd mentality following a popular theory or viewpoint.The utility sector has been hit hard recently, crashingWe've already seen several utility names adjust their growth outlooks due to higher costs of capital. Infrastructure is often expensive to build, and building new infrastructure is usually funded in large part by debt. Almost any infrastructure investment can be characterized as providing a large amount of upfront capital and then collecting a very long-term income stream. Higher interest rates make building new infrastructure less appealing, so less is built.Meanwhile, higher interest rates also impact the present value of existing income streams. Investing  100 million to receive  7 million year for decades sounded like a great deal just two years ago. Today, it isn't because interest rates are higher.So, I won't call the market crazy for selling utilities in the near term. Growth is going to be slower, and the cost of capital is making it difficult for utilities to grow while making the present value of future cash flows lower.I will say it is very short-sighted. There are two sides to every economic transaction - supply and demand. One party provides something, and another wants something. The price of the transaction is determined by the interaction between the two. What happens if utilities slow expansion  There is less electricity, and the supply is lower. Is demand going to decline as well  Not likely. Whether interest rates are 1 , 5 , 10 , or 30 , living without electricity is not a solution that many are likely to pursue. Economics 101  What happens when supply is low and demand is high  Prices go up. Rising prices are good for those who are on the supply side of the equation.We can already see this with oil companies. Oil prices are more reactive to supply changes, which is why oil companies are doing very well despite higher capital costs while other utilities have been struggling.The price of electricity is going up. And as the expansion of electric supply slows down, it is only going to go higher. When gas prices go up, you see it at the pump fairly quickly, and it is very common to see the price of gas at your favored station change daily. Electric companies generally are not allowed to increase prices month to month. Your bill will vary primarily based on how much electricity you consume monthly. In most jurisdictions, prices will be raised  or lowered  once a year with government approval. As with all bureaucratic processes, it takes time  the authorities will often push back against the raises requested, but eventually, nobody can fight the economic reality of supply and demand. Attempts to do so lead to unpleasant things like rolling brownouts.Infrastructure investments like electric companies have been dealing with pressures from higher rates and delays from benefiting from inflation, and the supply demand balance is looking very favorable for them. , yielding 10 , is one great option to invest in today.  holds a portfolio that is 33  electric, 11  midstream, along with a host of other infrastructure-style investments like toll roads, freight rails, gas distribution, cell towers, airports, etc. These are the things that we take for granted when living in first-world countries. They make our daily lives possible, and we sure would notice if they disappearedLike some other Cohen   Steers funds, UTF made the wise decision to implement interest rate swaps - fixing 85  of its leverage at an average rate of only 1.8 .Infrastructure investments are down, but they aren't out. They will continue to be great sources of cash flow and an essential part of our daily lives. UTF is well-positioned to ride out this turbulence while paying out a hefty dividend.Investors have many different avenues that they can use to benefit from utilities or infrastructure being sold off due to high interest rates. If you're an investor who does not want to have to play the game of figuring out which specific company to hold or which will be the best to see the strongest recovery, one fantastic option is UTF  Not only do you receive monthly dividends that give an annual yield of 9.8 , but you're also exposed to a number of companies that are heavily oversold, as well as gaining access to a fantastic management team that has a history of routinely raising the fund's dividends because they are out earning what they're paying. This is a definitive win-win for investors.When it comes to your retirement, there are not going to be many things in your life that are automatically paying you more each year. Many of your bills are going to expect you to pay them more every single year. Your Social Security will typically have an annual cost of living adjustment designed to only help you keep pace with inflation, but not to help you get ahead. Having a portfolio filled with income investments that are providing you with outstanding income and giving you the ability to reinvest some of that income back into your portfolio to see additional growth is going to be what allows you to continue to see wealth development even in your twilight years.Retirement isn't the sound of a funeral dirge. It should be a sound celebration  The sound of celebration is as unique as the situation. Whether it's spending extra time with loved ones, jumping in a truck hauling a 5th wheel trailer and being able to see all the beauty that the world has to offer, or simply staying at home with a crackling fireplace, enjoying a cup of tea and reminiscing with friends and family - whatever a beautiful and satisfying retirement looks like to you, it's possible if you have the financial security that's provided by owning dozens of different income-producing holdings.That's the beauty of my Income Method.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Hasn't Been This Attractive Since The Great Financial Crisis,"It's time to talk about one of my favorite agriculture stocks  Archer-Daniels-Midland . The company, which just reported its quarterly numbers, is doing extremely well. It benefits from multiple industry tailwinds, including strong secular growth in biofuels.In thisSo, let's get to itRoughly a month ago, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I highlighted the company's massive footprint in the agriculture industry.Listed in 1924, the company has roughly 750 facilities and 42,000 employees that manage 440 crop procurement locations, allowing sellers and buyers in the agriculture industryAs shown in the overview, the company connects buyers and sellers and produces essential products for most food items sold in grocery stores.This includes oilseeds and carbohydrate solutions, which account for the biggest part of the company's revenue.In the United States, Archer-Daniels-Midland is the third-largest producer of ethanol, according to .With this in mind, earlier this week, major European bank ING  that this industry is in a very good position.The bank believes that the biofuel industry in the United States is poised for substantial growth, driven by evolving supply and demand dynamics primarily shaped by government policies.As one can imagine, this development is of particular importance to American farmers and biofuel producers, who are witnessing a surge in the demand for agricultural feedstocks in the biofuel sector.As biofuels replace conventional fossil fuels in transportation and aviation, various biobased feedstocks, including agricultural crops and animal-derived products, are becoming critical for achieving sustainability goals and net-zero emissions by 2050.Like many people, I am not a fan of using  food  to produce fuel, but in light of global energy policies, my opinion doesn't matter.Furthermore, while corn-based ethanol initially gained momentum due to Renewable Fuel Standards  RFS  and Low-Carbon Fuel Standards  LCFS  in the mid-2000s, there is now a remarkable shift towards alternative feedstocks, driven by the growth of renewable diesel production.Meanwhile, increased refining capacity has led to rising demand for animal fats and used cooking oil, as well as soybean and canola oil, further used in renewable diesel.This shift has even led to renewable diesel production surpassing biodiesel production in 2023.Adding to that, the new Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  provides tax credits to the biofuels industry, extending existing credits for biodiesel and introducing new credits for sustainable aviation fuels.In this light, during last year's JP Morgan All-Stars Conference, the company noted that it has benefited from robust demand in biofuels, with strong biodiesel margins, high demand for ethanol, and increased use of soybean oil in green diesel plants, which confirms the trends noticed by ING.The company also mentioned the start-up of a new soybean crushing plant in North Dakota, which will add 1.5 million tons of capacity, focusing on low-carbon intensity feedstocks.Furthermore, the company is actively working on decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and sequestration expansions and agreements with partners like Warwick Carbon Solutions to provide low-carbon emissions power.In the third quarter, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of  1.63, accompanied by an adjusted segment operating profit of  1.5 billion.Notably, this quarter's results contributed to an outstanding year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of  5.62, making it the second-best EPS year in the first nine monthsAdditionally, ADM's trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital stood at 13.2 , which reflects the company's consistent strength in this environment.ADM also acknowledged the dynamic nature of the global market, where opportunities and challenges coexist, which makes it challenging for traders and investors.Consumer behavior trends vary across categories, impacting spending.Issues also include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and fluctuating commodity supply and demand.Despite these challenges, ADM continues to build on the momentum achieved year-to-date, with plans to surpass its 2023 expectations for the total company.With that in mind, ADM's different business units showed robust performance in light of both tailwinds and headwinds.During its earnings call, the company emphasized that its competitive advantage lies in its broad and integrated business model that spans from farm to fork, which is something I already briefly mentioned.In 2023, ADM capitalized on its extensive global origination network, partnering with farmers worldwide to offer traceable, sustainable crop sources for customers like PepsiCo , Nestle, and Carlsberg.The company aims to enroll 4 million regenerative acres by 2025, equivalent to powering over 100,000 homes annually.ADM is prepared to meet the demand for renewable fuel with initiatives like Spiritwood JV and Broadwind Energy project, contributing to lower carbon emissions and the need for  greener  fuels.The company also has a robust balance sheet with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9x, which provides them with financial flexibility to drive their long-term strategic agenda and return capital to shareholders.It enjoys a credit rating of  A .ADM has raised its 2023 earnings outlook and anticipates full-year EPS in excess of  7 per share.Based on that context, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently pays a  0.45 per share per quarter dividend. This translates to  1.80 per year. It implies a 26  2023E earnings payout ratio, which is extremely healthy.The dividend yield is 2.5 .ADM is attractively valued. As we can see in the FAST Graphs chart below, the normalized P E ratio is 14.6x, which has been a steady guide for the company for the past few decades.Now, the company is trading at 9.5x earnings. That's the lowest valuation since the great financial crisis.Even if earnings moderate in the next few years  analysts expect mild contraction after three stellar years , the stock is significantly undervalued.A return to its normal valuation could technically result in 18  annual returns through 2025.The current consensus price target is  97, which is 38  above the current price.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. I believe that ADM has a fair value between  100 and  110, which I expect the company to reach over the next three to four years.Archer-Daniels-Midland is standing strong as a promising investment in the agriculture sector. The booming biofuel industry, supported by evolving government policies, presents a significant growth opportunity for ADM.Their diversified business model has enabled them to weather market challenges and capitalize on global demand for sustainable crop sources.ADM's strong financial performance, improved earnings outlook, and healthy dividend payout ratio make it an attractive investment. With its current undervaluation and a potential return to normal valuation, ADM could offer investors an 18  annual return through 2025.Hence, I maintain my belief in ADM's fair value between  100 and  110, which I anticipate the company achieving in the next three to four years.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

The Most Common Misconception About REIT Investing In This Environment,"As many of my readers have probably noticed, lately, I have paid a very close attention to the REIT balance sheets and debt financing structures.I think that restrictive interest rates for a long period of timeEveryone who has invested a bit of his or her time into exploring how equity REITs work, understands that the chances of finding the next Nvidia or Apple by picking any REIT out there are extremely slim.Instead, REIT-focused investors can play a more balanced and predictable game, which is underpinned by to a large extent a predictable business model and cash generation profile.REITs per definition  regulation  have to devise a  buy and hold  strategy, where a notable portion of the collected cash flows  rents or leases  have to be regularly distributed to the shareholders.The main ways how REITs can increase the cash flows are the followingBesides increasing the rents   leases organically or conducting non-core activities such as positive debt refinancing, the key essence of REIT business is to capture a positive spread between asset  or investment  IRR and the cost of capital.If the spread widens, REITs are deep in the money.If the spread remains stable, REITs deliver stable and positive results.If the spread decreases, REITs fall.Since the early 2022, the overall cost of financing has gradually increased, sending the broader REIT index in a negative return territory.One might argue that this decline is mostly explained by the struggling office sector and if the office segment was excluded, the remaining REIT space would be in a nice position relative to the early 2022.Well, not exactly right. In the chart above, we can see some of the most popular REITs operating outside of the realm of office segment, and that have still delivered returns, which are significantly below the S P 500.All in all, the key message here is that REITs are extremely sensitive to the changes in the interest rate levels, as any movement in the cost of capital makes a huge impact on the underlying cash generation profile.In most of my recent articles, I have incorporated a huge skew towards assessing the potential implications of higher cost of capital.Why  Because I think that the  higher for longer  scenario and higher interest rates in general embody a significant potential to destroy huge chunks of FFO for many REITs out there.The following are the main avenues through which this risk is most likely set to render a painful impactOtherwise, at this stage, REITs are protected from additional headwinds that are associated with higher cost of capital as the effects from unhedged floating debt instruments have already been reflected in the latest financials.In my view, refinancings at higher interest rates is the most critical issue.Let me depict the  via one very common REIT  Realty Income Corporation .Currently, O has around  6.5 billion of debt  excluding the floating portion and the assumption of organic dept repayment  that has to be refinanced by 2026.As of Q2, 2023, O had a weighted average cost of financing at 3.7 , which is considerably below the market level financing cost.Looking at the prevailing YTM of some of the O's outstanding bonds, we get an average cost of financing around 6.4   72  of an increase .If we assign the prevailing cost of financing level to the maturing debt proceeds until 2026  i.e., reprice according to the market level , O's FFO would decrease by    175 million or by 6  taking TTM FFO as a basis. This, in turn, would send the FFO payout ratio higher to 80  level.If we take a more extreme scenario and reprice all of the remaining  12 billion to the 6.4  interest rate level, the effects would be very severe, impairing O's long-term growth prospects. In other words, completely justifying the recent price decline.Remember that via this example we see the potential consequences for a REIT, which has an upper investment grade credit rating, relatively well-laddered debt maturity profile, and a significant scale, which introduces flexibility in the financing processes. For many REITs the debt situation looks much worse.Finally, we come to the point, where I want to emphasize a very popular misconception in the context of REITs and the potential consequences of higher interest rates.The challenge stems from the misunderstanding of the rate of change effects. More specifically, many REIT investors carry a concept that REITs are a natural hedge of the inflation due to the rents   leases that adjust to the inflation levels accordingly.This coupled with the generally correct fact that many REITs exhibit favourable supply and demand dynamics - especially now when building new supply has become very expensive - leads to an opinion that the growing interest costs will be easily offset by a synchronized movement in the top line.As a result, many REIT investors have become overly complacent and do not fully appreciate the potential consequences.Now, my argument is that while all this is correct, it does not really move the needle in the context of surging interest expenses.Since the early 2022, O has managed to deliver a superb growth in its top-line, registering a couple of very strong quarterly results. In total, from Q1, 2022 to Q2, 2023, O's operating income grew by  34 . And for all of the reasons many REIT investors mention - e.g., embedded rent escalators, which kick in nicely during inflationary period and favourable supply and demand dynamics.However, despite the solid growth numbers, the share of the interest expense component relative to the operating income has become larger. And now let me remind you that the current cost of debt sitting in O's books is still nowhere near the market level and that during most of these quarters the interest rates were actually much lower than we currently have given that the Fed was still in the aggressive hiking process.To contrast O, which is an A-rated REIT with a smaller REIT, which has not an IG balance sheet, I have taken the Global Medical REIT  as an example.As we can see, the higher interest costs have consumed a significant portion of GMRE's operating income, despite the fact that the Company has embedded rent escalators for almost all of its contracts. Moreover, GMRE operates on a net lease basis just as O, which protects the earnings from other inflationary costs.Both in O and GMRE's case, the occupancy levels have remained robust  at their peaks  and there have been successful increases in the top-line. Yet, both companies have still significantly lower cost of financing recorded at their books currently, and first notable maturities are slowly but surely approach their deadlines.I recommend REIT investors to revisit the theoretically correct yet practically insignificant thesis that rent   lease indexation to inflation or rent increases in general serve as meaningful mitigates to the  higher for longer  scenario for REITs. Mathematically and based on the actual results, organic growth in rents or leases is not sufficient to protect many REITs from a gradual convergence to higher cost of capital and the resulting consequences.

"Forget The Hype, W. P. Carey Is An Absolute Bargain","Rising interest rates are a phenomenon remembered by few market participants--the last time interest rates experienced sustained upward momentum was 40 years ago. The subsequent reduction of interest rates after the U.S. inflationary crisis of the 1970sREITs, along with other capital and debt-intensive industries, were primary beneficiaries of this long-term trend, and have thusly been slapped in the proverbial face as interest rates rise. The office sector has been doubly slapped by rising interest rates and the COVID pandemic, which ushered in remote and hybrid work en masse. The sector has yet to recover to even a fraction of its pre-pandemic highs, and is now faced with the daunting prospect ofUnderstanding the direness of the situation, management at W. P. Carey  announced in September 2023 that the company would .The method of the spinoff is the main contention here, as many  have . Essentially, W. P. Carey management did two thingsThe first point here seems to be the cardinal sin. As  in his recent article on W. P. CareyThis, we think, is true when placed in the proper context, which is the interest rate discussion we started this article with.Yes--dividend cutters did not prosper in a falling rate environment. That only makes sense, right  After all, if you're cutting your payout as your cost of capital is falling, then the overwhelming likelihood is that your business is suffering. Cutting payouts in a  interest rate environment is a very different animal and, we would contend, a sign of prudent management.Others have also pointed out what W. P. Carey did not slash its dividend in the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, a line of reasoning intended to invoke in the reader a thought of  wow, things must  be bad, then.  In our view, this thinking is flawed. The GFC, as painful as it was and despite what our collective memories may tell us, did not have the same devastating force as the Great Depression, and active government intervention shielded many industries and companies from massive amounts of pain. Additionally, the GFC did not affect all asset classes equally, and, lastly, rates fell overall during the GFC, enabling companies to roll debt at even cheaper prices.In response to a question about the dividend on  to address the office spinoff, CFO Toni Ann Sanzone had this to saySo, yes, while dividend cuts are generally bad news, we think the rationale from management makes sense, especially in the long run.The second issue--that the company's spin-off would be meant to simply sell its assets over time--seems to us to just be an admission of reality on the part of management. The market for office space is unlikely to return to equilibrium anytime soon due to a massive imbalance of supply and demand. What, we ask, would you rather have in this situation  A lame-duck child company that limps along, in constant need of attention and funding, or a company designed to sell the assets and close up shop once the maximum amount of capital has been collected for investorsWe think the latter is a far better option.Now, we don't think the analysis conducted on this site regarding W. P. Carey is , in the sense that long-term investors have every right to feel as jilted as they do. The stock has performed poorly, after all, and it is only natural that the office spinoff and dividend target reduction would feel like a rug-pull. Thus, today's levels for sure represent an inflection point for long-term holders of W. P. Carey.For new investors, however, we think the opportunity may be quite enticing.First, an historic discrepancy has emerged between the company's stock price and its forward EBITDA estimates. For most of the last 10 years  minus the start of the COVID pandemic , W. P. Carey's stock traded well above its forward EBITDA expectations. Since the start of 2023, the stock has endured a precipitous decline while forward EBITDA estimates have moderately .  The most recent drop in EBITDA estimates appears to reflect the spinoff.The popular narrative surrounding W. P. Carey--that the company is slow-to-no-growth and that the primary reason for wanting to own it is for its dividend--also doesn't appear to hold up particularly well.Over the last five years the company has generated a 14.3  CAGR on sales. While, yes, this number is below best-in-class Realty Income  and slightly worse than STAG Industrial , it is also not insignificant and has been on the upswing.Perhaps more importantly for those with a long term perspective, W. P. Carey has managed to produce a better return on capital for its shareholders, coming in at 3.2  for the latest quarter, a full 113 basis points above Realty Income's quarterly ROC.Lastly, , the stock is attractive on a forward P FFO and P AFFO basis. The stock currently trades hands at 9.79x P FFO and 10.22x P AFFO, which is 7  and 21  lower than the current sector median. This, we think, is a reflection of the negative sentiment swirling around the stock.Year to date, W. P. Carey has been a disappointment for shareholders, delivering a 27  negative total return. While we understand why long-term holders of the stock may no longer find the story appealing, we think that newcomers to the company are likely to find a lot to like in the current valuation and outlook for the company post-spinoff.

Vonovia Is Likely To Benefit From Undersupply In Germany,"Dear readers,  is one of my favorite stocks to write about and one that occupies the biggest position in my real estate   REIT portfolio. I've studied the stock quite extensively over the pastMost recently I shared an update following Vonovia's Q2 2023 earnings - , reiterating my BUY rating at EUR 22 per share for the native shares  ticker VNA .I'm now more than 20  in profit  excl. dividends  on my position with a break-even under EUR 18 per share with no intention to sell before my EUR 40 price target. That leaves 80  of upside to a price target, which really is quite conservative, making Vonovia a worthwhile investment even at today's prices.I think that the one thing that often keeps people from investing in Vonovia is lack of knowledge of the local German market. The focus here is on the supply and demand dynamics and especially on rent regulation, which I believe is a key piece of the puzzle here.Today I want to show you why I have  that Germany will experience substantial under-supply of housing over the next 5 years which will inevitably benefit Vonovia and other residential landlords.Just as any other market in the world, the German residential market is driven by supply and demand  with a sparkle of regulation  over the long term.Let's start with supply of new apartments. There's only one reason why developers build new housing - to make money. When input construction and energy costs increase, developers are faced with a choice. They can try to pass through these input cost increases onto the final customers by increasing the sale prices or they can halt their development plans.In tough economic conditions with high inflation and a weakening consumer, it's quite unlikely that new apartments would sell at higher prices. In fact, housing prices have already started coming down from their peak in early 2022.Faced with no other choice, this has led many developers to postpone their construction plans which has led to a significant drop in the number of issued building permits  one of the best proxies for future new supply .Note that the data below is monthly, so in normal years about 300,0000 units are permitted per year. This year that number is likely to be below 250,000 and unless the economy improves drastically, I expect no more than 200,000 permitted units in 2024.The result is that only about 250,000 new units are expected to be delivered to the market this year. In the following years, this number may fall somewhat lower before recovering closer to the 300,000 unit long-term average. But even 300,000 units per year isn't nearly enough to cover the demand which is expected at 500-700 thousand units per yearThat may seem like a high number so let's break it down.Demand for housing is first and foremost driven by population growth. The natural population in Germany has been declining for a long time, but immigration has been high and has resulted in a 0.4  annual population growth over the last 10 years. Recently, this growth has been accelerated by  the government passing immigration reform laws in an effort to increase immigration to fight labor shortages and especially by  the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has resulted in unprecedented 1.3  population growth in 2022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 022. Going forward the population is expected to grow by 0.5-0.6  per year.On top of population growth, there are two trends worth mentioning. Firstly, urbanization which isn't stopping any time soon and is likely to disproportionately benefit Vonovia whose portfolio is located primarily in places that are seeing population growth. Secondly, the downsizing of households. Back in 2011, there were on average 2 people in every household. That number has dropped to 1.94 today and is expected to decline further to 1.89 by 2035, adding additional 0.2  of demand per year.Between population growth and these trends, it is estimated that demand for housing will average 500-700 ths. units per year which is a far cry from what will be constructed. And because you cannot simply pull new apartments out of a hat,  for the foreseeable future and will only be magnified if the ruling party manages to pass  for more stringent rent regulation which would only discourage more developers.What does all this mean for VonoviaFirstly, as the housing shortage keeps prices high a large portion of the German population will rent out of necessity which is likely to result in ongoing near perfect occupancy of 98 . Secondly, with fewer apartments on the market, existing real estate will be more valuable leading to higher prices which should help get the stock closer to its NAV of EUR 40 .In the short-term the stock price will continue to be driven by interest rates expectations and sentiment. But over the long term the value of the company's assets acts as a very strong magnet and the valuation will eventually reflect this. Severe undersupply is one of the key reasons why I don't mind being overweight Vonovia at these depressed levels and reiterate my BUY rating for the stock.Stay tuned for an update of my cash flow model following Q3 earnings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Buy REITs Before Everyone Else Does,"A fundamental truism of investing in stocks is that capturing maximal gains from an investment requires buying it  the crowd does.Ideally, an investor would buy a full position in a stock when it's down, then other investors will gradually orThat sounds nice , but in reality, human psychology often gets in the way. We are tribal creatures, and going against the tribe in hopes that they will follow feels uncomfortable and unnatural. In most areas of life, it doesn't make sense to go against the crowd. That's why, for most of us, investing is a learned skill instead of an innate talent.I would argue that income-oriented investors and dividend growth investors have a rare opportunity right now to buy ahead of the crowd. That opportunity is in realThere has been a  35  drop in the REIT index, measured below by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF , since the beginning of 2022This selloff has been inversely correlated with the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield, which has soared over that time period.REITs are than just bond alternatives. Unlike bonds, REITs offer inflation protection from property value appreciation and rent growth, which generally flow into rising dividends. But, despite my  to the contrary, the market still treats them like bond proxies, as exemplified by the tight, inverse correlation between REIT stock prices and bond yields, as seen above.In what follows, I'm going to argue that interest rates have or are very close to peaking, that the Fed is done with the current hiking cycle, that interest rates are likely to come down in 2024, and that this will be the catalyst for REITs to shift from  to .There are multiple reasons why Treasury yields have surged so much, such as government deficit spending and fading demand from foreign buyers, but I would argue the primary catalyst for rising rates is the Federal Reserve.Since April 2022, the Fed has dumped over  1 trillion of debt securities, most of which were Treasuries, off its balance sheet. That has created artificially high supply of Treasuries as rates have risen, just as the Fed's asset buying program created artificial  for Treasuries when rates were low and or falling.Plus, demand for Treasuries is driven largely by what the Fed  doing and  of what the Fed is  with the Fed Funds Rate. The coordinated  higher for longer  narrative from Fed officials in recent months has done exactly what it was intended to do  cause long-term interest rates to rise.The Fed thinks this will help anchor inflation back at its 2  target rate. I think this move will end up doing more harm than good.The fact of the matter is that .The market briefly panicked over the  hotter than expected  inflation data in the September reading. But the 3.7  headline CPI rate is only that high because of the shelter component, which lags real-time changes in rents by about a year.Compare the YoY growth in US shelter CPI  gold line below  to the Zillow Rent Index  red lineIn September, shelter CPI still showed 7.1  YoY growth, but we know from Zillow that actual YoY rent growth was only 3.2 .Apartment List's latest  shows an even lower rent growth metric of -1.2  for SeptemberThe same story holds true for home prices. Using  most recent data from July 2023, median home listing prices  0.9 , while the S P Case-Shiller index showed a 1.0  YoY gain.However you measure real-time housing cost changes,  shelter inflation is far below the 7.1  YoY rate reported in the CPI.And the shelter component of headline CPI represents about 35  of the overall index. Thus, about 2.5 percentage points of the 3.7  CPI rate came from this inaccurate shelter input.What was the CPI rate in September if you exclude this lagging shelter component  Answer  1.99 .The biggest reason there has been a slight bounce in CPI ex shelter since June is the rebound in oil prices, but even this appears to be temporary. Recently, the International Energy Agency  that oil prices near  100 caused meaningful demand destruction, hence the stagnant price now in the  80s.If instead of the CPI's inaccurate 7.1  YoY growth in shelter costs you used Zillow's 3.2  YoY rent growth number, headline CPI would be 2.4 .If you used Apartment List's -1.2  number, you would get a headline CPI reading of 0.9  for September.Inflation has already been whipped. It's just a matter of time before it shows up in the official data and the Fed acknowledges it.Both the forward SOFR curve and the Fed's dot plot shows interest rates on the short end coming down slowly next year. I think the drop in interest rates will be much faster and sharper than the market seems to think, because I believe we will get a recession in the near future.Anytime in modern history that the Fed has hiked rates this fast, it has precipitated a recession. And during every recession in modern history, the Fed has pushed rates down quickly and significantly  by an average of about 500 basis points .Therefore, shouldn't the burden of proof be on those who claim  contrary to the historical record  that the Fed will be able to achieve a soft landing, avoid recession, and ease the Fed Funds Rate down slowly over the course of several yearsEven if I'm wrong and the Fed does ease the FFR down slowly over the course of a few years, I still think this will put downward pressure on Treasury yields across the curve as the lagged shelter inflation falls and allows CPI readings to come down further.Now, with all of the above said, recall my earlier point that the market treats REITs like bond proxies.If REITs fall because interest rates rise, then what should happen when interest rates begin declining  whether fast or slowOf course, some investors will object that a recession would be bad for REITs, causing an  selloff. This is pure conjecture, and not very well informed conjecture at that. This objection seems to imply that every recession will be just like the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, which was very damaging to real estate and REITs.But most economic forecasts today see a milder recession on the horizon, more akin to the short and shallow recession of 2001.How did REITs perform through that recession  Answer  swimmingly.The Fed quickly pushed down the FFR in response to economic weakness, which corresponded with a drop in long-term interest rates.From April 2000 through June 2022, the Vanguard Real Estate Index  gained 35   15.5  annualized , while real estate stalwarts like Realty Income , Alexandria Real Estate Equities , and W. P. Carey  gained even more.The line of thinking above isn't some sophistry I'm using to try to bail out my underwater REIT positions.  As if anything I write could move the markets anyway  This is my actual view. I truly think REITs, especially the higher quality names that typically trade at large valuation premiums, offer an incredible buying opportunity right now, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.Here are several of the blue-chip REITs I've been buying hand-over-fist lately.ADC owns single-tenant net lease properties leased to the nation's largest and strongest retailers. Its portfolio is highly defensive, recession-resistant, and resilient to competition from e-commerce.Moreover, ADC enjoys among the strongest and best-positioned balance sheets in all of REITdom, with very little debt maturing until 2028.CEO Joey Agree and his top management team are highly shareholder-aligned, illustrated recently by significant insider buying.For a deeper dive on , check out  Why Agree Realty Is My Largest Holding.ARE owns and develops a portfolio of state-of-the-art life science campuses located in the nation's most productive innovation clusters like Boston, Washington DC, and Raleigh Durham. These are generally triple-net leased properties occupied by the world's strongest biotech companies.ARE has suffered a pullback due to worries over cyclically slowing VC investment spending in the biotech space as well as a wave of life science supply coming to market. But ARE's quality of building design and location should act as a moat, blunting the impact of these temporary headwinds.Meanwhile, ARE's balance sheet is top notch, boasting a BBB  credit rating, over 13-year weighted average debt maturity, and no loans maturing until 2025.For more on ARE, see  written in 2019 explaining why I  to own it, even though I thought it was too expensive to buy at the time. It's definitely not too expensive anymore.CCI boasts perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure network in the United States, with all the benefits of scale that comes with it. This network includes over 40,000 cell towers,  85,000 miles of fiber, and  120,000 small cell nodes.In addition, CCI enjoys a strong balance sheet with a BBB  credit rating and a very manageable amount of debt maturing over the next few years.The few headwinds CCI currently faces, such as its 9  floating rate debt exposure and Sprint's lease cancellations as a result of its merger with T-Mobile , are expected to disappear by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, mobile data is projected to keep growing at a double-digit clip, necessitating further investments from carriers into infrastructure.For a deeper dive into , see  Crown Castle  Take Advantage of The Market's Short-Termism.Now that EXR has completed its acquisition of Life Storage  LSI , it has become the largest US-focused self-storage REIT. It enjoys massive benefits of scale as well as an efficient operating platform that, when rolled out for LSI's properties, should produce some nice synergies.In addition, it has a strong balance sheet with a credit rating of BBB  that should give it the ability to handle refinancing the relatively small amount of upcoming debt maturities.Right now, self-storage is suffering a hangover from the huge growth during the pandemic, and low home sales volume and job growth mean few people are moving. The standard catalysts for customers getting a storage unit are not heavily present right now, but that situation won't last forever.For more on , see  REIT Meltdown  3 Rarely Discounted Buying Opportunities.MAA owns and develops a diversified portfolio of apartment communities across the Sunbelt, from Las Vegas to Norfolk. This is a recession-resistant asset class, and MAA's portfolio is ideally suited to benefit from the long-term trend of above-average population and job growth in the Sunbelt.The balance sheet is likewise rock-solid, sporting an A- credit rating.There's a wave of new supply coming to many of MAA's markets, but I  in detail why the REIT won't be hurt nearly as bad as the market thinks in  Mid-America Apartment Communities  Advantages Being Ignored Amid Supply Glut.REXR owns infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained market of Southern California. These properties enjoy one of the biggest mismatches between supply and demand in the United States. New supply under development is only about 2-3  of the total supply, while demand is growing significantly faster than that.The result is double-digit rent growth as far as the eye can see.REXR also boasts an incredibly strong balance sheet, low debt, and a BBB  credit rating that greatly minimizes the negative impact of high interest rates.For more on , see  REIT Crash  The More They Drop, The More I Buy.I call VICI the  landlord of Las Vegas,  because it is the largest owner of casino-resort real estate on the famous Strip, including the iconic Caesar's Palace from which it derives its name.VICI's balance sheet is in good shape with  only  a BBB- credit rating, while its long-duration leases enjoy some inflation protection. Management has proven themselves disciplined about growth, acquiring only when it is accretive to the bottom line.For more on , see  If I Could Only Own 7 REITs, It Would Be These.WPC is a net lease REIT focused on single-tenant industrial and, to a lesser extent, retail and self-storage properties across the US and Western Europe.Lately, WPC has taken a beating over its decision to quickly exit its office segment and downsize its dividend by 10-15 . But I actually like this decision. Single-tenant net lease office has become an extraordinarily unattractive property type that will likely endure very poor returns going forward. I only wish management would have ripped this band-aid off sooner.Plus, selling its office properties now gives WPC the liquidity to manage its 2024 and 2025 debt maturities. Even though it has a BBB  credit rating, I like that management is  killing two birds with one stone  by eliminating the office exposure and prepaying maturing debt in one fell swoop.For more on , see  Despite Inflation Protection, WPC is Best Suited For Low Interest Rates.The primary reason why REITs have shed over 1 3rd of their value since their peak has been rising interest rates.Therefore, as interest rates peak and begin to steadily decline going forward, we should expect the REIT recovery to pick up steam.I of course cannot time the bottom and don't believe anyone can. But I believe the valuations offered right now by high-quality REITs like the 8 discussed above provide ample margin of safety as well as massive upside.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

Why U.S. Treasury Bond Yields Will Continue To Rise,"The year 2023 has been a tough one for bond investors.The Bloomberg Aggregate Index has posted a -1.43  return YTD through October 13th. Following losses of -1.54  in 2021 and -13.01  in 2022, the Aggregate Index is on track for its thirdMuch of the focus has been on the Fundamental economic factors that affect the bond market.Although the Fed s favorite inflation measure has declined from its peak of 5.6  in Feb 2022, the Core PCE came in at a still high 3.9 , last month. Core PCE has remained above the Fed s inflation target of 2.0  for 30 consecutive months.This has been the primary reason why the Fed has been so aggressive with tightening monetary policy. Between March 2022 and theThe possibility of another rate hike is still on the table for this year.The Fed is concerned with the stickiness of the inflation rate and the resiliency of the economy. Many have been predicting a recession due to the Fed s tightening, but the economy seems quite robust, as evidenced by the surprising surge in non-farm payrolls of 336,000, as released by the BLS on October 6. This was markedly stronger than the 267,000 average gain in new jobs over the prior 12 months and the forecasted level of 170,000.While many have been anticipating for more than a year a Fed pivot by cutting rates, with such a durable jobs market the Fed s fear is that such a move would stimulate the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing, autos and consumer borrowing, which would then reignite inflation.The Fed has been using the mantra of  higher for longer  with regards to their rate policy for quite some time, and only recently has it begun to sink in.When Fed Chairman Powell says the Fed will be data dependent at future FOMC meetings, he is referring to these Fundamental economic factors.There is another dimension, however, that is also impacting the bond market, and in my view, is the major reason why US Treasury bond yields will continue to rise, and these are the Technical factors that affect bond yields.One of the basic elements of economics is the Law of Supply and Demand, and with regard to US Treasury bonds, I will discuss how his Technical factor impacts yields.The largest owner of US Treasury bonds is the Federal Reserve. From 2008 through 2022, during the Fed s fourteen-year experiment with Quantitative Easing  QE,  the Fed had a voracious appetite for Treasury bonds. Their Treasury bond holdings surged from  481 billion in 2008 to  5.9 trillion in 2022.The Fed s share of US Treasury Bonds owned by the public jumped from 7.6  to 25.5 .During the pandemic, when QE was reinstituted to prevent the economy from collapsing as everything was shut down, the Fed was virtually the only buyer of government bonds. With the entire yield curve yielding less than 1  due to the Fed s aggressive easing, the Fed bought 53  of the net new government debt issued to stimulate the economy.But then inflation reared its ugly head, and the Fed began reversing course. In addition to raising the Fed Funds rate to 5.50 , the Fed began a policy normalization program, more commonly referred to as Quantitative Tightening  QT.  The goal of QT is to reduce the size of the Fed s balance sheet. This was to be accomplished through allowing their Treasury bonds to roll-off at a pace of  60 billion per month. QT was announced in March 2022, and since then the Fed s Treasury bond holdings have declined to just under  5.0 trillion, or 19.8  of publicly held Treasury debt.The Fed is committed to continuing QT for the foreseeable future.The next largest individual owners of Treasury bonds are Japan and China. At their peaks, both countries each owned well over  1 trillion Treasury bonds. China s ownership topped out at  1.2 trillion in 2013, but has been gradually reduced to only  822 billion. Japan s ownership reached  1.3 trillion at the end of 2021, but has since been reduced to  1.1 trillion. Their shares of ownership of Treasury bonds declined to 3.2  and 4.4 , respectively.There are more than 40 other foreign countries that own Treasury bonds, as well, and collectively their holdings have also declined recently. From a peak of owning 28.3  of US Treasury debt in 2014 the other foreign countries holdings declined to 22.4  in 2023.The final group of US Treasury bond holders are other US Financial Institutions. This category includes, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and hedge funds. As a whole, the Financial Institutions are more price sensitive than the Fed and the other foreign governments. As yields have risen, the Financial Institutions are the only ones who have increased their holdings. Their share of Treasury ownership rose from 32.8  in 2014 to 50.1  in 2023..Treasury debt is issued to help fund the US Government. The government runs a fiscal deficit each year and their expenditures, in excess of revenues, are financed by Treasury bonds. Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the government s deficits have been quite large and consequently the Treasury s requirement for debt issuance has been massive.For the Fiscal Year ending 9 30 23 the government recorded a deficit of - 1.7 trillion, a  300 billion increase from FYE 22 s deficit of - 1.4 trillion. This represents the fourth consecutive year of  trillion plus deficits. The projection for the current year is more of the same.Because of the Debt Ceiling crisis this past spring, the Treasury had to resort to extraordinary measures to prevent the government from defaulting on its obligations. The Treasury had reached its statutory debt limit of  31.4 trillion in January and could no longer issue new bonds. Treasury Secretary Yellen had to move money around and delay funding some retirement programs until Congress solved the problem in June by suspending the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025.Once Yellen received the authority to turn the debt spigots back on, the Treasury has been playing catch up with record new levels of debt. In only four months, the Treasury has issued  1.75 trillion in new bonds. This amount is larger than issuance in any full year, excluding the 2020 pandemic surge. Total government debt outstanding has grown to  33.2 trillion and counting.The basic economic law of Supply and Demand says that when supply increases and demand declines, prices must fall. In bond land, this means that interest rates must go up.This has been evident in looking at the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note. The Fed began paring back their purchases of Treasuries in December 2021 as they started moving away from QE. Then in early 2022 they began cutting their Treasury holdings as they implemented QT.When the Fed began tapering their QE purchases the 10-year Treasury note was yielding roughly 1.50 . As demand for Treasuries has declined and the supply of Treasuries has increased, the 10-year yield has climbed to 4.65 , the highest level in 16 years.Because their borrowing requirements are so immense, the Treasury has a sophisticated and robust system for fulfilling their needs under the Office of Debt Management.The strategy is to offer a variety of debt instruments through a regular and predictable issuance mechanism. This includes promoting a broad and diverse investor base and supporting market liquidity and efficient market functioning.To accomplish their goals, the Treasury works with a network of Primary Dealers to ensure that there will always be a market for their needs.Currently there are 25 Primary Dealers who are authorized by the Federal Reserve System to deal directly in government bonds. These are banks or broker-dealers who must meet rigid requirements to qualify.The first requirement is demonstrating sufficient capital. A broker dealer not affiliated with a bank must have capital exceeding  50 million. For a bank that wants to act as a Primary Dealer, they must have at least  1 billion in Tier 1 capital. They must also be registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The next requirement is that the Primary Dealer must demonstrate that they maintain at least a 0.25  market share in trading government bonds. This includes showing a substantial presence as a market maker that provides two-way liquidity in US government securities.Additionally, they must commit to bid on a consistent basis for their pro rata share at Treasury auctions. Their bids must be competitive with prevailing market levels.Finally, they must have the proper back-office support, with membership in US clearing organizations to efficiently process transactions.The Treasury offers several types of debt instruments. These include Treasury Bills  maturities under 1 year, , Treasury Notes  maturities 1-10 years,  Treasury Bonds  maturities greater than 10 years , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS  and Floating Rate Notes  FRN .There is a regular calendar, where Treasury Bills are auctioned weekly, and all of the other instruments are auctioned monthly.The mechanism for the auctions is that the Treasury posts a schedule of type of security, the size to be issued and the date it is to be auctioned.When an issue is announced, it then trades on a when-issued basis. When-issued trading allows market participants to buy and sell a particular security before it has been auctioned. This feature is important because it provides helpful information about the market interest in the upcoming security.On the day of the auction the Primary Dealers gauge the interest in the security with their customers. Customers can bid on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. A non-competitive bid is usually from small investors who say they want the security and will take it at the prevailing market price. Competitive bids are for customers who say they will buy the bonds at a specific level. They then wait for the auction results to see if they are able to acquire the security at their desired level.The Primary Dealers then convey the interest of their customers to the Treasury at the prescribed auction time.Once the auction closes the Treasury compiles all of the bids and accepts bids, starting at the lowest yield, until they have reached sufficient demand for the amount of security they are offering. The highest yielding bid that clears the auction causes the auction to end.The Treasury uses a single-price format, so all winners of the auction pay the same price, which is the highest yield accepted to clear the auction, even if their bid was at a lower yield.Once the auction is complete, the Treasury then reports the auction results.The official results contain a lot of tidbits of information that are helpful in measuring the success of the auction.The first significant piece of information is to compare the high yield to what the security was trading at on a when -issued basis immediately before the auction closed. If the high yield is below the when-issued price, this is viewed as a strong auction because it demonstrates investors were being aggressive in their bid to ensure that they will get the securities that they desire.If the high yield is above the when -issued price, this is called a  tail,  A tail is viewed as a weak auction, because investors were bidding at a higher yield than that prevailing at auction close, and thus are indicating less interest in the security. The larger the tail, the weaker the auction.The next piece of information to look at is the bid-to-cover ratio. This indicator measures how much demand there is for the security. The larger the bid-to-cover, the greater the interest there is in the security.The final measure to analyze is the percentage taken down by dealers. Primary Dealers are required to submit bids to each auction. They want to provide bids for their customers, whether on a competitive, or non-competitive basis. However, if they do not have customer interest, then they must submit bids for themselves, as market-makers. Again, this is part of their role as a Primary Dealer.However, they typically do not want to own the security themselves. A large percentage taken down by dealers usually means weak customer interest and is viewed as a bad signal, while low dealer ownership is viewed as a strong auction.Last week the Treasury issued 3-year Treasury Notes, 10-year Treasury Notes, and 30-Year Treasury Bonds, and the results were all viewed as sloppy.The Treasury started with auctioning  46 billion of 3-year notes. The high yield was 4.74 , up from 4.66  last month, and the highest level since February 2007.The high yield was above the 4.723  when-issued yield at auction, creating a 1.7 bp tail. This was the largest tail since February, and the third largest in the past ten years.The bid-to-cover was 2.562, down from last month s 2.75. It was the lowest cover since February, and below the six-month average of 2.792.Dealers were awarded 22.1  of the total, the highest level since October 2022.Next came the 10-year Treasury auction of  35 billion.The high yield was 4.61 , versus 4.289  at last month's auction. The 4.592 when-issued yield at auction created a 1.8 bp tail. This was the largest tail since the April auction, and the 8 consecutive auction with a tail.The bid-to-cover was 2.50, down from last month s 2.52. It was also the lowest bid-to-cover since June.Dealers took down 20.9  of the auction, the highest level since October 2022.The final auction of the week was the  20 billion of 30-year Treasury Bonds.The high yield was 4.837 , up from last month s 4.345 . This was the highest yield since August 2007.The 30 year when-issued yield was 4.80, meaning there was a 3.7bp tail. This was the 4 consecutive 30-year auction with a tail, and it was the largest tail since November 2021. Also, it was the 3 largest tail on record.The bid-to-cover was 2.349, the lowest since February. It also was below the 6-month average of 2.44Dealers took down 18.2  of the auction, which was the largest amount since December 2021. It also was above the 6-month average dealer takedown of 11 .Together, these auction results show the limited demand within the investor community and how the Primary Dealers were forced to own more of the auctions than they would like.All indicators point to higher yields ahead.The final Technical factor to analyze is liquidity.The Treasury market has always been the largest and most liquid segment of the bond market. Large quantities of securities are traded daily. Size trades typically have little impact on the bid ask spread. This is known as market depth.Recent activity, however, has shown a troubling weakness in market depth. As measured by the Bloomberg US Government Liquidity Index, seen below, liquidity is near its all-time worst level. This index measures, on average, how far yields are away from where fair value models suggest they should be. The index has deteriorated over the past year as Treasury yields have risen, and is near the all-time high level.The Fundamentals continue to show above target inflation, and the resiliency of the economy, as measured by employment, cause the Fed to emphasize their  higher for longer  mantra.The Technicals, as demonstrated by declining demand for Treasury debt in an environment of heavy supply due to rising budget deficits, suggest higher yields ahead.The metrics of recent Treasury auctions support the weakness in demand among investors, and the deterioration in liquidity as rates rise suggest there is more pain to be felt investing in bonds.For those who view the high current yields as an attractive buying opportunity, I offer the words of Rick Reider, CIO of Global Fixed Income at BlackRockBuy the dip doesn t work during QT   you just keep getting new dips.

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Cash Drain Could Become A Problem (Rating Downgrade),"The market has been kind to shipping company  this year as its stock price has plunged from a 52 week high of  29.38 all the way down to  9.17 as of yesterday's close.The shipping company lowered its expectations for 2023 adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, implying a steep decline in free cash flow as well. The market now models a long earnings contraction for the shipping company which means that the dividend might not return for years.Furthermore, growing container supply might result in a depression of freight rates for a longer period of time which in turn might lead to an ongoing re-rating of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' valuation multiple.I am now a lot more pessimistic as to how long the earnings contraction will last and take responsibility byI have been a big fan of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services when it made a strong value proposition to stockholders, in no small part because of the company's huge dividend pay-out.. Recently, however, net losses have forced the shipping company to not pay a dividend and with the market now expecting a long earnings contraction, investors will likely have to wait years until the dividend comes back.Furthermore, the company is burning through cash and might again have to lower its EBITDA guidance when it releases quarterly earnings for the last quarter.According to ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' dividend policy, the company distributes 30-50  of annual net income as a dividend to shareholders, but the recent accumulation of losses has resulted in non-payment of a dividend and it could take years until the dividend gets paid again.By now, the consensus pretty much is that investors will not get a dividend until the free cash flow and earnings situation at the shipping company improves drastically, something which might not happen for years.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services lost  213 million in the second quarter which brought total YTD losses to  271 million.I am starting now to be a bit more concerned about the company's cash levels which are rapidly depleting and which, in the past at least, have been cited, including by me, as a source of strength for the shipping company.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' reported a net debt position of  1.6 billion in the second quarter and a net leverage ratio of 0.5x. However, at the end of last year, the company had a  269 million net cash position  0.0x net leverage ratio . The problem with this change in debt is that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' free cash flow has fallen off the cliff.Positive free cash flow is naturally replenishing a company's bank accounts and with free cash flow declining a scary 80  YoY in 2Q-23, I think ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is at the brink of having potentially to drastically increase its debt.The absence of any real debt and strong free cash flow were good reasons to buy ZIM during the expansion, but the cash situation is unlikely to get better in the near term.The company had  3.3 billion in cash at the end of 2022 and, at the end of the second quarter, had  1.9 billion in cash, reflecting a decline of  1.4 billion.With the current rate of cash drain, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services might actually have to raise some money next year, or leverage up its balance sheet.Freight rates have come under considerable pressure in 2022 and 2023, primarily because of shrinking demand in the consumer sector. With consumer sentiment deteriorating and shipping volumes shrinking, the spot market has come under increasing pressure.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' average freight rate, for instance, plunged to just  1,193  TEU  in the second quarter, marking a sharp correction of 67  YoY.Unfortunately, I don't think the situation is getting much better and I was probably misguided in my earlier assessment that ZIM Integrated Shipping Services could see a short-lived recession and enjoy a quick rebound in freight rates.One aspect why I am less optimistic on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is that the market continues to expect a glut of new supply for container ships which, in my view, will continue to suppress average freight rates way into 2024.The following chart is reproduced from my last article, for convenience.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of  1.2 billion to  1.6 billion, down from a prior guidance of between  1.8 billion and  2.2 billion in Adjusted EBITDA. Given the poor state of the shipping industry, I would not be surprised to see yet another reduction in the profit outlook.The market now models a much deeper recession than it did in July which is when I presented my last outlook on the shipping company. The estimates also indicate that the recession will last longer and concerns over the general state of the economy should be taken seriously.Cyclically-vulnerable shipping companies are at risk of a major earnings contraction and the market now sees 2024 to lead to even higher losses than are expected for 2023, and the situation is not anticipated to get much better in 2025 either.Profit estimates are negative and an earnings multiple can't be applied. The valuation ultimately depends on ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' outlook for 2023, its cash drain in the third quarter and the company's prospects for a free cash flow recovery.If the outlook gets slashed again when the company presents for 3Q-23, I would say the valuation of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is most likely headed for new lows. The most important metric to watch moving forward will be ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash balance.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services was a popular income stock in 2021 and 2022 which is when the shipping company returned a boatload of cash to shareholders.But two consecutive quarters of  growing  net losses have changed the picture quite a bit and the market now appears to model a steep recession that could last 1-3 years.I am now much more concerned about ZIM Integrated Shipping Services' cash drain as well as the length of the earnings contraction. As a consequence, investors must expect to see a much more leverage balance sheet moving forward. I am not willing to accept this risk and have sold out.

My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid, but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead. Currently with the funds rate at 5.5  and the core CPI at 4.1  the real funds rate is 1.4 . ThatThe Fed can resume its fine-tuning operation later if the need arises, but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go. I'll agree that the bulk of the Fed's work is done, BUT I don't believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a last-minute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown, the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded. The first-ever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mix-raising the odds of a government shutdown in mid-November. While this situation won't affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that will.The political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics, fiscal spending, and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors, rating agencies, and voters. Now to be fair, the government's deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yields-the market's way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order. And, the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the government's out-of-control spending, the worse the situation will get.In an era of low inflation and zero low interest rates, Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences. No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10-year Treasury yield now hovering around 4.9 . With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate, Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road. fiscal austerity would become a near-term headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates. However, that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2  target, so this growth inflation interest rate issue isn't going to be so easy to solve. However, as I will explain later, an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today. Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced before.The auto workers union is making  in my opinion  some outrageous demands. They are asking for a 40  increase in wages over 4 years, a 20  reduction in the workweek from 40.0 to 32.0 hours, and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of all-electric vehicles. The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands, poisoned any good-faith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainable.At the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rank-and-file union members. The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President. Against this background, it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly. As it progresses, the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip. The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparent.While investors seem to be pricing a  soft landing,  history is not on their side. The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history, and the market is still trying to absorb the impact. This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike, with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by near-term macro events. As rates have spiked, so too have long-term yields.Yield spreads also bear monitoring. The spread, or difference, between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, has been negative all year, i.e., an inverted yield curve, but has narrowed from a record -110 basis-point inversion in March to only 30 basis points today-not positive, but it's progress. Dating back to 1990, when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities. It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points, do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues. I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positive.The past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil. We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week, and as I'll speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations. The MACRO scene, however, has been impacted, especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their  911  event. Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spending debt debacle in our economy, the  rubber band  gets stretched once again. The U.S. has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will  get what they need  to defend themselves., but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation. These events along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII. In the meantime, taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding  spending , as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced . Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process. However, they are not.There is a contingent, in which Ms. Yellen is a firm supporter, that wishes to spend trillions on  climate issues  and an  energy transition . While the economy is doing well, welfare spending is near or at all-time highs. In fiscal year , the federal  spent  1.19 trillion on more than 80 different  programs. That represents almost 20  of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022. That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is  humming along  The pandemic is over but the country's food stamp program reached an all-time high in November 2022 and remains at that level.Then there are the 6-7 million immigrants that have arrived, and they also come with a huge cost to social services, welfare, etc. Finally, the cherry on top of this debt cake. The cost of  the  existing debt   not future debt  will be about the same as the existing Social Security program. In effect, we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programs.Therefore it is a HUGE  stretch  to assume the U.S. can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately needed.It doesn't take a Wharton School graduate to realize that  other  spending must be curtailed. I realize I keep repeating that, but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact. At some point, this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped. If it isn't then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye. Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL, some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE.  The climate ISN'T the biggest threat to our economy . The only question that remains is - is it already too lateBetween the  issues  at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad, the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades. For the U.S., the latter is a self-inflicted policy error that leaves the  That in turn will negatively impact the financial markets for what could turn out to be a period The 3Q23 earnings season ramped up this week with 11  of the S P 500 market cap reporting results, traders entered the scene with a wait-and-see approach.

Retail sales in August were inflated after gasoline prices spiked, however. That was not the case in September when gas prices began to ease.A closely watched category of retail sales that excludes auto dealers, gas stations, and building materials and feeds into the gross domestic product jumped 0.6  last month compared to the prior month.September's uptick in retail sales, the sixth consecutive monthly gain, reflects how the U.S. economy has remained resilient despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool spending and hiring.In the good news is bad news backdrop, this number was considered a negative as it potentially keeps the Fed engaged in the rising rate scene.The  to -9.0 in October from -13.5, versus a 16-month high of 12.0 in August which was the only positive reading over the last year.

The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longer-term interest rates that are doing some of the Fed's heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled, while Wall Street rallied.However, the markets shuddered at Powel's view that the economy's resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough, suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2 .That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3.--  - It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That is also frightening for equities.House Speaker Vote. It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan, leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry  R-NC . It's unclear if he can garner 217 votes either.The continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 11 17, and besides the geo-political turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed, the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker, the more likely it is that we reach that mid-November deadline without a budget agreement.Then there is the administration's emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel. With the slim Republican majority, they would need 98  of their contingent to back ONE candidate, and as we have seen that is an impossible task. An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal  handful  of Democrats to get behind a candidate  ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee  and remove this obstacle.As far as the shutdown, as stated in earlier updates, it's a non-event for the markets. If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending. With complete dysfunction in Washington, we're all suffering the consequences of politicians.After three years of overlapping crises, it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world. While these concerns are valid, I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Because of this, it is unlikely that the Israeli-Hamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the Russia-Ukraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years. A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the region.Fortunately, I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence. The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war. Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel. As the leadership in Tehran knows very well, Israel is a nuclear-armed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East. It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved. However, for a variety of other reasons, I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the  85- 90 barrel range. that are taking place in the Israeli conflict, but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth. First, from an economic perspective, Israel is a small country, with a GDP of  521 billion-making it the 29th largest country in the world, representing only 0.5  of world GDP. To put this into perspective, when measured by GDP, Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US  roughly the size of Virginia  and when compared to companies in the S P 500, Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company  Eli Lilly .Additionally, Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US, making up only 0.7  of both US imports and exports  the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively . And because of this, Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path. From an earnings perspective, given that I don't expect a significant economic impact from the war, combined with the fact that the S P 500 receives only 0.2  and 2.8  of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively, the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earnings.Finally, it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact. Unfortunately, conflict in this region is nothing new. Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts, the S P 500 was up  15  on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75  of the time.While this terrorist act may not change my economic views, it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the future.Iran did some saber-rattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any 'calls' in this war is preposterous. The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today. Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terror.If this terrorist attack isn't a wake-up call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future. The FACTS, not opinion, rhetoric, or  spin , but FACTS, tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced. Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2  years. Instead of crippling their economy, the country's coffers have been enriched in the last 2 years.If common sense doesn't prevail, this war is just the beginning of global turmoil. The U.S. received yet another reminder that 'policy' errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel. After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price, the U.S. finally decided to begin   Strategic Petroleum Reserve . Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels. Combine this with U.S. Domestic issues that I'll present next, and it's easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higher.There is  reason to abandon the energy trade.Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a  59.5 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and a side-step against the US anti-fossil fuels policies. The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resources.This deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill, and that should encourage more M  A activity.Being a low-cost producer with an enviable list of land assets, Pioneer Natural Resources is a  prize . Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits. That means the newly combined entity will drill longer, more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money. Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer  laterals  Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impact.A the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. In a stroke of genius, Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale, while defraying costs, and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels. In essence, this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.U.S. oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. However, that is about to end, as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian in the last 2 years. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition.The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029-the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades, and at some point, the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economy.Finally, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas. The U.S. energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that 'policies' have consequences.The indices are all at a point where they could still go either way. Given all of the  outside  influences, the best scenario might be more sideways action. Plenty of starts and stops, with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while. Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter. That tells me to stay diversified and look for  special situations .It's easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy. The S P 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away. The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the index.The ball is in the BULL's court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position. A 'break' of support opens up a completely different set of circumstances on the technical front.Once sentiment sours, NOTHING is going to change that downward price action.

SQM: The Future Of Lithium Amidst The Energy Transition,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  is priced at 5x this year's EPS. Anyone looking at this stock will immediately recognize that it's cheaply valued. So, this consideration is not the main factor that's weighing onThe problem with this stock is that there's so much uncertainty priced in. Undoubtedly, some aspects are worthy elements that  priced in.Demand for lithium is going to massively increase in the next few years. Accordingly, the long-term thesis is clearly intact. However, a combination of risk-off investor sentiment, together with a slowdown in the energy transition is overwhelmingly impacting the stock.Here I shine a light on why investors are eschewing this stock. Ultimately, even though there are some aspects that should be factored in, I believe that at 5x this year'sWhat's the energy transition  Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it was clear. Is the energy transition when we stopped using wood and dung and started to use coal as the primary energy source  Or is the energy transition when we started to use Diesel oil for mobility  Or perhaps, the energy transition was when we started to increase our usage of natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and cookingPerhaps, the energy transition is in the future, when we use a greater proportion of our primary energy supply from solar panels and wind turbines  Do you see the point I'm making here  That we are always transiting from one source of energy to another.Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it happens overnight. But the fact of the matter is that while we have energy transitions, they take time. And what do investors absolutely hate nearly as much as bad news  UncertaintyNot knowing how long we'll have to wait to get paid. And I get it. With the share price going up, nobody is going to bother with difficult questions.But when the share price starts to move south, everything that was an uncertainty before becomes bad news. Now.Investors' time horizons shorten, and unless something is expected to go up within the next 12 months with a high degree of certainty, investors lose patience.I'm not saying that SQM is unquestionably a good investment. I for one, invested with Albemarle   disclosure  I'm long ALB . Admittedly, both companies have been terrible performers in 2023.There's no clearer sign of investors' capitulation than the right side of the chart consistently moving down day after day, without respite.The top concern is the most obvious, and can even be discerned in the company's name. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile. When investors are risk-seeking, investing in Chile is a compelling opportunity. It's a fast-growing company, that's strategically located in Chile, which grants it access to abundant lithium resources and cost-effective mining operations.But when interest rates are high, plus investors' temperaments mercurial, all that investors can think about are the political and regulatory risks that arise due to the company's operations in Chile, not to mention the likely overreaching government policies that may capture some of the company's profits.80  of SQM's gross profits are tied to lithium's prospects. If lithium regains its footing, SQM will do well. And in time, lithium's prospects will improve.Lithium prices have fallen by around 70  in the past year. This has for the most part been brought about by the sustainable climb in prices in the previous 2 years.Again, the overall energy transition story is still very much intact. Demand for lithium is expected to increase in the future, primarily driven by the growing adoption of EVs and the expansion of renewable energy storage systems.As automakers worldwide increasingly shift towards EV production to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements, lithium-ion batteries, will play a pivotal role in powering these vehicles.Additionally, the renewable energy sector's need for energy storage solutions to stabilize  will further boost lithium demand, making it a crucial element in the energy transition.Moreover, lithium demand for energy storage solutions aimed at grid stabilization is on the rise as utilities and the grid seek reliable methods to store excess energy and balance supply and demand, especially given the increasing amount of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the grid.I contend that lithium batteries have gained prominence in this role due to their efficiency, rapid response times, and ability to store and discharge electricity when needed, contributing to grid stability.I have a cautiously optimistic outlook on SQM. While it's trading at an attractive 5 times this year's EPS, there are notable near-term uncertainties and doubts that need consideration.The demand for lithium, while poised for substantial growth in the long run due to the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, has faced recent setbacks, leading to a substantial drop in lithium prices and creating short-term volatility.Additionally, SQM's exposure to political and regulatory risks in Chile, coupled with market uncertainties, may dampen investor sentiment in the short term.However, the fundamental strength of SQM's lithium production and its strategic position in the industry suggest a potentially brighter future once these near-term challenges are navigated.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

The West Is Losing Control Over The Gold Price,"An important change has unfolded in the global gold market. The East has been driving up the gold price, predominantly in late 2022 and the first months of 2023, breaking the West s long-standing pricing power.Until recently, Western institutional money was driving the  in wholesale markets such as London, mainly based on real interest rates. Gold was bought when real rates fell and vice versa. However, from late 2022 until June 2023 gold was up 17  while real rates were more or less flat, and Western institutions were net . Most likely, Eastern central banks, and Turkish and Chinese private demand, lifted the price of gold.For about ninety years, up until 2022, there was a patternIf we zoom in on the period from 2006 through 2021 the main reason for Western institutions to buy or sell gold was the , which reflects the 10-year expected real interest rate  real rate,  in short  of US government bonds.The physical gold price was predominantly set in the London Bullion Market and to a lesser extent Switzerland. Gold trade in London can be divided in three categoriesAs we will see below, the TIPS rate, UK net gold import  positive or negative , Western ETF holdings, and the COMEX open interest were all correlated to the price of gold. Until the war in Ukraine broke out late February 2022, that is, and things started to change.Because customs data lags a few months, and the World Gold Council s supply and demand data is published quarterly, we will cover the global market until June 2023 in this article. We will examine how gold is becoming less sensitive to real rates, and how London is losing its gold pricing power.Let s start by  the correlation between real rates and gold. Note, the TIPS yield axes in the charts below are inverted because higher rates caused lower gold prices and vice versa.From March until September 2022 the TIPS yield rose dramatically  down in the chart , but the price of gold reacted less bearish than the  rates model  previously prescribed. As London was still a net exporter over this time horizon, I conclude the West was still in charge of the price. But then came the third quarter of 2022.From late October 2022 until June 2023 the TIPS rate was barely down while gold was up 17 . Remarkably, the West wasn t driving up the gold price, as demonstrated by UK net exports, declining Western ETF inventory, and falling COMEX open interest.First, the UK s monthly net flows. Obviously, the price wasn t set in London, as the UK was a net seller while the price was up. In Chart 1 and 4 you can see this is unprecedented.Also taking into account gold flows through Switzerland, the second-largest Western  and largest refining hub globally, shows a similar picture. For the first time since monthly data is available, the gold price has been rising over several months, while the UK and Switzerland combined are net exporters.Not surprisingly, Western ETF inventory, of which the majority is stored in London and Switzerland, has declined over the past three quarters.Western institutions that trade gold outright or use ETFs are dominant on the COMEX futures exchange as well. At the COMEX, we see the same development  gold s open interest has fallen over the period in question.If the UK and Switzerland were net exporters, who did they sell to  The UK mainly exported gold to Switzerland, so to answer this question all we have to do is find out which countries Switzerland exported to and check if these countries didn t sell the metal on.The Swiss customs department lets users track the flow of goods per continent. Apparently, Switzerland was a huge net exporter to Asia when the gold price went up.Let s see which of Switzerland s main buyers in Asia could have pushed up the gold price.It wasn t India, as the Indians, like most people in the East, are price sensitive. From October through June, India s net gold imports declined, with the exception of June when the price reverted.Possibly, Chinese private demand somewhat lifted the gold price. Although the Chinese are usually price sensitive, net imports into the mainland were surprisingly strong in November and December 2022, and in February and March 2023.Turkey s net import reached an all-time high in January 2023 when the Turkish lira continued to devalue and the Turks fled to real estate, durable goods and, needless to say, gold. After January, the Turkish central bank began blocking imports and sold 156 tonnes of its official gold reserves domestically to defend the lira. No doubt that Turkish private demand, mainly up until January, has had an impact on the gold price.A proper indicator of a trend reversal is the net flows to Eastern trading hub, Hong Kong. Normally, Hong Kong would be a net importer when the price declines  and vice versa . Recently, however, Hong Kong was a net importer while the price was up. Possibly, central banks are buying in Hong Kong, monetize the gold locally, and repatriate the metal outside the scope of public customs data. Gold owned by central banks  monetary gold  is exempt from being reported in customs data.The tonnages recently net imported by Hong Kong may not be very impressive, but they could be a sign of a larger development. If central banks are buying in Hong Kong, they can be buying anywhere.Major suspects are non-Western central banks secretly buying gold, as dollar assets have become riskier to hold since the US seized Russia s official dollar reserves in 2022. These central banks have an incentive not to make public rushing into gold or the price would spike excessively, giving them less bang for their buck.Every quarter the World Gold Council  WGC  publishes an estimate, based on field research by Metals Focus, that reflects how much they think central banks have bought. Since the Ukraine war, these quarterly estimates are much higher than what central banks in aggregate report to the IMF. Most likely covert central bank purchases have boosted the price.The most logical explanation for gold s recent behavior is a combination of surreptitious buying by central banks from emerging markets, and strong private demand in Turkey and China. It s possible the WGC s estimates of covert central bank buying are too low, given these estimates were falling during the price spike at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023.As some of you might have noticed, the US dollar gold price has been declining in the last months of the period of our investigation, and London was still a net exporter. Perhaps the West will regain control over the price again. I don t expect the gold price to fall to levels previously suggested by the rates model, though.Central bank buying is likely to stay strong.  We still believe that the official sector will remain a sizeable bullion buyer for the foreseeable future  , as factors that encouraged reserve managers to add gold reserves in recent years are expected to persist,   this August.We will have to wait and see if the East is able to further push up the price of gold and weaken the West s control over the price. If so, gold will become less of a dollar derivative, and take more center stage in the international monetary system.

Public Storage: A Simple Question Of Supply And Demand,"Over the long haul, it could be said that betting on the American self-storage space has really been a bet on the American consumer  as people buy more stuff to put in their homes, eventually they'll run out ofA primary beneficiary of this stunning growth is Public Storage , the largest self-storage player in the United States which, as of its , boasted 206 million net rentable square feet of storage space spread across 2,888 facilities, and whose common stock sports a 4.4  dividend yield  as of this writing .The large-scale trends across the country haveFor all of these bullish points, however, the market seems to believe that the outlook for Public Storage is not quite so rosy, as evidenced by the stock's 18.5  decline over the last 12 months.Over the last ten years, in fact, the stock has appreciated 77  versus the broader S P 500's  return of 171 . Reviewing the stock's performance on a total return basis for the same time frame also reveals underperformance for Public Storage with a 158  return against SPY's 225 .While it might be tempting to view the drop in Public Storage's price as a potential buying opportunity, we do not believe that the outlook for the company or the sector to be quite as strong as what the bulls contend. In fact, we think that a few key drivers will precipitate a continued slowdown in Public Storage's business and underperformance in its stock. The main points of our argument are thusLet's dive in.On the , Public Storage management highlighted move in volume, with CEO Joseph Russell noting that  we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14  in the second quarter.While growing volumes of move-ins might generate excitement on a conference call, analysts had questions about the company's move-outs as well. Let's take a dive into the same store net tenant addition metrics for Public Storage's latest quarter.Of Public Storage's 2,888 properties, 2,344  roughly 81  are considered same store, with the remainder in development or having been acquired less than one year ago. In our view, this reflects an aggressive growth strategy on behalf of the company  more on that later . Public Storage posted this chart in its latest quarterly filing, detailing same store data .Note that realized rent per occupied square foot grew overall by 8.3 , average occupancy across all markets declined overall by 2.1 . This indicates that the increase in revenue in the latest reporting period was driven--at least in the same store category--by price hikes to existing customers rather than an increase in new tenants.The picture doesn't get better when analyzing the tenants coming in to replace those that are leaving.As can be seen in the chart above  of the most recent 10Q , new tenants average annual contract rent per square foot decreased year over year by 14.4 , while promotional discounts to new tenants increased by 26.4 . Additionally, the net delta between new contract rents gained year over year versus contract rents lost from move-outs widened significantly, from negative  6 million in the quarter ending June 2022 to negative  29.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2023.In other words, it appears that Public Storage is having difficulty bringing in new tenants at full price, while it continues to raise rates for existing tenants and also experiencing a net decrease in overall tenants as expressed by average occupancy.It is perhaps not surprising that Public Storage is having difficulty with net tenant additions, given that the industry has been building new facilities at a feverish pace to meet demand over the last decade.In any industry, rapid build-outs of supply are driven by demand, but supply takes time to come online, and demand can wane during that time frame, causing supply to overshoot. To frame the situation for the self-storage industry, an estimated  of new storage facility space is expected to be completed in 2023 while the average storage unit price has dropped, according to SpareFoot.com, with the estimated cost to rent a storage unit in 2023 being  100 per month compared to .It's also a murky proposition to assume that Americans who are not yet utilizing storage spaces will suddenly jump on board and become new tenants. Consider our chart belowPictured above is a monthly snapshot of the Public Storage stock price and the Google trend search term 'Self-Storage Near Me' going back to September 2010. While not a perfect correlation, it can clearly be seen that the spike in searches for self-storage  we should note that Public Storage boasts that a large portion of its new move-ins come through its online funnel  in 2021 coincided with a rise in Public Storage's stock price. Searches for storage space has since moderated back towards 2019 levels, which, in our minds, is evidence that Americans are losing steam when it comes to renting new self-storage units.As an aside, we also believe that the stickiness of the self-storage consumer is also somewhat overstated in the bull case. While tenants who store motorhomes or other large items will likely remain for the long term, research from StorageCafe.com shows that most people using storage across the country are . Further, most contracts at self-storage properties are month-to-month with no penalty for cancelling  Public Storage's 10K notes on  that its lease policy is month-to-month .It isn't far fetched to think, then, that tenants could simply sell, discard, or move it back into their living space especially if they are looking to cut roughly  100 in expenses out of their monthly budget  and there is ample  to support the  that  seeking  monthly expenditures .Furthermore, the largest driver of new self-storage rentals comes from tenants moving to a .This, of course, was a boon for the self-storage industry as remote work became all the rage and high-earning white collar workers fled urban  to more rural settings. However, that trend appears to be , and there is plenty of research showing that Americans are moving .While we aren't of the belief that mass amounts of tenants will mount an exodus from self-storage nationwide, we believe that the majority of the facts do not stand in Public Storage's favor.Despite Public Storage's acquisitive nature  recall that roughly 20-25  of its properties are excluded from same store sales , analysts have largely factored out future FFO growth expectations from the stock.Against analyst estimates looking out in the second unreported year of  17.50 per share of FFO, Public Storage stock currently trades at roughly 15.6x FFO Share on a forward basis.Seeking Alpha's  paints a slightly worse picture, showing that the stock trades at 16x forward price to FFO, which is 30.9  above the sector mean.Should the company see its ability to hike prices on existing renters deteriorate, and if net move-ins continue to decline  as we think both will for the reasons outlined above , this will inevitably squeeze margins and Public Storage, which could result in further gloom from analysts in the future.For us, then, we target a 15-20  decline in forward price to FFO valuation as a good point to re-evaluate Public Storage's situation against the macroeconomic backdrop.It is difficult to grow a business with a relatively fixed cost structure while large amounts of new supply are set to come online amidst signs of waning demand.

Rising U.S. Treasury Yields Do Some Of The Fed's Heavy Lifting,"I love it when I can figure out a way to work more efficiently or, even better, get someone to do my work for me. The less I have to do, the better. I think the US Federal Reserve  Fed  agrees. After all, when it comes toWhen someone is happy to do your work for you, I think that s a good thing. I ve mentioned before how my oldest son used to prefer cleaning with his grandmother to playing with toys when he was a toddler. My husband was uncomfortable with this, but IIt seems the Fed has found a  helper  of sorts as well in the rising 10-year yield  and one that s a bit more effective than a three-year-old armed with Windex and paper towels . Different Fed members have said as much in recent days, and even Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening.There are a variety of reasons for this increase. The 10-year US Treasury yield is composed of two drivers  1  it s influenced by short-term rates  which is fairly straightforward  and 2  it factors in a  term premium  that investors demand for holding onto a bond for that long. That term premium reflects everything else that could occur over the life of the bond, including growth expectations and inflation expectations. Recently, inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, and so we need to look to other factors to explain the rise in long yieldsOf course, there is a countervailing force that can push down yields, and has done so on at least a few days since the conflict in the Middle East began  a preference for  safe haven  asset classes. There have been concerns that this crisis could be contagious and expand to involve other countries, which has fueled a move to Treasuries on several days since the conflict began. Although there has been far more of a preference for gold as a safe haven asset class, preferences can change - especially since the opportunity cost of owning gold is higher as yields rise.The rising 10-year yield is arguably a positive development in that it means the Fed doesn t have to hike rates anymore and therefore hastens the end of the tightening cycle, in my opinion. In other words, it s ripping the band-aid off. However, it s also exerting downward pressure on stocks. And when I talk to clients outside the US, they worry about the impact that higher mortgage rates, driven up by the 10-year US Treasury yield, will have on American consumers.But while the national average 30-year US fixed mortgage rate just hit 8 , a level that has not been seen in many years, I don t think it will have a very significant impact on US households. That s because more than 90  of existing mortgages in the US are long-term fixed-rate mortgages - with an average rate below 4  - so rising rates will not impact US households the way they have impacted households in other countries that do not have the exorbitant privilege of long-term fixed-rate mortgages. Or the way they impacted US households in advance of the Global Financial Crisis, when nearly 40  of existing mortgages were adjustable-rate. In fact, past due residential real estate loans have declined since mid-2020.The biggest result of high mortgage rates may be a low inventory of houses for sale, since many homeowners are unwilling to put their houses on the market with rates so high. The environment has created  golden handcuffs  for them.Policy uncertainty is likely to create an environment in which the 10-year yield will continue to move in a wide range in the near term. But I believe once we get clarity from the Fed that the rate hike cycle has ended, then I think we will see yields begin to ease.  In other words, I think sky-high long-term yields are likely to be very temporary.I think we are likely to get policy clarity in the next few months. After all, I thought it was meaningful that Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted last week that  indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Wage growth is typically the stickiest part of inflation, so that suggests the Fed is content with progress made in the labor market - all the more reason they shouldn t need to hike rates again.And while the Fed may continue to talk tough in the short term  and we got a lot of tough talk in Powell s speech last week , I think it will be quick to recognize signs of the lagged effects of monetary policy on the economy, as I believe a very real slowdown  a bumpy landing  is coming. The very data-dependent Fed should soon realize there is no need for more rate hikes - and that there will likely be a need for at least one rate cut before the end of the first half of 2024. I believe higher oil prices will also weigh down on the US consumer and do some of the Fed s work for it.US stocks are likely to come under pressure in the near term as the 10-year yield remains high and perhaps moves slightly higher. Last week, the S P 500 Index fell more than 2 , down to 4,224 - which marks its lowest level since June 1. But I have to put this all in perspective  it is well below its peak of 4796 on January 3, 2022, but is well above its closing low of 3,577 on October 12, 2022. I think it is telling us that the recession that was priced in last year with an approximately 25  drop in the S P 500 is being replaced with a slowdown, being forecasted by a milder drop in the S P 500 this year.At the expense of sounding like a broken record, I see this as an environment that reminds us of the importance of broad diversification across and within not just equities and fixed income, but alternatives.After a flurry of data releases last week, I m primarily waiting to see what the Federal Open Market Committee decides to do in its meeting on Nov. 1.But there are some important data points and events between now and then Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Federal Reserve Board of Governors Summary of Economic Projections, Sept. 20, 2023, and Summary of Economic Projections, June 14, 2023 Sources  JP Morgan, Refinitiv Datastream, and Invesco Global Market Strategy Office, as of Oct. 20, 2023 Source  Bankrate, as of Oct. 23, 2023 Sources  Invesco, Macrobond, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  Freddie Mac , as of Sept. 31, 2023 Source  US Federal Reserve, transcript of Jay Powell speech, Oct. 19, 2023 Source  Bloomberg, as of Oct. 20, 2023NA3186789Header image  archives   GettyPast performance is not a guarantee of future results.An investment cannot be made into an index.This does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor.

TORM: The Comeback Is Unfolding,"You are reading my 4th article on TORM plc  - one of the world's largest transporters of refined oil products, operating in various vessel segments from Medium Range to Long Range 2 tankers.I first wrote aboutToday, I'd like to update my coverage again as the tanker transportation market is changing quite dynamically and the, TORM reported its strongest performance ever, building on a strong 1st quarter. They achieved a TCE of  308 million, with an EBITDA result of  237 million  with a margin of 61.6  vs. 45.3  last year . After adjusting for unrealized gains, EBITDA increased by 23  to  199 million, and profit before tax increased by 72  to  184 million compared to Q2 FY2022As the management noted during , TORM's return on invested capital amounted to 33.9  in Q2  vs. 22.7  last year , and its balance sheet remained strong with a net LTV ratio of 29  and available liquidity of  497 million. The board of directors approved a dividend of  1.5 per share based on the second quarter results TORM has taken delivery of several vessels and entered into collaborations to enhance their fleet's performance. They mentioned .The executives emphasize the importance of the product tanker order book, which is currently at 10  of the fleet. It's spread across 3.5 years of deliveries, translating to a relatively low annualized growth rate  any new orders won't be delivered before 2026 . This implies that the market may not see significant new supply in the near term, supporting current rates.So the financial outlook for the remainder of FY2023 was  bullish,  so to speak, as TORM expects significant earnings day coverage at favorable rates. As of August 14, 2023, the company had already secured 72  of its full-year earning days and 74  of its Q3 earning days. While these rates provide a foundation, TORM acknowledges the potential for market rates to vary significantly, given the low visibility of unfixed TCE rates. Their outlook for FY2023 anticipates TCE in the range of  1,050-1,175 million and EBITDA ranging from  775-900 million. These projections reflect the current fleet size, considering vessel acquisitions and divestments.I like to check management's statements for realism by comparing their forecasts with third-party research, and if we're talking about shipping, BIMCO analysts, whose research is regularly publicly available, are one of the leading representatives of independent opinion  as far as I know . Analyst Niels Rasmussen updated , pointing to a serious imbalance of supply and demand in this market.While time charter rates are below their late 2022 peak, they are still well above 2022 levels, and used vessel prices have increased, underscoring the strength of the market and positive future expectations. Given the limited supply growth expected in 2024 and rising cargo volumes, BIMCO's outlook stayed optimistic. However, risks remain, with Chinese demand and economic indicators playing a key role in shaping future market conditions.The strength of the market can be seen in the latest data and in the behavior of fleet utilization  , MR utilization rates are currently at all-time highs  as of October 15From this, I conclude that TRMD's internal outlook is close to reality and that the company will indeed be able to achieve its projected EBITDA of  837.5 million for FY2023  the mid-range .Just like a few months ago, Seeking Alpha's Quant System, which  of picking promising stocks, gives TRMD stock an , which is absolutely solidAt the moment, TRMD is trading at about 4x of next year's EV EBITDA. Is that a lot or a little  In absolute terms, that looks cheap. But compared to the rest of the industry, it's slightly above averageIn terms of dividend yield, however, TRMD outperforms its peers, although its double-digit FCF yield is the smallest of allGiven its huge dividend yield, TRMD still appears to be a fairly cheap option among clean tankers, and as the positive trends in the industry continue, I expect that dividend yield to be quite well protected. This should ultimately attract more income-seeking investors and drive the share price higher - those who buy early will see a much higher total return, in my opinion.Of course, investing in TRMD stock carries several inherent risks that every investor should take into account. First off, the shipping industry's susceptibility to market volatility and cyclicality means that TORM's performance can be greatly influenced by fluctuations in freight rates, economic conditions, and oil prices. Regulatory and environmental compliance requirements may lead to increased operating costs, and TORM's substantial debt could pose financial risks, especially during extended periods of low rates. Intense competition, geopolitical instability, and the potential impacts of changing interest rates and exchange rates further underscore the risk profile of investing in TRMD stock. So prior to investing in TRMD or any stock, diligent research and consideration of one's risk tolerance are crucial.However, despite the associated risks, I remain confident that the stock rebound I anticipated for TRMD back in July is still in progress, and it is far too premature for it to halt. The current dividend yield is a result of market strength, but even if it falls to , it is still over 15  in FY2024, which is very, very generous at the company's current valuation of 4x EV EBITDA.Therefore, I reiterate my  Buy  rating and expect a double-digit total return from TRMD stock over the next 12 months.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Disney:Why You Should Buy And Hold Forever,"Although Fact Set breaks down the revenues into a few different subcategories, Disney generally classifies them as DMED for the media side and DPEP for the parks and hotel side. The DMED business represented about 35  of total operating income for FY22 and DPEP 65 . So in this case we have huge revenues with slim margins on the media business and lower revenues with higher margins on the parks entertainment and retail side.The equation here for a turnaround looks quite clear, enhance the parks business with greater CAPEX and cut the fat on the media side now that a customer base has been established. The linear media business also needs to be slowly merged into the  Web Based Data and Services  portion, or streaming. No small feat. However, Netflix has shown us that fairly high operating and profit margins can be achieved in direct-to-consumer streaming. Replicating it is the ultimate goal.Disney  was launched on November 12, 2019. This combined with park closures during Covid and the departure of Iger resulted in negative profit margins for a short stint. The recovery has been slow and not entirely pretty.Back to Netflix as a comp for what all streaming services aim to achieve. While Netflix has been around longer than 2009, streaming was introduced during this period. It took the good part of 7 years to achieve a steady upward trajectory for positive margin trends while the company also began to phase out the physical disk business. I wasn't even aware, but Netflix still mailed DVDs up to September of this year. Any dying business will have a long tail and take time to phase out.That being said, part of the difficult trek to profitability for Netflix had to do with the adoption of streaming. Luckily streaming has now become the norm, so Disney does not have to fight that battle. Streaming competition is also more fierce than ever, but Netflix has built a blueprint that should speed up the process to ascending margins in about half the time as it took Netflix. If it took Netflix 7 years, I'd like to think Disney could start that trajectory in 3.5-4 years. We should be near the sweet spot for margin improvement.In my previous article, I looked at Disney primarily on an asset basis. Since then, the price-to-book value has hit even further lows. Being that Disney is in a turnaround phase, with lots of write-offs and expenses, I used a modified Graham number using the book value and EBITDA per share as a proxy to income. Here is an update on that model for where we stand todayIn my bull case price model I will be making the following 2025 future assumptions using a Buffett Owner Earnings Model with TTM numbers bumped up by 10All numbers in millionsThis is not the first time I have written about Disney. I am very interested in keeping myself abreast of the company since it has become one of my larger holdings. Having traveled extensively, I would have to say that Disney has maintained its brand appeal internationally even though it has deteriorated domestically. It is still one of the first places on the list to visit should a foreign national set foot in one of the various locations that have a Disney Park.As someone who leans to the right side of the political spectrum, I also acknowledge what some of my readers have pointed out, some liberal, US-based issues have seeped into the Disney media content. This is not prescient throughout the rest of the world where Disney is known solely for its Parks, Hotels, and retail products.I have seen recent feature-length films put out by Disney, and while they were not all that impressive, none of them struck me as agenda-based either. I must also admit that I do not stream Disney  or subscribe to the linear segments, but supply and demand should eventually reconfigure the offerings to a nice happy middle. Simply put, we are all customers, and business survival will eventually come down to pleasing all of your customers. Our demand will eventually modify the supply. The beauty of a capitalist economy is that the customer eventually wins in the end. The only way we don't is if there is someone willing to subsidize an agenda.Commentary courtesy of The YOY reduction in subscribers has not gone over well as evidenced by Disney share price trends. However, Disney and other streaming services are going the route of higher monetization per user at this point versus service price cuts to attract a greater number of eyeballs. This is bound to happen as price increases take hold and ads are placed across all the platforms.Disney also has the advantage as evidenced by the Charter deal, to migrate their content to other streaming services outside of Disney  where companies like Netflix do not enjoy that advantage. While they may not increase their subscriber revenue through this, the ad revenue will still be theirs. Ads on streaming will be the new norm and the key to higher margins.Disney is looking to Double Down on the Long term debt has seen a decline from its peak at near  60 Billion, now down to  48 Billion. Current assets are solid at near  30 Billion. The EBIT net interest expense ratio is a healthy 5x. Not amazing, but ample coverage.

AMD's Consolidation Presents Strong Price Development (Technical Analysis),"  is scheduled to  for Q3 2023 post-market on October 31, 2023. While the company anticipates growth in both revenue and earnings due to robust product demand, there are heightened risks stemmingIn , AMD delivered commendable revenue figures, further cementing its pivotal position in the semiconductor sector. Even with an operating deficit, the company's financial results were noteworthy, particularly from a non-GAAP perspective. This piece picks up from my , offering an updated snapshot and highlighting potential investment avenues for long-term investors. Notably, the stock price has held its ground, and its consolidation at crucial thresholds suggests a bullish price development.In Q2 2023, AMD reported a  of  5.4 billion, marking a notable presence in the semiconductor industry. Their official releaseDr. Lisa Su, AMD's Chair and CEO, emphasized the significant ramping up of 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors. A massive increase was observed in AI engagements, with a seven-fold rise during this quarter alone. This was attributed to customers initiating or expanding their programs, primarily supporting the future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. The company is also gearing up for the launch and ramp-up of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Segment-wise, the Data Center segment revenue came in at  1.3 billion, a decline of 11  YoY, yet a sequential increase of 2 . Despite facing a drop of 54  YoY due to a weaker PC market and supply chain inventory corrections, the Client segment managed a sequential growth of 35 . Moreover, the Gaming segment faced a 4  YoY decline, with its revenue being  1.6 billion. In contrast, the Embedded segment saw an uplifting 16  YoY increase, totaling a revenue of  1.5 billion.Significant events and strategic movements also marked Q2 2023. At the Data Center and AI Technology Premier event, AMD unveiled two new 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors optimized for different workloads. Some of the event's other highlights were partnerships with industry leaders such as Hugging Face and PyTorch and robust networking portfolios. Cloud giants like AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft Azure, and OCI embraced 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors for new instances. Gaming and commercial PC users also have new products to look forward to, with the introduction of the Ryzen Z1 Series processors and the Radeon  RX 7600 graphics card.Strategically, AMD is set to invest  135 million to amplify its adaptive computing research in Ireland, targeting next-gen AI, data centers, and 6G communication infrastructure. Finally, the appointment of Phil Guido as the chief commercial officer, coming from a 30-year tenure at IBM, promises to bring in fresh strategic insights for AMD's global operations.AMD is scheduled to announce the Q3 2023 earnings on 31 October 2023. For Q3 2023, AMD expects growth in both revenue and earnings owing to solid demand for its products. The revenue is expected to hover around the  5.7 billion mark, with a potential variation of  300 million. Additionally, the company projects its non-GAAP gross margin to be close to 51 . Surpassing these expectations with positive results could significantly boost AMD's stock price.In the previous article, a deep dive was taken into the pronounced bullish trends observed in yearly and quarterly charts. The article emphasized how the notable downturn of 2022 was counteracted by strong bullish formations, suggesting a potential rise in momentum. This steep decline in 2022 can be traced back to the wick on 2021's yearly candle. Further insights from the quarterly charts revealed a pronounced breakout from the 38.2  Fibonacci retracement mark at  102.25. This threshold was pivotal for bullish momentum, and a second consecutive quarterly close above it only solidified this perspective.Additionally, the critical reversal candle touching a low of  54.57, backed by staunch support at the 61.8  Fibonacci retracement of  63.83, suggests that the bottom was hit, and an upward trajectory was expected. The weekly chart corroborated this bullish view, showcasing a completed inverted head and shoulders and a descending broadening wedge. It's also worth noting that any monthly close below  102.25 could hint at further declines. Yet, with September 2023 closing at  102.82, the market seems to maintain its bullish stance. To sum it up, the prior article posited that the price adjustment in AMD offers a prime buying opportunity for long-term investors.As previously discussed, AMD has held its pivotal levels and now exhibits a more bullish trajectory. The monthly chart below showcases the long-term foundational development from 2001 to 2019. This robust foundation was surpassed in 2019, marked by the red trendline, which served as the bullish base's neckline. Leading up to this breakthrough, the price had carved an ascending broadening wedge delineated by the blue trendlines. When these patterns were surmounted, the stock witnessed a significant upward movement.Several factors fueled this surge. At the forefront, AMD experienced a surge in demand for its Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, allowing it to snatch market shares from its rivals in desktop and data center domains. These products' standout performance and efficiency branded AMD as a potent contender against established market leaders. Furthermore, the global semiconductor landscape saw a general uptick, propelled by the digital revolution during COVID-19, growing cloud computing needs, and the increasing integration of electronics across industries. AMD's strategic alliances, relentless innovation, and successful roadmap implementation amplified investor trust, reflected in the stock's impressive performance during this period.Nevertheless, as highlighted in the previous discussion, the market's robust correction halted at  54.56. This bounce-back is a positive sign, hinting at a potential upward journey. Moreover, the RSI on the monthly chart is comfortably above 50.Conversely, the updated weekly chart highlights the stock's challenge in sustaining above the blue trendline. The pullback from the peak of  132.83 is attributed to fulfilling the descending broadening wedge pattern's target. Additionally, the RSI has edged above its midpoint, suggesting potential support at this crucial level.Moreover, the latest market pullback is better visualized on the subsequent weekly chart. It reveals a correction from  132.83 that has formed a bull flag pattern. A breach above  125 could potentially trigger a significant upward rally. The observation underlines the bullish stance for AMD, reinforced by a pronounced inverted head and shoulders pattern with the head at  54.57 and shoulders at  71.60 and  81.02, combined with the emerging bullish flag.Investors may consider increasing long positions at the present rates, given that the consolidation at critical levels, coupled with the appearance of a bull flag and inverted head and shoulders, signals an upward momentum.Various factors, including global supply chain dynamics and inventory adjustments, threaten AMD's performance and stability. The notable 54  YoY drop in the Client segment due to a struggling PC market and supply chain inventory changes underscores this vulnerability. While the company has shown the capability to manage certain industry pitfalls, continued disruptions or any imbalance between supply and demand can jeopardize its revenue, profit margins, and its place in the competitive landscape.External macroeconomic factors, such as potential economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, and unexpected global incidents, can further unsettle AMD's operations and stock value. The competitive landscape is also challenging, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Intel's earnings. Underperformance against these market expectations, especially in critical areas like data centers or client sales, can cause significant stock price fluctuations. Additionally, the possibility of competitors introducing groundbreaking technologies or aggressive pricing strategies remains a consistent threat to AMD's market dominance. On a technical note, if the stock closes below  102.25 in a month, it could drop to  63.82, but a monthly close beneath  63.83 would challenge the long-term optimistic forecast.AMD displayed a robust revenue performance in Q2 2023, asserting its prominence in the semiconductor sector. While the company faced particular challenges, such as an operating loss, its non-GAAP figures and continued growth under Dr. Lisa Su's leadership spotlight its potential and adaptability. The introduction of the latest EPYC and Ryzen processors, coupled with a significant rise in AI engagements, underscores AMD's forward momentum. Various segments within the company showed mixed results, with major product releases and strategic partnerships further enhancing the company's market position. AMD's upcoming investment in Ireland showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in adaptive computing. However, the future brings both optimistic projections and uncertainties due to broader economic influences.From a technical standpoint, AMD displays a robust bullish trend through pronounced price patterns. The appearance of the inverted head and shoulders combined with the bull flag formation bolsters the bullish argument presented in the previous article. As a result, investors might think about increasing long positions to capitalize on the potential upward surge. AMD is set to reveal its Q3 2023 earnings in a few days, which could catalyze AMD's next significant movement.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Sociedad Química Y Minera De Chile: Get Ready To Buy,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  shares have derated on falling LCE  Lithium Carbonate Equivalent  prices and concession renewal or nationalization risk. In addition I see potential for downgrades post 3Q23 results on high consensus estimates. However, the sharesEV auto sales and penetration are  than anticipated. Falling car prices, higher fuel costs, government rebates, and charging infrastructure expansion have combined toAfter skyrocketing to over US 80kg,  are back to a healthier US 20kg as supply and demand balanced. For SQM this is a sweet spot that allows for over 40  gross margins, free cash flow to continue to fund expansion, and keeps higher cost assets from entering the market at a reckless pace. at US 20kg makes many key   without subsidies  and with high environmental costs, according to recent data by  and . If spot prices continue to decline, new capacity may get stalled or need to look for long-term supply contracts to fund mines and chemical conversion.In addition, LCE is not yet a commodity like oil or copper, actual transactions and the ability to hedge, and buy forward contracts, are in diapers. The market is still largely based on bilateral negotiations between mining companies, chemical converters, battery makers, and automakers. Demand in China may have paused but in the USA and Europe, it's increasing. In my view, the China spot price is a guide but not likely what SQM or other non-China companies are realizing with customers.A process that promises to further enhance the cost competitiveness of brines vs rock or clay lithium fields. As illustrated in an  by Goldman Sachs , the Latin American brines could expand share via low-cost environmentally benign technology. DLE may reduce processing time and increase yields. Thus, if and when SQM can renew its concession that would very likely be accompanied by a DLE expansion project and enhance capacity and cost competitiveness.Post 2Q23 guidance I have adjusted volumes and now I assume a lower LCE price of US 20kg going forward  vs 30k in 2H23 . This may reduce gross margins from 50  to 40  as seen in the table below. Note that cash cost estimates decline in YE24 as new capacity comes online. SQM has been growing very rapidly adding costs faster than revenue that can't always be capexed.For the other segments of the company, I assume Iodine continues to see near US 70kg prices and over 60  margins. Specialty fertilizers and Potash improve on higher agricultural and natural gas prices while industrial chemicals are flat. I continue to value SQM at 10x EV EBITDA, this has been it's historic multiple and coincides with a DFC valuation and long term growth rates. However, the market has de rated SQM down to 5x and the consensus price target uses an implied 5.8x multiple. This de-rating is also evident in many peers such as Albemarle , Livent , Ganfeng  and Tianqi. Part of the rationale for this lower multiple is that LCE prices spiked and would fall, which they have. Yet the market continues to discount the sector due to price volatility, much as is seen in the oil and iron ore sector. However, I believe this sector should not be considered a pure commodity given that LCE, or Lithium Carbonate Equivalent as the name implies, is not pure lithium, this is a specialty chemical compound with varying formulations.The second reason for SQMs derating is due to recent political risk, the famous nationalization threat. This is very unlikely to come to fruition for many reasons, the primary one is that the current government has almost zero political power and no budget to acquire SQM's assets at a reasonable price. At present there is no bill in front of Congress to enact its  take over  proposal of lithium assets via joint ventures where the government controls the assets  51  but does not contribute capital. The only action reported by SQM and in the media is that Codelco  national copper mining company  has been tasked with negotiating the concession renewal  which expires in 2030 . In my view, Chile is not going to nationalize anything.When if the concession renewal is announced the valuation may jump several points, which would also be positive for ALB. There is considerable upside risk to SQM's valuation.My current estimates, that use LCE prices of US 20kg from 3Q23 forward, are at the low end of consensus. This is a problem, if SQM does realize LCE prices at this level, there could be a rash of downgrades that would not be positive for the shares. Thus, it may be worthwhile waiting for 3Q23 result before buying the stock.Buy SQM post 3Q23 results. Consensus may need to correct for lower LCE prices. However, at US 20kg for LCE prices going forward, SQMs valuation is cheap at 5x EV EBITDA, which has room to re-rate on less volatile LCE prices and more importantly, resolution of the concession renewal.

There Might Not Be Another Chance Like This For Years,"There is a crazy mismatch in the market right now as it concerns real estate investment trusts  REITs  between  and .Second-quarter REIT earnings releases thus far have been almostCompare the 12-month performance of the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  to that of the S P 500  and Nasdaq 100-Index The market seems to be convinced that REITs are facing serious and long-lasting headwinds that will meaningfully damage their ability to grow in the long run. Therefore, many investors are avoiding REITs altogether rather than looking for value.We think this pessimistic sentiment basicallyLet's address all three points and finish by taking a look at five high-quality REITs trading at what we view as crazy discounts to their fair values and fundamental performances.On the first point, if you watch financial media for any length of time, you'll inevitably hear commentators equating  commercial real estate  with office buildings, and we all know the difficulties facing office real estate right now amid the new hybrid work environment.Even industry insiders sometimes equate the two. See, for example, the title given to this sentiment survey from the Real Estate RoundtableThe survey is about  CRE, but stress in  CRE in particular appears to be dragging down sentiment for all CRE.What about the idea that a big drop in downtown office utilization and values will have a negative effect on the cities in which they're located  Keep in mind that most non-office real estate properties, and most of the properties in REITs' portfolios, are located  of downtown areas.It isn't a big leap in the mind of the average investor to go from  commercial real estate  to  REITs.  You need only look at the occupancy rates of the four main sectors of CRE to discover that REITs do not equal office.While office occupancy has indeed plummeted since the onset of COVID-19, occupancy of apartments, retail, and industrial remains at or near their highs.The market treats REITs as totally helpless in the face of rising interest rates, almost mechanically discounting REITs as rates ratchet higher.But the market seems to forget that REITs have professional management teams whose job it is to maximize rent and minimize interest costs. Most of them do a very good job at this.Hence we find that REITs' total FFO has surged higher since the onset of COVID-19Moreover, REITs' weighted average debt maturity sits at about 8 years, and  generally speaking  relatively few of their loans mature and require refinancing on any given year. During the low interest rate period of 2020 and 2021, REITs very actively refinanced debt, pushing out maturity dates as far as they could. Many of them, like Alexandria Real Estate  and NNN REIT  refinanced expiring debt with 30-year bonds during that period.That is why the weighted average interest rate on REITs' debt has only barely budged higher in the last year even as interest rates have surged.Of course, the longer interest rates remain elevated, the higher their weighted average interest rates will go. But while higher rates are a short-term headwind, they can be a long-term tailwind, because of the next point.In the long run, higher interest rates  combined with higher labor and construction costs  act as a massive boon to commercial real estate and especially to REITs, because it will result in far fewer new development projects coming to market.As we all learned in Econ 101, the economy is basically operated on supply and demand. If the supply of something stays flat while demand grows, the price typically goes up. This is true of real estate as much as for any other sector of the economy.When interest rates and input costs go up, development of new real estate properties grinds to a halt, which leads to fewer new properties coming to market to compete with the existing stock a year or two down the road.That's exactly what we've seen happening over the last year or so in the CRE development industry.Here's a chart showing sentiment among CRE developers related to their views of whether various components will be higher or lower in 12 months' time.As you can see, over the past year, they have mostly viewed occupancy and rents as headed higher while construction and labor costs have likewise headed higher. Only recently have developers started to see the light at the end of the tunnel for construction costs -- envisioning an end to materials cost increases.What does this do to development activity  It causes much less of it to be greenlit.Take a look at this chart of industrial  on the left  and multifamily  on the right  construction starts going back 10 yearsAlthough starts spiked in 2021 and early 2022, they have since  to very low levels as the costs of land, labor, materials, and capital have soared. The same thing is happening all across the CRE spectrum right now. Very few new projects are breaking ground for any type of real estate.What does this mean for REITs  It means that after the  manageable  wave of new supply of properties comes to market this year and next year, there will be a steep drop-off in 2025-2026 and potentially beyond that.Less supply combined with growing demand should result in rising rent rates.Let's briefly look at five REITs that we believe exhibit this huge mismatch between strong fundamental performance and weak investor sentiment. To illustrate, we'll just use one valuation metric  price to operating cash flow  or  CFO , because cash flow is one of real estate's primary channels of delivering returns.First off   , a triple-net lease REIT focused on investment grade, single-tenant retail properties leased to the nation's leading retailers like Walmart , T.J. Maxx , Tractor Supply Co. , and Home Depot .ADC enjoys a BBB credit rating, very little debt maturing before 2028, the highest quality tenant roster in the net lease REIT space, and a skilled management team. And yet, ADC is near its cheapest valuation of any time in the last five years.At a price of around  69, ADC trades at a price to AFFO of 17.5x, compared to its 5-year average of 19.6x.Next up, consider  , the only pure-play life science REIT that owns and develops state-of-the-art, Class A research   development properties in the nation's most innovative research clusters. The REIT just  an earnings beat on continued strong demand for its top-tier lab space, even if leasing and rent rate growth is normalizing from its elevated, COVID-era levels. ARE also enjoys a BBB  credit rating and no debt maturing before 2025.And yet, partially in response to activist REIT investor Jonathan Litt's short report, the REIT trades near its lowest valuation in 5 years.At a price of  127.50, ARE trades at a price to AFFO of 16.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 25.5x.Much the same could be said about US-based telecommunications REIT  , which owns a vast network of wireless towers, small cells, and fiber across the country. The market seems to be focused on the fact that management slightly trimmed AFFO per share guidance for 2023, lowering their growth estimate from 3  to 2 .Moreover, the market also seems pessimistic about management's repeated assertion that CCI will be able to return to growth after 2025, when the last of Sprint's lease cancellations take effect. Given the huge rise in mobile data usage and carriers' need to continue investing to facilitate that traffic, I believe management in their assertion that dividend growth will return to 7-8  annually in 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, CCI's BBB credit rating and modest debt maturities in 2023-2024 exude strength.And yet, CCI's valuation has gone off a cliffAt a price of  112.50, CCI trades at a price to AFFO of 14.9x, compared to its 5-year average of 23.0x.Turning to the self-storage space, we believe one of the strongest names in this area is  , which recently solidified its scale advantage by acquiring peer Life Storage. EXR now commands the  1 market share in U.S. self-storage at 13.2  of the market. Like ARE, EXR's ultra-strong pandemic-era performance is in the process of normalizing, especially as the housing market cools and fewer people are moving. EXR also enjoys a BBB credit rating and a manageable amount of debt maturing this year and next year.And yet, the market is valuing EXR  than it did prior to COVID-19.At a price of  144.50, EXR trades at a price to AFFO of 17.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 22.3x.Finally, in the industrial space, consider  , the premier owner of high-quality, infill industrial properties in the extremely supply-constrained Southern California market. Management calls the industrial supply shortage in Southern California  virtually incurable,  and this shortage has spurred peer-leading rent and NOI growth. Over the last five years, REXR's NOI has grown at a CAGR of 39 , and after Q2 2023, in-place rents on its existing portfolio remained 50  below market, implying significant organic growth ahead.REXR is truly firing on all cylinders while also enjoying one of the strongest balance sheets in REITdom with a BBB  credit rating, and yet the market is pricing it significantly  than it was before COVID-19.At a price of  56.75, REXR trades at a price to AFFO of 26.0x, compared to its 5-year average of 39.5x.REIT fundamentals across almost all sectors remain strong, and the decrease in development activity today implies that a favorable supply environment will be in effect in a few years' time. And yet, the market is pricing many top-tier REITs as if growth is coming to an end and temporarily elevated interest rates will permanently eat into REITs' profits.As for us at High Yield Landlord, we will follow the fundamentals, not investor sentiment.If you want full access to our Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us at High Yield Landlord for a We are the largest and best-rated real estate investor community on Seeking Alpha with 2,500  members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 500  reviewsYou won't be charged a penny during the free trial, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Jussi Askola is the President of Leonberg Capital, a value-oriented investment boutique that consults hedge funds, family offices, and private equity firms on REIT investing.

What I Wish I Knew Before Buying High Yield Stocks,"Thanks to the rapid rise of interest rates over the past year and a half, alongside geopolitical, inflationary, and other macroeconomic headwinds, high yield stocks have rarely been more attractively priced than they are today. Just take a look at what some ofClearly, there is an attractive combination of value and quality available in the high yield space. That said, the sector is far from a guaranteed ticket to financial independence and riches. For every high quality and sustainable high yield stock out there, there are many more that are ticking time bombs. As a result, while high yield investing can certainly be a very lucrative and rewarding approach to investing, it a requires knowledgeable, prudent approach to avoid suffering large long-term losses.Here are two lessons that I wish I had learned before investing in high yielding stocksMany times, management teams will make rosy projections about their company's ability to deliver strong long-term growth alongside paying out a very attractive dividend. While management does  hopefully  have the clearest view of the performance of and outlook for their business, they do not always share an honest assessment of the true state of their business. Sometimes, they may even be giving their best assessment, but they lack the foresight to properly understand the macroeconomic and or competitive threats coming their way.Two classic examples of this from my own experience were Algonquin Power   Utilities  and Lumen Technologies .AQN had a very impressive history of delivering a consistent  10  dividend per share CAGR over the course of about a decade. The company had a robust growth pipeline fueled by a powerful one-two punch of its renewables business segment and its regulated utilities business segment. Moreover, it had an investment grade balance sheet and the dividend yield looked quite attractive at over 5  following a pullback in the stock price. With management continuing to guide for robust dividend growth in the years to come, I bought shares, taking management at its word.However, if I had taken more care to look under the hood, I would have seen that they actually had considerable exposure to floating interest rates and were taking on a lot of leverage to finance their aggressive growth pipeline. With interest rates soaring in 2022, AQN got caught swimming naked when the tide went out  to borrow from a . As a result, it was forced to slash its dividend and the stock price plunged, burning me and many other gullible investors who had trusted management's guidance.Fortunately, in the case of LUMN, I sold before the massive dividend cut, but this was another case of a company that continued to speak glowingly of its strong growth potential that would be fueled by the  4th Industrial Revolution  all while also pitching its  1 per share dividend as a top capital allocation priority that would be sustained through the pivot to growth.Once management quietly removed this priority from its slide show, I asked the company point blank about it, and they tried to talk around it. Thankfully, I sensed something was going on and sold my shares, and sure enough, shortly thereafter, management not only cut the dividend, but actually totally eliminated it. Since then, the stock has completely cratered as it has failed miserably in its efforts to pivot to growth. Sadly, investors who failed to jump ship have been burned badly as over the past year LUMN stock has lost over 84  of its value.While management guidance and commentary can be very useful, never ever take it as gospel truth. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions when you get a chance to speak to a company. Oftentimes, how they answer questions on earnings calls and when you speak with them says as much, if not more, than what they actually say.Another lesson I wish that I had learned before investing in high yield stocks is that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors. Yes, I am a bottom-up investor who focuses on company-level fundamentals and valuations when making investment decisions and I generally do not make macroeconomic forecasts and therefore do not make my investment decisions based on where I think the economy is headed. However, that does not mean that I should be totally blind to what is happening in the broader economy when allocating capital.What I mean by this is that sometimes it is clear what is going on in the broader economy and what the ramifications will be for a stock in my portfolio. Even if the stock looks deeply undervalued and likely to deliver attractive returns over the course of a full economic cycle, it may be apparent that the current economic situation will cause excessive distress for the business. As a result, market sentiment may be highly likely to remain negative on the stock for the foreseeable future and in some cases, a dividend cut may be highly likely as well, further exacerbating market sentiment.A classic example of this was recently seen in the apparel sector. A stock that I owned was Hanesbrands . It had recently brought on an impressive new CEO who was previously a senior executive at Walmart  and was implementing an impressive plan to improve the company's brands, supply chain, and operating efficiencies. However, it quickly became apparent that a perfect storm of macro events was transpiring that were leading to an unmistakable solution. Inflation was soaring, interest rates were spiking, a prolonged imbalance in supply and demand, and an out of the blue cyber-attack on the company exacerbated its fairly heavily leveraged balance sheet and left management with little choice but to eliminate the dividend. Throughout this entire process the stock price continued to plummet, yet, given my focus on the long-term disconnect between supply and demand and principled agnostic approach to macro factors, I held the whole way down through the dividend cut. Given that I am an income investor, I ended up selling the stock after the dividend was eliminated.In hindsight, I should have seen the writing on the wall much earlier in the process and sold the stock at a much smaller loss than I ended up doing after the dividend was eliminated. Granted, I got lucky and was able to recycle the capital into New York Community Bancorp  right near its bottom during the March crash in the banking sector, leading to me gaining back much of my losses on HBI in short order. However, my handling of the HBI investment was still a clear mistake. Was my initial investment a mistake in the sense that my reasoning was wrong  I don't believe so. The fundamentals and valuation seemed to clearly indicate that HBI was undervalued, but the macroeconomic and black swan factors - which are highly unpredictable - conspired against it and sent the stock tumbling. This is just part of investing and is why I diversify my portfolio. However, my mistake was holding HBI for as long as I did despite the clear headwinds facing the stock. I should have just eaten my losses and moved on at a much earlier stage in the process.Now is clearly an exceptional time to invest in high yield stocks given where valuations sit. However, investors should not jump in head first into the sector recklessly. Many high yield stocks are high yield for a reason.While I certainly value management's opinion and listen closely to the earnings calls, investor presentations, and the answers they give in my interviews with them, I have learned the hard way that just because a management team says that its high yield is  safe  does not mean that it really is.Moreover, while I am a big believer in taking a bottom-up approach to investing and not making investment decisions based on macroeconomic forecasts, I also believe that it is foolish to completely ignore macroeconomic factors once it becomes obvious that they are going to force one of your holdings to slash its dividend and potentially even face financial distress.By taking these lessons along with many others into account when investing in high yield stocks, investors can avoid painful dividend cuts and the steep principal losses that almost always accompany them.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Tesla: Onward And Upward,"During 3Q23,   produced 430,488 vehicles and delivered 435,059. Last quarter, the company produced and delivered 479,700 and 466,140 automobiles. The sequential decline was anticipated, as TSLA had announced downtime at its production facilities for upgrades duringTSLA is  Q3 2023 financial results on or about October 19. For the period, analysts anticipate  24.7 billion in revenues and  0.65 in GAAP earnings per share. Based on the number of Teslas delivered during the quarter, we expect actual results to come in below consensus estimates, on the top line and bottom line. However, although we anticipate a decline in revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to the shortfall in the sequentialWith respect to margins, despite the softer revenues, we expect higher gross margins on a sequential basis, driven by the increase in Model Y MSRP, decrease in commodity prices, labor efficiencies due to greater automation, and depreciation. However, profit margins are likely to come in lighter on a quarter-over-quarter basis, based on expenses related to the ramp in production associated with the Cybertruck and the Megapack, as well as additional spending on artificial intelligence. Consequently, earnings per share are likely to decline compared to the previous quarter, while coming in higher than a year ago.Considering that the TSLA story has not radically shifted during the third quarter, we reiterate our  492 share Price Target derived utilizing a 10-year Discounted Cash Flow model, that incorporates a 10-year normalized revenue growth rate of 50 , a profit margin of 10 , operating cash flow margin of 18 , yearly capital expenditures of 2 , average cost of capital of 7 , and a perpetual growth rate of 3 . Reiterate Buy Rating. With whispers that Cybertruck launch paraphernalia is being sent out, it appears that the vehicle's debut event is drawing close. Given that pick-up truck sales account for 20  of the U.S. automobile market, the lack of a pick-up truck among TSLA's models was a glaring gap, that was necessary to plug. Therefore, we are excited about the Cybertruck eventually becoming a reality.In regard to the competition, Ford Motor Company's  F-Series vehicles are the best-selling pick-up trucks in America, followed by General Motors'  Chevrolet Silverado models. F's F-150 Lightning is an EV pick-up truck with a range of 320 miles, towing facility of 7,700 lbs, and MSRP of  50,000 on the base model. Chevrolet Silverado EV version has a range of 400 miles, towing capacity of 10,000 lbs, and a price tag of  52,000 on the base model. Relatively, the Cybertruck has a range of up to 500 miles and towing facility of 14,000 lbs. Nevertheless, we view the entire line-up of Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado models, including the internal combustible engine  ICE  pick-up trucks as potential competition for the Cybertruck.Although, based on the Cybertruck's novel features and specifications, we expect strong demand out-of-the-gate, deliveries are likely to initially lag demand, due to the manufacturing complexity associated with the vehicle. However, as demand continues to ratchet, the gap between supply and demand is likely to narrow, as TSLA allocates additional resources to benefit from the popularity of the Cybertruck. In our opinion, sales of the Cybertruck, which, given the vehicle's niche appearance is considered to lack mass appeal, will surprise significantly on the upside.In addition, although, our argument might appear cliched, similar to the iPhone, the Cybertruck represents a paradigm shift within its industry. The iPhone captured customer attention because of the additional value it provided relative to other smartphones. We believe the incremental value the Cybertruck provides over the typical pick-up truck will reflect in a surge in vehicle sales, over time. In our opinion, the UAW strike afflicting F, GM, and Stellantis  is unlikely to benefit TSLA. Although we believe that the shutdown at the factories of the impacted firms is likely to be successful, the companies will absorb the increase in labor costs rather than risk raising product prices and turning uncompetitive. The automobile industry is highly profitable in absolute dollar terms, with F and GM guiding to 2023 net income of between  10 billion to  12 billion and  9.3 billion to 10.7 billion, respectively. Considering that labor costs account for 4  to 5  of the average cost of producing a vehicle, the impact of higher employee wages and benefits on the bottom line is unlikely to be crippling.Moreover, it is hardly a zero-sum game. Up until the UAW demanded a resurrection of the living wage raises, defined pension plans, and removal of wage tiers, the requests appear reasonable. However, when it comes to wrangling a 40  pay raise for workers, the UAW terms appear onerous, and will only escalate the trend towards automation of core production functions at automobile companies, in our judgment.Net-net, a potential success of the UAW strike will likely decrease profit margins at F, GM, and STLA, over the short term. Longer term, the impasse represents a margin expansion opportunity as hiring is replaced by automation, bolstering our argument that F's, GM's and STLA's loss is not TSLA's gain. The Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  mandate  including  400 billion in funding  to encourage the purchase of green energy technologies matches up nicely with TSLA's mission to design, manufacture, and market products that accelerate the earth's transformation to renewable energy. Consequently, along with customer subsidies on the MSRP of a majority of TSLA's EV models, the company's energy storage solutions are similarly advantaged with retail and corporate purchases of the firm's battery storage systems  Powerwall and Megapack  eligible for up to  30  in tax credits on the cost of the products.In addition, the IRA has earmarked  12 billion in entitlements to escalate the development and deployment of clean energy systems in rural communities across America, which will necessitate the utilization of battery storage technologies. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  USDA  entrusted with managing the venture, has received funding requests for up to 2x the 9.7 billion overlay allocated by Federal authorities. In addition, given our opinion that the nation is highly likely to achieve the target of 60  solar wind generated power by 2030 compared to the current 13 , large utility companies are likely to turn to TSLA for their battery storage requirements as they shift the electricity grid towards dependence on renewable energy sources.Further, it is notable that TSLA's energy storage business is global with mega-scale projects that depend on the firm's Megapacks, active in Europe and Australia, with additional projects under development in the geographies. Moreover, TSLA recently tabled a proposal with the Indian government to produce and market the Powerwall in the country. Although Indian officials balked at providing the firm with incentives for manufacturing, it appears that subsidizing customer purchases of the Powerwall is under discussion.With the Megapack backordered until Q3 2024 and favorable market conditions, TSLA appears to be increasing focus on its energy storage business. In that regard, it launched a Megafactory in China, over the summer, and has stated that its objective is to add several facilities over the short term.Overall, with what appears to be another strong quarter behind it, TSLA is well-positioned to charge ahead. Onward and upward.Considering the highly volatile nature of TSLA shares, they undoubtedly offer an opportunity to generate returns through day trading and other short holding period arrangements. However, TSLA is an investment story, not a trading story. Folks that Buy and Hold TSLA stock for longer time horizons are like to secure greater gains on investment with virtually zero risk relative to traders timing the market in the company's shares.Tesla, Inc. is a prudently managed firm with products that are key participants in growing markets with fragmented competition. We believe TSLA has high growth in revenues and earnings locked in for at least the next ten years. Buy, Buy, Buy  on pullbacks .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Adyen Simplified,"I recently produced an in-depth review of Adyen's   H1 2023 report as well asWhile I feel I was as comprehensive as possible in my review, I recently came across market share data that has been in my mind over the years for Adyen, but which I've been unable to locate. As I mentioned in the introductory bullet points, this data is, in some sense, the entire thesis.Specifically, this data illustrates a few key aspects of the Adyen investment thesisWith these ideas as our platform, let's begin this abridged version of my Adyen thesis.As I've shared in the past, Adyen could likely be considered to be the best FinTech on earth presently. Perhaps, it could be argued that Stripe  holds this crown, but, as the data in the concluding thoughts of this note will reveal, Adyen is a vastly more capital-efficient business relative to Stripe, while growing at essentially parity and while having fielded a platform at essentially product and feature parity.Additionally, as the TAM data that I will share with you in a moment demonstrates, Adyen has a very long runway for growth.So we have a fantastic combination of quality and capital efficiency, alongside elevated growth prospects.With these ideas in mind, let's turn to a review of Adyen's valuation.For a company that could grow sales, and, by extension, free cash flow per share, at 20   which would be below management's guidance  annualized for the next 10 years, a 3.4  free cash flow yield is quite fantastic.And this does not include future share repurchase programs, which its legacy peers, such as Fiserv , have executed with brilliant success.To add just a bit of extra information here by which you may become a more educated investor, Adyen's 3.4  yield is quite attractive in light of its growth prospects and in light of the reality that it is likely the best FinTech on earth. This yield is vastly, vastly more attractive than the sub 2  yield investors were offered historically.Additionally, the rise of Adyen's yield is not mysterious.On the heels of the fastest interest rate hiking cycle in American history, the 10 year treasury yield, against which Adyen's yield principally competes for investor capital  the result of which influences supply and demand for Adyen's security  therefore, share price , now finds itself at about 4.6 .Academic finance suggests that Adyen should trade such that we get the risk free rate   risk premium, which would suggest that Ayden should trade with a free cash flow yield of 5 .For current owners, this likely sounds like a scary prospect, but for prospective owners, such a valuation would likely yield 25 , or quite likely more, annualized returns in the decades ahead, as the company grows at 20  and begins repurchasing shares.All of this being said, Adyen does not offer a risk premium, nor does its yield trade at parity with the 10 year treasury yield, and I believe this makes sense  While investors in the 10 year will only receive 4.9  per annum, granted they hold to maturity, investors in Adyen will witness the free cash flow yield  note not actual yield  on their investment grow very materially in the decade ahead, especially if Adyen begins repurchasing shares with its excess free cash flow, which it likely will at some point in the decade ahead.The principal impetus behind crafting this abridged version of the Adyen thesis was my recent receipt of the TAM data that has eluded me for the last couple of years or so.Adyen, like essentially all of our businesses, has grown within a giant TAM populated by legacy incumbents and a diverse set of point solutions.Adyen has vertically integrated the aforementioned point solutions into one acquiring platform tech stack, and it has done so on a single source of code. This has resulted in a more feature-rich, cost-effective, and versatile platform  especially for global, multi-national enterprises , which has afforded Adyen the market share capture we can see in the chart below.Additionally, we can see the highly fragmented nature of this industry, within which Adyen continues to grow due to the nature of its platform. That is, its growth within this fragmented TAM has been a byproduct of the nature and configuration of its platform, which you may review belowAdyen is a quintessential example of a business that fits within my Inverse Bubble Framework  a term I coined , as well as our first and third foundational investment frameworks.  As I mentioned towards the introduction of this note, Adyen is arguably the best FinTech on earth at present, and the financial data below confirms this reality in my mindAs we can see, Adyen's leadership has demonstrated a  aptitude for capital allocation relative to the leadership of Stripe.Adyen has grown faster with vastly less required capital, and Adyen and Stripe are effectively at product parity today.To close, some have told me they do not like FinTech  to which I would respond,  Fair, but have you seen the returns of legacy FinTechs from whom Adyen or Marqeta continue to capture market shareBelow, we can see the returns of Fiserv and Global Payments over the last 40 and 20 years respectively.Today, we have the opportunity to buy the very, very best FinTechs on earth at value  to deep value .Both of these businesses have truly giant cash hoards and no debt, as well as very profitable unit economics and long runways for growth.Thank you for reading, and have a great day.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,"The notion that history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically, stocks and treasury yields  interest rates  are inversely proportional. As risk-free interest rates rise, equitiesHowever, as soon as long-duration  10-year  treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at  4.25 , the S P-500 formed a local top in mid-July and has since declined by nearly 8   with 10-year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5.001  last week .Now, the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by  extremely poor  breadth, with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few mega-cap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indices.Interestingly, the rally in big tech has been driven by significant P E multiple expansion  and not fundamental earnings growth . Given the steep rise in long-duration treasury yields, such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic. The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their  safe-haven  status  massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets  as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy. In one of my recent notes, I shared my views on the significant concentration into big-cap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq-100  Now, from a historical standpoint, I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987 - the year of the  Black Monday  crash. In a similar vein to 2023, we can observe a sharp rise in equities and long-duration treasury yields through the summer of 1987  an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship . And as you can see on the chart below, the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on  Black Monday   19th October 1987 , with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a  flight to safety  trade  causing a sharp decline in treasury yields .In today's note, we will try to find an answer to this question, but before we do that, let's understand the drivers of this ongoing wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields.On the back of a 40-year bull run in the bond market  1982-2022 , treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemic-induced inflation, ending the era of free money.During this tightening cycle, the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 5.5  and reduced its balance sheet assets by  1T through run-off of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of  95B per month.While inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022, it is still running well above the  target of 2   September CPI  3.7  y y . With persistent labor market tightness  unemployment rate  3.8  and strong economic data, central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation, and rightly so given past inflationary episodes.For several months, the Fed has insisted that a  higher rates for longer  policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle. And, in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes  despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow, as we know, the  monetary tightening actions and  higher interest rates for longer  stance explain the move higher in short-duration treasury yields. However, long-duration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening  long-term interest rates outpacing short-term interest rates , the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly. And, as of writing, the spread between 10-year and 2-year treasury yields has narrowed down to just -16 bps  from more than -100bps just a few weeks ago .Historically, yield curve uninversions have occurred right before the start of economic recessions, and while stock market investors are big on the idea of a soft landing  with S P-500 trading at  19x P E , leading economic indicators continue to point towards an imminent slowdownNow, higher long-duration bond yields mean tighter financial conditions and slower economic activity. While the bond market is doing some much-needed work on behalf of the Fed in the fight against inflation, the velocity of this move up in long-duration yields is quite incredible, and the longer this goes on, the greater the chance of something breaking in the financial system that eventually leads to a hard landing  recession  in the economyDuring the Q A session of his appearance at the New York Economic Club last week, Powell  on being queried about his understanding of the run-up in the long end of the treasury yield curve  listed out multiple theories that could explain the surge higher in long-duration treasury yields- Given the continued strength in the economy  tight labor market and strong GDP growth , higher interest rates are becoming an ineffective tool for slowing down economic activity or that rates just haven't been higher for longer-  US government debt   33.6T, current fiscal deficit   1.7T, massive treasury issuance from the government, Powell said - we are on an  unsustainable  path fiscally-   reduction of Fed's balance sheet assets, Fed moving from buyer to seller- investors are demanding a higher term premium due to growing expectations that the world is moving into an environment of more supply shocks than demand shocksAnd followed that up with the following commentsBy pointing toward supply-demand dynamics, my opinion is that Powell essentially admitted that the Fed has lost control of the long end of the yield curve. While the Fed's rate hiking campaign is likely on pause for now, the door has been left open for future rate hikes. More importantly, with inflation still running well above its target rate of 2  and Q3 US GDP growth projected to come in at 4 , the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy  switch back to QE  quantitative easing  in the foreseeable future. And without the Fed buying up government treasuries, the wild run-up in long-duration yields may continue for a while, pressurizing valuations of risk assets.Since treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the US government, their yields are considered the risk-free rate in the investing world. In a normalized environment, risk assets like equities tend to offer a premium of 2-3  on top of this risk-free rate. Hence, at this time, the S P-500 should ideally command an earnings yield of 7-8   risk-free rate  10-year treasury yield  of 5    equity risk premium of 2-3 .By inverting this 7-8  earnings yield, we get to a Price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5-14.28x for the S P-500. Considering forward 2024 earnings estimates of  245 for the S P-500, the market is currently trading at a forward P E of 19x. According to the yield math shared above, S P-500 should be trading 25-35  lower than current levels, i.e., in the 2,800 to 3,200 range.In addition to this yield-based repricing, I see additional risk for the S P-500 since consensus analyst estimates are looking for 12  y y earnings growth in 2024 heading into a potential recession. If we do end up getting a garden variety recession, S P-500 earnings could drop by 15-20  next year. And in that bearish scenario, the S P-500 could drop down as low as 2,200 to 2,640  2024 S P-500 earnings   176-185, P E multiple  12.5-14.28x .From a valuation standpoint, there's ample room for a significant de-rating in the S P-500, with its Shiller PE ratio  28.87x  sitting at extremely elevated levels as you can see on the chart belowYes, the yield math could change quickly if long-duration treasury yields moved back down to 2020-21 lows  however, current economic conditions are unsupportive of such a low-interest rate environment. A Fed pivot and re-introduction of QE-infinitum is probably the only thing that can push rates down to such depths, and while I do expect the Fed to revert back to QE at some point in the future  I believe the Fed Put is currently inactive  due to strong economy and high inflation . This reality doesn't change until and unless something breaks in the financial markets or the economy. And honestly, if something does break, we could see a  crash in the financial markets before the Fed pivots back to quantitative easing.On the back of a sizeable pullback since mid-July, the S P-500 is currently testing the support trendline from the COVID-19  March 2020  and the October 2022 lows. With weekly RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, a massive technical breakdown here is very much on the table.If long-duration treasury yields hold up at elevated levels or continue to climb higher over the coming sessions, equity market selling could pick up here accompanied by a potential spike in VIX  CBOE Volatility Index , which rallied past the 20 level last week.The S P-500  SPY  has support in the 410 to 420 range  however, if we break those levels, then all bets are off, and yes, we could even see the S P-500 experiencing a crash similar to 1987.That said, so far in 2023, SPY has followed seasonality patterns quite well, and numerous analysts have cited strong past performance trends in the November-December period while predicting a year-end rally for stocks  Recent economic data has remained resilient, and Q3 earnings are unlikely to rock the boat. With the Fed virtually on pause now, equity markets can embark on a run higher to close out 2023.Last Friday, SPY closed right under its 200-DMA support level and the trendline of support from October 2022 lows. However, we could be forming a bear trap here, with RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart showing signs of positive divergence.From a sentiment perspective, investors appear to be fearful at this moment in time as indicated by CNN's Fear   Greed Index  currently in  Fear  territoryAhead of a seasonally strong period in a pre-election year, investor sentiment is bearish  fearful  whilst SPY is nearly oversold and trading within a critical support zone. From an ultra near-term perspective, SPY can forge some sort of a bounce here as long as we hold the 410 to 420 support zone  and then resume the downtrend in H1 2024.The immutable laws of money dictate that risk assets such as equities offer a positive risk premium relative to the risk-free rate in the market. With the long end of the treasury yield curve having moved up to  5  in recent weeks, the S P-500 trading at a 4  earnings yield is simply unsustainable, and a de-rating to 7-8  earnings yields would be justified.Given the current state of the economy and Fed chair Powell's recent talk, long-duration treasury yields are likely to move higher from here, not lower. From a valuation and technical perspective, the S P-500 can drop by 25-50  from current levels.As we noted in this article, there are uncanny similarities between 1987 and 2023 up to this point of the year. Will we see a 1987-esque crash  Frankly, I don't know, but under the given set of economic and financial conditions, I simply cannot rule out a stock market crash.Winston Churchill once said -Heading into a potential recession, the equity market  S P-500  valuation reflects a high degree of investor complacency. A 1987-esque may or may not materialize  however, prudent investors must prepare themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes  tail events  in this uncertain environment. Considering the simple yield math behind stock valuations, the S P-500 is ripe for a significant correction. A technical bounce here may delay the inevitable move lower  however, looking at medium-term  1-3 years  risk reward, I rate SPY a  Sell  at current levels.The era of free money is over, and we are now operating in a normalized interest rate environment. With major US equity indices yet to price in the new financial realities, the risk of significant correction or crash remains elevated.In order to navigate this tricky uncertain environment, we are pursuing  Bold, Active Investing with Proactive Risk Management  at our investing group - . Join our community today and take control of your financial future.Ahan Vashi has 10  years of investing experience with a professional background in equity research, private equity, and software engineering.

BP: Significantly Undervalued At Current Oil Prices,"BP  is a well-known major oil player from the UK which has faced challenging conditions in a difficult oil market for the last three years. Despite drastic events  Deepwater Horizon, shale oil expansion, COVID, Rosneft write-off , the company remained aAt the end of the second quarter 2023, BP had 17.38 bn shares outstanding and a total market cap of  112.8 bn as of 09 30 23  share price of  6.49 .The fundamental ratios can be found in the table below, with a peer comparisonsales, EBITDA, earnings, equity and dividend numbers for 2023 in relation to the share prices as of 09 30 23.BP claims the top spot in two fundamental categories  P S and P EBITDA , has the second-highest dividend yield and ranks second and third in the other two categories  P B and P E . If we compare the 5 oil majors by implementing a score system  1. 4, 2. 3, 3. 2, 4. 1, 5. 0 , BP will take the lead.BP has introduced a dividend policy which regularly increases the annual distribution by 4  at  60 per barrel Brent oil after cutting the payout in half in the second quarter of 2020  from 10.5 cents quarter to 5.25 cents quarter  when the pandemic hit the economy. Since then BP has raised the quarterly dividend to 7.27 cents  38.5  or 11.5  p.a.  which exceeds the policy increase of 4 . At current oil prices above  80 per barrel, it is very likely that BP can increase the payout by 10  annually at least.Furthermore, BP is strongly committed to share buybacks of at least . In 2023 BP allocates 60  of surplus cashflow due to high oil prices. Since the end of 2019, BP has already reduced share count by 14.1   from 20.241 bn to 17.379 bn shares . In the second quarter of 2023 BP bought back 323 million shares for around  2 bn. At  60 per barrel BP aims to buy shares for  4 bn but due to a good environment for oil companies, BP has At a current share price of  6,45 and if oil prices remain above  80, BP will buy back nearly 1 billion shares each year which represents a buyback yield of more than 5 . Hence, the dividend and buyback yield combined is close to 10 .BP's earnings have been volatile for years because of major shocks which have been mentioned before  COVID, Rosneft . However, earnings have always recovered strongly when the environment for oil prices were beneficial. What is the current outlook for oil prices and the most likely scenarioThe most important influences on oil prices are supply and demand  1 , economic growth  2  and OPEC policy  3 .Oil prices have recently risen to  91  WTI  and  95  Brent  per barrel, an increase of 33  since June. Global oil demand is expected to rise to while supply plunged to 100.9 mb d in July. In July and August oil demand hit a record of 103 mb d widening the supply gap. Although the supply situation will improve to 101.5 mb d by an increased non-OPEC  oil production, oil demand will exceed oil supply for the next months which will support current oil price levels.The global economic output will . Growth is driven by India, China and other emerging markets while Europe's economy will be outpaced. Economic growth will stabilize oil prices as well as global air traffic which . The global demand for travel is continuously high and consequently, it is likely that global air traffic will surpass pre-pandemic levels which will also boost global oil demand.OPEC  supply fell to 50.2 mb d in July because of a reduced production of Saudi Arabia. The OPEC  countries are interested in a tight market and won't add a significant amount of supply to the global oil production. The group announced a total of 3.7 mb d output cut in April and a revision of this decision is unlikely. OPEC  produces nearly 50  and OPEC 33  of global oil supply. The output cut will limit a production expansion and oil supply won't keep up with economic growth and demand. Hence, the OPEC policy supports high oil prices in the near future.All in all, a scenario with high oil prices above  80 is very likely  60  and has consequences for BP's valuation.The first scenario with the highest probability shows a significant undervaluation of BP. Even if we reduce the buyback amount of  6 bn by  700-800 million share based compensation, the buyback yield in combination with future dividend increases support an upside potential of more than 50 . Furthermore, the downside risks are limited as the worst scenario for oil majors still signals an undervaluation for BP. The higher oil prices climb, the more likely and faster BP can surpass pre-pandemic dividend levels.BP is not only undervalued compared to its peers, the company's shares still would have upside potential if oil prices fell which is not very likely near-term. A combination of economic growth, limited oil supply growth and an increasing demand for air travel are excellent conditions for BP shareholders. In the scenario of high oil prices above  80 per barrel, they can expect increasing dividends and a buyback yield of at least 5 . Finally, the shares have a significant upside potential of 55 .Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

A Rising Interest Rate Freight Train Is Coming For The Economy,"The quiet murmur of rising interest rates has now grown to the roar of an approaching freight train. The 10-year yield continues to rise, hitting a fresh 52-week high this week over 4.3 . The  this week and is now threatening to rise above 8 . After over a decade of zero-interest rate central bank policies  a.k.a. , surging inflation sparked an economic avalanche that threatens to turn the economy and markets as we know it upside down. With massive government deficits, analysts can't seem to raise their targetsSo why are interest rates rising so much  And what does it mean for the economy and financial markets  Let's dig in.The 2010s were a unique time in economic history. Due to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis, global central banks kept interest rates at zero  or less  for roughly 14 years. The US raised interest rates for a couple of years from 2017 to 2019 but ended up cutting them right back to zero due to COVID. In addition, central banks pursued  to push down interest rates on mortgages to below the free market rate. This had even more effect on the economy.Holding interest rates at or near zero had subtle but profound effects on the economy in the 2010s.ZIRP also made certain business models unusually profitable. Friends of mine got rich by doing not much more than borrowing money cheaply and buying real estate. Decent execution of off-the-shelf business models like  or Airbnb hosting made making money a cakewalk. Even simply buying a property for a 3.5  fixed mortgage in the 2010s and putting paint, carpet, and a tenant in it was good enough. During this time, vacant houses in California made about as much money from price appreciation  just by existing  as a typical household living there did by working.Crypto is another business model that took off because of ZIRP. With the economic inputs of interest rates at zero, inflation at 2-3 , and government borrowing a bit unsustainable, putting some of your money in another currency like Bitcoin  actually makes a ton of sense.Of course, the mainstream economic theory here is that by fixing prices for loans at an unnaturally low level, the Fed was going to create shortages. For example, QE created an artificial housing shortage, despite there being a  in the US than there was before the 2008 crash. Still, consumer price inflation was low and everything was fine, at least until around 2019. And low rates were popular with the upper middle class, who saw their home equity increase and their 401ks rise. But, like America's obsession with off-label Ozempic, it was too good to be true.The chaos of the pandemic brought these policies to a rapid end. Inflation surging from 2  to nearly 10  annually shattered the public's trust in price stability. The public started panic buying goods, there were shortages of all kinds of necessary goods and services in the economy, and alternatives to the US dollar became cocktail party conversation. This more or less forced the Fed to act by raising interest rates and reversing its QE policies. Had they not done anything, inflation likely would have continued to rise, as it did in the 1970s.Today, inflation is still significantly above target, and public trust in the currency is still not fully restored. The US government is running , and fewer and fewer investors are willing to buy government debt. Fitch recently downgraded the US's credit rating due to an  and a lack of will to raise taxes. After getting burned by inflation, the market is hitting back.To this point, the market has severely punished the prices of previously issued long-term bonds with low coupon rates. Long-term Treasuries  have fallen off of a cliff.This is simple supply and demand. The Treasury needs to sell trillions of dollars in bonds to cover its budget deficits, and the market has not been keenly interested in buying them. As long as government deficits go unchecked, interest rates will continue to rise. The so-called  from Beijing to Riyadh to New York are threatening to humble the US Treasury, voting with their keyboards to stop financing unsustainable levels of spending. Unless the Treasury either raises taxes or sharply cuts spending, the freight train will not be stopped. While it's theoretically possible that the White House could force the Fed to print money to buy the US debt, this would send an unmistakable message to our foreign creditors that it's time to turn off the spigot. Long-term bonds actually aren't a terrible value here if you trust the government's ability to raise taxes and maintain 2  inflation, but that would require some sort of signal that they're going to take deficits seriously first.Essentially, credit is getting more expensive and harder to get. Since household savings rates are near record lows, that's a big problem for borrowers. By industryAt a , a homebuyer with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home worth  721,000. At 4 , it's  649,000. At 5 , it's  587,000. At 6 , it's  533,000. At 7 , it's  486,000. At 8 , it's  445,000. Finally, at 9  mortgage rates a household with  100,000 in income can qualify for a home that costs  410,000, which is 43  less than they could at the 3  interest rate. This is purely mechanical from the change in financing costs, not due to opinion or sentiment. To maintain equilibrium at 9  mortgage rates, home prices would need to fall 43 .This isn't just theoretical. Mortgage rates have already soared from 3  to 7.5 , so 9  isn't even that crazy given where we already are. This interest sits on top of large home price increases during the pandemic. The typical household looking to buy a house now with a mortgage is making an almost existential choice by signing up to pay bubble prices at 7-8  interest. It's not going to end well, and DTI ratios are at or above their previous peaks in 2006-2007. If you're in the top 1  of income earners then do whatever you want, but if you're looking to buy a house and start a family you're making a much bigger gamble than you might think.It's going to be hard for interest rates to go down with the deficits the government is running, so the most likely outcome here is some sort of housing crisis sooner rather than later. It's not really a question of if, it's rather a question of when. Consumers are not displaying enough elasticity to interest rates due to their bias against renting, and it's going to cost them. Just because you should call an all-in bet for  20 does not mean you should call it for  2,000. It's the same with mortgages- housing was a great investment at 2016 prices and 2016 interest rates but a terrible one at today's rates and prices.The story isn't too different for automakers. Because the vast majority of buyers need to finance their cars, sharply rising interest rates are bad news for automakers. While manufacturers are free to offer discounted financing, it cuts into their margins. Far fewer people can pay  90,000 for a truck at 6  or 7  for a 5-year loan than could at 2  or 3 .March's bank crisis was sparked by regional banks taking too much interest rate risk, and then rising rates burned them. Now, rates are back at fresh 52-week highs. Where are all of these banks now, and how much in losses have they sustained  The crisis caused rates to fall, allowing smart banks to get out from upside-down bets. For every bank that took decisive action to reduce interest rate exposure this spring, there are likely several that put their heads in the sand. While big banks are fine, I expect dozens more of these smaller banks to end up being taken over cheaply by competitors or closed by the FDIC over the next 12-18 months. Bad bets on commercial real estate and long-duration assets virtually guarantee this. This will not be the last you hear about regional banksThis said, attrition in the banking industry could be an opportunity for well-run banks like JPMorgan .The days of losing billions to grab market share are effectively over now that capital has a price. While the 2010s brought gains in innovation, they also brought hundreds of VC-backed companies with flimsy business models. Expect many of these companies to go out of business over the next 12-18 months. This is just common sense.Large-cap valuations are near-bubble highs despite bond yields rapidly rising. With the economy being  revolutionized  by skyrocketing interest rates, it's worth considering whether you can meet your financial goals by taking less risk in bonds and cash. For every cloud, there is a silver lining and bad news for borrowers is good news for lenders.Also, it's not widely known but interest rates are priced into futures and options, which means that calls and long futures get more expensive, while puts and short futures get cheaper. Higher interest rates also accrue to short sellers who short stock, enforcing some discipline on the market by channeling capital away from junk companies to higher-quality, profitable companies.Current valuations for large stocks are suspect. The S P 500  currently sits at  in terms of its earnings. Stocks like Apple  and Microsoft  are trading for 30x earnings or more, while stocks like Tesla , Amazon , and Nvidia  are trading for 50-100x. Historically these kinds of valuations don't work out. On the other hand, you can get roughly 5.5  in money market funds , 5.5  in short-term bonds , and 4.4  tax-free in municipal bonds . Will stocks ever get cheaper than they are now  Since stocks have almost never been more expensive than they are now from a valuation perspective, it seems likely that they'll revert to the mean with bonds and cash offering better and better returns. Again, I think this happens sooner rather than later. in various countries tells us that higher rates and inflation will likely remain for 5-10 years. While a severe recession could bring balance back to the economy, this is hard to exploit because the assets that would benefit from lower rates  stocks, real estate  would likely have to get completely crushed first to set the conditions for another bull market from the bottom.While realtors are shouting from the rooftops to get buyers to  date the rate and marry the house,  overpaying for assets with teaser rates and betting that interest rates will go down and make the deal pencil is something that has burned millions of people in the past. This time is likely no different. History also shows that  tend to go up in times of economic stress.This also goes for the popular assertion that the economy will never slow down because unemployment is currently low. Consumption of food, services, and soft goods won't crash per se due to higher interest rates, but the borrowing to buy stuff will crash. Housing and autos  for consumers, and changes in these are how every business cycle starts and ends. Workers in these industries are the original source of unemployment shocks, and business investment operates on a similar cycle. This eventually trickles down to consumption, but it's a slow process. Student loans kicking back in on October 1st , as student loan debt service is about 1  of the US national after-tax income.You should care about rising interest rates because it greatly affects the fair value of assets. If you understand how interest rates affect asset pricing, you can be more  elastic  to changes in interest rates and use this to make money for yourself and reduce your risk. If you're overly emotional or dogmatic, you're more likely to end up paying the wrong prices for the wrong assets. To this point, rising rates are both a huge opportunity and a huge threat to investors. In a less dysfunctional world, interest rates should not have risen this much, and government budget deficits wouldn't be as atrocious. But we have to make do with the world we have, so this is how I view things as likely to play out going forward.Will interest rates continue to rise  If so, what will the effects be on the economy  Share your thoughts in the comments below   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Is There Still A Bull Case For Bonds?,"For those who have been bullish bonds and calling for a rally throughout 2023, it has been on the back of falling growth and waning inflation such thesisIt seems the traditional relationship between yields and the business cycle has broken down, at least for now.Indeed, while my own fixed income asset allocation quadrant has been suggesting an overweight position in duration is appropriate for this stage of the business cycle, this cycle has thus far indeedBut, to be fair, market internals have also been disconfirming the recent highs in yields, as indicators by the likes of the copper to gold ratio and the relative performance of cyclical stocks vs defensive stocks  which are both contributors to this model  have been making lower highs and lower lows while yields do the opposite. Historically, market internals have provided a fairly reliable gauge of where yields should be from a growth and inflation perspective.However, while growth has been slowing on the whole, the US economy remains robust and resilient, meaning the business cycle overall hasn t actually been an all-out tailwind for bonds just yet.Despite the plethora of unfavourable leading indicators of economic growth, the US economy continues to hold steady. Much of this resilience can be attributed to a combination of the followingAnd although we have clearly seen a slowdown  and probably recession  in the cyclical manufacturing side of the economy, the services sector is humming along nicely. We can observe this below by examining the recent momentum in a number of key economic data points. Outside of industrial production, growth in consumption, income and employment all remain in expansionary territory.While the trend in growth is by and large to the downside, the economy overall has been running pretty hot, and the expectation we are heading into recession  which is driving many fund managers to allocate to duration  has simply not yet played out.But I say that to say this. A recession may well be on the cards yet. As I detailed in my recent , the evidence continues to point to a slowdown in growth over the coming quarters, which should translate into hard data deterioration at some point in late 2023 or early 2024. This is an outcome that should favour duration at some point in this cycle, but we are not there yet.Of course, from a fundamental perspective for bonds, growth is only half the story. Inflation and inflation expectations also play a major role in determining the price of interest. Unlike the growth story, the deceleration in inflation has been much more clear cut. Headline CPI has moved sharply lower this year. The latest three-month annualised reading came in at 1.9 , just shy of the Fed s 2  target.Of course, core CPI has been far stickier as a result of persistent wage growth, but, the outlook for owners  equivalent rent  the largest component of both headline and core CPI  suggests the overall trend in core CPI is likely to be to the downside over the next 12 months.However, I would argue the downtrend in headline inflation looks to be running out of steam. Indeed, as I detailed , we could well be nearing a point in which many of the cyclical drivers of headline CPI - energy, food and commodities overall - are shifting from inflation headwinds to tailwinds once again. This is certainly a message being corroborated by my composite inflation leading indicator, whose downside momentum clearly looks to be waning and is not suggesting headline CPI reaches the Fed s 2  year-over-year growth target anytime soon.Of course, whether we do see renewed inflationary pressures show up in headline CPI as 2023 progresses depends much on how far energy prices can rally in the coming months. While I do not think we will see triple-digit oil prices this year, the fundamentals within the oil market continue to lead toward the bullish side of the spectrum  as I detailed .I would not at all be surprised to see  90- 100 oil in the coming months, an outcome which would once again put increased upside pressure on inflation breakevens  which themselves are highly correlated to the oil price, as we can see below , and thus put upside pressure on interest rates overall.The positioning dynamics of the bond market have become rather tricky to decipher in recent times. Bond bulls have been quick to highlight how bearish speculative positioning is towards the bond market, which is currently nearing multi-decade lows.While speculative positioning is indeed at its most bearish levels in decades  a signal which I would generally lend a great deal of credence , in this case it would be remiss of me if I were not to point out the large potential fault in the signaling power of this data point.This relates to the , a popular trading strategy deployed by relative value hedge funds. Such a strategy attempts to profit from dislocations between the pricing of cash Treasuries and that of Treasury futures. During periods when there is demand for Treasury futures from institutional asset managers such as pension funds  which seems to be the case at present, as I shall detail below , then this increased demand can create a dislocation between the price of the underlying itself and that of Treasury futures. This creates an opportunity for hedge funds to lever up in the repo market and buy the underlying while at the same time shorting the futures, attempting to capture the spread. This was a popular investment strategy prior to COVID-19, and we can see these strategies are seemingly once again being deployed by hedge funds by looking at measure such as hedge funds futures positioning  which is heavily short, as we can see above , Treasury repo volumes  which have soared to multi-year highs , as well as asset manager positioning in the futures market  which is heavily long . The Fed itself also recently  how such strategies are seemingly being utilised by hedge funds once again.Not only does this dynamic suggest institutional capital in the form of pension funds and the like are long bonds, but it also seems to suggest the heavily short speculative positioning in the futures market illustrated above may be somewhat misleading and not actually providing a reliable contrarian buy signal after all.If we assess discretionary positioning toward bonds through the lens of Bank of America s Global Fund Manager Survey, we can see that not only are asset managers heavily overweight bonds, but there is also a consensus among them that yields are going to fall from here. Previous instances where discretionary managers were as certain yields were going to fall marked major tops in bonds, not bottoms.Also confirming this level of bullish sentiment toward long duration is J.P. Morgan s client survey index.Unlike what speculative positioning in the futures market is indicating, it appears asset allocations and money managers are actually bullish bonds.Other measures of positioning are also sending similar messages. The put call ratio for the 10-year Treasury bond for example remains floored and is not signalling the kind of panic put buying indicative of market bottoms.In fact, as we can see below, just the opposite has occurred. Call buying on the TLT ETF has skyrocketed in recent months.Meanwhile, TLT fund flows have been positive for much of 2022 and 2023 as investors pile into the traditional recession trade, while the ETF's short interest is effectively non-existent relative to historical levels.Again, this is the kind of speculative behaviour generally seen at market tops, not bottoms. Undoubtedly, it appears everyone one is playing the deflationary cyclical game of the last 30 years without understanding the changing structural dynamics surrounding inflation and demand and supply - nowhere is this more evident that in the bond market term premium  more on this later .Alas, one group of traders we can be sure are actually short bonds and are providing some kind of reliable contrarian buy signal are CTAs, which are effectively systematic trend-following strategies. While not as short bonds as they have been, CTAs are indeed actually short the market, and, as we can see below courtesy of Goldman Sachs, there is plenty of juice CTAs can provide bonds should a short squeeze develop at some stage.It is also worth noting too how pessimistic the media has become toward bonds. While discretionary positioning does not yet reflect this narrative, this level of bearish sentiment in mainstream media is often noteworthy.So, if inflation has been falling and fund managers buying bonds, why do yields continue to go up  Simply put, this is a supply and demand story.Indeed, I have highlighted in previous articles on the bond market how unfavourable the supply and demand dynamics could be for yields, but, I must admit this bearish force has been far greater than I had anticipated. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change anytime soon.Though most will be aware of the fiscal situation the United States currently finds itself in from a Treasury issuance perspective, it is worth repeating. Since running down the Treasury General Account earlier this year, the US Treasury has been issuing new debt en masse, with around  1 trillion of Treasuries forecast to be issued in Q3 and Q4 of this year alone. That s a lot of supply.Of course, this is happening at a time when Federal tax receipts are falling and interest expenses rising, two trends which will only exacerbate this dynamic and worsen the fiscal situation.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continues to undertake QT and dump additional supply on the market, while foreign investors are themselves also no longer funding US deficits on net  and haven t been for some years now . As such, it is falling to the private sector to buy these bonds.And, while the private sector has been happy to comply thus far given the attractiveness of US government debt, it is true that when neither the Fed nor foreign investors are willing to provide the required level of demand,  in the absence of demand, supply sets the price.  Per the work of Totem Macro below, what this means is historically, excess supply has had a far more meaningful impact on pressuring yields higher than would be the case when the Fed was willing to support the market via QE and foreign investors were willing to finance US deficits.These excess supply dynamics remain a continued threat to the bond market. But it unfortunately doesn t end there.Japanese investors are the largest foreign owners of US Treasury securities. Japanese insurance companies and pension funds represent some of the largest pools of capital in the world, and US bonds are one of their primary holdings. So, when the Bank of Japan makes alterations to its yield curve control policy, this can have big implications for Japanese capital flows.Indeed, they have recently done just that, widening the 10-year JGB trading band from 50 bps to 100 bps. And, as noted recently by the , with ' yields going up in Japan, the risk is that Japanese investors will now begin to sell US fixed income and start buying higher-yielding Japanese fixed income. This is a big deal for global fixed income markets because Japanese investors are the biggest foreign holders of US Treasuries, and they also own significant amounts of US credit.We can see this dynamic in play by looking at the correlation of 10-year US Treasury yields and 10-year Japanese government bond yields. As JBG yields rise, Japanese capital allocators are incentivised to sell foreign USTs and buy domestic bonds.The depreciation of the yen relative to the USD also exacerbates this dynamic, as many Japanese investors hedge their FX exposure when investing in foreign debt assets. So, when the dollar yen FX rate rises  USD appreciates relative to the yen , hedging costs increase and domestic yields can become more attractive even if the yields are lower than UST yields. This dynamic helps to explain why the USD JPY FX rate  black line below  is so closely correlated to US yields  blue line below .This dynamic is perhaps better illustrated by comparing JGB yields relative to FX-hedged UST yields, as we can see below. The additional yield pick-up for Japanese investors when investing in USTs is much lower than the JGB yield when accounting for the hedging costs associated with foreign investment.This is the threat of the great repatriation of foreign capital. All else equal, rising JGB yields and a strong dollar incentivises Japanese investors to repatriate capital to finance Japanese deficits instead of US deficits, a dynamic which will only serve to further reduce demand for US government debt securities  at least at current rates .But once again, the story doesn t end there. Another spike in oil and energy costs could again result in capital flows from energy importers out of USTs and into domestic assets in order to defend their currencies - as rising energy costs lowers current account balances thus depreciating the currency - another risk to duration should energy costs  i.e. oil  start to rise again. Such flows are effectively equal to additional QT.Should the USD strengthen, this also gives reason for foreigners to continue to sell USTs to strengthen their own currencies  as the dollar trends to go up when Fed is conducting QT and the private sector must adsorb the debt while the foreign sector is selling . The recent devaluation of the Chinese yuan speaks to this risk, with  recently reporting that Chinese banks are trying to defend the CNY by selling USDs USTs.As we can see, the supply and demand imbalance clearly indicates their remains upside risk for yields and downside risk for bonds, regardless of the macro fundamentals for duration. These are very important factors at play that have not been anywhere near as prominent in recent times where the fundamentals favoured duration.From a technical perspective, the 10-year yield is at an interest juncture. After butting heads with recent resistance just shy of 4.4  and completing a daily 9-13-9 DeMark sell signal, this recent move higher in yields clearly looks to be running out of steam. Given the level of bearish media sentiment toward bonds at present, I suspect we will see this correction continue to play out over the next month or two, though I would be surprised if yields were to retrace all the way down to their major support level around 3.4  anytime in the near future. Indeed, barring any imminent crash in equities, recession or market event that sees the return of QE, it is hard to argue against this being a chart that looks like it wants to go higher overall.While what I have discussed thus far has primarily focused on the cyclical outlook for bonds, it is worth highlighting some of the secular risks for the bond market that could see yields move much higher over the medium to long term.This dynamic is most aptly examined through the lens of the term premium, which represents the additional compensation investors receive for holding a longer dated bond  i.e. 10-year Treasury  until maturity as opposed to continually investing in one year Treasuries and reinvesting the proceeds each year upon maturity. In theory, the term premium should account for the additional duration and inflation risks associated with locking up capital for a long period of time.As it stands, it appears the term premium for 10-year Treasuries is not at all reflecting any kind of structural risks facing markets.  of the term premium suggest it is still negative as investors are yet to demand any kind of meaningful compensation for actually bearing the additional risks for being long duration in a world of .We can see this below by comparing the term premium to various forms of long-term inflation expectations.The same can be said of inflation uncertainty, which has clearly yet to be accounted for by fixed income traders.Even the outlook for debt issuance by the US Treasury and the excess supply this is set to bring to the market are yet to be fully accounted for in the term premium.On a structural level, it seems clear there are a number of reasons why yields could go higher from here, or at least average a higher level that what we have seen during recent decades. These are dynamics all bond bulls should keep in mind.Summing it all up, there are clearly a very large number of factors at play here that are contributing, or attempting to contribute, to the movement in bond prices and yields. The economic resilience thus far has resulted in any kind of material growth slowdown or recession being pushed back, meaning the macro conditions are yet to turn truly favourable for bonds. Likewise, while the cyclical inflation trend has been to the downside for most of the past 12 months, there are signs suggesting inflationary pressures could again re-emerge as we close out 2023.Meanwhile, the supply and demand story for bonds remains as bearish as ever, with excess issuance by the US Treasury and the potential for the repatriation of foreign capital both serious risks that could lead to higher yields.Will we get a cyclical bond rally at some stage  Most probably, but the timing here is very difficult given the bearish factors in play. A significant rally in bonds will probably require a material stock market crash, recession, or the resumption of QE. This is particularly true given how discretionary positioning toward the asset class seems on the bullish side. For now, being long duration at present is not the right risk reward trade investors should be looking for, particularly given the attractive yields on offer from the short end of the curve. After all, we now live in a world where you can be paid to wait. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",39,2023-09-01T21:52:00.000-04:00
TLT: Bullish Ahead Of September Payrolls And The CPI Update,"Rising bond yields have taken the market by storm with the 10-year and 30-year Treasury rate at the highest levels since 2007, approaching nearly 5 . The setup has been a disaster for the bond market, including the iShares 20  Year Treasury BondThe fund technically tracks a basket of Treasury bonds with maturities greater than  and represents a good bond benchmark as one of the most widely traded exchange-traded funds in the market. While the trading action has been poor, we see room to take the other side ahead of a rebound.The potential for favorable indicators, between the September CPI as well as the payrolls report suggesting confidence that inflation will continue to trend lower could help build a consensus that the Fed is done withThe Fed's rate hiking policy in place since early last year, taking the Fed Funds rate from effectively zero to 5.5  at the short end of the curve explains much of the dynamic in rising yields at the long end of the curve.Still, what we're seeing now has evolved into more of a momentum-based selloff. Data shows that bond futures market positioning is at a, implying a bet on even higher yields going forward.As it relates to the macro backdrop, the interpretation is a view by some that  inflation remains a problem  and the Fed will need to keep hiking to bring the CPI down to the 2  target level.This line of thinking received some fodder at the September Fed meeting with comments by Chairman Powell leaving the door open for another rate hike this year, noting the group remains data-dependent.The  higher for longer  mantra was strengthened by the fabled dot plot forecast by Fed members for the Fed Funds rates in 2024 to 5.1  compared to 4.6  from the June update.All in all, it is fair to say bonds deserve to be higher compared to levels last year although we will argue that the move has been overextended.The key point here is that there is some uncertainty regarding the actual direction of Fed policy even over the next few months. The difference between a continued  pause  or a rate hike over the next Fed meetings has significant implications for the broader bond market.Importantly, that extra rate hike taking the Fed Fund Rates to 5.75  is far from certain with a case to be made that it won't happen. There is a deep divide in the market right now regarding where the Fed Funds rate will end this year.According to the, which extrapolates the probability for the Fed Funds rate move at each FOMC, there is currently a 52.2  chance the Fed ends the year at the December meeting with no change to the current 5.5  level, compared to a 47.8  odds for a hike.The point here is to recognize that the interest rate expectations and the corresponding market probabilities are dynamic. Several factors can work to shift those probabilities.A  good  or favorable data point suggesting lower-than-expected inflationary pressures between now and the next Fed meeting could be enough to keep the group on hold. If it becomes clear further rate hikes are unnecessary for the CPI to trend lower, this scenario would be particularly bullish for bonds and TLT with room for yields to correct lower.This would be reflected in the December rate hike odds repricing lower and potentially even pulling forward the room for a rate cut earlier in 2024. This would also be a positive for stocks, although we'll leave that to a separate discussion.On the other hand, bond bears are sort of hoping inflation surprises much higher with other macro data coming in exceptionally strong, forcing the Fed to turn even more hawkish. Here is the market-implied probability that a rate hike in December would become the consensus, as a further tailwind for bond yields to climb higher, and more downside in bond prices including the TLT ETF.Two major indicators are coming out over the next few weeks that can help set the record straight. First up is the September non-farm payrolls report due out on Friday, October 6th. The current consensus is for 170k jobs added, representing a slight slowdown from 187k in August.Our thinking here is that this otherwise  soft  figure confirms a gradual deceleration in the labor market as evidence monetary policy is working to cool demand-side consumer pricing pressures. For context, the average number of jobs added over the past year has been around 260k added per month meaning it's clear that the pace has slowed.What might even be more encouraging is room for the unemployment rate to climb above 4 , based on a growing participation rate that was the theme in August.This headline number returned to the highest level since 2021 indicating that the transmission of monetary policy to restrict economic activity within the credit cycle is working. We also expect wage growth to be subdued.In our view, it would take a  blowout  print higher implying the economy is exceptionally strong to raise an eyebrow at the Fed that the labor market trends are inflationary.A miss to the downside on Friday with the payroll number a bit weaker than expected would be a very bullish backdrop for bonds because it pushes back on the need for the Fed to keep hiking and brushes aside concerns that inflation is accelerating.If anything, bonds could react in a sort of  buy the news  dynamic, where any print is met with some market-wide short covering considering the recent weakness. We expect to see a rally in TLT here as part of a  short squeeze dynamic  against the excessive net short interest in the bond market.TLT bulls can also look forward to the September CPI report set to be released on October 12th. A lot of attention has been placed on the recent spike in oil prices, although the key here will be core trends. The September inflation update showed that the core CPI dropped to 4.3 , the lowest level in more than two years.This is a very favorable development we expect to continue over the next few months because this side of the consumer price basket covers categories like housing, automobiles, and services that are more directly impacted by higher interest rates compared to energy prices.All indications are that core CPI which had been stubbornly elevated for much of the past year is finally turning. The Fed looks at three and six-month annualized levels which are well on their way to being at the target range. Again, the data has said they are data-dependent, and the cooling CPI is as important as it gets to confirm the trend is on track.In terms of the headline rate, our call is that core can drag the broader index lower through 2024. Even as oil prices have climbed, we believe it would take oil significantly higher for it to begin driving a cost-pull inflationary wave. We can point to retail gasoline which remains as a national average as highlighted by the otherwise muted impact on the consumer price basket.Putting it all together, we see good value in bonds at the current level with room for TLT to rebound higher as interest rates stabilize and ultimately pull back.Investors can pick up TLT with a compelling  4  dividend yield on a forward basis, with a good chance the fund will deliver a positive total return over the next year in our opinion. A scenario where the 30-year Treasury rate corrects to  4.25  by year-end, implies TLT can reclaim the  100 as our initial target.Into 2024, the possibility that the inflation converges toward the 2  target more quickly than currently expected, would provide the flexibility for the Fed to consider rate cuts based on anchored expectations. This could evolve irrespective of economic conditions within the soft landing scenario where the economy averts a recession.A soft September payroll report and cool CPI can go a long way to reset the trajectory of Fed policy. TLT and bond market shorts covering within a broader repricing would kickstart a momentum trade to the upside.In terms of risks, it would be more a concerning spike or re-accelerating of inflationary pressures that would be necessary to sustain a selloff in bonds. Factors such as the national debt, with supply and demand dynamics of Treasury bond issuances, also play a role in this market, but to a lesser extent.The setup here is that bonds are oversold and the next move in prices is higher in our opinion. More aggressive traders can also consider the ProShares Ultra 20  Year Treasury ETF  which is essentially a 2x leveraged version of TLT meaning double the risk as well as potentially double the upside return in percentage terms.

Canadian Solar: EPS Outlook Plummeting On Solar Glut And China Risks,"2023 has been a particularly challenging year for the solar industry. The solar ETF  has lost 40  of its value this year, with virtually all those losses occurring over the past three months. One notable exampleOver the past month alone, CSIQ has plummeted by 20  due to a poor sales outlook and earnings report from its larger competitor SolarEdge . Further, although solar stocks have lostCanadian Solar has been a publicly traded company since 2007. Since then, it has gone through four  boom and bust  cycles where it doubled  or more  in value and erased all those gains. The same pattern is mirrored in most other solar stocks. In general, the boom and bust cycle is correlated to changes in CSIQ's EPS  however, there is a tremendous amount of speculative influence, considering there is often some overreaction in the stock price in either direction. See belowOne key issue with solar companies is that the industry is not as firmly rooted as others in the energy space. These companies are very capital-intensive, with Canadian Solar spending over  630B in CapEx last year, or nearly half of its current market capitalization. Accordingly, they operate with a fair degree of competition and are highly exposed to broader manufacturing trends.Many investors are attracted to solar companies because they see the long-term growth potential of the solar market. However, the greatest benefactors of that may not be the solar panel factories because they're exposed to the same competitive, interest rate, and inflation risks as all other industrial manufacturers. A slight decline in demand combined with a continued increase in global solar panel production can quickly push the market into a glut, erasing the relatively thin profit margins found by factories. Additionally, these companies do not naturally grow organically as many others but require significant capital infusions to expand. Thus, substantial sales growth will almost always require considerable equity dilution or debt financing.The operating margin and sales growth trends of Canadian Solar and its peer, Solar Edge, are very similar because they compete in the same market. See belowThe operating margins of these firms dipped dramatically from 2020-2022, mainly due to supply-chain challenges that increased production costs while  to slow. Today, are up dramatically as these companies adjust for rising costs, although they're still lower than many years ago. That said, the price hike is likely sufficient to lower demand, particularly considering that electricity price growth has stagnated after two strong years. Thus, the sales outlooks for these firms are now deteriorating more quickly.Canadian Solar is still expected to expand its revenue over the coming years. However, over the past year, there has been a significant decline in its immediate and longer-term revenue estimates, highlighting some potential for stagnation. See belowSignificantly, Canadian Solar relies on debt financing to grow its revenue, which comes at the cost of its equity stability. It has also diluted its equity to a small extent over recent years, though the pace has quickened. Further, we can expect that production costs, such as power, labor, and input materials, will continue to increase at or above inflation as in recent years. As a result, its  to stagnate through at least 2025, but no significant declines are anticipated, with annualized EPS running around  5 and potentially rising after 2025.The solar sector's largest issues are interest rates and inflation. Combined, these factors dramatically increase solar installation costs and lower most solar systems' ROI. Solar panel loans now carry  APRs, erasing most of the gains received by adopting the panels. Problematically, the solar market has not been tested by such high interest rates ever before, increasing the probability of overestimation, as recently seen in guidance cut.At the same time, the production of solar panels, particularly from China, is rising very quickly today. In light of waning demand, this situation has already created a glut of solar modules in many markets, with that  as long as US and EU interest rates constrain residential demand  and corporate . Combined with increasing weakness in , credit ratings, and rising solar panel production costs, I believe it may take longer than 2025 before we see a rebound in solar demand.  very cheap today, likely reversing some of the electricity price growth since 2020.Most of the company's manufacturing is in China, often viewed as a Chinese headquartered in Canada. At the end of 2022, 72  of its long-lived assets  1.67B in total  were situated in China  an additional 12  were in Thailand, but less than 1  were in Canada  see . Its annual report has 315 mentions of  China  and 365 of  PRC,  with immense details regarding associated risks relating to trade, ownership issues, geopolitical risks, taxation, and other factors. Additionally, 95 is in Asia, while just 3  is in Canada.Canadian Solar markets itself as a Canadian firm, which is technically accurate, but its core operations are mainly Chinese. China is essentially the only place in the world where solar panels can be manufactured cost-effectively due to other countries' environmental and labor cost restrictions. Controversially, Canadian Solar has  of using Uyghurs in China. Unfortunately, The same is true for many Chinese-made items  however, unlike , Canadian Solar cannot hide behind the issue through externally contracted factories since they indirectly own projects in Xinjiang. Although the company has since investigated the issue and , third-party that is not entirely accurate.Humanitarian issues aside, this controversy is a significant problem for CSIQ. For one, investors must realize that it is effectively a Chinese company that actively seeks to appear more Canadian than it truly is. That is not to say that it is dishonest, since its annual reports are clear on that fact, but it is true in investor marketing since very few other analysts have realized this fact. Of course, the US and other countries recently against solar panel imports made by China's forced labor factories. Aside from the slave labor issue, it is a problem that most of CSIQ's assets are tied up in China because US investors do not necessarily own those assets, instead being indirectly that generally do not protect foreign investors.In my view, in light of Solar Edge's substantial guidance cut, the latest income and sales estimates for Canadian Solar are likely overestimated. Interest rates are now around 5  from today through 30-year Treasury bonds, so there is no reason to expect any reductions in short-term borrowing costs anytime soon. Considering we see the yield curve steepen without rate cuts, it is possible that the Federal Reserve may hike rates again next year. Inflation has slowed, but it can rebound as it had numerous  which faced similar supply-side inflationary trends relating to geopolitics in the Middle East.That risk factor compounds Canadian Solar's woes because its COGS should now rise faster than its sales consistently as long as interest rates and inflation remain an issue. In my view, we may likely see the company's operating margins slip back toward zero as they had been years ago. Higher interest rates also push the company's borrowing costs up, just as its debt grows as it seeks to expand its operations. The company's financial debt-to-EBITDA is relatively high at 6X, particularly considering I expect its EBITDA to crash due to the sales and profit margin reversal. Indeed, considering its thin margins and high capital overhead, I believe there is reasonable potential that CSIQ's EPS will be back around zero by the end of 2024, far below current estimates.Short interest on CSIQ is high at 9.6 , meaning many investors are betting against the stock. Most analysts love the company and believe it is undervalued today, but may be dramatically underappreciating its China-related risk factors and broader glut risks facing the solar sector. As solar loan costs soar and solar panel production costs rise with global labor and commodities, I firmly believe Canadian Solar and most of its peers will soon see enough price competition that their meager operating margins will be wiped out again. We've seen this pattern many times throughout the company's history, so I do not see any strong reason to suspect it should not continue.The fact is that Canadian Solar is not a green energy growth company but a relatively old-school manufacturing firm with tremendous cyclical risks and capital needs. Further, it faces high exposure to geopolitical trade issues between the West and China and associated labor issue allegations. This is not to say that I do not believe Solar itself will grow, just that Canadian Solar, as a stock, has minimal upside potential related to the long-term expansion of the solar industry. So long as supply and demand rise together, a factory will not generally expand its income without raising external capital. Thus, CSIQ's sustained EPS upside, even with a great demand outlook for Solar, is minimal to me, while its downside risk associated with a glut is considerable.Overall, I am slightly bearish on CSIQ today and believe it will continue to lose value over the coming months as its 2024-2025 EPS expectations decline due to the glut issue. If the allegations of labor issues in China result in actions from Western governments, then CSIQ's downside would be even more significant. That said, the same can be said for most solar companies, given that essentially all solar panels are produced in Asia, . Personally, while the US has made laws to stop the labor issue, enforcement is , potentially because green necessarily afford higher prices.At this point, it is difficult to say where exactly CSIQ may land once its bearish trend ends. It is just now reaching back into its pre-COVID price range, mirroring expectations of EPS deterioration. To me, given a near-or-below zero operating margin outlook, high leverage, and China-headquartered assets, I would not personally buy CSIQ at any price, given there is too much room for black-swan risk factors and financial deterioration. However, I would be surprised to see CSIQ cross below  10- 15 per share anytime soon, given it did earn substantial profits over the past year. Even if its prospects are in sharp reversal, it is unclear if this issue will last until 2024-2025 or longer. Thus, while I am bearish, I would not short CSIQ today because it has already lost so much value, and we will likely not know clearly how its financial position will be impacted by the macroeconomic shift until early 2024.

"Nvidia Was Up 235% In 2023, Don't Expect It To Continue (Rating Downgrade)","It is our stance that the stock market is not logical, rather it's sentimental. There is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100   - only to fall 40   in aThis roller coaster ride is most evident in tech stocks, which happens to be our specialty. Therefore, we openly and frequently discuss with our free newsletter readers the importance of layering into a leading position, setting up buy plans ahead of time, and also the importance of taking gains once the technicalWe've had unwavering conviction in Nvidia's AI story . In fact, it was our leading position going into 2023 and  exceeded Stanley Druckenmiller at 29 , meanwhile, Druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading AI portfolio. The Street is also  for being early to  , which was a latecomer recommendation in March 2023. Ark Invest often discusses AI as a leading trend, yet almost  entirely. We point this out because we provided Nvidia as a stock tip for free, repeatedly, with top-tier analysis delivered on Seeking Alpha and through , with our own capital backing the research.We are a strong proponent of offering quality information at the free level. We offer top-tier analysis every single week in our free newsletter,   Unfortunately, free information tends to come from those who are unproven and may not be very good investors at all, while those with a proven track record keep trades close to their chest.Not only do we actively manage every position we own and send real-time trade alerts, but we discuss openly and frequently our thoughts along the way. Our track record on Nvidia over the past 1-2 years looks like thisThe single biggest issue individual investors face is a lack of quality information that is , , and comes with  around position sizing, portfolio performance, and how to handle sell-offs.It is this last point that we'd like to discuss with you today,  how to handle selloffs.  We were considered crazy for buying Nvidia in 2022 and we are considered crazy for trimming in 2023. Yet, in what is rare transparency for the financial world, we are sharing with you our plans with this leading portfolio position.On August 28th, we put out our price analysis on NVDA. We offered two general scenarios that we see playing out, which are still very much in play today. Here is what we said back thenAlso, in the last report, we were looking for a breakout above  480 to signal that a low was in, and we were heading toward our first overhead target around of  545. We did see a breakout, but it failed to hold, which was a warning of more volatility to come. This, coupled with some heavy distribution volume above the  440 price level, had us decide to take more gains in Nvidia. However, we do not believe current prices are ideal for a long-term, buy and hold mindset. Patience will likely pay off in the long run. So, it will be up to each investor to decide if they want to take on the risk of potentially getting one more high.For us, the reward is not worth the risk, which is why we have decided to trim. Our last buy at  410 in July is our last buy, and we do not have any more buys planned until we see a resolution. There are two other AI-related stocks that we like better in the near term, and when we enter these, we will notify our premium members with real-time trade alerts.This remains my primary perspective as long as we hold the  340 support. Below there, and the top is likely in.Nvidia is a core holding of ours, so we will likely never close the position, as long as the story and tech trend remain intact. However, we do strongly believe in taking gains, reducing risk, and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis. That being said, we believe we are approaching one of these moments. Even though we broke a key trendline today, we expect a bounce to occur soon. If this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels, we will trim our position even more.There has been an excessive level of insider selling by the CEO, Jensen Huang. So far, he has sold over  110,000,000 worth of shares over the last 3 weeks. Regarding insider activity, there are many reasons insiders sell, which may have nothing to do with the business. However, when you see the executives within a company, like the CEO, it's worth paying attention to. Since June, we've seen about  175,000,000 worth of NVDA sold.In conclusion, our broad market work suggests that a complex topping process is forming. Many sectors and stocks have likely topped, while some big tech names look like they have the potential for one more high into the end of the year.Insider activity and institutional selling point toward another high being less likely. If we do get that second high, our plan is to trim more. Until the  340 support breaks, NVDA still has the potential for that last swing higher. Regardless, we believe being patient will pay off for those looking to buy a great company at a great a price. We are also being patient for when we add back to our position and feel it's better to be defensive at the moment.If you own Nvidia stock, or are looking to own NVDA, we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars, held every Thursday at 4 30 pm EST.

Surge Battery Metals Is The Lithium Giant In Nevada That You Haven't Heard Of Yet,"My email box and phone blew up last week with friends and family forwarding the big news of Lithium Americas   huge caldera-hosted lithium mine in northern Nevada. 'HaveHowever, as boring as I've been blathering on about lithium mining stocks, I couldn't be satisfied with being ahead of the curve on lithium in general. After all, lithium prices have declined precipitously from record highs, so it has been a stock-pickers market for lithium mining stocks.Back to Lithium Americas. 'Yes, and yes,' I said, but then I added a big new reveal  There's an early-stage lithium company, Surge Battery Metals  , that looks to be sitting on a lithium deposit that checks all the boxes that Thacker Pass does and is arguably better, but it is trading at 1 10th the value or less. This company's property is also in Nevada, ranked the number one mining-friendly region in the world by the . They've drilled some remarkable holes judging by lithium content, strike length and initial geology and metallurgy. So remarkable that  the Chairman of the company  a respected figure in the world of lithium, mining, and finance  a Director  former Rio Tinto executive and geologist  and the Chairman of another public lithium mining company that became a strategic investor  American Lithium   all had a similar initial response  Surprise, intrigue and sometimes head-shaking disbelief., Chairman of   his company's approximate 10  stake in Surge Battery Metals  beginning at 11 34 - Director, .  Source   - Chairman,   Source  I'm going to assume that readers are familiar with the lithium space. I'm not going to discuss the chemistry of lithium-ion batteries, and I'll expend little to no ink on the differences between the three general types of lithium mining, hard-rock, brine, and sediment clay. The reason I'm going to skip all that for now is I want to get this article out rapidly because I think after last week's big pullback after a breakneck run, that Surge Battery Metals warrants a strong buy recommendation. I am convinced of this opinion based on the current supply and demand picture, my experience investing in lithium stocks and investing in general. I think that Surge Battery Metals will be acquired for at least five times the current market capitalization in relatively short order. I want this article to serve as a stake in the ground at this point in time so I get the intangible  credit  for having informed a wider audience about Surge Battery Metals, hopefully to our mutual success.Of course, hope is not a reliable investing strategy. In my long investing experience though, simple comparative economics is quite reliable. That is just taking one product, company, or resource project, and measuring it against another more established and higher valued one, and determining whether the former is undervalued based on the qualities of each project and the market capitalization of the companies being compared. I'll do that with Surge Battery Metals' Nevada North Lithium Project.The Nevada North Lithium Project  NNLP  is in Northeast Nevada in Elko County. It now encompasses 725 mineral claims, a total area of 22.45 square miles, and is open in multiple directions. The expanded size model is over 8.5 times larger than just this past February 2023 based on the latest results of the drilling campaign, soil samples, and geophysics.What first caught my attention about Surge's NNLP last November 2022 was the below map, showing geologist Alan Morris' area-wide soil sample results across the original footprint of the project. Stunningly, the pink purple regions reflect lithium values  from 500 to 5,120 parts per million  ppm .Not only are lithium readings at the surface like this extremely rare, the whole economics of a project can get a huge boost if the surface readings are confirmed to run deep. And they do, as confirmed by a 2022 drilling campaign that posted the results belowAs you can see, these results are extraordinary in terms of grade and strike length, and rival the best results of clay sediment hosted lithium anywhere in North America. Some highlights are the over  in hole 5 beginning right at the surface, and hole 7 which boasts So far during the current drilling campaign, two holes assays have come back from the third-party lab and have produced the following resultsHere in NN23-01 we have about   to Surge Battery Metals, the shallow zone includes lithium content , which is apparently the highest ppm in Nevada ever confirmed by a lab.NN23-02 continued to expand the size of the project to the northwest, as an , and contained one layer of core length of .About eight more holes have been drilled, including the deepening of a few previously drilled holes upon further indications of additional highly prospective zones of lithium at lower levels.If the Nevada North Lithium Project appears to be as significant in size, grade, ease of lithium extraction, and level of impurities as Thacker Pass, the NNLP should be valued the same as Thacker Pass. If the NNLP proves to be of greater significance in the majority of these factors, it should be valued higher than Thacker Pass. This is the basic thesis.However, we certainly need to add a lot of points to Thacker Pass for its stage of operations including finalized permitting and approval, finalized mining flow sheet and plan of operations, defined metallurgy, and financing. Lithium Americas has been at this a long time and is clearing ground and commencing operations. They are much farther along, and there is a significant value attributed to project stage by the Market.Once Lithium Americas finalizes its split into two entities, one which holds the South American assets and the other which holds the North American assets, we will know how the Market values Thacker Pass. Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Jaberwock Research wrote a  with a valuation estimate on the separated entities. They ascribe a value to Thacker Pass of  4.009 Billion, discounted by .7, excluding a 636 Million investment from GM, of which half has been injected so far. They give a value to the South American assets of  2.354 Billion post cash of  167 Million and debt of  279 Million. Because the Market is currently valuing the combined company at  2.72 Billion in Market Cap, which is less than half of Jaberwock's discounted all-in current value, I'll use their ratio of 70 30  in favor of Lithium Americas' North American assets. This comes to about  1.9 Billion for Thacker Pass in terms of current Market Cap.On to the comparison. Here is a table of the most important clay sediment hosted lithium deposits in North AmericaFrom the table above, we can see that Surge's NNLP has higher average grades than even stellar Thacker Pass, averaging 3,437 from its drilling campaign thus far.In its initiation of coverage, the analysts at SCP Resource Finance  previously known as Sprott Capital Partners  estimates, based on last year's drilling alone, a resource of 2.5-3Mt LCE   . They believe that this season's just completed drilling could lift the resource towards . SCP further sees blue sky potential of the NNLP at .Upcoming holes are being drilled deeper, to up to 1000 feet, and previously drilled holes are being deepened after indications of deeper targets. 15Mt LCE could even be conservative in my opinion, and we'll find out soon from the assays of these deeper targets.'How can one make an estimate like this with only the assays from 10 holes ' some will protest. Fortunately, the nature of clay-hosted lithium deposits gives geologists confidence, as clay-hosted deposits often show remarkable consistency and continuity across a wide area.Thacker Pass sits in the McDermitt Caldera, an ancient lake inside that formed inside a collapsed volcano which collected-lithium enriched sediments from various geologic occurrences over millions of years - including of course the volcano's initial eruption - constrained by the volcano's edges. Over time these sediments became further enriched with lithium as detailed in one of the papers principally authored by Lithium Americas' Thomas Benson, , that garnered a lot of well-deserved attention in the press recently.The high grades of Li-bearing clay being found at the NNLP are similar if not higher than the grades found at Thacker Pass, and the regional rocks have been described as of  to the McDermitt Tuff soils that host lithium at Thacker Pass. The NNLP sits in the site of the Jarbridge Caldera, and it appears from the location and geology that the same factors that enriched the lithium-bearing clays at Thacker Pass could also be responsible for the NNLP's  of lithium ppms.Further, in the recent  with Surge director Iain Scarr, he mentions that there is more Hectorite present in the soils of Thacker Pass than present at the NNLP, hence extracting the lithium from NNLP should be less complicated and less costly.Speaking about soils, the SCP analyst points to a beneficially low magnesium content  2-4  and the presence of coarse calcite crystals which aid in extraction purification efficiency.Another key factor in mining is 'overburden', which is simply how much relatively worthless rock and dirt sit above the valuable resource that must be removed to get to the good stuff. As mentioned above, . Compare this to Thacker Pass, which finds itself in the opposite position. At Thacker Pass, the best grades are generally  and the lesser grades are at the surface. Overburden equals additional cost. Surge's project is blessed with high grade at the surface in the resource area drilled so far.To sum up the comparison, Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine is being valued in the Market right now at  1.9 Billion before the second  300 Million  cash infusion from GM, assuming the value of the entire company pre-split is 70  in favor of Thacker Pass. We will find out this week, perhaps before this article comes out. Regardless, some Seeking Alpha contributors see a value of Thacker Pass of up to about  5.7 Billion  excluding the  636 Million from GM .Let's be a bit conservative and give Thacker Pass a current value of  1.5 Billion. Surge Battery Metals has a current market cap of about  109 Million U.S. dollars and a fully diluted market cap of about  140 Million U.S. dollars.That is a  In doing this comparison, I asked myself what the likelihood is that the NNLP becomes a mine. Considering all of the positives and the comparison that at the very least gives the NNLP an equal value if it becomes a mine after it is proved out by the requisite amount of drilling, I have no doubt that it does become a mine. It will probably not be owned by the same corporation at that point, as I can see Surge Battery Metals being acquired for a substantial premium in relatively short order.After all, Lithium Americas reportedly had numerous competitors vying to take the stake that GM ended up winning. The U.S. Administration has recognized the urgency of a domestic supply of lithium and other critical energy metals, and plenty of companies are finding out the hard way that some nations are looking to nationalize or further control lithium projects. Case in point  the Sonora Lithium project in Mexico. The government of Mexico just  a number of concessions from Chinese giant , in a move that could delay another large source of lithium to a world that is estimated to be going into deficit for years.When investing in the mining sector, it's often wise to bet on the repeat performers. Their contacts, geological experience, and instincts come in especially handy in the relatively small community of lithium experts. It's a small community because for a very long time, lithium wasn't worth a whole lot. How times have changed.The  of Surge Battery Metals is , an experienced executive and financier who sold his last company, Millennial Lithium, to none other than Lithium Americas for  490 Million U.S.The  of Surge is , who before Surge was EVP of Transmission and Distribution at British Columbia's electric utility BC Hydro, serving 4 Million customers. He previously served as Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and Chair of the BC Oil and Gas Commission. is a geologist with more than 30 years at Rio Tinto, including serving as Commercial Director and VP of Exploration. holds a BSc in chemistry and a PhD in flotation technology. A holder of numerous patents involving lithium processing and extraction, Dr. Mehta is a world-renowned expert in lithium mining, extraction, and processing. is EVP at American Lithium Corp. and the board representative for American Lithium's investment in Surge Battery Metals. He is a professional geoscientist and brings more than 30 years of experience in the exploration industry to the Company, including working directly on American Lithium's TLC Claystone Project in Nevada.Here is a rundown of Surge's share structure from their most recent corporate deckThe Company raised about  7 Million dollars in June 2023, mostly from American Lithium, which has funded their recent drilling and exploration campaign. They reported about  9.6 Million on the  at the end of June. Warrants attached to that financing should bring in some more money to the company if American Lithium chooses to increase its stake in Surge, which I expect them to do. Other financing will of course be necessary in the future for Surge to keep up the pace of drilling. Considering Surge's prospects and the attention coming to lithium in Nevada, I think financing will not be a problem and could come from many sources, including another strategic investor.As detailed previously, Surge just concluded its second drilling campaign and has released results on two of them. There are about eight yet to be released after they are analyzed at the lab, including some that have been re-entered with a rig that can handle greater depths.Other news could relate to additional land acquisitions, additional strategic investors, and perhaps additional site visits another global automaker, which the CEO described after the initial drilling results were released.Then, the Maiden Resource Estimate  MRE  will be released, estimated by the company variously to be arriving as early as November 2023 but at the latest Q1 2024. More recently, company representatives have said that Q1 is more likely, to allow the incorporation of the results of the whole second drilling campaign.Below is my own standard list of the main risks I consider specifically when considering an investment in junior mining stocks, beyond the general risks inherent in any public company investmentWhat balances some of these standard risks in Surge's case is Lithium Americas' hard-fought but trailblazing success. They had rough patches along the way, had court fights and doubters of the technology behind lithium extraction from clay sediment, but emerged successful and are rumored to be close to a  from the U.S. government to fund mine construction.Surge is the beneficiary of the  Second Mover Advantage . By following Lithium Americas' playbook where it was successful and avoiding the minefields where it had difficulties, Surge could really expedite the timeline to a producing mine, or a buyout. Who better to guide the team than Chairman Graham Harris who led his company's buyout by Lithium Americas, and CEO Greg Reimer  who rapidly focused Surge on the NNLP and started to assemble a crack team when he saw what they had in the ground  Chairman Harris has done this before, and I was a beneficiary since I owned stock in Millennial Lithium.One final point concerns the price of battery-grade lithium. Spot prices are volatile, and reflect short-term supply and demand considerations, but most lithium is purchased on long-term contracts. Some might think that currently depressed prices in the spot market are a sign of a surplus of lithium. Maybe if viewed week-to-week, but the long-term demand picture is extremely bullish, and might even get desperate as countries increasingly look to protect their own national lithium interests, cancel concessions, and various mines get delayed or cancelled such as  in Serbia and Sonora in Mexico.Analysts at Macquarie have  that lithium supplies have been depleted now to the level where prices began to soar the last time.Sometime in the near future, but within a year, I expect Surge Battery Metals to be acquired by one of the big names in lithium such as Rio Tinto, Albermarle, BHP, Lithium Americas, or even a specialty chemical conglomerate, auto manufacturer or oil major. There are a lot of contenders out there, and if  I think the operative word is  Surge's official MRE confirms the highest-grade clay-hosted resource in North America, which has minimal overburden and favorable extraction parameters, I predict Surge's share price will ramp up further to reflect greater awareness of this remarkable project.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

"Scorpio Tankers Q2: A New Fleet, A Strong Strategy, A Promising Future"," , a leading provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the challenging market conditions, the company has demonstrated resilience and strategic financial management, which are key indicators of its potentialThe oil shipping market is influenced by a myriad of factors. These include global oil supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and broader economic conditions. Each of these elements plays a significant role in shaping the industry's landscape and, more specifically, the spot rates for oil tankers.Global oil supply is one of the key drivers of spot rates in the oil shipping market. Spot rates, the price for immediate charter of aCurrently, we are witnessing a period of relatively low oil inventories, which is contributing to an upward trend in spot rates. This situation is beneficial for oil tanker companies like Scorpio Tankers, as higher spot rates are leading to increased revenues and profitability.Another critical factor influencing the oil shipping market is the rate of fleet growth. The number of new ships being built and added to the global fleet can significantly impact the supply-demand dynamics in the industry. Currently, the industry is experiencing lower fleet growth levels relative to historical averages. This trend is primarily driven by high interest rates, which make the financing of new ship construction more expensive, and the fact that many shipyards are currently occupied with building other types of ships.This lack of new ship construction is leading to a tightening of supply in the oil shipping market. With fewer new ships entering the market, the existing fleet is in higher demand, which can further drive up spot rates. For well-leveraged oil tanker businesses like STNG, this situation presents an opportunity. With a modern and efficient fleet, they are well-positioned to capitalize on these market dynamics.STNG's financial results for  showed a net income of  132.4 million and an adjusted net income of  133.3 million. While these figures represent a decrease from Q2 2022, it's important to consider them in the broader context of the company's performance and the market conditions.The global oil shipping market is known for its volatility, with rates and revenues often fluctuating in response to changes in oil supply and demand, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. Despite these challenges, STNG has demonstrated a strong ability to navigate this complex landscape and generate increasing profits.Looking at the company's performance for the first half of 2023  H1 2023 , STNG reported a net income of  325.6 million and an adjusted net income of  328.9 million. These figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022, indicating a strong upward trend in the company's profitability.Furthermore, STNG's ability to maintain profitability despite the decrease in net income in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022 demonstrates the company's resilience in the face of market volatility. It suggests that STNG has effective strategies in place to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities, positioning it well for future growth.Management has been actively managing its debt through a combination of lease repayments, debt reductions, and new financing agreements.In , STNG exercised purchase options on several vessels that were previously financed under various lease agreements. This resulted in a significant aggregate debt reduction of  300.2 million. In July 2023, the company continued this strategy by exercising purchase options on six more vessels, leading to an additional debt reduction of  143.6 million. STNG also gave notice to exercise purchase options on two more vessels, which is expected to result in a further debt reduction of  36.5 million by the end of Q3 2023. This shows a strategy of wanting to deleverage, especially away from more expensive lease agreements.In addition to these debt reduction strategies, STNG has also secured new financing agreements. The company executed or received commitments for three separate credit facilities totaling up to  1.2 billion. The first credit facility, executed in May 2023, was a  117.4 million facility from a European financial institution. The second, executed in July 2023, was a term loan and revolving credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to  1.0 billion. Upon execution,  440.6 million was drawn from this facility to finance 21 of the company s unencumbered vessels. The remaining availability of this facility is expected to be drawn between Q3 2023 and the end of Q1 2024, primarily to repay and refinance more expensive lease financing. The third credit facility commitment, expected to close within Q3 2023, is a  94 million facility from DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, which will be used to finance four vessels.These strategies reflect STNG's proactive approach to managing its debt. By reducing its existing debt through the exercise of purchase options on leased vessels and securing new, lower-cost financing, STNG is effectively lowering its interest expenses and improving its financial position. This approach not only reduces the company's financial risk but also frees up resources that can be used to invest in its operations and growth initiatives.Scorpio's active share repurchase program is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. Share repurchase programs are often implemented when a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment. In their  Scorpios management outlined their thoughts on this explicitly stating  Share repurchases preferred over dividends when trading a significant discount to NAV.  During the most recent quarter, STNG purchased  283 million worth of shares at an average price of  48 per share. This move reduced the company's basic shares outstanding to 53 million from 56.8 million. Since the start of 2023, STNG has repurchased a substantial 8.6 million shares for a total of  421.1 million. This aggressive repurchase strategy underscores the company's belief in its intrinsic value and its commitment to capitalizing on what it perceives to be a market undervaluation of its shares. Over the past few months, STNG has been buying shares at prices ranging from  43 to  49 per share, demonstrating its commitment to this strategy and providing an idea of what they see is trading below NAV.Moreover, STNG still has  213 million remaining under its 2023 securities repurchase program. At current prices around  50 per share, this could potentially lead to the repurchase of an additional 4.26 million shares, or roughly 7.5  of the current shares outstanding. This further reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to an increase in earnings per share  EPS , all else being equal, and continue to boost the share price.It's also worth noting that STNG has preferred share repurchases over dividends when its shares are trading at a significant discount to Net Asset Value  NAV . This strategy suggests that the company is focused on long-term value creation rather than short-term yield.The age of a company's fleet is a significant factor in the maritime shipping industry, particularly for oil tankers. The typical useful lifetime of an oil tanker is between 20 to 30 years. After this period, the cost of maintaining and operating the vessel often outweighs the benefits, leading companies to retire and replace these older vessels.The global fleet's average age currently stands at 11.7 years. This figure is a crucial benchmark as it provides context for comparing individual companies' fleet ages. A fleet age significantly below this average suggests a company is operating with newer vessels, which often translates into operational and financial advantages.Scorpio Tankers Inc. stands out in this regard, boasting a modern fleet with a Deadweight Tonnage weighted average-year built of 2015. This figure is considerably newer than the global average and also surpasses some of Scorpio's direct competitors. For instance, International Seaways  and Nordic American Tankers  both have fleet average build years of 2011.Moreover, some of these competitors' fleets include ships that are reaching or have already reached their retirement age. This situation could lead to substantial capital expenditures in the near future as these companies may need to invest in new vessels to maintain their operational capacity.In contrast, Scorpio's oldest ship was built in 2012, meaning none of its vessels are approaching retirement age and many are debt-free and still have dozens of years of operation. This situation provides Scorpio with a significant advantage, as it can avoid the substantial costs associated with replacing older vessels for the foreseeable future.The benefits of a younger fleet extends beyond avoiding the costs of replacing older vessels. Younger fleets often have lower maintenance costs as newer vessels are less likely to require significant repairs. They also tend to be more fuel-efficient and are more likely to meet the latest safety and environmental regulations, which can lead to cost savings, operational efficiencies and help reduce political risk associated with older vessels. Scorpio Tankers' conservative dividend payout ratio of 10.42  demonstrates the company's strategic approach towards its long-term financial health. By retaining a significant percentage of its earnings, the company has more capital available for reinvestment into its operations and growth initiatives, and for reducing its debt load.A focus on debt reduction is particularly advantageous in the current economic climate, where rising interest rates are a concern for many businesses. By reducing its net debt, which has fallen from - 2,934 million in Q4 2021 to - 1,523 million currently, Scorpio Tankers is effectively lowering its future interest payments. This is significant because a substantial proportion of the company's debts are in the form of floating rate notes, the interest rates of which increase in tandem with market rates. A lower debt burden could even potentially lead to improved credit ratings and better loan terms in the future.Despite the expected drop in the Fleet TCE rate to  26,210 from  32,154 in Q2, the company's strategic financial management and modern fleet position it well to navigate these challenges. The company's focus on debt reduction and share buybacks over dividends suggests a long-term growth strategy that could yield significant returns for investors.The company's revenue is heavily tied to the global oil industry, and fluctuations in oil supply and demand can directly impact its profitability. This commodity price risk means that a drop in oil prices could reduce the demand for oil transportation, leading to lower revenues for Scorpio Tankers which is predicted by Scorpio in their latest earnings.Furthermore, the company's significant debt load, a portion of which is subject to floating interest rates, exposes it to interest rate risk. Should interest rates rise, Scorpio Tankers could see its interest expenses increase substantially, affecting its profitability and ability to service its debt. The company also faces regulatory risk as the shipping industry is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. Changes in these regulations could necessitate major capital expenditures, potentially impacting Scorpio Tankers' financial performance. Operational risks, inherent to the shipping industry, include potential accidents, piracy, and environmental disasters, which could lead to significant costs, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liabilities. Finally, the cyclical nature of the shipping industry and its susceptibility to global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in seaborne trade patterns create market risk for Scorpio Tankers. Downturns in the shipping cycle could decrease demand for the company's services and put downward pressure on shipping rates, which could potentially impact revenues.With all of this information on dividends, , stock buy backs and overall strong market tail winds. How do we value STNG not only against the overall market but also against some of it's peers  From a dividend perspective, STNG is trading slightly higher than their 4Y average of 1.97  at an estimated FWD rate of 2.11 . It is the lowest among its peers, especially when you add in INSW's special dividends that don't show up in their yield in the TTM or Fwd. But they also have a low payout ratio, so as they finish up deleveraging, and as their stock rises to a point they feel matches their NAV they will likely begin to focus more on dividends and less on stock buybacks. I imagine that target NAV valuation is around the  52- 55 mark, and I expect them to continue to have large stock buybacks below that price. Delving into the Price to Earnings ratio, Scorpio Tankers stands out with a trailing twelve months  P E ratio of 3.27, the lowest among its peers. This can be attributed to its relatively high debt load, as evidenced by its EV Market Cap ratios. This ratio provides a snapshot of a company's financial situation, encompassing debt, cash, and market value. STNG's position towards the higher end of this industry ratio suggests its financial strength may be less robust compared to competitors like INSW and DHT.However, the future looks promising for STNG. I anticipate that as the company manages its debt more effectively and harnesses the industry-wide earnings momentum to boost its cash reserves, it will be better capitalized. This improved financial health should enable the company to provide increased returns to its investors and drive a non-linear return, especially if Spot Charter Rates stay elevated. In my view, Scorpio Tankers Inc. represents an attractive investment opportunity, especially in terms of its Net Asset Value. Given the high valuations of ships and STNG's relatively new fleet, I believe purchasing its shares at any price below  57 represents good value. If the price drops below  40, it would be a highly attractive investment.It's important to remember, though, that the market is cyclical and can be significantly influenced by geopolitical events, which can quickly shift price targets. While this price target isn't high relative to the current prices levels. I like to set low Price Targets that I believe afford optimum risk reward ratios rather than pie in the sky valuations that companies will struggle to grow in to. Scorpio Tankers Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, strategic debt management, active share repurchase program, modern fleet, and low fleet to EV valuation.

"Yes, This September Nonfarm Payrolls Report Supports The Soft Landing Narrative","This morning's  came in white-hot at aboutThe market initially reacted with a sharp selloff, and yields spiked. By lunch hour, what started looking like a vicious selloff turned into a nice rally, complete with the S P VIX Index  falling 4  at 12 27 p.m. and the Nasdaq and Russell both up north of 1 . The expectations were for a soft report that showed a slowdown in hiring, particularly after the private sector  came in at only 89,000 earlier in the week.There were reasons to expect a weak jobs report. Still, in the end, economic strength in the labor market appears to have been greater than even the most optimistic economist forecasted. Indeed, many expected a hiring slowdown and a focus on economic weakness would be a problem.Now, the concern would appear to be the opposite  at least, that was the concern when markets first opened. However, this report seems to confirm that a soft landing is underway because jobs are being gained, and labor participation is high and steady. Yet, the wage gains are slowing and do not appear likely to reignite inflationary pressure.Nobody predicted a super-hot report, and those who discussed it thought it would play out very differently. Even seasoned market minds who discussed the prospect of a hot report were utterly wrong about how the market would respond to one. For example, consider this quote from Scott Wapner's program on CNBC yesterdayI am a big fan of Josh Brown's analysis, and while I don't always agree with his take on markets, I know he's a knowledgeable guy who does his homework. Frankly, yesterday, I would have agreed with his take. We look at the price on a screen like it is one thing. Like it changes at the whim of some unforeseen invisible hand. But the price is one of the best pieces of information you have because it reflects so many different decisions in one piece of information.The price may be one thing on your screen, but it is the sum of billions of decisions and transactions. So, the lesson is not that Mr. Brown is a lousy commentator  it is that the market humbles us all with its collective wisdom that inherently transcends what we can comprehend from the individual perspective. And I think the market took time to process the report and saw precisely what I saw  stark evidence of a soft landing. As you can see below, the recent rise in rates has not been because of inflation anyway  it's more about increasing term premia, which is .The analysis leading up to the report was a perfect case study of what happens when the crowd uses heuristics about second-order thinking to substitute for actual second-order thinking. In the market, various catchphrases tend to spread like wildfire and substitute the complex critical thought necessary to achieve alpha and a leg up over the crowd.  Good news is bad news  is one such aphorism that may have shreds of truth, but it also requires an underlying understanding of why to preserve intellectual dexterity.Firstly, let's dispel the assumption that the Fed doesn't want you to have a job right now. I'm sure Fed Chair Jay Powell and even the most hawkish members of the FOMC want you to have a job. It builds character and self-esteem. It puts money in your pocket. They want you to have a job for the same reason that old Mom and Dad encouraged you to get one. They don't want workers to have too high a degree of bargaining power in the market relative to employers because they can push up wages fast enough to reignite inflationary pressure. The Fed is trying to avoid a wage-price spiral, not trying to get you fired.But suppose the high labor costs don't lead to higher prices, and workers' ability to demand higher wages declines. In that case, you have the best of both worlds  falling inflation without the collateral damage of adverse dislocation in the labor market. So, this report confirms that a soft landing is indeed possible. Not only that, job growth appears to be driven by consumers at the lower end of the income spectrum, and labor participation has stayed at high levels, always a tonic for nervous hawks.When the market opened down, I was going to write that this was a buying opportunity. However, the market beat me to it. I can't stress this enough  I think a market rally on a scorching jobs report is a significant positive and, in some ways, a more bullish outcome than I could have imagined. I think markets will rise from here, and Q4 will live up to its seasonal strength.Look, there were definitely some angry bears this morning who thought they were about to cash in. That doesn't mean they're wrong about everything. The rising debt obligations of the United States and the potential for these levels to crowd out private sector activity are becoming more real by the day. At the same time, it may urge the Fed to make  higher for longer  last for less time than the market currently expects.The backdrop of political chaos in one of America's major political parties that could further gum up calcified political alliances that make reform difficult makes the problematic debt situation all the more ominous. Another significant risk is that the UAW strike could cause some economic dislocation. The following risks could derail any market rally, thoughFurthermore, inflation forecasts have been rising from economists. If they are correct and inflation isn't defeated, we may have much more volatility ahead of us, and the prospect of a Fed policy error rises dramatically.So, while the rally on the jobs blowout counter to expectations is very bullish and makes me want to buy, there are certainly no shortages of serious risks to contemplate. Any one of them could derail a rally and make the year-end on a sour note. Still, I think it is likelier that we climb a wall of worry and end the year on a high note.This morning's actions surprised a lot of folks, myself included. Nonetheless, your conclusion from the herky-jerky market action this morning is ultimately bullish. While the jobs number was hot, it did not indicate that wages would reignite inflationary pressure. So this turns  good news being bad news  into just plain good news. It also paves the way for the coveted White Buffalo of financial markets, a soft landing.Supply and demand is a seemingly simple concept, but it can be challenging to understand on a macro level when the labor market is involved. Like the price, headline labor numbers reflect a prodigious and complex reality that doesn't lend itself well to being boiled down to one number. But beyond the headline number, we're really after observations about collective behavior. The behavioral indicators suggest that it would be difficult to ignite the type of inflation that the Fed fears most. It is even more difficult now that wage pressures appear to be alleviating.If I am worried about a recession and I tighten my belt, but then the expected drop in demand doesn't materialize or demand increases, then not only have I likely expanded my margins. I probably need to hire an extra hand or two to help with all the business I didn't expect. I think this is what is going on in the economy, and I think countervailing forces make a soft landing likelier than recent rate angst would suggest.

My View On Wall Street: I Assess The Pros And Cons,"The S P 500 has declined about 9.5  since I last published the Equity Market PROs and CONs report on July 28th. At the end of July, investors were flying high as the major indices had put in an impressiveWe closed out another losing month in September and set sail into Q4, and now we'll revisit the PROs and CONS that are on the scene today. In this report, the  12-8 - with 2 issues that I consider Neutral.The last two months of trading in the market have been difficult for the BULLS. The major averages peaked in late July early August and have been trending lower everInvestor sentiment took forever to turn bullish this year. ironically it turned earlier this summer just in time for equities to peak and pull back in August and September. This typical contrarian indicator worked again. Now, it's back to bearish for investors. The Bespoke Investor Sentiment Composite is negative once again and CNN's Fear   Greed Index is registering  Fear  right now. Since the sentiment is contrarian, excess bearishness is considered Bullish.Seasonality was a 'Con' in my last PROs and CONs report, and unfortunately for the BULLS, it didn't disappoint. August and September weakness for equities held to form this year, but now seasonality moves back into the 'PRO' column as Q4 is typically the best time of year for stocks. As shown below in the snapshot from the Bespoke Seasonality Tool, the upcoming 3-month period has been the very best 3-month period of the year for stocks over the last ten years.The 100th percentile for gains is certainly bullish.Core inflation has come down and is showing signs of stability. Supercore inflation is deflating slower but still making progress. While inflation isn't DEAD, the stock market by its price action after the last report believes the peak is definitely in and is ready to deal with current readings for a while longer.Initial jobless claims have steadied while employment growth has slowed. Prime-age employment remains just shy of a record-high share of the population. While job openings have declined  indicating weaker labor demand , the level remains very high compared to historical readings.Consumers still have lots of cash on their balance sheets, even relative to much stronger consumer spending relative to pre-pandemic. While savings rates are low, consumer borrowing is well-covered by income and households can keep spending at a healthy  if slowly moderating  pace for some time. When consumers have jobs they will continue to spend. In addition, Corporations are not about to give up the employees they had a hard time acquiring after the pandemic. That keeps the labor situation  tight .A range of manufacturing industries are rapidly adding factory capacity in response to recent industrial policy  CHIPS, BIL, IRA . Construction on factories is running north of  200bn per year with hundreds of billions more in spending to come. At the same time, the housing market is still short of inventory and will be for years to come. Finally, infrastructure spending has accelerated sharply thanks to fiscal policy and is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a double-edged sword. Good news for select sectors of the economy but it also keeps  Debt  and  Inflation  elevated.During the 2022 bear market, rolling 12-month forward earnings estimates fell 6.5  from peak to trough. Since then, they have recovered almost the entire decline. Of course, analysts tend to lag the market, and estimates only started getting cut well after the 2022 bear market was underway. Still, underlying earnings are in good shape. Recent results have also started to turn more positive. The EPS beat rate fell from its historic post-COVID surge, but over the last few months has ramped back up again. A similar, more modest recovery in guidance raise rates is also taking place.The equity market thrives on  themes , and  AI  has been the market's theme in a big way for most of this year. There's a good chance this becomes a  rather than  wave. Over the long term that is bullish for equities. Every week there seems to be some new technology in the AI space introduced, and search interest for AI topics remains elevated and trending higher.The only question is when will real money hit the bottom line.Outside of the mega-caps in the S P 500, it has been a flat year for the market. So even though the cap-weighted S P 500 is still showing a 10  YTD gain, things aren't nearly as rosy underneath the surface. The median S P 500 stock is flat, while the median stock in the small-cap Russell 2000 is solidly in the red at -7 . That doesn't look like the  new  BULL market backdrop that the majority says it is. As the week ended I now see ALL of the indices barely above their Long term trendlines. This equity  market   is living on the edge.Main Street media always talk about the 2-year 10-year Treasury Yield curve. The Fed also watches another metric. The 3-month 10-year Treasury yield curve has now been inverted for a record 222 consecutive trading days. The curve reached its maximum point of inversion in early May at 183 basis points and has steepened to its current level of -75. Given that it has been nearly a year since the curve first inverted and the economy still appears to be steady, there's a growing consensus that the current signal has been a false alarm.But don't dismiss the yield curve too quickly. As shown in the table below, historically, the average number of days between when the yield curve first inverts to the start of a recession is 589 days.From the time the yield curve bottoms to the start of a recession, the average is 395 days. Based on these two figures, a recession in the second half of 2024 would fit right within the averages.The Leading Economic Indicators index published by the Conference Board takes a range of different economic and financial market data points into account and creates a single index that tends to deteriorate before recessions and recover before activity bottoms. As shown in the chart,  In other words, if we don't see a recession following this run of data, it will be an unprecedented result.The Leading Indicators have fallen for 18 consecutive months. Only two other periods have seen longer streaks of decline  the mid-1970s recession and the global financial crisis.There is a consensus view that the FOMC is near its terminal rate or close to it. However, the message we heard this week from Chair Powell is  It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That too is pretty scary. The Fed is in a box and along with the market is facing a lose-lose situation.Home prices have surged thanks to a mismatch between supply and demand. High mortgage rates mean existing homeowners are unwilling to surrender extremely low rates, further restricting supply.Those high mortgage rates also damage affordability driven by high prices. When combined, affordability has hit the worst levels since the 1980s, with the average non-managerial worker needing to pay the equivalent of 86.7 hours of wages to cover the mortgage payment for the median existing home assuming 5  down. And down payments are increasingly difficult to save up given high prices.The shock to the banking system delivered late last year and early this year has largely been digested by the market. However, leading indicators of bank credit suggest a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank lending over the next year.The SLOOS  Senior Loan Officer Outlook Survey  asks lenders whether they are seeing higher or lower demand for credit, as well as whether they are raising or lowering the standards they underwrite to. As shown in the chart below, the reported demand for credit and the reported credit standards suggest that commercial   industrial  C I  loan growth is set to slow dramatically.Declining credit outstanding would only do bad things for the economic backdrop.The terrorist attack in Israel highlights another U.S. policy error. From a financial point of view that brings the country into another conflict. The US  debt  issue was highlighted in last week's MACRO update. It appears the US is now supporting two wars. Ukraine, and now Israel along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the  since WWII. This country has never been more stretched and vulnerable, and at some point, this will have a serious impact on the MACRO economic scene. At some point, the market sniffs this MACRO issue as the serious threat that it is.Two years ago, we could look at an S P 500 P E ratio in the high teens, or even 20, and say that at least interest rates were low. Bespoke Investment group  On a trailing basis, the S P 500 trades for 20.6 times earnings, and while that is far from a record, it ranks in the 83rd percentile relative to all other readings in the post-WWII era. Comparing the earnings yield of the S P 500  inverse of the P E ratio  to the yield on the 10-year US Treasury, the current spread of 0.25 percentage points is the lowest since 2010.While 'the market' is expensive, the key driver of the valuation stems from the largest stocks in the index. As shown below, the 10-largest stocks in the index, which account for 32  of the S P 500, trade for a median of 31.7 times earnings with four stocks trading for over 65 times earnings.Meanwhile, the median multiple of the remaining 490 stocks is  20 times trailing earnings. That was OK when interest rates were zero, but at 5  we are in a different backdrop that typically takes PE ratios down.This  CON  has been on the list since the beginning of the year, yet stocks have risen. As mentioned earlier, the S P 500's earnings yield relative to Treasury yields and real rates is at its lowest levels in decades, meaning stocks are less attractive relative to risk-free rates. The S P 500's dividend yield was more than 100 basis points higher than the 2-year Treasury yield two years ago,  There is an alternative to stocks again. As uncertainty ramps higher, investors will reach for risk-free yield. All of that cash that many analysts and BULLS say is on the sidelines and will go into stocks, seems more like a  Hope  trade. Those analysts are living in the past.While inflation readings have come down dramatically over the last year, the June Year over-year reading of 2.9  might be as good as it gets in the near term. Huge month-over-month increases in CPI in early 2022 are now removed from the y y CPI tally, which will make it harder for CPI to continue lower in the coming months unless we see outright deflation which is not currently projected. Investors expecting the y y CPI number to continue lower may be surprised to see it keep ticking higher up towards 3.5 -4  through year-end and beyond. The latest PCE report confirms that inflation is still hanging on, and any further progress will be SLOW.From the October 2022 peak through the July 14th bottom, the broad trade-weighted dollar fell 8.4 . Over the last three months, it has risen close to 4 . Since 1973, larger-than-typical dollar rallies have led to lower-than-typical S P 500 returns. As long as the dollar is strong, it's doubtful the stock market will take off in a big way. Of course, the inverse statement is also true  a reversal lower in the dollar would set up a positive backdrop.The bull market's uptrend from the October 2022 low has been celebrated, but as I have continually pointed out the near-term technicals do not look good. They still have a lot to prove before I can BUY into the New BULL market scene.We've seen  since the market made its high for the year on the last day of July. For this negative technical action to turn, we'll need indices to break above their early September highsThe results of all five of the regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys for September were released. Altogether, regional Fed surveys have shown that manufacturing activity improved slightly in September. The PRO crowd will claim that we have seen the bottom and improvement is on its way.The folks that present the Bearish argument say  Show me . They point out that after two years of declines, the net readings are still in contraction territory. The fact that stocks hit such extreme oversold levels towards the end of September - a notoriously weak time of year for stocks - is a 'PRO' in the minds of an optimist, as there is a tendency for prices to revert when they get this overdone.Furthermore, Treasury yields, the dollar, and oil are all at extremes to the upside at the same time. It doesn't take much for a big reversal to occur when things get this one-sided. That is true BUT  extreme  conditions can last for longer than an investor wants to believe.  Hoping  for a change in direction is a bad strategy.This time around there are some distinct changes on the list. In July the standout on the PRO side was the trend reversal resulting in a BULL market backdrop that I said trumped just about all of the negatives. This time around we see that has changed again as many indices and the DJIA along with the Russell 2000 are back in a BEAR backdrop.On the CON side, the T.A.R.A. argument is still there and it has started to impact the market, especially when uncertainty ramps up. There is plenty of cash on the sidelines, but probabilities suggest a lot of that cash won't make it into equities due to the  risk-free  alternatives. This is one of the reasons I do not see another rip-roaring BULL market leg to new all-time highs on the horizon. The Earnings forecast is the one issue to watch, and  It is a fluid situation that can change quickly. At the end of the day that will control what happens in the very near term. After I put the report together, I came away with the feeling that the PROs are centered around the near-term prospects, while many of the CONs speak to the MACRO view.Last week's selling pressure bled over to Monday's  open  with the S P establishing a new intraday low during this  correction . However, buyers emerged and the S P rebounded to post a modest seven-point loss. The price action was typical for a market that is trying to find a bottom. Intraday rallies dissipate, and there is plenty of choppy price action. The NASDAQ snapped a 4-day losing streak with a modest gain. No such luck for the other indices. The S P extended its daily losing streak to 5, with the DJIA and Russell 2000 establishing 4 straight days of losses.More choppy trading on Tuesday was eventually resolved to the upside, something we haven't seen in a while. All major indices and every sector posted gains for the day as investors celebrated another  Turnaround Tuesday .The party ended there for the BULLS. The combined losses for the S P 500 in the last 3 days of trading tallied 3 . While the NASDAQ Composite fell 3.9 . Support levels were taken out, and the entire market ended the week in an extremely oversold condition.US companies signaled a  during October, following broadly stagnant output seen in August and September.PMI Composite Output Index at 51.0  September  50.2 . 3-month high.

Rather, the issue is that many skilled workers of the national oil company have fled the country amid record-setting inflation and political chaos. Likewise, following the past decade's nationalization confiscation of energy assets owned by some international companies, it is difficult to imagine them wanting to return.Therefore, it is doubtful that any  supply  from this dictatorship will have any impact on the global energy scene.

Enterprise Products Partners: The Highest-Quality 8%-Yielding Wide Moat MLP,"The energy sector is highly complex. It consists of so many fundamental influences and industries that it's easy to lose track - especially when looking for something specific.Essentially, the energy industry consists of three major partsAs the overview below shows, upstream companies are the ones that produce natural gas and crude oil, which is the basis for a wide range of products, including gasoline, diesel, and various chemicals.The companies turning raw products into finished products are refiners. However, in order for these companies to get access to feedstock, midstream companies are needed. These companies provide storage and pipelines to ship, i.e., oil to refineries.The finished products are then shipped to the end customer using midstreamHaving said that, upstream, midstream, and downstream all have pros and cons.Investors looking to capitalize on rising oil and gas prices are better off buying upstream companies as these companies have revenue streams tied to the price of commodities.Refiners are dependent on the crack spread, which is the profit margin of refiners that buy oil to turn it into diesel, gasoline, and other products. These companies also are price sensitive, just different from upstream companies.Midstream companies are the most boring companies - but in a good way.These companies are dependent on the amount of product flowing through their pipelines and contract prices. Most companies also have take-or-pay contracts, which allow them to generate revenue, regardless of whether customers use their pipelines.The benefit is that cash flows tend to come with very low volatility, which is great for dividend safety. The drawdown is that investors do not benefit from a potentially steep increase in commodity prices. On the flip side, investors also do not suffer if prices drop.The biggest risk is a scenario where commodity prices are so depressed that upstream companies are likely to reduce output. This could hurt volumes for midstream companies. The same goes for weak end-user demand.While I cannot make the case that midstream companies are without risks, they come with a great risk reward, given high average dividend yields and, above all, very wide moat business models. After all, it's extremely expensive to build a pipeline and terminal network.Once companies have a network in place, they quickly turn into cash cows. is such a company.This company may be one of the best in the business. It has a history of stock price outperformance, a top-tier balance sheet, loads of free cash flow thanks to a mature business model, a juicy yield, and a moat that can be seen from space.In this article, I'll walk you through my thoughts as I make the case that EPD is among the best high-yield midstream companies money can buy.As one of America's largest pipeline and terminal operators, EPD isn't unbiased. However, it makes a compelling case for a strong future of fossil fuels.For example, EPD makes the case that energy usage is essential to improve the UN Human Development Index. This index covers life expectancy, education, and economic wealth.As we can see in the overview below, the higher the Human Development Index, the higher the demand for energy.While, at some point, energy efficiency becomes key, as more energy doesn't improve the Human Development Index anymore  between roughly 150 and 200 Gigajoules per capita , it's fair to say that the development of economies is based on energy demand.It's why coal production was so important during the industrial revolution, as it allowed the US and other Western nations to start building wealthy economies. While we're now at a point where renewables are increasingly important, our wealth is built on coal, oil, and gas.Hence, EPD puts a big question mark in the chart below, as there's no way we can achieve Paris Climate Agreement targets in a scenario where the global population growth until 2050 is expected to be 1.8 billion.In light of these developments, the United States is the place to be. The United States enjoys some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world, a massive infrastructure network allowing it to produce and export these reserves, and stock-listed companies that allow investors to benefit from this.Looking at the chart below, oil, gas, and related liquids production is expected to see consistent growth, albeit at lower growth rates compared to pre-pandemic levels. That's why I'm also bullish on upstream, but that's something we'll discuss in another article.Additionally, the US will be an increasingly important export nation for crude oil, natural gas, ethane, LPG, and related.EPD has highlighted domestic demand versus total supply in the charts below. Note that by 2030, the U.S. will also be able to boost LNG  liquid natural gas  exports to more than 40 billion cubic feet per day. In 2021, that number was 11 billion.Having said all of this, rising energy production, higher export demand, and long-term tailwinds for fossil fuels are fertile ground for EPD.Founded in 1968, EPD is one of the oldest MLPs in the United States. With a market cap of  58 billion, it's also one of the biggest.In this case, its age is a huge advantage. The company is mature, which means it has an established network of pipelines and terminals without the requirement to spend a lot on growth capital expenditures.When dealing with midstream companies, I usually advise people to go with mature companies, as these are often able to pay dividends without having to borrow money.Looking at the map below, we see that the company has a network of more than 50,000 miles of pipelines, more than 260 million barrels of storage, 20 deep water docks, 30 natural gas processing plants, and 26 fractionators.Over the past 12 months, EPD spent  2.7 billion on capex. This is a combination of growth and maintenance capex.This number has been well-below pre-pandemic levels when the company had to consistently invest more in its business to grow it.Now, it benefits from strong  and rising  operating cash flow from past growth investments and subdued investment requirements.Before 2017, the company didn't generate  a lot of  free cash flow. Now, it's generating more than  4 billion in annual free cash flow.This number is expected to gradually increase to  6.5 billion by 2025, which would translate to more than 11  of its market cap.As a result of these qualities, the company has a 3.0x leverage ratio, which is extremely healthy. Hence, it has an A- Baa1 credit rating, one of the best ratings in the industry.FurthermoreFurthermore, unlike many peers that had to cut their dividends when a toxic mix of falling energy prices and high capex needs hit them in 2015 2016, EPD has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive years.Also, looking at the numbers below, the company has a well-covered dividend and self-funded capex. It's now a healthy cash cow with tremendous dividend potential, thanks to an expected double-digit free cash flow yield after 2024.These qualities have also allowed EPD to outperform its peers. Over the past 10 years, EPD shares have returned 71   including dividends . The Alerian MLP ETF  returned just 7 .When looking at our rating tracker, we see that the company enjoys the highest quality score in the industry, which is no surprise, given what we have discussed so far.Valuation wise, we're dealing with an attractive opportunity.The company is trading at 8.9x 2024E EBITDA, which is based on its market cap, roughly  1.0 billion in minority interest  income streams it doesn't fully own ,  27.5 billion in expected net debt, and  9.7 billion in potential EBITDA.This valuation is attractive, as EPD tends to trade close to 10x EBITDA.This would give the company a fair value 18  above the current unit price.The current consensus price target is  32, which is 20  above the current price, making my outlook a consensus outlook.Having said all of this, I expect EPD to outperform most of its peers on a prolonged basis. The company has the perfect low-risk business model, strong demand and supply tailwinds, a healthy balance sheet, self-funded operations, and a well-covered dividend.On top of that, its juicy 7.5  yield comes with a great valuation, making EPD a terrific tool for income-seeking investors.Enterprise Products Partners stands out as an exceptional player in the midstream industry.With a rich history, extensive infrastructure, and a rock-solid balance sheet, EPD's appeal is undeniable. Fueled by rising energy demand, export potential, and a mature business model, EPD boasts remarkable financials.Generating substantial free cash flow, maintaining a robust dividend growth history, and possessing a conservative debt profile, EPD promises a steady income stream and substantial growth potential.EPD's strategic position in the energy landscape and its juicy 7.5  yield make it a standout choice for income-oriented investors.The company's low-risk, high-reward business model, supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics, paints a promising picture for the future.As a seasoned player with a well-established moat, EPD is primed to deliver both consistent returns and a hedge against market uncertainties.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

Tighten Your Seatbelts,"Shifting supply-and-demand dynamics appear to be driving bond markets more than fundamentals, which makes for a bumpy ride.With our annual  outlook just around the corner, we ve recently been discussing some ofIn fixed income, we think a key theme will be one that most strategists did not have in their outlooks for 2023, but which was nonetheless prominent and could persist into 2024  the overwhelming importance of bond market supply and demand in setting prices and yields, which at times superseded the direction suggested by economic and credit fundamentals.We think it is worth singling this theme out. As we close in on the end of this historic tightening cycle, central bank policy is subsiding as a source of uncertainty, and the ebb andThrough the fourth quarter of 2022, U.S. and global growth outlooks were becoming steadily more pessimistic. By the end of the year, for most economists and strategists the debate was not if, but when, the recessions would occur during 2023.What happened to credit spreadsFor the ICE BofA Global High Yield Index, they went from almost 590 basis points at the start of the fourth quarter of 2022 to as low as 430 basis points by March 2023. For the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Corporate Bond Index, they went from around 180 basis points to less than 130. For the ICE BofA Global Hybrid Corporate Index, they tightened from 340 to 240 basis points. The mini-banking crisis in March caused a spike, but spreads have drifted tighter again through the rest of the year.Was this because the U.S. economy unexpectedly continued to grow, even as China and much of Europe stagnated  Perhaps but that wouldn t explain why we saw the same journey in European high yield and emerging markets spreads.A much better explanation, in our view, is the dearth of new corporate bond issuance in the first half of the year. Throughout much of 2021 and 2022, corporate issuers financed aggressively relative to their needs, taking advantage of record-low rates. That meant many coffers were full by the close of 2022. Bond market inflows have been modest this year because many investors have been happy to sit in cash or money markets earning 5 . But with high yields now on offer, the inflows weren t negative and when that modest demand met almost non-existent supply, it tightened spreads.Right now, of course, attention is focused on the rates market rather than credit markets. Core government bond yields have burst out of their 2023 trading ranges, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield adding some 65 basis points in little over a month to trade higher than at any time since early 2007. What might be going on hereWell, certainly the U.S. Federal Reserve s steady drumbeat of higher rates for longer even though inflation has been declining is settling into the market psyche. It s difficult to lay the blame on changes to fundamental inflation expectations  The move in the nominal yield curve has been matched by a move in the real yields, leaving inflation expectations unchanged. Instead, meaningful changes in the supply-and-demand dynamic appear to be playing a large role here, as well.The August Treasury refunding saw a significant lift in coupon issuance, and the market has come to the realization that this is the beginning of a durable trend. While the Fed s shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening has been well-telegraphed and understood by market participants, the Treasury s growing fiscal deficit is surprising on the high side. Together, they currently amount to close to 10  of U.S. GDP, with quantitative tightening accounting for around 3 .Spending continues to rise, while revenues have dropped by 10  for the fiscal year-to-date relative to 2022, largely due to a heavy decline in capital gains tax receipts. The deficit is expected to be around  1.6 trillion this year, versus around  1 trillion last year. Current forecasts for 2024 are around  1.8 trillion, with rising interest expense continuing to contribute much of the lift. We think this means Treasury coupon issuance could roughly double from this year s level of just over  1 trillion to as much as  1.9 trillion in 2024 a massive supply shift.On the other side of the equation, in addition to the Fed going from large-scale buyer to seller, U.S. commercial banks, traditionally a major source of demand, are mostly absent because their existing bond holdings are both large and underwater, and because of heightened market and regulatory scrutiny following the mini-banking crisis earlier in the year.The offshore bid for U.S. bonds an important source of demand ever since the global financial crisis has also been all but eliminated as the rapid rise in U.S. short rates relative to those in many other markets has resulted in prohibitively high currency-hedging costs. Finally, active money managers  ourselves included  would usually have been keen to take advantage of such a dramatic rise in yields by adding portfolio duration, but holdings analysis and sentiment surveys suggest that, as a group, money managers have already spent much of their firepower.Does this mean the march to higher yields will continue unabated  Not necessarily. Three particularly large sources of demand loom on the horizon.The massive and ever-growing mountain of cash residing in money market funds and other short-term investments could start to move as soon as there is a whiff of change to monetary policy in the air. Likewise, as long-duration, high-grade corporate bond yields move into the 6 7  range, liability-driven pension fund investors may start to shift allocations toward them.Finally, while short- to intermediate-term correlations between Treasuries and risky assets have been consistently positive recently, that could change rapidly if risk aversion rises, creating a potentially strong bid for bonds.With such strong, shifting supply-and-demand forces waiting to exert themselves in Treasury and credit markets, investors would do well to be ready for sudden regime changes and volatile price action.We have waited a long time for value to return to fixed income markets. With nominal yields at levels we haven t seen in 16 years, combined with an attractive move to higher real yields, we are generally comfortable clipping a healthy coupon in today s market, even if the ride has become bumpier and is likely to stay that way.Tighten seatbelts and count the income.

"Global Medical: 7.7% Yielding Preferreds Are Expensive, A Look At Alternatives","Global Medical REIT Inc.  is a medical office building play that we have covered before. After two buy ratings, we moved to the sidelines in our last piece.There was really nothing strongly negative about theSource  GMRE's Q2-2023 was about in line but we saw the slow and steady impact from the interest rate hikes. Fixed charge coverage was steadily moving lower and we are likely to see the same trend in Q3-2023.Interest expenses are up substantially from Q2-2022 and funds from operations  FFO  and adjusted FFO are both falling under the pressure.It is fascinating that we are here despite a primarily fixed-rate regime for the REIT.The weighted maturity does still look small and that represents the biggest risk to the long term health of the company. The company is aware of this and is actively managing things before there are problems.SourcePortfolio level metrics look great, as they always have. We would not expect any deterioration here, outside of a very severe recession.GMRE has a soft lease maturity schedule for the remainder of 2023 and then we have over 14  coming up for renewal in 2024.Occupancy levels remain near 97  and this is the other area to monitor. While the two  office buildings and medical office buildings  are not identical, there are overlaps. It is not too uncommon to find doctors having clinics in general office space and also seeing general office space  upgraded  to accommodate doctors. With the plethora of office space that is begging for attention, this is a risk that investors should look out for. Keep in mind that doctors are not the class of tenants that will move to save a few dollars. Practice location and convenience are key. Most also have staffing shortages and moving to a new location might make that worse. But it is a longer term risk factor for this area. Even in the more complex area of laboratory spaces, which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  specializes in, we have seen . So while the asset class may be recession resistant, it is not going to defy the laws of supply and demand.Whichever way you look at it, GMRE.PR.A is of course safer than the common shares. After all, you have the large common equity buffer in front.But is this the best bang for your buck  Probably not. One issue we have with GMRE.PR.A is just how lopsided the setup is on this, thanks to the very high coupon of 7.5 . GMRE.PR.A trades right near par with a 7.7 . Now, that does not sound like a problem by itself, but you have the risk of a call, immediately in the next rate cut cycle. So you have minimal upside and yes, all the downside if interest rates go higher or if the gradual destruction of value in the company. We will illustrate our point further with two examples.In the realm of REITs, triple nets tend to be the safest. The parent company here Spirit Realty Capital  sports a BBB rating  GMRE does not have a credit rating . SRC has a . The weighted average lease maturity is over 10 years. On a credit quality SRC is definitely going to be miles and miles ahead of GMRE. But you get about the same yield from both preferred shares with SRC.PR.A giving you 7.48 . The big difference here is that SRC.PR.A trades at  20.06 offering you substantial upside to par in case of interest rate cuts.This is from EPR Properties  which . We will focus on this one, even though EPR has two other preferred share series. This one is a straight preferred  no convertible calculations  and offers a 7.91  yield currently. It too trades at a big discount to par and offers substantial upside in case of a rate cutting cycle.On a credit quality basis as well, we see EPR preferreds as somewhere between GMRE.PR.A and SRC.PR.A. So relative to GMRE.PR.A, you are getting higher credit quality and more upside if interest rates are cut.Common shares now offer a 9.4  yield and we think that will be maintained for the foreseeable future. Of course growth is going to be next to impossible as the AFFO payout ratio approaches 100  and the company can only issue equity below NAV. But the stock still has value and we think we can eek out 10-12  returns from here by opportunistically using covered calls. Our last executed covered calls are shown below and they reduced the volatility of our position substantially.The preferred shares seem remarkably expensive relative to what is available today. We would only be interested in GMRE.PR.A shares if they offer a 8.2  plus yield. targets the best value stocks with the highest margins of safety.

Market Is Set Up For A February 2020 Type Collapse,"Following the summer rally, the market has been on a gradual decline in recent weeks. Gains are showing signs of rapid unwinding after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated policymakers' support for  rates to tame inflation. TheThe latest Fed dot plot shows support for the Fed Funds rate to hit the 5.50  to 5.75  range by year-end, implying another 25 bps increase at either the upcoming November or December policy meeting. Rate cut expectations for 2024 have also tempered, with policymakers' latest projection implying a benchmark rate at 5.1  by the end of next year, which is about 50 bpsMeanwhile, the economy has withstood the most aggressive cycle of rate hikes in decades better than expected - both consumer spending and the labour market have been resilient, incentivizing an upward revision to the 2023 economic growth projection from 1  in June to , with the expected unemployment rate tweaked lower from 4.5  to 4.1 . Although data suggests a soft landing is possible, Chair Powell has denied such a scenario as the  and reiterated the Fed's stance to keep monetary policy in restrictive territory for longer.The remarks have taken the long-end Treasury yield above a  in recent weeks, while equity performance has also been . Although bonds have been pricing in the new normal of restrictive monetary policy for a while now, equity valuations appear to only now be catching up. We see several risks that are rapidly brewing into reality, which could suggest a sustained downtrend in the S P  and Nasdaq  valuations from current levels.Inflation has shown signs of  over the summer, but risks of a reacceleration are still running high. This is corroborated by August figures that came in , with both core and headline inflation running hot on the resurgence of energy costs and stubbornly high shelter costs.Specifically, oil prices have  climbed nearly  25 from their summer lows , representing  over the past quarter and trading comfortably above the  90 range. While oil prices have largely been driven by weak sentiment during the first half of the year, primarily influenced by fears of weakening demand due to China's deteriorating economy which has overshadowed OPEC  supply curbs, the reality of tightening supplies is settling in. And this is reflected in the recent surge in gasoline prices, which contributed to more than half of August's monthly price increase. Meanwhile, the outlook on food prices also remains mixed, as the combination of rising energy and labour costs alongside shortages in  and  due to extreme weather remain headwinds. Taken together, both core and non-core prices continue to face prominent risks of resurgence, underscoring August's figures may be a warning sign.With inflation still running hot, the higher for longer narrative is likely to settle in as the new normal. We fear that this setup may be ushering in the most adverse implication possible - the Fed may stop pursuing a Goldilocks soft landing scenario and opt for a forced correction of the economy, as the situation becomes increasingly politically driven. And Chair Powell's recent rejection of the economic soft landing as a baseline scenario is corroborative of this risk. The higher for longer rate environment has pushed Treasury yields toward an all-time high.  Treasury yields have rapidly surged beyond the 4.6  range, while the  is approaching 4.7 . Meanwhile, the rate-sensitive  yield has experienced a relatively gradual uptrend, reaching about 5.1 .At these levels, the government faces acute financial pressure to funding operations. For context, nearly a third of total U.S. government debt outstanding is set to hit maturity within the next 12 months, with more than a half set to mature over the next three years.This underscores the massive refinancing needed over the foreseeable future, and more importantly, the government's exposure to impact from an adverse rate environment. The  on related debt has already surged from 1.5  from when it was last financed, to now 3.0 . And the doubling rate is poised to climb further in tandem with rising interest rates, underscoring quarterly interest expense payments beyond the current all-time high of  in no time.The ever-increasing federal debt burden, coupled with rising debt service costs implies the potential for tax increases, which could adversely impact the economy further as still-hot inflation and tightening financial conditions run simultaneously in the background. More importantly, the combination will be adverse to the Biden administration's outlook on extending its term heading into the 2024 re-election. To prevent this unfavourable mix, Chair Powell and Co. may need to tighten credit conditions further to manually orchestrate the slowdown needed to put the economy into correction, putting conditions for a soft landing further out of reach.Adding pressure to this dire set-up is the mechanics of leveraged rate funds that have been increasing their short wagers on Treasury leading up to the September FOMC meeting. The net-short positions on Treasuries futures held by leveraged funds reached their  in more than a decade in August, incentivized by persistent economic challenges spanning  inflation, tight labour market and the hawkish Fed . The  on cash Treasury and futures prices may have also incentivized the build-up of bearish bets. However, the recent surge in yields could potentially lead to an unwind of this net-short positioning, and pressure bonds' performance further by creating shock waves that will ripple throughout the market. The unpredictably elevated nature of long-end Treasury yields is corroborated by the  of the five- and 30-year Treasury yield curve last week - a year after the curve's inversion reached its  in more than a decade.In addition to persistent inflation and tightening financial conditions, the overvalued nature of equity valuations at current levels is what greenlights the impending risk of a broader market crash. Prior to the onset of the late September market slump, the S P 500 had been trading at a record high of almost 30x forward earnings, representing a rich valuation premium to 10-year average of about 23x. Much of this uptrend had been buoyed by the market's frenzy for AI, with the Magnificent Seven stocks - namely, Apple , Amazon , Google    , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia  and Tesla  - trading at an average forward P E of more than 40x and accounting for about  of the S P 500 index's performance. But the S P 500, ex-Magnificent Seven, is not cheap either - it currently trades at about 24x estimated earnings, and still exceeds the 10-year average of about 21x on the normalized gauge. The resurgence of tech valuations is corroborated by the Nasdaq 100's lofty premium built-up this year - the tech-heavy index is currently trading at  estimated earnings, far exceeding its historical average of about .Although long-end Treasury yields have long been pushing new highs since the onset of the latest rate hike cycle, which have been adverse to growth valuations underpinned by cash flows further out in the future, the market's rally this year has largely defied these challenges most prominently observed during 2022. Markets had likely been pricing in expectations for an eventual normalization in the rate environment during the first half of the year, as improving inflationary pressures harbinger the impending unwinding of monetary policy tightening. This is supported by observations of historically low equity risk premium priced into market valuations.Recall that the ERP measures the difference between returns on equities versus the risk-free rate of return on Treasury. The yield on short-end Treasury bills had consistently exceeded the average return on equity as measured by the inverse of the S P 500 P E ratio during the first half of the year - a first since 2000 - likely on the back of expectations for increased visibility on an eventual trajectory back towards monetary policy easing. Even with the recent slump in stock valuations, the  on three-month T-bills still exceeds the average 4.2  return on equities computed on the inverse of S P 500 ex-Magnificent Seven P E ratio of about 24x, despite the latter's higher risk exposure.This suggests that the market's latest declines following the Fed's reaffirmation on a higher for longer rate reality is a reflection of swift adjustments to the ERP. While valuations have not budged in the face of continued rate hikes during the first half of 2023, they might very well start to as the potential of a soft landing and eventual policy easing are pushed back until further notice. Recall the CAPM model, which dictates the cost of equity based on both the stock and broader market's risk profile. The cost of equity is computed as the risk-free rate plus the equity beta multiplied by the ERP.The cost of equity is typically more sensitive to changes in the ERP than the risk-free rate itself. As markets are likely to upwardly adjust the ERP in response to the new normal of higher for longer interest rates, the discount factor on future cash flows accordingly increases, risking a further decline in equity valuations from current levels.Currently lofty market valuations also face brewing weakness among financial names. While market sentiment has normalized since the slew of regional bank failures in March, it does not materially change the reality that an elevated rate environment does not bode well for the financial sector. Higher rates essentially mean higher borrowing costs, and narrowing net interest margins for the banks. Customers will continue to be incentivized to rotate their deposits into higher-yielding products and accounts, impacting the availability of low-cost funding for banks to service its lending operations and, inadvertently, pressuring net interest income. Meanwhile, borrowing will likely remain weak in the face of an elevated rate environment as home buyers and investors stay risk-averse, which will hamper banks' earnings further.While both regulators and banks have  capital buffer requirements to better  cope with a severe economic shock , especially following the slew of bank failures earlier this year, the sector's exposure to weakness persists amid the elevated rate environment. As Treasury yields continue to rise, the value of long-term notes held by banks diminishes. While much of these losses stay unreported on P L, as banks stash the holdings away as  available for sale securities  with their unrealized gains   losses flowing through AOCI, the diminishing value of bond assets affects banks' level of equity on the balance sheet. The average capital requirement - or CET1 ratio - for large banks currently , which implies that for every  10 the bank lends, it must have at least  0.895 of capital in reserve. This also indicates that banks typically operate at about 10x leverage, which exposes them to risks of a significant equity value correction in the event of material depreciation to asset value - a case proven in the failures of , , , and .Taken together, the window of weakness on equities is rapidly expanding at current levels. The durability of current valuation premiums are becoming increasingly at risk, given weakness in underlying fundamentals amid the elevated rate environment.In addition to persistent inflation, higher for longer interest rates, and lofty equity valuations, there is also a broadening portfolio of other moving pieces indicative of further market weakness to come The U.S. government has narrowly dodged a shutdown this weekend with the agreement on a  for ongoing negotiations regarding long-term funding. But this does not eradicate the impending risk of a potential no-deal, which could bring on adverse implications for equity valuations.The market has historically rallied upon the end of a government shutdown averted shutdown. This was also the case earlier this year, when the government had averted a shutdown  and potential financial crisis  after an agreement to  the U.S. debt ceiling. However, the increasing frequency of government shutdown risks  two times this year  amidst an inflationary environment and tightening financial conditions is unprecedented. This is in line with the market's modest response to the latest risk of a government shutdown - much of the recent market downside realized were likely attributable to the reality of a higher interest rate environment settling in, which means that the averted shutdown is unlikely to be a  big source of upside  in the near-term.But the mire of political drama is likely to further dampen confidence in the U.S. government's ability to navigate the economy back to health. Current models estimate a  headwind to annualized GDP growth for each week of government shutdown that could potentially take place in the fourth quarter if the 45-day impasse ends with no deal. A further extension could also  the Fed's efforts to quell inflation , risking a reversal of recent progress made. The , which measures stock market volatility expectations, also remains dampened at sub-20 levels considering the current market risk profile. Under the , which divides the current VIX by 16 to gauge the implied stock market movement, current options pricing suggests a  1  daily movement in the S P 500. We do not think this has sufficiently de-risked for impending market risks.Instead, the modest VIX is likely underpriced for the current market risk profile set-up due to the supply and demand mechanics in options markets, influenced primarily by structured product funds. Specifically, options selling for passive income at some of these funds may be weighing on the VIX, resulting in the gauge's inadequate reflection of pent-up stock market volatility, which risks becoming an overlooked factor.Another implied risk to consider is the historical link between month-end options expiry  mopex  that happens on the third Friday of each month, and an equity market collapse. The onset of the equity market collapse observed in February 2020 had coincided with mopex on February 21. This eerily resembles the latest stock slump, which began the third Friday of September, in line with the latest mopex. The narrative on weakening consumption amid inflationary pressures and an elevated borrowing cost environment has been brewing for more than a year. Yet corporate earnings have largely stayed resilient, leading markets to contemplate if relevant risks have already been priced into current market valuations.The resilient labour market amid the latest cycle of monetary policy tightening has been a primary counteractive force to the adverse combination of dwindling pandemic-era savings and persistent inflation. But this last lever is likely going to give soon. Credit card delinquencies are  pre-pandemic levels, while the resumption of  this month is likely to weigh on household budgets further. Specifically, cutting out room in budgets for student loan repayments is expected to displace  in annual discretionary spending and impact GDP growth by 0.1  this year and 0.3  next year.Unfortunately, the added burden on consumer budgets also coincides with the timeline of which the lagging monetary policy effect on labour markets is due to materialize. Different parts of the economy have different sensitivities to monetary policy tightening. And for the labour markets, which has been resilient through it all so far, typically start to feel the impact of monetary tightening at the 18- to 24-month mark. That means the  full force  of the 0  to 5.5  rate hikes implemented since March 2022 are about to be felt by the labour market from here on out, potentially eradicating a key source of strength that has been keeping the economy afloat so far. With at least one more rate hike in the books, the impact of weakening consumer spending might finally be starting to hit the underlying fundamentals critical to supporting the market's lofty valuation premiums at current levels.While 2023 has largely defied the market's pessimism and turned out to be a good year for equities so far, vulnerabilities to a violent downturn remain close. The combination of Fed hawkishness, political motives, weakening economic fundamentals and a potential earnings recession could risk sending new shock waves to the broader markets, putting the case for a soft landing further out of reach. The set-up is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the durability of equity valuation premiums at current levels, driving up risks that the latest uptrend might be finally running out of steam.Thank you for reading my analysis.

"CVR Partners: 33% Dividend Yield, Breakout Appears Imminent","CVR Partners, LP  is a company that focuses on creating nitrogen-based fertilizers such as ammonia that is currently paying a 20 percent dividend yield. I know what you might be thinking. A company that pays over a 20 percent dividendBut before you write off CVR Energy due to its hefty dividend, you might want to dig deeper to see if this 20  percent dividend is too good to be true.Before we do that, let's examine a brief . The story began in 1893 with a farmer from Southwest Missouri named Howard Cowden. As a farmer, he began a cooperative to help farmers gain pricing power. Fast forward, andThen, in 1944, CCA bought an oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas. The Coffeyville refinery was originally built and owned by the National Refining Company  NRC , which traced its roots back to 1882 when J.I. Lamprecht from Cleveland built the refinery for kerosene.In 1966, CCA rebranded itself to Farmland Industries and its management began to try to grow the company aggressively. On May 31, 2002, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which was the largest agricultural coop bankruptcy in American history. One reason it went bankrupt was that it was in the middle of constructing a fertilizer plant in Coffeyville, Kansas, next to its petroleum refinery. This bankruptcy was thanks to the plant experiencing difficulty operating correctly after its launch in 2000.Having a fertilizer plant next to a refinery was supposed to make sense on paper as each ton of ammonia produced would require 1.18 tons of petroleum coke, and the Coffeyville refinery was able to produce over half the 500,000 short tons of coke the new nitrogen plant would need. This should have created strong synergies between the refinery and the fertilizer plant, but it was not operating well enough for the company to avoid bankruptcy.This fertilizer plant, which would one day become a keystone asset of CVR Partners, had cost Farmland  300 million to build but its interest in the plant was sold in March 2004 to a company owned by Pegasus Capital Advisors, a Connecticut-based private equity fund for just  11 million.Pegasus Capital Advisors sold the Coffeyville refinery and fertilizer plant just a year later on July 12, 2005, to Coffeyville Acquisitions, LLC, which was a partnership between Goldman Sachs   private equity arm, and the funds of Kelso Partners, a major private equity player founded in 1971.In April 2011, Coffeyville Acquisitions, LLC was ready to take the company public in the midst of a strong fertilizer market that had rebounded from the 2009 recession. Since April 2011, CVR Partners has operated as a publicly traded MLP.As described above, CVR Partners' main asset is its Coffeyville, Kansas facility. And in addition to that is its East Dubuque, Illinois facility. The yellow lines on the map below indicate rail lines that allow these two plants to transport their product to most states west of the Mississippi. Most important is the fact that these two plants operate in the corn belt which is where most of the demand for nitrogen fertilizer comes from.CVR Partners focuses primarily on nitrogen-based fertilizers such as ammonia. Here, we can see that broadly speaking, the United States is the  of nitrogen fertilizers behind China and India. has remained very steady over the past decade and with the world's population continuing to grow in many pockets of the world, demand should only increase. The chart below demonstrates how nitrogen fertilizer demand has jumped since 2020 and 2021.The following three slides are provided courtesy of .Here we see that North America's population is projected to remain steady for the next decade or so while populations in developing regions such as Asia and Africa are projected to explode higher. I would take projections like these with a grain of salt and expect them to fall short of the actual population. Nonetheless, these population booms in Africa and Asia won't have a direct impact on North American food demand but with the world being more global, they will unquestionably have an indirect impact.This following chart maps out the arable land person and demonstrates two things. If you want to own land, then you better buy some. Perhaps that is a better investment than shares in a fertilizer company. However, more related to this article and CVR Partners, LP is that in order to produce greater amounts of food for a growing population, larger quantities of fertilizer will be needed to create higher yields.According to the IMARC Group, global fertilizer demand is going to grow almost 4  compounded annually through 2027. And so there shouldn't be a drop-off in demand for fertilizer in the foreseeable future.Through 2022, the company continued to see a strong environment for their business. Sales volumes are not necessarily increasing, however, their margins are in the form of higher prices for their product. We can see this in the dramatic increase in Ammonia pricing compared to a more modest price increase in their inputs, Natural Gas and Petroleum Coke.Corn Stocks have declined in the past couple years which indicates that it is likely that more farm acres are going to be planted to corn in the coming years. As I have already pointed out, more corn acres being planted means greater demand for CVR's products.As the slide below says, 2021 demonstrated an inflection point in their business where farmers' economics improved, which resulted in higher demand for their product. Management sees this trend continuing into the immediate future.The company has maintained a fairly consistent balance sheet ratio. The business circumstances of 2020 and 2021 caused the company to have its debt-to-asset ratio increase but since then, it has begun to bring that ratio back down.The company operates as an MLP and so most MLPs have balance sheets that have higher ratios of leverage than other companies. For example, Magellan Midstream Partners which I just wrote about their , has a debt-to-asset ratio of over 75 percent.Here is the history of the company's dividend yield. It has maintained a flexible dividend policy as the profitability of the company fluctuated in more recent years. The question regarding CVR Partners LP is will the demand for CVR's end product remain strong and will the inputs required to produce their product remain low. In other words, will this spread remain favorable for the company  In 2022, we can see that based on the dividend paid, the spread has remained favorable. And thus far in 2023, the dividend has remained intact.The company reported solid results for the . This statement from the CEO Mark Pytosh summarizes the quarter.Despite a decrease in the price of their product year-over-year, their financial results remained strong and the company was able to pay a  4.14 per share dividend for the quarter. They were also able to increase production and sales volume thanks to great  operating reliability.  How did the operating results as well as the dividend remain this strong when prices for their product were decreasingThis was because natural gas prices, one of their input costs, decreased from  8 per Mbtu down to just over  2 per Mbtu. See the chart below.CVR Partners LP can be very tempting due to its very attractive dividend yield. But before we decide to chase the dividend, what are the charts telling us  Thankfully for bullish investors, the chart is also looking very bullish at the moment. The chart is in the process of completing what appears to be a bullish flag pattern. Traditionally, if this is a bull flag pattern, once the pattern has been completed, the price should continue climbing about the length of the  flagpole  on the flag. This isn't an exact science but rather just a rule of thumb.And if the dividend remains intact over the next few years, then there isn't any reason why CVR Partners couldn't double in price to adjust for the strong dividend. Although nobody can see the future, my expectation is that the market will be forced to realize the value of CVR Partners and that the share price will grow so that the dividend yield is more in line with other traditional MLP yields. I see the scenario where dividend yields decrease due to profitability decreasing as the more unlikely scenario.I believe the biggest risk that CVR Partners faces is twofold. Will there be another event like the pandemic that crashes share prices  Very unlikely in the near future. And second, will the supply of materials that goes into making ammonia and other nitrogen-based fertilizers see price increases  This is only a bad thing if there isn't also a comparable price increase in CVR's end product. These prices don't always move in lock-step but if demand for energy increases, it is also probable that food prices will increase as well.If MLP equity investing is a strategy that you like, then there may not be a more attractive MLP worth investing in at this moment. I think the broader market could experience some weakness going into early or mid-October which may be shortly followed with a breakout in CVR Partners from its technical bull-flag pattern.Based on projections from different organizations, the foundation for global and national demand for fertilizer is likely to increase, keeping demand for CVR Partners' products high. Should CVR Partners experience a technical breakout in price, I would watch closely for what charts continue to do and would keep a close eye on global supply and demand dynamics as well as prices for the company's input costs.

TLT Could Be A Winner Even Without A Soft Landing,"Stock and bond returns have dramatically separated over the last 18 months. While the bond market has priced in an  overheating  economy with high short-term growth with lower long-term growth  i.e., inverted 2s 10s yieldI think in the long run this dislocation is unsustainable and willTwo of my core tenants for initiating any investment  which I outlined in my original article  are A  don't fight the global liquidity cycle and B  make trades congruent with the economic outlook for the next 18 months. Funny enough, this article was written almost exactly 1 year ago - over that time, the S P 500 is up  13  and TLT is down by  9.5   total return . Unfortunately, the market over that time has behaved in a predictably irrational pattern, pricing in a best-case scenario soft landing for stocks while pricing in sustained long-term inflation for bonds. On a probabilistic list of outcomes, this would be one of the least likely outcomes and the Fed itself has forecast a .The chart above from the Felder Report shows the divergence between fed liquidity and market performance with the red dashed line at the end estimating liquidity dynamics over the next several months due to TGA balance needing to be replenished and fed tightening continuing at its scripted rate. This chart by itself makes me extremely wary of risk assets and should be at the center of every investor's mind. As liquidity tightens - cash is king and investments in risk assets should be heavily scrutinized. Combine this with tightening lending standards at the commercial banks and a restrictive credit cycle - the liquidity environment is not favorable.  Obviously, you could argue this is bad for treasuries too, I discuss this in the risks section .Bloomberg economists are predicting negative real GDP growth over the next twelve months - obviously, economists' projections  like Fed projections  should be taken with a grain of salt but combined with falling leading indicators should also weigh heavily on investors' minds as they consider the economic outlook for the next several months. As the credit cycle continues to roll over, the highly levered US economy will struggle to sustain positive output growth - ignore the credit cycle at your own peril.The stock market has not been as healthy as the large rally over the past 12 months would suggest. Gains have been highly concentrated among the  Magnificent 7  tech stocks, particularly for the NASDAQ and the impact can been seen in the divergence in performance between the equal-weighted indices vs. the standard index. I'm not sure anyone could convince me that 60x P FCF is a fair price to pay for these stocks no matter how high the quality and growth. If these companies were to produce 60x the cash flow they currently produce, their output would rival many countries. It's unreasonable to assume that companies this big will continue to grow at rapid rates  if not purely for anti-trust concerns . If valuations on these stocks mean-revert this would produce tremendous pressure on the entire stock market given the concentration of these stocks in major indexes.A chart I saw that really stood out to me as a strong late-cycle indicator is the SPX EPS   NIPA Profits going back to 1970. NIPA profits represent  income from current production  and are reported to the BEA for economic analysis. These profits can be thought of as  real  or  current  output vs. accounting EPS earnings which can be influenced over the short term by management teams. The idea is that in periods of declining economic activity but before the bottom falls out, management teams pull forward profits to the current period to bolster flailing earnings. However, this can only go on so long before the rubber meets the road and economic reality sets in causing accounting profits to mean revert  and often flip to a negative ratio with NIPA profits during recession. This indicator is extremely reliable in predicting recessions as you can see from the chart above and we are now at levels only seen previously 3 times since 1970. Even if there is not a recession, simple mean reversion of this ratio will put pressure on EPS across the board and should promote a more fearful   cautious environment in the stock market which should be beneficial for treasury securities.Another chart which I think is significant in assessing the current state of the cycle is the consumer excess savings chart above from JPM. The bank estimates that there are only  0.2T of excess savings left from COVID-era stimulus. While total savings are still at relatively normal levels, these savings are concentrated in the top 10  of wealthiest individuals in the US. As the bulk of Americans run out of excess savings, the demand impulse should continue to decrease.  The labor market has been strong over the past 18 months, but job openings have slowed and payroll gains have been in a consistent downtrend, exposing cracks in the labor market.Auto and credit card delinquencies have , again highlighting some weakness in the consumer balance sheet.Finally, I'll end with some quotes from the latest Dallas Fed manufacturing survey which I believe are particularly harrowing, as the narrative has shifted away from complaints about input costs and labor and towards softening consumer demand. If this softening demand materializes in a broad scale across the economy then the current economic expansion will end quickly as lately it's almost entirely been driven by consumption. TLT  - has underperformed dramatically since the Fed began hiking rates last April. Looking at the total return performance table, the recent underperformance has been so sharp that it's dragged the 5-year performance negative. This is pretty astounding when you think about it - what is essentially the longest duration  risk-free rate  has a negative total return over the last five years, demonstrating that no asset is truly risk-free  keep in mind this is a nominal return not an inflation-adjusted return .The long-term Treasury bond yield chart is one of the most important charts in all of finance - it's indicative of a number of macro trends which define the era we live in. Aging workforce, decline in productivity and labor force participation, sluggish growth, lack of innovation and perhaps most importantly uniformly dovish monetary policy which has encouraged low rates for the last 40 years. Obviously, there have been intermittent periods of rising rates but overall these brief periods barely stand out on this chart apart from the current cycle which broke one of the long-term downward channels  red lines on the chart . I would consider this a capitulation event and this early in the cycle, this is a gift from the market gods. An opportunity for a savvy and sober-minded investor who understands that the world is not ending to reinvest in one of the best performing asset classes of the past 2 generations. Opportunities like this do not appear often and what makes this even more compelling is the asymmetry of the trade.Buy when there is blood in the streets  - the classic value mantra applies here as the bond market has become overly pessimistic both on inflation and growth outlook. As I've discussed above, inflation is likely to be stickier than the Fed and most market participants are hoping but I also believe that the economy is in its most overheated state currently and will likely begin to slow in the coming months which will send rates lower. However, even if I'm wrong on my economic outlook  and trades should never be made on economic outlook alone -  and the economy does obtain a soft landing with cooling inflation, this will also result in lower rates  unless of course the economy emerges  than before and rate are permanently higher to compensate but that outcome is also unlikely given the demographic and long-term macro dynamics at play in the US economy .Furthermore, I like how the 30-year has been in a relentless march upwards despite cooling inflation, a FED who appears to be tapped out on interest rate hikes  or at least close to it , and some early signs of an economic slowdown. The bond market is so fearful that it refuses to allow for any optimism and despite the 30-yr being mostly flat for the year it has made a 50 BPS surge over the past 3 months while the stock market has been mostly flat. This divergence in return will almost certainly mean revert - risk premiums have been  over time and a large, sustained divergence in stock and bond performance is unlikely, perhaps impossible.The main risk to this trade, particularly in the short term in my opinion is the imbalance in supply and demand in the treasury market. The TGA remains relatively depleted and the US Treasury estimates that issuances will increase substantially heading into the end of the year. This fear of supply-demand imbalance has fueled the treasury selloff for the last few months.It's a little hard to predict quarterly changes in treasury issuance. Ultimately, the CBO projects the deficit to increase over the coming 10 years as social security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending growth outpaces growth in tax receipts. In general, this will put pressure on the treasury market in the absence of QE to soak up the excess supply. A  I think most of this fear is priced in and B  I highly doubt the Fed will allow the treasury market to implode given the implications for financing the US government and on the broader economy. While the Fed is not mandated to stabilize the treasury market, look at their actions since the GFC - they've been mostly committed to buying treasuries over this time period and I imagine they will return to form as quickly as possible. The US economy cannot afford massively higher rates on such a large debt balance and I feel comfortable betting on the rates mean reverting closer to pre-COVID levels. Obviously, no trade is truly risk free and if rates stay higher for longer, it will limit the upside of this trade. However, even in that case you can lock in an attractive yield at current rates which limits the downside.In conclusion, the treasury bond market has deviated substantially in performance from the stock market over the past 18 months. Historically, these deviations tend to mean revert and given the long-term trend towards lower rates since the 70s, I believe rates will continue to trend lower  even if they don't get back to the pre-covid lows . Buying TLT is asymmetric due to the high yield currently and worst case, can clip a strong coupon if rates stay at current levels.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Navios Maritime Partners: Buy For Strong Fundamentals And Potential Upside,"Navios Maritime Partners  deals in owning and operating tanker vessels and dry cargo. It provides shipping services mainly in Asia, Europe, and America. The company has recently reported its strong quarterly results and I believe it can sustain thisNMM is a global company that owns and operates tanker vessels and dry cargo. The majority of the company's revenue is earned by charging customers for the use of its vessels to transport their dry, liquid, and containerized goods. These seaborne shipping services are offered under long-term charters. Its business is geographically diversified in  and each of the geographic regions contributes 63.40 , 22.90 , and 13.65 , respectively to the company's total revenue. The company's portfolio consists of 175 vessels, diversifiedThe company has experienced a slight decrease in revenue in the period of pandemic as its revenue has decreased 5.18  YoY in FY2019 compared to FY2018. The pandemic negatively affected the seaborne trade activities. However, since FY2021 the company has experienced higher tanker rates than its long-term averages because of solid supply and demand fundamentals, which is also reflected in its financial performance of FY2021. The company has reported revenue of  713.18 million in FY2021, which is 214.5  growth compared to  226.77 million in FY2020. It has managed to sustain this solid growth in FY2022 as well and reported  1.21 billion which is 69.7  YoY growth.The seaborne trade activities were impacted after the pandemic, and later it experienced a hurdle to rebound the growth as a result of inflationary pressures and geopolitical issues. However, the scenarios are gradually changing in 2023. Though the growth has not surpassed the pre-pandemic levels, it is still steady. The tanker business highly depends on the global oil demand. Economic growth is said to drive the oil demand, as they are . According to a recent projection by the IMF, world GDP can rise by  and 3  in 2024. The oil demand is also anticipated to grow as marine trade activities for one of the major dry commodities such as  is estimated to grow by 2  in China and 3  in Europe. All these positive growth factors have created opportunities for the participants. Identifying these opportunities, the company has planned and completed some acquisitions of vessels to expand its capabilities. It has taken delivery of three newbuilding Capesize vessels. Recently, in August it also agreed to acquire one Kamsarmax vessel for  28.0 million, which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter. In addition, the company has also agreed to execute the acquisition of two newbuilding Japanese MR2 product tanker vessels. These vessels are expected to be delivered between 2026 to 2027. I believe this expansion can significantly increase the revenue of NMM as it helps the company in the accommodation of larger cargo volumes and facilitates it to capture the growing demand by creating capacity for additional shipping contracts. As per my analysis, this growth might be sustained for a longer period as a result of a rise in energy trade and population growth, which can boost trades of essential commodities.The company recently reported its quarterly results. It reported revenue of  346.93 million, up 23.61  compared to  280.66 million in Q2FY22. This growth was mainly fueled by to expansion of the fleet and a marginal increase in the Time Charter Equivalent  TCE  rate. The company has managed to beat the market's revenue expectations by  28.94 million, or 9.1 . Net income dropped by 4.95  YoY from  118.16 million to  112.30 million. The decrease in net income was driven by a rise in time charter, voyage expenses, and rise in debt. The decreased net income resulted in an EPS of  3.65. However, the company has managed to surpass the market's EPS consensus by  0.77 or 26.7 . NMM reported  270.05 million in liquidity and adjusted EBITDA stood at  201.6 million.The firm managed to perform well despite the macroeconomic pressures, which reflects its resiliency. I believe the company can sustain this growth in the future as the  confirmed that supply   demand fundamentals are intact, and the company is continuously focused on expanding its capabilities which can help it to capitalize on the growing opportunities. According to Seeking Alpha, the company's revenue might be  1.30 billion, which is 7.44  YoY growth. After considering the rising seaborne trade activities and supply   demand fundamentals, I think Seeking Alpha's revenue estimate is accurate. The company's 3-year average net income margin is 30 . I believe NMM can maintain the net income margin of 30  in the coming period as the management has confirmed that the supply   demand fundamentals are still intact. Therefore, I am estimating a net income margin of 30  for FY2023, which gives an EPS of  12.67.The company's debt has increased significantly in the last few years. Its long-term debt was  763.4 in Jun 2023 which is 234  growth compared to Dec 2020. NMM's 36  debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.6  while the other 64  has a floating interest rate of 7.8 . The company's large part of the company's debt is subject to changes in market interest rates. Currently, the interest rates are rising in the market to counter the rising inflation. Therefore, if the interest rates continue to rise in the coming period, it can significantly affect the company's net income margins.China is one of the prominent markets for the company, as it imports large quantities of raw materials from other countries and exports significant amounts of semifinished and finished goods. For instance, in 2022, China imported iron ore of 1093 billion tons which represented approximately 74  of the international marine iron ore trade. It also contributed 19  to the global marine coal movements in 2022. If the levels of imports and exports decrease due to changes in the country's economic policies, it can negatively impact the company's charter business and reduce its profit margins.The oil demand is highly interlinked with global GDP growth. The world GDP and oil demand are estimated to grow decently in 2023 which can create significant opportunities for the shipping industry. I believe the company's plans to expand its vessels through acquisitions can accelerate its growth by helping it serve a large number of customers and capture the growing demand in the market.After considering all the above factors and revenue   net income margin estimates, I am estimating EPS of  12.67 for FY2023, which gives the forward P E ratio of 1.68x. The company's forward P E ratio of 1.68x is 90.3  lower compared to the . NMM's primary competitors are  ,  ,  , and   as all of them offer marine transportation and have market capital in the same range.The company's forward P E ratio of 1.68x is 76.4  lower compared to the industry average P E ratio of 7.11x. The comparison of forward P E ratio of NMM with industry average and sector median P E ratio indicates the company is significantly undervalued.I believe the company might grow in the coming quarters as a result of positive demand in the industry and intact supply   demand fundamentals which can help it to trade at industry average P E ratio as according to mean reversion theory P E ratio has tendency to trend back to average P E ratio. Therefore, I estimate the company might trade at an industry average P E ratio of 7.11x in the coming period, giving the target price of  90.08, which is a 324  upside compared to the current share price of  21.23.NMM has performed solidly in the second quarter despite macroeconomic pressures. The industry has various supportive growth factors which can help demand to remain stable for a longer period, and NMM's current expansions of its vessels can help it cater to growing demand. However, it is exposed to risk of fluctuations in imports and exports of China and rising interest rates, which can contract its profit margins. The stock is undervalued, and we can expect significant growth from the current price levels as a result of rising sector-specific global opportunities and its expansion of vessels. Considering all the above factors, I assign a buy rating to NMM.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

A Trillion-Dollar Black Swan Right Under Our Nose,"Since bottoming back in October, markets have rallied to the surprise of many investors. After a few red days in a row, the bears are back out from hibernation, and even the famous Michael Burry is openly While subscribing to theories of imminent collapse has been historically a losing trade, I'd like to propose a theory for just that today.I see a lot of similarities between stocks today and stocks in 1987, a year that featured both a 40  rally and a 35  collapse  Black Monday .We've already seen the 35  rally, is a drawdown coming next  Some very specific features sparked the massive sell-off in October 1987, and some of these are certainly present today.Specifically, 0DTE options are now a trillion-dollar market, which could send stocks into a doom spiral.What1987 was definitely a  fun year  for investors. After a good year of sideways movement, US stocks really began to take off. From January to September, the S P 500 rallied close to 40 .Great start to the year, but spirits would soon be crushed. After selling off close to 10  from its highs, the stock market literally collapsed on Monday, October 19, 1987. The S P would end up falling back towards 200 points, interestingly, finding support at the 200-week MA.The worldwide losses are estimated to have been close to  1.7 trillion, and this sell-off. By November of that same year, the market would bottom and never look back.Now, let's look at some other variables to put this crash into context, and try to understand what was going on at the timeIn the chart above, we can see the SPX, the Dollar Index  in purple, inflation in yellow, the unemployment rate in orange, and the Fed funds rate in blue.A couple of notable things to point out. Firstly, employment is doing well. This sell-off had nothing to do with a recession, as we saw the market collapse while unemployment levels were decreasing.Secondly, inflation, though volatile and a bit higher than what we were used to before COVID, was, for the most part, under control.Overvaluations in the stock market are an easy answer. Stocks had run nearly 40  and gotten ahead of themselves  that much seems obvious.However, a lot of economists point towards monetary factors to explain this collapse. So let's focus now on the DXY, the Plaza Accord, and the Louvre Accord.As we can see, the dollar index had been weakening since 1985. This might well have contributed to the rally and was no accident. Through the Plaza Accord, the major economies of the world agreed to depreciate the dollar, which had reached very high levels following the Volcker Fed administration.This all changed, however, after the Louvre accord, which aimed to stabilize the value of the dollar. However, notice that the dollar did not immediately stabilize and, in fact, kept grinding down.There are a couple of things to take away from this. Firstly, we can see that the Fed started raising rates following the Louvre accord, which could be described as bad for stocks. What might have even been a bigger contributor to the 1987 sell-off, though, is the fact that the dollar failed to stabilize as quickly as some expected.This policy failure increased uncertainty in the market and also the likelihood of further monetary tightening down the road, which we did indeed see.While it is hard, and some might even say impossible, to pinpoint the exact reasons that triggered the market sell-off, there seems to be at least some consensus on what made things worse.In short, portfolio insurance and programmatic trading played a big role.Portfolio Insurance was developed in 1976 and became very popular leading up to the 1987 crash. The idea behind this was quite simple, and it was a matter of using stop-loss orders in order to prevent huge losses. Remember, this was over 30 years ago, and it was quite a novel concept at the time.What was not foreseen, though, was how these automatized  portfolio insurance  could create a self-fulfilling feedback loop of doom.Source  Too many sellers and not enough buyers. Pretty straightforward supply and demand dynamics playing out right in front of our eyes.The big question is, could this happen today  Let's compare the variables we looked at in 1987 with what we have todayThough not quite as strong as in 1987, we've had a pretty good start to the year, with the S P up over 20  since January.This has been accompanied by a controlled cooling of inflation and also a depreciating dollar. Unemployment is near historic lows, and we have just witnessed one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in history.Conditions are not exactly the same, but there are some similarities. Yes, stocks, especially the Nasdaq  have run a lot this year, and we could make an argument that a lot of them are overvalued.The US economy, like in 1987, seems strong, but this doesn't mean we can't sell off. In fact, it might be the complacency with this seemingly strong economy that could lull investors into a false sense of security.With that said, more tightening seems unlikely, as we should be nearing a pause. However, this could change if inflation remains sticky, an argument that I've made before.Lastly, in terms of the US dollar, it's hard to know where we are going to land. Exchange rates aren't thought of like they were back in the 1980s, and there is a lot less policy targeting it, but I do see a resemblance between today and 1987. There's certainly a lot of uncertainty.A lot of currencies have come under pressure in the last few months. The Yen has been making headlines as the BoJ tries to scrap its YCC policy. The Chinese Yuan has hit a  after the PBOC's rate cut and, of course, the British Pound had a rough start to 2023.While I'm still not sure how all of this could pan out, let's just say this opens up the room to surprises. Maybe the Fed is forced to tighten more as the dollar falls, or the dollar strengthens too much and takes a toll on the economy.Any of these issues could spark a quick sell-off, and the quick sell-off could become a 20  down day thanks to 0DTE options.So what are 0DTE optionsSource  Any option that expires on the same day is a 0DTE option, and while technically, these have traded for a while, they become a lot more prominent in the last year. In 2005, weekly options were issued by the CBOE, which allowed traders to use 0DTE options once a week. However, as of 2022, there are now 0DTE options on SPX futures available for all trading days.0DTE options offer high leverage and flexibility, and this might be why they have become so popular. How popular, you askAccording to this chart, 0DTE options set a new record on August 11th, representing over 50  of all the volume.This would represent a notional value of over  1 trillion, as  , and could lead to a  20  decline given the right circumstancesSource  Note that this analysis was made back in March, and the effect could be even greater now that 0DTE options are even more popular.Just like in 1987, 0DTE options threaten to exacerbate a market sell-off by creating unforeseen downward momentum.A 20  sell-off from here would take us back towards 3800 in the SPX, almost re-testing the previous lows. With that said, the 200 weekly MA offers some strong support at 3900, and it's worth remembering that this was where the market reversed back in 1987.All in all, while I have laid out the potential for slightly higher highs in the coming months, downside risk has definitely increased, and the popularization of 0DTE options opens up the door to a black swan event similar to 1987.Macro moves markets, and this is what I do at The Pragmatic InvestorJoin today and enjoy- Weekly Macro Newsletter- Access to our Portfolio- Deep dive reports on stocks.- Regular news updatesStart your  right nowJames Foord is an economist by trade and has been analyzing global markets for the past decade.

The Tesla Dilemma: Juggling Growth And Competition," stock still offers investors lots of upside potential  the carmaker continues to defend some of the best technology in electric vehicles, or EVs, on both production efficiency and product features  in addition, the Tesla brand remains the However, reflecting on the latest developments in the global EV market, it becomes also evident that the Austin-based automotive company faces multiple challenges in its road to  EV domination.  In this article, I will discuss my take on Tesla's  i  latest Model 3 launch,  ii  the broader price cuts  price war, and the  iii  changing market share.Overall, while I continue to defend the position that Tesla remains one of the most exciting growth assets listed on the market, I also understand that the goldilocks days of easy growth, notablyIn context of the Munich IAA mobility event, held from September 5th to 10th, Tesla unveiled a new generation of its best-selling Model 3 car. On the design angle, the new Model 3 sports updated bumpers and lighting, as well as a somewhat revised interior. With regard to performance specs  the rear-wheel drive Model 3 has a 0-62 mph  0-100 km h  acceleration time of 6.1 seconds and a WLTP range of 319 miles  513 km . The Dual Motor Long Range variant is even more impressive with a 4.4-second 0-62 mph  100 km h  time and a WLTP range of 391 miles  629 km . Both versions offer fast charging capabilities of 170 kW or 250 kW, providing up to 175 miles  282 km  of range in just 15 minutes when the battery is depleted.In my opinion, the new Model 3 launch is notable, because it is a welcome alternation in the carmakers strategy to fuel demand by simply cutting prices. With the new Model 3, Tesla may once again point with car buyers on product excitement, vs. price excitement. By the way, somehow Tesla's Model 3 update reminds me of Apple's  strategy with relaunching the iPhone over and over again, with minor tweaks. Tesla plans to sell the new Model 3 as early as 2024. And overall, early management commentary suggests that the new product my help to improve profitability by both lowering the cost of goods sold and increasing the selling price compared to the outgoing model.Tesla's new Model 3 launch is also important, because Tesla needs to update its  somewhat  older product portfolio to remain competitive with European and Chinese carmakers, who bring new models to the market at record pace. In other words, the times where Tesla was the only game in battery EV, or BEV, are over. In fact, in terms of global BEV sales and market share, Tesla's share now has dropped to only 15 , down from about 23  for the previous year.However, it is also important to note that the BEV market is still expanding rapidly, which renders the loss of market share less concerning. According to a research note by Morgan Stanley's equity research team , the global BEV sales in July 2023 YTD vs. the same period in 2022 are up a remarkable 36 , growing to 5,075,089 BEV units sold in 2023 so far. The growing market is supported by higher penetration levels in all regions  the U.S. at 8.0 , Europe at 15.9 , and China at 22.8 .Finally, while BYD Company's  17  market share has overtaken Tesla's, I would like to point out that Tesla is leading in the U.S. and Europe, while BYD is only leading in China, which is a more price sensitive market, although high volume.Looking beyond the new Model 3 excitement, I see Tesla's next growth leg supported by its next-gen vehicle platform, which could account for 4-7 million EVs produced by 2028 30, according to my estimates. For context, the next-gen platform is Tesla's most important hardware project right now, aiming to reduce production cost and efficiency for more aggressive EV volume scale. According to management guidance, the next-gen platform will be leveraged at plants around the world, and not only in Mexico as I have initially assumed. The platform is expected to be used for the production of the Cybertruck, Semi, and Roadster, as well as other future vehicles.Moreover, as the second major growth opportunity, Tesla continues to be working on FSD technology. In that context, Tesla's ambitions are likely to accelerate over the next 12 to 24 months, as the company is investing in AI and its Dojo supercomputer project. As an additional consideration when discussing FSD, I would also like to point out that Tesla has recently reduced the price of its FSD package from  15 tsd to  12 tsd, which could likely push adoption up by anywhere between 10  to 20 , I believe. But more data points are needed to see how penetration and gross profit maximization is optimized by price adjustments in FSD. Like in its pricing strategy for vehicles, Tesla is lately experimenting a lot with pricing. Thus, pricing on FSD may continue to evolve over the next few months  and personally, I would not be surprised if the starter package drops below the five figure benchmark.I see a challenging Q3 for Tesla  In my opinion, there could be downside risk to investors' expectations for volume and margin, reflecting planned summer production shutdowns which will push both production and deliveries down, while repeated, aggressive discounts on sales may limit profitability. Specifically, Tesla has recently estimated that both production and deliveries volume will likely be down in Q3 vs Q2, mostly driven by the discussed factory shutdowns around the globe. In that context, the company had about 16 days of sales in inventory in Q2, mostly in-transit vehicles, which may not be enough to offset the production impact from shutdowns happening in Q3.Tesla has so far never voiced any doubts to hitting the 1.8 million in deliveries target. But the data still suggests downside risk to the flattish deliveries consensus at present. And if volume is met, it might come at a considerable cost, e.g., pressuring profitability on purchase-inducing price cuts. In that context, Tesla also intends to manage the delivery mix between the Model 3 and Model Y by adjusting the pricing gaps between the two models on a weekly basis for specific regions to tailor to market-specific nuances on supply and demand.The manufacturing costs of Tesla's Austin and Berlin factories are improving on volume ramp ups  but overall scale effects are still well below Fremont at present. However, once Austin and Berlin reach more stabilized production levels, they will be able to implement cost reduction efforts. In my opinion, however, meaningful operating leverage from the Berlin Austin factory ramp will not materialize prior to 2024.Regarding the Cybertruck, Tesla reiterated that the company is on track for start of production and deliveries in Q4, with 250k in target annual capacity. The vehicle is a product specific to the U.S. market, and management indicated that it is difficult to estimate how many Cybertrucks can be sold in 2023 and 2024, since it will also largely depend on the demand for its other vehicles.Tesla continues to be an exciting investment opportunity. However, it is important to recognize the evolving landscape of the global EV market, which presents both opportunities and challenges. A few considerations stand out  First, the recent launch of an updated Model 3, focusing on product quality rather than price reductions, indicates Tesla's commitment to sustainable growth  Second, While Tesla's global market share has dipped, the overall EV market is expanding rapidly, with Tesla maintaining leadership positions in the US and Europe  Third, investors should keep a close eye on Tesla's next-generation vehicle platform and Full Self-Driving technology, which hold the key to the company's future growth.While I see a few potential challenges in the short term, particularly in Q3, I advise investors to maintain a long-term perspective on Tesla  and, as long as the company maintains leadership in EV technology, as well as customer love, I recommend to remain invested.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

JinkoSolar stock shines after strong global demand spurs module shipments,"Shares of JinkoSolar  on Monday after reporting a revenue beat for the third quarter, benefiting from a surge in demand for its solar products, and the company remains  confident  to exceed shipment guidance for 2023.Shangrao, China-basedThe company said premium high-efficient N-type products accounted for over 60  of total shipments during the third quarter. For Q4, module shipments are expected to be 23.0 GW.Since the third quarter, price declines in the supply chain have stimulated end demand. For the first nine months of 2023, newly-added installations of PV in China reached 128.9 GW, nearly 50  more than full-year installations in 2022. Meanwhile, intensified competition brought by changes in supply and demand, accelerated technical iteration, high interest rates in some regions, and geopolitical tensions caused some volatility in the global PV market, and posed challenges on all industry players. We believe that we, as the industry leader, will become even stronger as the competition intensifies,  CEO Xiande Li said in a statement.Key metrics  gross profit of  840.6 million  99.7  Y Y  gross margin of 19.3  vs. 15.7  last year  net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of  181.4 million  adjusted net income of  184.6 million  diluted earnings per ordinary share of  0.63  and diluted earnings per ADS of  2.53.Shares of the company have  so far this year since Friday's close of  25.89.",2,2023-10-30T10:42:50.000-04:00
Exxon Mobil: Take Some Profit Near All-Time High Prices,"Readers familiar with our writings know that we have been long-term bulls on Exxon Mobil . We posted our first  on the stock back in Oct 2021 andFast-forward to now, all these drivers worked out really well. The stock has delivered a total return of  100  since then  see the chart below , outpacing both the S P 500 Index and also the energy sector.However, we see that all 3 driversXOM was able to maintain quite respectable profitability, as measured by ROIC  return on invested capital  as shown in the chart below, in the long term. Its ROIC in the past decade averaged around 9.17 , far better than its close rival Chevron . However, due to a series of headwinds  mostly the breakout of the COVID pandemic and oil price fluctuations , its ROIC nosedived into the negatives toward the latter half of 2021.And our bull thesis started when we saw signs of its profitability turning a corner, as shown in the chart below. At that time, our thinking was that travel would recover and the Russian Ukraine situation would lead to a supply-demand imbalance, both helping to stabilize energy prices and boost XOM's profitability. Indeed, XOM's profitability staged a perfect V-recovery, as seen shortly afterward. Its profitability surged to about 25  ROIC in early 2023.However, its ROIC has since then pulled back a little bit to the current 21.4 . I don't view this pullback as a random fluctuation. I see it as a symptom of the changes in the underlying forces for several reasons. First, the pullback is also observed in other peers, such as CVX. Second and more important, the supply-demand imbalance has largely equilibrated by now, in my view, as detailed immediately below.A few key factors kept supply and demand out of balance in the energy past for the past 2-3 years. The top ones in my mind are  A  years of underinvestment in basic energy infrastructure, B  the breakout of the Russian Ukraine war, C  the global shipping congesting limiting the shipment of LNG  liquefied natural gas , and D  colder-than-normal winter temperatures resulting in higher natural gas consumption than normal  say the five-year period between 2017 and 2021 .All these factors have largely renormalized and found at least a temporary equilibrium point by now, with the exception of D. Weather is just weather and can always change randomly. As a result, you can see from the chart below that natural gas storage now sits above the historical average by a good margin. For readers unfamiliar with this chart, it shows the working natural gas inventory in the lower 48 states in underground storage. The units are a billion cubic feet. The grey area means the range - the difference between the max and min averaged over five years. The thick black grey line is the running average. And the thick blue line shows the current level. As seen, for the latter part of 2021 and throughout most of 2022, the inventory has been struggling below the average. But starting early 2023, the inventory has been building up and stayed steadily above the average.Crude oil stock is still near a multi-year low  see the second chart below . However, I anticipate its turning point is coming soon because of the changes in the fundamental forces mentioned above. Trading at a TTM P E in the single digit  9.05x as of this writing , the stock is still cheap comparatively amid an overall expensive market. However, its valuation no longer offers any meaningful margin of safety in my view.For a cyclical business such as XOM which pays steady dividends in the long term, the dividend is a much better measure of its economic earnings  than accounting EPS . As a result, dividend yield is a much better valuation metric  than P E  in my view. As shown in the chart below, the stock was yielding about 5.8  when we started our bull thesis, far above its historical average. But now, the situation is the opposite. Its yield is not only below the historical average but also at the lowest level in at least 5 years.There are other considerations surrounding the stock, both in the upside and downside directions. Some of the upside catalysts include its clean energy initiatives, which ought to ramp up and bear fruit in the long term. I anticipate capital spending in the alternative energy arena, notably renewable diesel fuels and hydrogen, to accelerate in the years to come. Management also controls costs effectively, in the way I see things. Through structural reorganization and operating efficiency improvement, annual expenses have been lowered by  7 billion compared to 1-2 years ago. Lastly, as mentioned earlier, its profitability as measured by ROIC is still at a very competitive level even if it pulls further back when compared to its own historical average or its close peers.However, my overall feeling is that the issues mentioned above will be the dominating forces in the near term, say the next 2-3 years. To recap, its profitability has already reached a peak  at least temporarily for the next few years . The supply-demand imbalance seems to have found a new equilibrium. From the supply side, the sector has reinvested heavily in the past 2-3 years to boost production. From the demand side, the world was forced to either reduce consumption or find alternative sources as the Russian Ukraine situation drags on. As such, XOM might still be a good investment in the long term  all upside catalysts mentioned above are long-term oriented , but I expected return potential in the near term to be very limited due to the lack of immediate catalysts.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

Unleashing NextEra Energy: Fast Dividend Growth And 30% Undervaluation,"The other day, I  Duke Energy , which is my only utility investment. While it carries a 4.5  yield, it has underperformed the market in the past ten years, making it a good yield play but not aIn this article, I want to shed some light on , the renewables-focused regulated utility giant. Headquartered in Florida, it's the oldest stock-listed utility, as highlighted in the  below.Despite its age, the company isn't boring.Over the past ten years, NEE shares have outperformed their utility peers, dividend growth stocks, and the S P 500 by a wide margin.However, the company is now in a downtrend.NEE shares are down 18  year-to-date and roughly 25  below their all-timeWhile challenges like persistently sticky inflation and the odds of a prolonged hawkish Fed policy are doing a number on stocks with high debt loads and somewhat limited pricing power, it also comes with opportunities.NextEra Energy became a dividend aristocrat in 2021 when it hit its 25th consecutive annual dividend hike.Currently, the company has 27 consecutive hikes with an 11.3  compounding average dividend growth rate over the past five years.While its dividend yield of 2.7  is somewhat subdued, it is blowing its peers out of the water when it comes to dividend growth.Furthermore, the company maintains a 58  payout ratio, which is below the sector median of 66 .So, when it comes to its dividend scorecard, the only drawdown is its dividend yield. But then again, it comes with higher growth and a lower payout ratio.In other words, ignoring everything else, buying NEE versus higher-yielding peers depends on one's own goals.If investors require income, alternatives are almost an obvious choice. Investors who aren't dependent on income may want to opt for a stock with a higher total return potential - on top of high, decent dividend growth with fantastic safety and consistency.While its stock price may not suggest it, NEE is firing on all cylinders.In the first quarter, the company achieved a remarkable 14  year-over-year growth rate in adjusted earnings, driven by new investments.Note that the company saw strong growth despite weather headwinds, which is impressive given how sensitive renewables are to weather headwinds  pun intended .The company's commitment to renewables and storage projects led to the addition of 1,665 megawatts to its backlog, which now totals around 20 gigawatts.Despite challenges like commodity price inflation and supply chain disruptions, Energy Resources remains stable, as it believes that its significant pipeline of projects positions it well for meeting customer demand.Additionally, Energy Resources is exploring opportunities in the green hydrogen market, aiming to leverage its renewables expertise to support this emerging industry.This was also reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.According to the The company also benefits from strong growth in its key market, Florida, where employment and GDP growth are outperforming the nation's average.Excluding changes related to weather and usage, the company's customer base grew by 1.1  in the second quarter  versus 2Q22 , which is a fertile foundation for periods when individual power demand rises as well.To deal with rising demand and investment in renewables, FPL's  Florida Power   Light  capital expenditures in the second quarter were around  2.5 billion, and the full-year 2023 capital investment is projected to be between  8.5 and  9.5 billion.FPL's strategy centers around solar investments, with a goal of adding 3,100 megawatts of solar through 2025.According to the company  emphasis addedAs these investments are expensive, the company's net financial debt has exploded from  20 billion in 2010 to currently more than  70 billion.By 2025, net debt is expected to have exceeded  85 billion.The good news is that NEE isn't wasting money. Investments in value-adding projects have caused EBITDA to grow consistently, allowing the company to maintain a 4x leverage ratio for roughly 20 years, as seen in the lower part of the chart above.This is a very healthy leverage ratio, which explains why the company enjoys an A- credit rating. That's one of the highest ratings in its industry.Nonetheless, the fact that utilities have a lot of gross debt isn't helping them in an environment of elevated rates, where borrowing is expected to remain expensive for a while. It's why utilities usually perform poorly when inflation rises.In periods of low falling inflation, NEE's stock does very well.NEE has a healthy balance sheet, and despite high rates, it continues to do well, which is why I believe that weakness offers opportunities.Thanks to the recent stock price decline, NEE's valuation has come down to earth. The stock is now trading at 16.4x NTM EBITDA, which has erased the entire post-pandemic valuation expansion.The current consensus stock price target is  91, which is 30  above the current price.While I do not expect the stock to immediately start an aggressive uptrend, I do agree with this target and believe that NEE is undervalued by at least 30 .NEE has an impressive track record of outperforming peers and indices for more than a decade, backed by a remarkable 11.3  five-year average dividend growth rate.While its current dividend yield may seem subdued, its dividend growth potential and low payout ratio set it apart.NEE's commitment to renewables and storage projects is evident in its backlog expansion, totaling around 20 gigawatts. Its exploration of the green hydrogen market, supported by tax credits, reflects a forward-looking approach.Fueled by Florida's robust market and a strategic focus on solar investments, NEE remains resilient despite its substantial debt.A healthy leverage ratio and strong credit rating provide a foundation for success.The recent dip in valuation indicates an undervalued opportunity for investors in NEE.With a consensus target price of  91, NEE offers the potential for a 30  upside and long-term growth and stability in the sustainable energy sector.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

What Affects The Price Of Gold: Conventional Wisdom Vs. History,"People buy gold and silver for a lot of reasons. For jewelry and adornment, for numismatic  coin collecting  purposes, to store wealth, limited industrial applications, to protect against inflation, and to guard against geopolitical turmoil and related threats to fiat  government-issued  currency. As it relates to investing, the list is narrowed  theFirst, it must be stated and underscored that there is nothing special about gold that makes it magically go up in value in response to inflation. Gold is a commodity, and like any other commodity, its price rises and falls according to supply and demand dynamics  with plenty of interference from gold futures speculation . In other words, the price of gold only goes up if people are willing to pay more for it. And, as inputs, commodities tend to be the first to feel inflation's power.Because it has been repeated so often that gold protects purchasing power from the ravages of inflation, it could be a classic instance of the tail wagging the dog. When people hear that inflation is high or going to be high, they flock to gold to protect their purchasing power thus driving the price of gold up. That increase in price then makes it look like gold did indeed track with inflation, but it wasn't the inflation that caused it. It was people buying gold due to inflationary fears. It's correlation but not causation. There have been  where gold went down in spite of inflationIn other words, trying to time the market and get in and get out of gold according to inflation reads and inflation expectations could result in considerable money loss.However, using gold as a store of value over extremely long periods of time could indeed achieve the desired result. This chart explains it allWith notable periods of divergence, gold and to a lesser extent silver have both kept pace with inflation. But the problem with this is that we have instruments that allow us to  pace inflation with zero periods of divergence, TIPS and I-bonds. So gold and silver become lesser vehicles if matching inflation is the stated goal. Another issue is that tracking with inflation via gold, silver, TIPS, or I-bonds means that the real return is still 0 . Purchasing power was maintained but wealth did not increase. If you can use an asset that BEATS inflation, why not use itGold and silver are non-productive assets. More than perhaps any other asset class, the value of these is inherently tied to how much someone else is willing to pay for it. Beyond limited use in industry and electronics, gold is just a mineral. Unlike stocks which represent proportional ownership of an entity that produces  and can produce more of  things that humans use, need, want, and demand, or real estate that serves a critical function to giving people a place to live, work, eat, etc., gold just sits there. As Warren Buffett said, sure you can fondle gold, but don't expect it to respond.In summation for this portion, yes precious metals can protect against inflation but only if they are held for the long term. But maintaining purchasing power is a far lesser goal than actually building wealth, so if you have to hold something for the long term anyway you might as well buy stocks or real estate, whose returns smash gold and silver.I am of the opinion that investing in precious metals for the inflation aspect alone simply isn't worth it. If you want to match inflation, buy TIPS or I-bonds. Better yet, beat inflation by investing in stocks and real estate for the long term. However, when coupled with a second factor, allocating a modest portion of one's overall portfolio to precious metals makes sense.Let me put it bluntly  if something like World War III starts up and the United States loses, our currency will almost certainly collapse. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the hot situation in Israel, and China's objective of someday re-taking Taiwan, plenty of folks are prognosticating about an outbreak of widespread war involving major powers. If the U.S. does not win that conflict alongside allies, don't count on being able to buy TIPS or I-bonds. If things get especially bad, don't count on your dollar bills being worth much more than the paper they are printed on. That is the doomsday scenario, a picture often painted by the  gold bugs .In that scenario where a strong government doesn't exist to issue and back up a fiat currency, silver and gold will be the likely fallback for a medium of exchange.An  describes it well. The U.S. dollar is....War could easily upset the value proposition of the United States.Even without a war or any doomsday scenario, the U.S. dollar is facing unprecedented challenges to its status as the world's reserve currency. This is due to the world becoming increasingly concerned about the U.S. capacity to meet debt obligations, alongside a rising China and other nations that would rather not bow to the dollar for settling global trades.At a BRICS summit earlier this year  BRICS   Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa , this theme was  by several world leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin said,  The objective, irreversible process of de-dollarization of our economic ties is gaining momentum.  President Xi Jinping of China was recorded as promoting  the reform of the international financial and monetary system . If any such  BRICS currency  comes into being even a decade from now, having gold and silver could very well act as a store of wealth insulated from any impact on the U.S. dollar. This is especially so if the rumors are true that any such BRICS currency would be backed by gold. It's worth noting that the past two years have seen  by central banks of various nations the world over.What happens to the price of silver and gold during periods of major conflict, threats, and social economic unrest  A few examples.Let's start with the most recent first, looking at a period that encompasses the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, indicated by the first and second red dots, respectivelyYou could make the case that gold shot up in response to COVID commotion, but you could also argue that the surge was simply a continuation of a previous bull trend that started two years earlier. The Ukraine situation saw gold soon then-after plummet by 19 .Next is The Great Recession which started in December of 2007, indicated by the red dotHere too the case could be made that the global shock resulted in a flight to the safety of gold, where prices pushed up by  200 in a few short months. However, the surge was short-lived. Before year end the price of gold had dipped below the recession start price, then starting a slow march upward that matched the global economic recovery.Now we look at September 11th, a day that changed the world. The price of gold went up by  20 in the immediate aftermath, but the settled back down quickly, flattening for a few months, and then slowly climbed through subsequent years. If this amounts to a flight to safety, it was cool and calculated. More of a meander to safety.Looking at WWII, where Germany invaded Poland in 1939  first red dot  and then when Japan brought the United States into the conflict in 1941  second red dot , both were in the midst of a significant fall in the price of gold. Global unrest indeed, but no surge in gold.The final example from the Great Depression certainly makes the strongest case for gold being a wise investment in instances of economic shock. From  360 to  800 in just a couple yearsThis list was not intended to be exhaustive. And it is certainly beyond the scope of this article to try and surmise fully why the price of gold behaved as it did in each given instance. The point is that significant events by themselves don't seem to send gold in a particular direction. Trying therefore to invest according to some potential doomsday event is an error, if history is any indicator. It's a mixed bag.But let's talk about an instance where there was no single shock to set things off, but rather a series of smaller events and conditions combined to create a climate that may have contributed to the meteoric rise in the value of gold that happened in the 1970sFrom  280 to  2,600 over ten years is a 25  annual growth rate. What a decade. What was going on that might explain some of the rise  Some things that have plenty of resemblance to today- Cold War with Russia- Stagflation- Oil embargo and subsequent energy crisis- Iranian hostage situation, with 60 US citizens taken- Russia's military posturing and invasion of Afghanistan- Yom Kippur or 4th Arab-Israeli warEerie, is it not  Replace a few words or names and those bullets basically describe today. None of those things individually had the same scope as WWII or the same shock as 9 11, but taken together they clearly pushed people's investing dollars into a perceived safe haven, gold of course.Now, to be perfectly clear, I am not predicting some meteoric rise in gold. Far from. Who knows what will or will not happen  However, it does underscore the importance of diversification among asset classes with an informed proportion of the portfolio sitting in precious metals, more so perhaps in instances where many monetary and socio-geo-political elements are in play.I am no gold bug. If I wanted to achieve one thing with this article, it was the hope that I could dampen the voices of the firms trying to make a profit by using current circumstances and in my opinion, using scare tactics to get people to buy precious metals. There is simply no proof that gold reliably spikes as a result of inflation and or big global events. That being said, it is one basket in which folks should have an egg or two as part of a long-term strategy of preserving wealth. Other baskets are real-estate, stocks, bonds, other commodities, and perhaps even a dash of foreign currency. No one knows what the future will bring on the U.S. or global stage. Therefore, touching various asset classes is wise. Limiting overt exposure to any single one is key.Fear of missing out and fear of loss should not be drivers of investment decisions. Data should drive investment decisions. I hope I provided here data that could round out the picture a bit and prevent folks from doing anything drastic. Buy gold and silver, but do so in a measured way that agrees with your overall life situation and goals.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Halliburton's Rise: Riding The OPEC Wave,"When I penned  on Halliburton , the stock was navigating a challenging phase, primarily attributed to declining commodity prices. My core investment premise hinged on the belief that production cuts would carve out a more favorable environmentThe move is largely due to the favorable production cuts by OPEC to support oil prices in the face of a potential fall in consumption due to a global slowdown.The global energy narrative took a compelling twist as Saudi Arabia and Russia confirmed their decision to extend  cuts, removing a consequentialThe cuts saw Brent crude prices surge past the  90-a-barrel threshold-a point unseen since November 2022.There is a strong argument that these factors, along with a possible conflict in the Middle East, will continue to drive prices higher, which will support the multi-year bull thesis I laid out in the last article. Here's what I expectAlong with the supportive macro environment for oil prices, there are other key business driversWe saw these drivers play out in the last earnings report, demonstrating that the firm has been collecting its fair share of wins.Halliburton's financial snapshot for 2023's second quarter is a testament to their resilience and adeptness.This was a strong report, and one can argue that the stock deserves to be up more despite the strong move due to supply and demand dynamics supporting a favorable outlook.Halliburton will report Q3 earnings on Tuesday, October 24. Investors should look for strong EPS figures  greater than  0.75 Share , but the highlight will be how the changing supply and demand dynamics from OPEC are affecting the business. I would expect a strong year-over-year performance across the board with less sensational improvements quarter over quarter.As you might guess, analysts agree that EPS figures will continue to trend upwards, and Halliburton has managed to beat expectations in each of the past five quarters.It is likely that we will see the expected growth materialize as the major economies are essentially fully opened, and we are unlikely to see any relief from OPEC in the medium turn. There is a risk that if a conflict should deepen between Iran and the US following the horrific attacks in Israel, Iran could aggressively ramp up production as it has in the past to raise funds. This would soften oil prices slightly, but a collapse would be unlikely without support from OPEC. It is likely that Energy will become a hot theme over the coming months due to these tensions, and firms like Halliburton could see some uncharacteristic volatility.Halliburton has undoubtedly proven its mettle amidst fluctuating commodity prices, with the stock showcasing an admirable 45  surge in just a year. This upward trend, fortified by OPEC's strategic production cuts and geopolitical intricacies, hints at the resilience and adaptability of the company. The Q2 earnings report further buttresses Halliburton's prowess in the oilfield landscape. However, investors should stay alert. As global tensions simmer, particularly concerning Iran and the U.S., the energy sector might be in for a rollercoaster ride. While Halliburton seems well-poised to benefit from a surge in oil prices, a recession could dent consumption and introduce headwinds. There is also the tendency of low-cost producers to ramp up production when prices are high. That said, the trade is a lot clearer than it was a year ago, though there is less meat left on the bone. I rate Halliburton as a hold.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

REITs Vs. BDCs: A Lesson In Contrarian Investing,"Some prefer real estate investment trusts  REITs . Others prefer business development companies  BDCs . I like owning both.Often, the macroeconomic environment is supportive of both. But sometimes, economic conditions are good for one but bad for the other. That makes them complementary assetsREITs and BDCs share in common the fact that they must both pay out at least 90  of their taxable income in order to avoid corporate-level income taxes. Instead of being double-taxed -- once at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level -- these vehicles avoid corporate taxes in exchange for their dividends being taxed as ordinary income rather than the  qualified dividend  rate.REITs and BDCs also share in common the basic business model of issuing capital  a combination of equity, debt, andBut that's basically where the similarities end. The biggest difference, in my view, between these two investment vehicles is thatThere are other differences, such asAnd so on.But for the sake of this article, the primary difference I want to highlight is the fact that REITs are  of debt  some of which is floating rate , while BDCs are  of debt  almost all of which is floating rate .All else being equal, rising interest rates are a  and a , while falling interest rates are a  and a .But we should be a bit more specific, because most of REITs' debt is long-term  5  years  in nature, while most of BDCs' loans have floating rates based on the shortest-term interest rate -- the overnight rate set by central banks.So, more specifically, we can state that  again, all else being equal , REITs benefit from falling long-term interest rates, while BDCs benefit from rising short-term interest rates.Both are basically , but during rising interest rates, that spread between WACC and investment yields typically narrows for REITs and widens for BDCs. During falling interest rates, the opposite typically happens.With that in mind, take a look at the price performance of the broad-based Vanguard Real Estate ETF  against the VanEck BDC Income ETF  in the first several months of 2020, when COVID struck and incited a sharp drop in interest rates.During this time, lower interest rates in addition to longer lease terms and an overrepresentation of financially strong tenants prevented REITs from falling as far as BDCs.Meanwhile, BDCs got hit by the double-whammy of collapsing interest rates and a sudden economic shutdown that hurt many of their private, middle-market borrowers. If the federal government had not stepped in to provide emergency lending and grants to these middle-market businesses, the damage would have been even worse.The situation so far this year could not be more different, though. The Federal Reserve has hiked their key policy rate aggressively, pulling long-term interest rates up with it, while the economy  i.e. middle-market borrowers and tenants alike  has remained strong.As the market has realized that BDCs' borrowers have mostly been able to absorb these higher interest costs, and that BDCs have rewarded shareholders with dividend raises and special dividend payouts, BDC total returns have begun to meaningfully outpace REITs this year.Again, the higher rates are a tailwind for BDCs and a headwind for REITs.We can see this even clearer when looking at examples of top-tier BDCs against top-tier REITs this year. Here are my top five BDC holdings and top five REIT holdings.  And yes, I know that one of these is a mortgage REIT, but I view its business model as substantially similar to that of a BDC, only concentrated on real estate companies.I like BDCs that are able to maintain a premium to their net asset values over time, because this indicates an ability to issue capital for accretive investments on a regular basis. The higher the premium to NAV, the lower the cost of capital, generally speaking.Of course, I like to buy these BDCs as close to NAV as possible, or at a discount to NAV in those rare circumstances, but the point here is that regularly trading at a premium to NAV is both an  and a  of quality. It is the higher quality BDCs that tend to enjoy such a valuation premium in the first place, and once they have that valuation premium, they can use it to issue lower-cost capital in order to win bids on lower-yielding loans for higher quality borrowers.MAIN is the textbook example of this, which is why it is my largest BDC holding. The company explicitly aims to increase its NAV per share over time along with its monthly dividend.Meanwhile, on the real estate side, four of my five largest REITs primarily  or exclusively  employ net leases, which are long-term contracts with fixed rental revenue streams and annual escalations rarely exceeding 3-4 . They also employ long-term debt ranging from 5 to 30 years in length, although most of them carry at least some floating rate debt on their balance sheets at times.This year, especially since the beginning of May, the BDCs  and ABR  have significantly outperformed VNQ on a total return basis.MAIN and ARCC, the two largest and arguably most conservative BDCs in this group, have understandably exhibited less volatility, both on the downside and upside. But they have also handily outperformed real estate so far this year.Meanwhile, when comparing the five REITs against BIZD year-to-date, we find the mirror opposite.All year, but especially starting in May, REITs have significantly trailed BIZD.CCI, a telecommunications infrastructure REIT, has performed the worst not only because of the  10  of its debt featuring floating rates but also because lease cancellations from the T-Mobile -Sprint merger are taking a bite out of revenue growth.ARE, the leading life science real estate owner and developer in the US, has also suffered from investors mistakenly equating it with office buildings, a drop in venture capital funding for biotechs, and an activist REIT investor's short report.Fundamentally, all five REITs continue to perform quite well, but the higher cost of debt has spooked many investors out of the names.Which is the better buy today for total returns over the next few yearsIf we had asked that question in March or April 2020, during a period of collapsing interest rates and extreme economic pain for private businesses, the correct answer would have been BDCs.Don't believe me  See for yourselfThat is because peak pessimism about BDCs  even greater than the pessimism for REITs  rendered phenomenal values for those stocks.The same holds for BIZD against the five  in my opinion  best-in-class REITs discussed above, with the sole exception of VICI.In the initial stage of COVID-19, VICI  the  Landlord of Las Vegas,  as I like to call it  shed over half its stock price and market cap. The very experiential, in-person activities at VICI's casino properties were obviously severely curtailed by lockdowns and social distancing. But this selloff also primed the REIT for a robust rebound as Las Vegas reopened and the world returned to normal.YTD, however, BIZD has outperformed VICI as we saw above.But we can't invest by looking in the rearview mirror. We have to invest by looking out the windshield. No one can buy past returns, only future performance.As the famous quip goes,  It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.But in my view, the much better bet to make today with one's scarce investable capital is on .I think it's plainly obvious that sentiment is much stronger for BDCs than it is for REITs. In general, investors are pessimistic about REITs and optimistic about BDCs.But this trend won't last forever. To quote the father of value investing, Benjamin GrahamI'm not advocating selling BDCs. I'm a buy-and-hold-quality-companies kind of guy, and I'm certainly not selling my high-quality BDCs  or ABR, for that matter . But I think REITs make the much better buy today.It isn't just that the pendulum of investor sentiment has reached its end on its current path. After all, it is usually the case that something has to occur to  the pendulum stop and reverse course.That something is the path of interest rates. We are at or very near the top in interest rates, not just by my own reckoning but by the projections of many experts. The forward path of SOFR  which is tied to the Fed Funds rate  is forecast to begin dropping dramatically in 2024 and settle out sometime in 2026.While I agree with these forward projections in a directional sense, I don't at all buy the notion that rates will come down in a slow and controlled manner. They never do.Like stock prices, the Fed Funds rate takes the escalator  or stairs  up during economic expansions and the elevator down during recessions.Going back three decades, the Fed has never been able to gradually lower their policy rate over the span of a few years. The Fed has seemed to have three modes  slam on the gas, slam on the breaks, or coast.If a recession comes sometime in the near future, and especially if the highest interest rates in 15 years break something in the economy, then interest rates will likely fall faster and lower than the expert projections indicate.Historically, this is how it has worked out far more than the slow, gradual lowering of rates currently envisioned.If the pattern of history plays out again this time, or even if it doesn't and the expert predictions for a slow, gradually downward drift of interest rates occur instead, REITs should outperform BDCs over the next few years.While I remain a fan of BDCs, I view the five REITs discussed above as being uniformly better buys today than the four BDCs and one mREIT.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

Marathon Petroleum: Oil Price Shock Spells Trouble For Refining Margins (Rating Downgrade),"Over most of the past year, I have held a bullish view of most oil refining companies, given the prolonged increase in refining profit margin spreads. I  my long-term bullish take on MarathonHowever, as discussed more recently , I've downgraded my view on refiners due to the recent oil crash   in the  crack spread.  As such, it is likely an excellent time to look closely at Marathon, considering its stock remains generally high. However, its profit outlook is waning asA sizeable potential oil price increase could be very bearish for refiners such as Marathon, particularly if prices rise enough that gasoline demand declines. The lack of US Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories exacerbates this risk, as that reserve was intended for sizeable geopolitical-related production cuts. Overall, investors can expect increased volatility in the oil and gas markets, potentially leading to downside risks for Marathon Petroleum, depending on how we calculate its forward valuation.For the most part, refineries benefit from predictable and calm energy markets, where oil supplies and gasoline demand do not change too quickly. My long-term view remains that Marathon and its peers may benefit from lower competition due to a lack of refinery investments today. That said, the short-term outlook has changed as volatility mounts, raising pressure on oil prices against gasoline. See belowThe first half of 2023 was quiet for energy markets after a volatile 2022. However, oil has risen dramatically in value since July to around  87 per barrel today. Oil prices declined last week but erased most of those gains Monday morning as the outlook for some oil . Gasoline initially rose with oil over the summer but crashed since August as the demand outlook for gasoline slipped. Marathon has retained much of its value, but the differing trends between oil and gasoline threaten its capacity to earn an income. The  crack spread  is measured as the spread between gasoline and heating oil vs. crude oil has crashed, particularly for the gasoline spread. See belowThe heating oil spread remains high today, but the RBOB gasoline spread is back in its previous range. It is also falling very quickly as gasoline declines and crude oil increases, making it more difficult for Marathon Petroleum to earn a steady profit.Luckily, Marathon publishes its expected EBITDA sensitivity to changes in the crack spread. See its most recent analysis belowSince the end of  spread has declined from a Q2 average of  32 barrel to  19 barrel today. That figure is a combination of the gasoline and heating oil spreads above. All else being equal, this  12 barrel decline in the spread equates to an expected EBITDA change of - 12.96 annualized  3.24B quarterly .  have only changed marginally over this period. Natural gas has also hardly changed, so the shift in the blended crack spread is likely the only significant factor impacting Marathon's refining margins.The company was already under pressure following the decline in crack spreads over 2023. However, this most recent crash in the crack spread threatens to erase most of Marathon's current EBITDA. See belowHistorically, Marathon does not have a positive EBITDA if the gasoline crack spread is below around  15, depending on changes in other operating costs. Today, that spread is below its typical range before COVID-19, indicating a sharp deterioration in refining margin profitability. The company usually generates a steady EBITDA of around  1.5B per quarter from its Midstream segment. In comparison, its refining margins can vary from negative   seen in the 2022 gasoline shortage . Its refining segment EBITDA was  3.16B in Q2 and may be as low as - 80M in Q4 should the crack spread remain constant. Combined with an expected  1.5B from Midstream, I anticipate its Q4 EBITDA at  1.42B, given limited changes in commodity prices and volumes.Marathon will publish its Q3 EPS at the . I expect its Q3 EPS will be much more robust due to the elevated crack spread over that period. The spread averaged  during most of that period, or about  5 greater than the previous quarter. All else being equal, that equates to a  1.35B EBITDA in Q3 compared to Q2, giving us a Q3 expected EBITDA of  5.66B.Marathon's Depreciation and Amortization has run around  830M, and its interest is currently around  142M quarterly. Together, this creates an extra  972M added quarterly cost. Considering this, I project Marathon's Q3 pre-tax income at  4.67B, or  3.7B after taxes  21  historically . The company usually has  350M in income attributable to non-controlling interests, giving a final net income estimate of  3.35B or an EPS of  8.38. This estimate is on the high end of the  averaging at  7.48.For Q4, based on current prices, its EBITDA outlook is  lower at  1.42B due to the extreme change in the refining margin outlook over the past month. That equates to an estimated pre-tax income of  448M, or  353 after tax, and almost zero after non-controlling interest  4M, or a  0.01 EPS . The latest analyst EPS consensus for Q4 places its income at  4.53 EPS  however, those estimates likely do not consider the latest extreme changes in the crack spread as the last week or two has seen tremendous downside.These estimates do not account for one-off costs, gains, or changes in realized prices and expenses compared to the futures market. I believe it is generally reasonable to assume Marathon's volumes will also remain constant. With hurricane season in full swing, refinery outages and related issues can be a problem in estimating income levels. Further, the crack spread measure  differs to an extent from the futures index I've used. The overall degree of change does not vary dramatically, so that should not significantly change the degree of fluctuations in its EBITDA  however, it is reasonable to assume that slightly more minor total EPS changes may be seen than my estimates, potentially indicating a Q3 EPS closer to  7.5 and a Q4 nearer to  1.On Monday morning, both crude oil and gasoline futures rose by around 3-4 , indicating no change in the crack spread related to the Middle East oil price shock risk. While issues negatively impacting oil and gasoline supplies should affect both commodities, I suspect the crack spread will decline if oil rises enough to lower gasoline demand. As mentioned in my , the spread is likely falling due to a decline in gasoline demand associated with lower refinery utilization and product supplies. Potentially, the significant increase in EV sales may be a causal factor. See belowEV and hybrid vehicle sales will be necessary to watch because even if they lower gasoline consumption by 1 , that will have an ample price impact because the commodity is so sensitive. Further, the US economic outlook is not particularly strong today, with the manufacturing PMI and consumer sentiment pointing toward weaker activity in both supply and demand. While the correlation of the economy to gasoline demand is imperfect, it appears to be a potential factor in pushing gasoline demand lower. See belowAgain, a slight decline in gasoline demand combined with a minor increase in oil production could dramatically move the crack spread. In my previous article regarding Marathon, my long-term view was that weak capital investments into the refinery segment over the past decade  and today in particular  would lead to gasoline production being generally slow to oil, contributing to a permanently higher crack spread. Electric vehicle demand is very strong today despite household economic strains, partially due .In the long run, I still suspect that refineries will underproduce gasoline, leading to higher crack spreads. However, the short-term situation has changed dramatically since summer as gasoline demand has shown a stronger correlation to . Further, the sharp rise in oil prices may add significantly to this issue, particularly if oil rises for geopolitical reasons.Gasoline stocks are roughly at normal are a bit low but are rebounding. That is an indication that the shortages in the refining market may be turning into a small glut. However, oil stocks excluding the SPR are now back at the same low levels before the SPR release. Of course, no more reserves will come out of the SPR, which has lost around half its previous storage levels. See belowWe must remember that the SPR was created to offset losses in oil imports due to geopolitical issues. Currently, it is very unclear how or if the conflict will escalate, and most lack the information relevant to make that determination. Still, if it does grow to include significant oil producers throughout the Middle East and those key transport lanes become blockaded or threatened, then an extreme decline in global oil supplies could occur. This potential ,  exacerbated by the lack of US domestic oil reserves  both strategic and commercial , could likely quickly push US oil prices into the hundreds of dollars per barrel, considering it is . Gasoline should keep up with oil for some time. Still, gasoline demand will eventually fall due to higher prices, mainly if it is already falling with the economy today.The US is already exporting far more oil due to OPEC  production cuts, offsetting the recovery in US oil production. That said, the rig count has steadily trended lower because oil prices have generally been lower this year than last. See belowAs the rig count declines, future oil supplies should trend lower. That can positively impact the price of oil but will not necessarily aid gasoline if demand continues to decline. Further, a sufficiently significant decline in the rig count will usually harm midstream profits and fees change with lower supplies, potentially harming Marathon's steadier income stream.At this point, it is unclear if US oil exports will continue to rise or if production levels will fall on the lower rig count. Further, should global oil supplies decline enough, the US could reenact its export ban to restore the domestic market. That said, I doubt that would occur outside of an emergency scenario that would already be problematic for Marathon. I believe oil's bullish case has become much stronger, while gasoline is not nearly as solid, pointing toward a lasting decline in the crack spread.At today's commodity prices, I believe Marathon's EPS may be near zero or slightly positive for some time. Its cash flows will be more robust due to its depreciation, and its free cash flow should remain decent due to its lower CapEx levels. In the long run, I still suspect that low refinery capital investments will lead to a stronger gasoline market than oil. However, in the short term, I believe MPC has ample 12-month downside risk associated with the sizeable refinery-margin profit decline shock.Looking forward, I expect MPC's Q3 EPS will be good and potentially better than expected due to the great crack spreads over the summer. However, from Q4, I believe its profits will be near zero until we see a solid turnaround in the crack spread. In my view, depending on how the oil market's situation changes, an even lower crack spread may occur if oil becomes too expensive on insufficient global supplies. For this reason, I am bearish on MPC on a 12-month outlook basis. Its EPS may be around  -1 to  2 per quarter with crack spreads where they are today, potentially making MPC overvalued at a projected 2024 forward  P E  of  30X.I rarely alter my view from bullish to bearish in such a short period, but the dramatic change in the oil market over the past months makes a sharp negative revision very reasonable. I still like the stock from a long-term perspective, but not at its current price, given the immediate profit decline. To me, the issue is not necessarily current crack spread levels but the possibility that a war,  global recession, causes that spread to remain low for a year or longer. If MPC operates in a  highly sensitive   environment today, it must maximize free cash flow to give it cash to reinvest into an electric vehicle world. Thus, if it fails to maintain a high FCF over the coming years, as I've expected, its long-term potential would also be minimal.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy GDX: Greatest Gold Lease Rate Spike Since Late 2008,"Believe or not, we may have reached for one of the strongest buy signals in the gold asset market since  was  in September 2008, a good 15 years ago. An unusualWhy should gold investors pay attention to lease rates  or what buyers are willing to pay in interest beforeLast week, I mentioned the jump in 2-month lease rates to multi-decade highs  and a large inversion position to later contracts  in a  on the  . For gold bugs, the outlook for gold assets has gotten even more bullish over the past few trading days.If you are new to the gold market and gold miners in particular, and you don't want to  1  carry the extra leverage and risk of NUGT or  2  delve deeper into which individual miners are the best to own over the next 6-12 months, I definitely suggest opening a position in the  . This product holds the biggest and most valuable mining outfits, giving you quick and diversified exposure.It's also the largest gold miner ETF for stronger liquidity in trading with AUM of  11.8 billion and a 0.51  annual management expense. GDX does pay a respectable dividend yield of 1.65 , slightly better than the S P 500 equivalent. I fully expect higher gold prices next year will lead to dividend raises from many of its holdings.The Top 10 holdings of GDX include  , ,  ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  , and  . You are buying a piece of mining assets located on all the world's continents outside of Antarctica, with ownership structures from percentage partnerships, to fully owned resource and production assets, to royalty financing firms getting a piece of future sales.This article will review how GDX has performed after similar spikes in gold lease rates over the last 15 years, with the 2008 instance holding the closest similarities to our current financial market condition, in my opinion.Below we can look at a 15-year graph of the gold prices vs. changes in lease rates, via GoldChartsRUS.com. I have drawn green arrows to point out the similarities between today and October-November 2008. Plus, I have circled in green the closet cousins for a spike in lease rates during late 2015, March-April 2019, and last year's autumn setup.Here is how each occurrence played out over the following months and years for both gold bullion quotes and GDX total return performance. The conclusion which is easy to reach  past lease rate spikes have foretold of coming price gains, usually large ones over time.Does a lease rate spike lead to an immediate jump in gold prices  The answer is not necessarily. It could take a few weeks or months for the gold bull run higher to appear. That's what evidence over the last 15 years has proven. However, if you buy now and close your eyes  ignoring daily fluctuations and news flow  for 6 to 12 months, I am quite confident gold bullion and gold miner pricing will be dramatically higher than today.That's exactly what the tight physical market setup is telegraphing for the future. To find a better balance between supply and demand forces, much higher quotes look to be necessary. Bringing existing above-ground gold supplies to market through the profit-motive is how capitalism works.Part of the tightness in the physical bullion market is related to  around the world since early 2022. If their buying continues, who knows how high gold can rise in constantly debasing U.S. dollars backed by mathematically unpayable Treasury debt numbers. Any dollar confidence crisis could shoot gold above US 3000 an ounce without much warning. This target is close to my long-term  fair value  calculation for gold using 60 years of relative pricing to other asset classes and U.S. money debt creation trends. I have explained this fair-value idea in previous gold silver articles over the years.And, if we get a recession soon, with new stress on the global financial system, another round of record QE buying of Treasuries  to prevent credit markets from freezing up  and increases in money supply aggregates  to prevent a debt-default depression  will only serve to stoke interest in the hedging characteristics of monetary metals, both gold and silver.I rate VanEck Gold Miners a , leaning toward a , if prices do not rise immediately, using a 12-month outlook. Gold and related mining concerns are not getting much positive attention in the press, and futures market positioning by  highlights a clear absence of bullish interest over the last year despite a  15  gold gain. That's a good thing, as the precious metals cycle turns up, plenty of new buying interest is now sitting on the sidelines. We'll have to wait and see if we are entering a new gold rush in investment interest into 2024. It depends on the economy's direction and how the Federal Reserve reacts.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Will Rising Interest Rate Avalanche Crush The Economy And Markets?,"For 14 years after the 2008 global financial crisis, global central banks held interest rates close to zero. In the U.S., cash interest rates never topped 2.5  and were near zero the vast majority of the time. In EuropeAfter the pandemic and massive government deficits sparked runaway inflation, this model was shattered into a million pieces. Interest rates continue to surge, and I'm not sure that Yesterday, the , with more possible increases to come today with bond yields continuing their landslide. Investors are paying even more. At the same time, home prices are still up about 40  from pre-pandemic. For some rough math, buying a  500,000 house with a 3  mortgage costs you  1,686 per month in principal and interest. Add in the 40  increase in home prices and finance it at 8 , and that principal and interest payment is  4,109 per month. At this rate, we might be at 8  mortgages in a matter of weeks.Should you still borrow as much as possible to buy a house  I think it's the biggest financial mistake that you as a young six-figure earner could make, especially since you can put your 20  down payment in a money market fund and earn hundreds of dollars per month in interest  5.5 . And if you don't think so, the price of money may keep going up until you do, courtesy of massive government deficits and the Fed's inflation-fighting mandate. I've  over the past 18 months.Some readers will think my work is a total airball because prices are only down like 1  from the peak. There's still time. I don't think the economy is going to handle 8  mortgage rates well at all and we're about to find out who's right. For now, homebuilders have sold millions of homes  When these reset, I think a lot of dual-income overleveraged people will be in trouble.Will we see 9  mortgages  We're not that far off. Old-timers may recall mortgage rates this high or higher, but to put them in context, you need to compare home price-to-income ratios as well to get debt-to-income numbers. , despite a lack of population growth and a rapid pace of construction. It doesn't add upConsumers largely refuse to save money, and the government is looking to borrow as much as possible as well. It's simple supply and demand  if everyone wants to borrow and there are few people willing to lend, then interest rates go up. People on the Internet say the Fed will just print more money to bail everyone out, but they really can't legally do it with their inflation mandate. History is filled with governments who print money to monetize the debt and wipe out the middle class.However, at least in the U.S. and Western Europe, central banks have experience fighting inflation and understand the long-term economic consequences of letting inflation skyrocket. In the U.S., the public was sick of the shortsighted economic policies of the late 1960s and 1970s and double-digit inflation. Fed chair Paul Volcker took a stand, smashing the inflationary psychology via an engineered recession. Germany cracked down even further on inflation, having learned from the traumatic, ingrained experience of the  Interestingly, that generation's children and grandchildren are today's business leaders there, and their thinking largely influenced the euro and the idea of  in Europe in the 2010s.At this point, it's highly unlikely that the Fed will turn around and print a bunch of money because doing so might drive inflation back not to 8 , but to 20  or more annually. History shows that Congress eventually gets the message, as they did when bond vigilantes forced both the  and  to cut spending.What good economists would tell about the large deficits of Bidenomics is that there's a risk of  the rest of the economy. Huge government deficits need to be financed by borrowing, and finding buyers financing the debt means that interest rates go up. People always say the government spends too much, but to run these kinds of deficits during peacetime and economic expansion . This has the obvious effect of diverting economic activity that would happen in the private sector to the government. Worse, so-called  can stop buying government debt, sending interest rates skyrocketing.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman recently  on rising interest rates in the U.S., which he's winning in spectacular fashion. He thinks the 30-year Treasury will go to 5.5  this implies mortgages would be at about 9 . It seems that the lessons of the 1970s have been forgotten, with  2,000 stimulus checks offered up by both parties as the reward for voting for them in 2020. We're paying for those now.The U.S. government either needs to cut spending or raise taxes, or interest rates might just keep going up. This inflation surge shouldn't have happened   the Fed should have ended QE far earlier, and raised rates sooner. The federal government should have spent about a trillion less in 2021, 2022, and 2023. I'm speculating here, but I think if they had, then interest rates would be 3.5  or so and inflation would be a bit above 2 .Mortgages get all the attention, but cars and trucks are expensive. They're even more expensive when you can't pay cash and need to finance them. Pre-pandemic, car loans were cheap  3-4  for good credit . Now, customers often need to pay over 7 . On a  50,000 car loan, that's the difference between paying  898 per month and paying  990. Car loan payments aren't as sensitive to interest rates as mortgages, but as amortizations get longer, the effect is greater. Again here,  since pre-pandemic, so there's a compounded effect. Last I looked, salaries are up about 15-20  since pre-pandemic, so cars and houses being up 40  each is bad news. Will American automakers sell as many cars with higher interest rates  Economic theory says no. There likely will need to be a transition towards more economical cars, be they electric vehicles  EVs  or hybrids, because aging consumers with thin balance sheets don't have any business with  1,000 car payments.I think this explains why the Fed and the White House are puzzled by why consumer confidence is so low despite unemployment being low. If I waved a wand and awarded you a  100,000 job but you have minimal other assets, in 2019 you could buy a house and car. Now, your options are much more limited, first because of pandemic shortages from money printing, and now because of skyrocketed interest rates. Despite making a little more money  on paper  than before, people are worse off in terms of purchasing power unless they went into the pandemic owning one or more houses and cars.In March, we saw several regional banks fail in rapid succession. Since then, things have been quiet, although interest rates have increased and lending standards have steadily tightened. If you recall from March, what crushed these banks was having far too much leveraged exposure to long-duration bonds yielding 1  or whatever when they got flooded with deposits in 2021. Then interest rates rose and rose until some banks went broke. While betting on bonds with leverage is historically a good trade  if you have some yield to work with , it requires a higher level of risk management skill. Banks like Silicon Valley Bank  didn't have that skill, so they went bust.I wonder what else is lurking out there with these regional banks  The 10-year hit a new post-crisis high today, and while companies like Charles Schwab  took  to fix their balance sheets, I bet a lot of them just stuck their heads in the sand. I'm not going to name names of banks I think are in trouble, but if you see some of these regional banks in the headlines soon being closed for losses, then you should not be surprised.I think it's also worth noting that like many parts of the economy, certain banks and fintech-type companies thrived in an environment where interest rates only went down. If they bet the farm on it, they're going to lose the farm if interest rates keep rising.Rising rates have a direct impact on the stock market by affecting the leading sectors of the economy that rely on loans  housing, autos, etc. . Another channel that interest rates work through is increasing bond yields and thus financing costs for companies over time. Rising rates also have an indirect effect on the stock market by allowing you to earn interest risk-free in money market funds.While many investors think things like  housing is the best investment ever and nothing can stop it,  there should be some level of interest rates that makes them change their minds. Maybe it's a 5  mortgage rate, maybe it's 7 , 8 , or even 10 . Similarly, for stocks, there be an interest rate on cash that makes you change your mind about wanting to own them. If the government decided that they'd pay 20  risk-free in Treasuries, would you really want to be punting your money on the NASDAQ  Recall that in the 1970s and 1980s, S P 500   of where they are now due to interest rates being sky-high.The question right now   cash interest rates are at 5.5 , while long-term interest rates are rapidly rising. Stock prices don't really make sense, either on a macro level or whether you dig into blue-chip companies and project their cash flows. Do you want to buy stocks for near-record-high valuations, or keep some of your money in cash  It's not an all-or-nothing decision, and the higher interest rates go, the more apt you should be to save and the less you should be to borrow. American consumers just haven't gotten the message yet, with savings rates near record lows. They will though, because the price of money will keep going up until it induces them to save.Lastly, the yield curve is sending a message. Inverted yield curves are associated with a recession warning, but once the recession actually starts, the yield curve tends to rapidly steepen. Often the curve steepens because the Fed is cutting, but if it's steepening because interest rates are skyrocketing, it likely has the same effect. This will be a real business cycle, not the computer simulation science experiment that the COVID economy was.Has a recession already started and we don't know it yet  Student loans for 40  million borrowers are due on October 1st. It will be interesting to see how everything shakes out. Volatility seasonally , and we're right on schedule, but it's not like the bottom has fallen out yet. Whether the rising interest rate landslide continues is likely key to knowing where markets go next. If we see the 10-year Treasury push towards 5.5  and mortgages make a run at 9 , then it's probably game over for the 2023 mini-bull market, with some combination of a housing crash, bank failures, and stock investors forced to face the reality of steadily rising financing costs for corporate America.

"Big Dividend Yields Going Higher, Dumb Debt, And Snark"," RatesWell, congratulations anyway  You get the same reward as everyone else  more national debt.The market seems settled on raising rates10-year Treasury rates  are sitting more than 60 basis points above the trailing 100-day average. Great. Jacking up interest rates is supposed to kill off the companies that were not productive, right  That makes it a good thingRates can be an issue for mortgage REITs  mREITs  and equity REITs. For equity REITs, debt is eventually rolled over at higher rates and investors have more alternatives. When interest rates are high because of inflation, investors don't get an alternative. CPI smoothing through the housing index suppressed the actual rate of inflation. Consumer prices were actually rising at double-digit rates for a while. But you probably know that, because you've gone places and seen prices. A useful techniqueWhen actual prices were growing faster than 10  and Treasury rates were under 1.5 , investors didn't have a choice. Equity is a garbage hedge against inflation in the short term, but a great hedge in the long term. Real estate  such as that owned by equity REITs  can also serve as a good hedge over long periods.Those low rates pushed investors into equity markets. Today, Chairman Jerome Powell is ensuring they can get paid on Treasuries. We can use TIPS  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities  to measure how much of the yield is coming from inflation expectations. If the TIPS yield is high, it means investors are being offered an unusually high real  inflation-adjusted  return in the bond market.When was the last time the 5-year TIPS yield broke this level  See the chartCool, it was 2006 to 2007. We all remember nothing bad happened then, so that's great.The Federal Reserve successfully convinced investors that they will keep elevated rates even if inflation subsides. Whether we get a recession or not, the Federal Reserve really wants to see interest expenses explode higher.The market already concluded that inflation would probably be back to about 2This can be a particularly hard environment for most investors. When interest rates increase by 50 basis points in a year, it's no big deal. When they rip higher like this, it slams into valuations.Higher interest rates delay demand. That reduces inflation in the short term, which is what everyone focuses on. However, bigger  create inflation. The recent inflation was not caused by monetary policy  which means interest rates . They were low for over a decade without causing inflation. Fiscal policy changed as we shifted from big deficits to  multi-trillion  dollar deficits. Some investors still believe that this is some kind of multi-decade-lagged impact of lower rates. I'll never reach those investors. Most of you can probably see that inflation picked up promptly after pushing trillions of dollars into the economy.Don't get me wrong. Interest rates have a lagged impact. But it isn't a multi-decade lag. Inflation didn't run under 2  for about 12 years, only to rip higher suddenly from the same low rates.The issue now is that apartment construction is plunging.Why does this matter so muchLet's be real. Most of Gen Z isn't going to be buying homes. Oops, did I hurt some feelings  Sometimes, reality hurts.What I want you to see is the navy line and grey lines. That's a huge drop. Bad. Starts are projected to fall from over 500,000 to 250,000.Do you know what impacts apartment rentsIt's supply and demand. That was a really obvious answer.So, how can a country get more affordable rental units  There are two stepsIt's like rent control, except it works. Developers clearly responded to rates as it drove a surge in production and a subsequent plunge.What do I say to the guy who assumes that building more apartments will just result in millions of new renters showing up to pay the exact same price  Nothing. That's dumb. Listen to conference calls and investor presentations. The big factor that puts pressure on rental rates is local supply levels.The mortgage REIT book values are going to be down. It will be either  all  or  almost all  of the mortgage REITs listed here. On the other hand, business development company  BDC  book values will be much closer to flat on average. There will probably be one or two outliers, but most will be pretty flat.The worst losses are probably going to be in the high single-digit percentages or low double-digit percentages. Buyer beware when using the trailing BV figures  which are included below . Our strategy for trading in the mortgage REIT and BDC space relies on having frequent updates. We update estimates most weekends. Most Mondays, we go into the market with new information. For reference, there are still some reports on Wall Street where an analyst has one update for the quarter. What's better  1 update or 12 updates  When rates are moving this fast, it matters.I've got another bold prediction, though. Absent a major recession or a plunge in interest rates  which would probably require a recession , preferred shares that are  fixed-to-floating  will have a tendency to climb toward call value as the floating date approaches. There are currently 3 mortgage REIT preferred shares that are floating  NLY-F, NLY-G, and AGNCN.Their share prices are  25.34,  24.73, and  25.59, respectively. That puts their floating yields in the range of 9.9  to 10.5 . Some of the mortgage REIT preferred shares involve more risk. However, many of them have bigger floating spreads. Personally, I will gravitate more toward the lower-risk shares. However, I am venturing into a few of the higher-risk shares where upcoming floating dates imply dramatic upside. If shares rally toward  25.00, then the yield to call becomes a more useful metric even if calls don't actually occur. Of course, this only applies to shares that will have a floating rate.Investors tend to like double-digit yields. Some of these shares hit the floating date and will see dividend rates jump 25  to 50 . As the floating date approaches, we've seen prices go higherOf course, that's only one example. Yes, there are others. No, they don't fit in this article. I already wrote the sections below and the piece is getting too long. If you think I'm wrong, just look at the stability in the share prices for NLY-F and AGNCN over the last 2 years. They were the first ones to float.If you missed the announcement, you should know that CIM announced CIM-B will float using SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment. I plan to provide a bigger update on that publicly. The announcement came only a few business days after we encouraged Seeking Alpha readers to consider contacting CIM about the situation. Particularly appealing was CIM's confirmation in the filing that this would happen automatically under the law. CIM's prospectus for CIM-B has nearly identical language to PMT's prospectus for PMT-A and PMT-B.Reading the waterfall intelligently results in a waterfall that doesn't function. The fixed-rate dividend wasn't a viable long-term fallback because the qualification was  no such dividend period  exists, rather than  no such rate exists.  CIM was explicit about their shares falling under the LIBOR Act and automatically switching to SOFR  Secured Overnight Financing Rate    the spread adjustment  about 26 basis points . It was an exceptional rebuke to a less ethical peer.I want to repeat that with different wording for anyone who missed it. CIM did not say   We're choosing to use SOFR.  They said it would happen automatically under the law. The only options they had were to accept SOFR   the spread adjustment or break the law. No other option. Hey PMT, why are you looking so shifty over thereI'll probably have a public article on it next week. For this week, I really wanted toI'm excited to keep hunting in the preferred share space. Several of these shares already yield over 8  and will jump into double-digit yields when the floating rate kicks in  unless the Federal Reserve slashes rates .We will close out the rest of the article with the tables and charts we provide for readers to help them track the sector for both common shares and preferred shares.We're including a quick table for the common shares that will be shown in our tablesIf you're looking for a stock and I haven't mentioned it yet, you'll still find it in the charts below. The charts contain comparisons based on price-to-book value, dividend yields, and earnings yield. You won't find these tables anywhere else.For mortgage REITs, please look at the charts for AGNC, NLY, DX, ORC, ARR, CHMI, TWO, IVR, EARN, CIM, EFC, NYMT, MFA, MITT, AAIC, PMT, RITM, BXMT, GPMT, WMC, and RC.For BDCs, please look at the charts for MAIN, CSWC, ARCC, TSLX, TPVG, OCSL, GAIN, GBDC, SLRC, OBDC, PFLT, TCPC, FSK, PSEC, and MFIC.This series is the easiest place to find charts providing up-to-date comparisons across the sector. The chart for our public articles uses the book value per share from the latest earnings release. Current estimated book value per share is used in reaching our targets and trading decisions. It is available in our service, but those estimates are not included in the charts below.  Presently, a few other REITs also have no consensus estimate. Due to the way historical amortized cost and hedging is factored into the earnings metrics, it is possible for two mortgage REITs with similar portfolios to post materially different metrics for earnings. I would be very cautious about putting much emphasis on the consensus analyst estimate  which is used to determine the earnings yield . In particular, throughout late 2022 the earnings metric became less comparable for many REITs.I changed the coloring a bit. We needed to adjust to include that the first fixed-to-floating shares have transitioned over to floating rates. When a share is already floating, the stripped yield may be different from the  Floating Yield on Price  due to changes in interest rates. For instance, NLY-F already has a floating rate. However, the rate is only reset once per 3 months. The stripped yield is calculated using the upcoming projected dividend payment and the  Floating Yield on Price  is based on where the dividend would be if the rate reset today. In my opinion, for these shares the  Floating Yield on Price  is clearly the more important metric.Note  Shares that are classified as  Other  are not necessarily the same. Within The REIT Forum, we provide further distinction. For the purpose of these charts, I lumped all of them together as  Other.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Fluence Energy: Armed With Disruptive A.I.,"Dramatic changes in the levelized cost of solar power are currently forcing a sea change in how our electric grid functions. In order to mitigate the problems caused by the widespread adoption of solar, we areThe passage of the  dramatically increased our  Instantaneously managing something as dynamic and complicated as our grid has always been beyond human capability, so up until fairly recently we wouldn't have considered it. Developments in Artificial Intelligence have changed everything.Fluence Energy, Inc.  is one of several companies currently positioning themselves to be able to compete for dominance in this highly disruptive emerging industry. With the company already vertically integrated for the production ofFluence Energy provides energy storage equipment and services. The company was formed in early 2018 as the result of a joint venture between AES Corporation  and Siemens . The two companies  AES's extensive research with Siemens' expansive global presence. Fluence  6.6GW of storage deployed, contracted, or managed in 47 different markets.Fluence Energy offers both hardware installation and maintenance services, as well as operational capability through A.I. controlled energy management software. They provide turnkey energy storage products with fully integrated hardware, software, and digital intelligence.Fluence also offers a variety of service and management packages. Customers who want a more hands off approach can sign up to one of their more full-service options.Fluence is a vertically integrated grid scale battery manufacturer. They are several generations into their development and currently produce a highly modular cube shaped battery. When used in their separate applications, Fluence gives each of their technologies its own unique brand. Their grid-scale energy storage product is known as Gridstack  their control and operation system is known as Ultrastack  their solar capture optimization system is known as Sunstack  and their commercial energy storage and load flattening system is known as Edgestack.The grid-scale battery market is projected to experience a  until 2031. The global smart grid market is projected to have a  until 2030. The United States renewable energy market is estimated to have a  through 2028, and the global market is projected to have a  until 2030.The  is one of the primary factors at play when examining long-term energy infrastructure trends. With photovoltaics achieving the title of  several years ago, additional inclusion of renewable sources seems inevitable. However, the adoption of intermittent sources has been warping the daily supply and demand curve for grid supplied electricity. This supply and demand imbalance produced by solar is known as the Duck Curve. Uncontrolled overproduction from solar has the potential to damage portions of the grid. This problem has grown severe enough that we are already disconnecting portions of commercial scale solar operations during the middle of the day.Since the initial adoption of our electric grid, it has operated on a continuous supply basis. Traditionally, because of the significant startup time for most power plants, changes in future demand must be forecast. Because of the need to avoid shortages, not only must demand be forecast, managers must intentionally overshoot that expected demand. Our continuously oversupplied grid operates with significant waste and is in dire need of storage capacity.Because they are viewed as the single most vital part of our current grid, the base load providers have enjoyed superior pricing power at the negotiating table. With our inverter technology already above the threshold where they can achieve a strong stable signal, and the rise of storage providers undermining the need for continuous oversupply, as even more decentralized sources are incorporated into the system the individual negotiating power of electricity producers diminish.As the total storage capacity within the system grows, and we incorporate more medium and long-term storage into the system, I expect that negotiating power will shift toward the storage providers. Eventually, they may be able to adopt a  stance while negotiating against any single source provider. For this reason, I believe only the most cost-effective base load providers will thrive in the coming decades.Also, I believe the need for peaker plants . Peaker plants are usually powered by natural gas. They are designed to be able to synchronize with the grid and achieve operational power from a cold start within a few minutes. We ask them to come online breifly to mitigate the spikes in demand that occur every evening. We also ask them to help us maintain stable oversupply during events which cause changes to usage habits on a truly massive scale, like the Super Bowl, the Olympics, or the World Cup.As the grid storage industry is incredibly disruptive, I also expect a price war to break out. Storage providers can collect free or almost-free electricity during periods of overproduction. In places where a significant portion of electricity comes from solar, this happens in the middle of the day, every day. They can later sell that electricity when it's trading at its highest every evening. In addition to experiencing an erosion of their negotiating power, I do not expect the source providers will be able to compete with actively managed storage providers if a price war breaks out.The thing to note here is that storage providers are financially incentivized to get their hands on as much overproduction as possible. Companies wanting to increase the volume of electricity they can arbitrage each day are going to attempt to install grid scale storage sites into as many markets as possible. This is one of the greatest shake-ups the industry has seen since its inception  we may even see already established utility companies begin installing storage into the service areas of rival utility providers. Over the next several decades, I believe the arbitrage business has the potential to scale into a truly massive industry.The machine learning software packages that we have been developing to actively manage multiple dynamic sources are what is making this possible. I think the companies which are able to develop the most capable A.I. are the ones which stand to benefit the most from actively managing our future smart grid.Fluence Energy was formed as an attempt by AES and Siemens to pool their knowledge and experience to produce a company capable of meeting the growing demand for grid scale storage. Fluence Energy expanded their capability with  in April 2022. Nispera collects and analyzes data from multiple sources to monitor production in real time.

While their parent companies have accounted for a significant portion of their business so far, approximately 81  of their backlog is with not-related parties. Their total backlog of contracts is up to  11.2B.They also increased the amount of assets they had under A.I. management by 800 MW and were able to place an additional 2.7 GW under contract for digital management. They stated this represented a 200  increase from the previous quarter.They previously expected to be adjusted EBITDA positive in fiscal year 2024. They are now revising their expectations to be close to adjusted EBITDA break even in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. They stated they believe they will not need to raise any additional capital and have ample liquidity to meet their cash needs for the next 12 months.Fluence has been experiencing significant revenue increases. Eight quarters ago Fluence Energy had a quarterly revenue of  98.1M. Four quarters ago that had risen to  342.7M  by this most recent quarter that had further grown to  698.2M. This represents a total two-year rise of 611.7  at an average quarterly rate of 76.47 .Their margins have been improving for the last several quarters. As of the most recent quarter gross margins were 4.38 , EBITDA margins were -4.88 , operating margins were -5.27 , and net margins were -3.57 .As of the most recent quarter cash and equivalents was  194M, short-term investments was  70M, and quarterly operating income was - 37M. Their share count has been growing at a fairly stable rate for the last four quarters. In June of 2021, total common shares outstanding was at 114.3M  by this most recent quarter that had risen to 116.9M, a 2.27  increase.As with many spin-offs and joint ventures, and unlike many start-ups, Fluence has not had to take on large amounts of debt on its path to operational viability. This most recent quarter, Fluence Energy had - 0.1M in net interest expense, total debt was at  3.4M, and long-term debt was at  0M.As the company approaches adjusted EBITDA profitability, I expect that these cash flow values will improve. As of this most recent earnings report, unlevered free cash flow was at - 123.4M, while levered free cash flow was at - 123.9M.Their total equity rose dramatically in late 2021 but has been slowly declining since then.Similar to my thoughts about their cash flow, I expect their returns will shift into positive territory as they continue to improve their margins. As of the most recent earnings report ROIC was -4.36 , ROCE was -1.89 , and ROE was at -4.38 .As of August 3rd, 2023, Fluence Energy had a market capitalization of  4.92B and traded for  28.36 per share. The company is not profitable so I cannot produce a PEGY estimate, but they do have an  of 35 . Considering their guidance for profitability, I view their forward EV Sales of 1.6x, Price Sales of 1.65x, and Price Book of 12.39x as showing the company as presently undervalued.Despite their positive guidance, the margin expansion and cash flow improvements might not materialize. With their cash and short-term investments, the company currently has  264.4M in unrestricted funds. Their most recent quarterly levered cash flow was - 123.9M, while cash from operations was - 74.5M, EBITDA was at - 34.1M, and operating income was - 36.8MI believe that arbitragers will eventually gain significant control over the price of electricity as supply and demand both vary throughout the day. However, this may not occur. If the general public views what the storage providers do as price manipulation, they may one day face regulations.Fluence Energy has multiple direct competitors including Stem , and Tesla  who are also developing thier own energy production and grid management digital intelligence. They also face indirect competition from companies such as C3.ai , which are developing digital intelligence services more focused on dynamic consumption management. While Fluence certainly does appear to be capable, their eventual dominance in this emerging industry is far from a guarantee.The company currently has  11.2B under contract waiting to be converted into revenue. This most recent quarter, they were only able to fill  700M worth of orders and yet signed  2.8B in new contracts. This  2.8B came in above their previous quarter's new contract value of  2.7B. The picture that is being painted by this trend is that demand for their product is currently outstripping the pace they can install new storage. It's fairly clear why the company believes they will be able to grow revenue  their waiting list is growing.The grid scale storage industry currently uses mostly lithium-ion based batteries, but I believe this will change. As the upcoming production ramp up of  comes to market, the total cost of grid scale storage  This should further increase demand for Fluence's products and services.Currently, most of the conversation within the industry is about short-term storage. As we further develop batteries more capable of handling medium and long-term applications, the storage market will find new demand.Fluence Energy is still transitioning from the introduction startup phase of the business life cycle into the growth phase. They are currently blessed with no long-term debt, and the low cost of solar should provide them with sustained tailwinds for years to come. I think their machine learning digital management packages have already proven themselves effective, and are probably one of the reasons the company is experiencing increasing demand. This company already has  11.2B in revenue waiting on them, and they are signing up more every quarter. Their margins have been improving and guidance is positive, so most of my remaining questions revolve around how quickly they can reach positive cash flow.Because of the disruptive nature of their technology, and their attractive long-term projected growth rate, I believe waiting to buy until after the company achieves positive cash flow may be a mistake.

Natural Gas Seems To Have Underappreciated Upside Potential,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Yahor Zaikou as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. It is not news that U.S. natural gas prices  are highly volatile. In addition to the usual cycles from overproduction to shortages in commodity markets, we are dealing with a commodity where the balance of supply and demand is so delicate that it can change dramatically even in response to single, hard-to-predict technical factors, such as the Freeport explosion last year. And, of course, natural gas price is highly weather-dependent, which apparently gives it an undeniable reputation as a widow maker.The analysis of natural gas supply andIn this article, by contrast, we will take a holistic approach and try to analyze the dependence of the price of natural gas on just one variable--how much gas is in storage. We will see how this dependence has changed in the past and try to look into the future.Below, you can see graphs of natural gas prices and storage surplus compared to the average of the previous five years. The first thing I noticed when I put these graphs together was that the words of natural gas producers' representatives that the current surplus will dissipate sounded even more convincing to me. This is not just an abstractly rational statement from the point of view of market laws, natural gas inventories have indeed always tended towards their average value, at least in recent years. At the same time, compared to production volumes, the deficit and surplus have never looked too large.The maximum surplus we see on the graph is produced in about a week, and the exports that have fallen due to an accident at just one LNG terminal in a few months exceed the current surplus. The market is constantly doing the delicate work of balancing itself.As you might expect, if one compares graphs of natural gas price and surplus, it is easy to see that they are related. Price minima were reached in 2016, 2020 and 2023 almost simultaneously with the maximum surpluses. This year's price minimum was higher than in the previous two cases, but the surplus was also slightly lower this year, so this year's price minimum fits nicely into the series of previous price minimums.At the same time, we see that the moderate supply deficit in 2022 coincides with much higher prices compared to previous years. To make sense of this, let's take a look at the graph below, where prices are shown as a function of the natural gas storage surplus. While what we see is far from a perfectly smooth line, the graph clearly shows that in recent years prices have depended on the surplus in one of two patterns shown in different colors.Until 2021, we have a flatter curve with a somewhat stronger rise in prices to  4 at the very left side of the graph when the deficit is at its maximum. Between 2021 and 2022, we have an impressive price increase to almost  10 even with moderate deficits. The difference between the two patterns is clearly visible just when there is a deficit of natural gas in storage, while when there is a surplus, prices are in the same range. Perhaps the reason is that when there is a surplus, the market pays more attention to the production cost below which the natural gas output will be drastically reduced, which will quickly bring the surplus to zero. The production cost apparently has not changed radically in recent years, in the sense that it has changed less than the statistical spread of the values on the graph. Anyway, the market is now in surplus, and we can't tell from this graph whether the later paradigm is continuing or whether we are back to the earlier pre-LNG paradigm. There is another way to find it out, we will come back to that later.It is important to note that although the temporal boundary between the two patterns is arbitrary to some level, in order to clearly separate the points, the border had to be drawn in 2021. In other words, well before the beginning of problems with Russian gas supplies to Europe due to the war and thus the paradigm shift that led to the emergence of the later pattern can hardly be explained solely by panic. It seems that between mid-2019, when the period of natural gas deficit in the market ended, and early 2021 when the deficit returned to the market something happened that changed the response of natural gas prices to its deficit in a big way, namely, it led to much higher prices. What exactly happened  I think the correct answer is that during this time period the amount of LNG exported from the US doubled, increasing by over 5 bcf d. As you can see in the graph below this was the period of the fastest growth in LNG exports in history and I have not found any other events of such magnitude in the natural gas market to put forward an alternative hypothesis.Also, from 2021 onwards, there has been a period of high prices in global LNG markets and there is a great temptation to attribute the high US natural gas prices to the impact of external prices due to the globalization of the natural gas market. In practice, it is not that simple. A very common and reasonable counterargument is that if LNG terminals are operating at full capacity for the U.S. natural gas market, it doesn't matter how much natural gas costs in Europe or Asia- it won't be possible to increase exports. But first of all, although I'm not an expert, I'll allow myself to speculate on the following topic. From my observations of export volumes, I can assume that LNG terminals have some freedom in how much gas to deliver at a given moment--- a bit more or a bit less. The monthly export high as seen in the graph above was reached in April of this year at 12,6 bcf d. This is quite significantly higher than in many of the recent months when Freeport was either already operating or still operating, i.e. nominal liquefaction capacity was the same as it is now. And all this time it was thought that export capacity was fully utilized. The market may believe that higher prices on global markets can lead to a 1 bcf d increase in supply  a value that seems reasonable based on the chart below , which is not a negligible amount. Such an increase in exports alone would bring the entire current surplus to zero in about 7 months. Second, whether or not the global market's impact on the U.S. is justified, it is definitely there, and has been for a number of years. Will it suddenly come to an end, given the fact that in the coming years we will see an increase in LNG exports and, as a consequence, a move towards the already undeniable globalization of the natural gas market  I doubt it.Importantly, the futures market also seems to believe that prices will continue to follow the trajectory from the later pattern, and thus we continue to be in it. As shown in the graph below, starting in 2025 the futures market predicts average annual prices just above  4. It makes sense that the futures market assumes that there will be a zero deficit on average for each of these years, because the market is effectively seeking balance.If so, then futures prices are consistent with the later pattern. The price-vs-surplus graph shows that natural gas prices near zero surplus are clustered around  4 for the second pattern, while the corresponding prices for the first are around  3.The main conclusion of this article is that during the next period of natural gas deficit, prices are likely to rise much more than the market currently expects. How far we are from that period-- depends on many factors, those are described in the introduction. The main one is the weather. In addition, such a forecast itself implies an increase in price volatility, not a decrease. Therefore, buying decaying financial instruments like  and  does not seem like a good idea to me, despite my bullish position on natural gas.I think it is better to buy shares of natural gas producers. However, the attention should be paid to their financial strength and their low production costs, which can ensure that the company will safely survive the period of low prices, if it lasts for some time. I also think it is important to pay attention to how a company hedges natural gas prices. The less hedges, the more upside in my opinion. For this reason, if I could only own shares of one natural gas producer, I would choose Antero Resources . But that is a pretty risky approach. Do your own due diligence.

Livent: Lithium Boom Or Bust? Analysts Are Rightfully Bullish,"The , one of America's largest lithium producers, is currently down 20  year-to-date. It has lost close to 60  of its value since its peak above  35 last year.In this article, we'll take a lookWe'll also discuss the risk reward as analysts continue to believe that LTHM is poised to doubleGiven its financial numbers and longer-term opportunities, I absolutely agree with that.So, let's dive inThe Livent Corporation, originally known as FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp., was established in 2018 as an independent companyThe company, whose roots go back to 1944, is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and specializes in the production of various lithium compounds, with a focus on high-performance lithium products.These compounds are essential in applications such as electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy technologies.As we can see in the overview below, Livent's core products include battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, butyllithium, and high-purity lithium metal.Additionally, Livent offers specialty lithium compounds such as lithium phosphate, pharmaceutical-grade lithium carbonate, high-purity lithium chloride, and specialty organics.In order to grow its business in an industry critical to supplying much-needed materials for the energy transition, the company has a growth strategy built on four pillars, two of which stand out to me.As the overview above shows, Livent has its first customer agreement with Ford for the delivery of up to 13,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year over an 11-year period.The company also announced a proposal to merge with Allkem, creating a leading global lithium chemicals producer.The merger offers increased scale, vertical integration, and growth opportunities.As of 2Q23, key milestones have been achieved, including regulatory notifications and applications and a preliminary S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC.Livent and Allkem shareholders are expected to vote on the merger in the fourth quarter of 2023.Almost needless to say, Livent anticipates significant growth in the electric vehicle market, driven by increased consumer awareness, government incentives, and the need for carbon reduction.Having said that, it's not an undisrupted uptrend for miners.The Wall Street Journal said it best when it wrote an  with the title on October 17.The article mentioned that one of Livent's peers, Albemarle , recently walked away from a  4.2 billion deal to acquire Australian lithium miner Liontown Resources.This decision was influenced by several factors, including a declining lithium price, financial concerns, and strategic considerations. The lithium price has plummeted from  66,000 per metric ton in 2022 to around  27,000 by October 2023, impacting revenues of the entire industry.One big factor is weakening Chinese demand.China's lithium market is adversely affected by weak consumer and business confidence, as well as an ongoing property crisis.EV sales growth in China decelerated to 37  in the second quarter, in contrast to the global average of 50 .Consequently, Chinese lithium carbonate futures have plummeted by approximately 37  since their introduction in July, leading to a substantial 35  discount compared to lithium hydroxide futures in the United States.After all, Chinese demand accounts for 40  of lithium demand.Although Western lithium prices are also under pressure, they receive some support from battery metal buyers in countries like South Korea and Japan, who aim to benefit from tax incentives tied to President Joe Biden's climate bill.Nevertheless, the decline in lithium prices may persist.  to Citigroup, lithium carbonate and hydroxide prices could drop another 15  to 20  in the near term due to weak demand, high inventories, and improved supply.During its 2Q23 earnings call, Livent commented on these developments, highlighting that lithium prices have stabilized at more sustainable levels after reaching historic highs at the end of 2022.The floor price is estimated to be above  30 per kilo in China, with the expectation that it will continue at this level through 2024.While there may be price spikes due to supply and demand factors, underlying market fundamentals remain tight.As a result, the company reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance, projecting revenue in the range of  1.025 to  1.125 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of  530 to  600 million.This guidance implies significant revenue and EBITDA growth compared to 2022, driven by higher volumes and average realized prices despite anticipated higher costs.On a longer-term basis, the company should continue to benefit from a widening supply gap, especially if rising cyclical demand meets a strong secular bull case.It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet. Analysts expect the company to lower net debt to  9 million this year, followed by a decline to  54 million in net cash at the end of 2024. This means that the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debt.As I mentioned in the introduction, LTHM's stock price has come down crashing. However, analysts still believe that the fair value is in the lower- 30s range.While I wouldn't be surprised if these targets were to come down a bit if the company hints at potentially prolonged weakness in the industry when it reports its earnings on October 31, we're dealing with a very attractive risk reward.Looking at the chart below, we see that the company has had a normalized P E ratio of 46x since it became an independently traded company.We also see that the company is expected to grow its earnings per share by 14  next year, followed by 3  growth in 2025. Needless to say, these numbers can be much higher if lithium prices rebound. They also can come in lower.Currently, Livent is trading at less than 9x earnings. Even a return to a 28x multiple in 2025  incorporating the aforementioned expected growth rates  could result in an annualized return of 77 .A higher valuation and higher expected growth could significantly improve that potential return.While I absolutely believe that the stock's fair value is more than 100  above its current stock price, we're dealing with a very tricky situation.Further cyclical weakness could easily cause this stock to drop another 10  to 20 .So, whenever we're dealing with high-return, high-risk investments, I make the case that the best way to deal with this valuation is to buy gradually and keep positions small.If you believe that lithium is right for you, I would start very small and gradually add to the position.In a scenario where LTHM keeps dropping, investors can average down. If LTHM rallies, investors have a foot in the door.I believe this is the best way to deal with a very favorable long-term investment opportunity that faces shorter-term cyclical risks.In light of the risk reward, I give LTHM a rating.But then again, if you mainly invest in low-volatility dividend growth stocks or similar, While Livent has faced a turbulent year, with a significant drop in stock price, there's an intriguing upside for investors who can navigate the cyclical risks.With a focus on lithium, a crucial component in EV batteries and renewable energy tech, Livent's growth strategy, capacity expansion, and commitment to next-gen compounds show promise.Despite the recent decline in lithium prices, Livent maintains a stable financial position and anticipates long-term growth opportunities.The stock is trading at an attractive valuation, offering a potentially high return, but it comes with a risk, considering industry uncertainties.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

PPLT: Dead Money Can Come Back To Life,"In a September 3, 2023, , I concludedOn September 1, nearby NYMEX platinum futures were trading at  968.70 per ounce. In late October, the price was just over  900 per ounce as the rare metal continues to be dead money and a weak link compared to gold. Platinum has tested investor patience and perseverance for years, and it continues to be a financial thorn in portfolios in late 2023.Platinum reached aAs the twenty-year chart illustrates, platinum fell from the 2008 record  2,308.80 high to a low under  600 per ounce in March 2020. The 2020 bottom was a spike low during the beginning of the pandemic that caused a tidal wave of selling in markets across all asset classes. For over three years,  800 has contained selloffs on the downside, with the price remaining below the  1,300 level. While  1,050 is the average level, platinum futures have spent most of the time below the  1,000 per ounce level.The May 2023  2,072 high on the nearby COMEX gold futures contract was a double top formation as the futures reached precisely that level in March 2022. The failure to reach a higher high led to a correction that took the continuous gold futures contract below  1,810 per ounce in early October 2023.Gold fell, reaching a low on October 6. The October 7 terrorist attack in Israel caused gold futures to turn higher, rallying to nearly  2,000 in late October and probing above that level on the nearby December futures contract.A close above  1,950 per ounce on October 31 will establish a bullish key reversal on the monthly gold futures chart, which could lead to new record highs above the  2,072 technical resistance level. Gold is the leading precious metal. While platinum's nickname was  for decades because of its rarity compared to gold, it has not lived up to that moniker in a decade.The platinum-gold spread measures the relationship between the precious metals.The chart of continuous NYMEX platinum futures minus the continuous COMEX gold futures shows platinum's premium rose to a record high at over  1,200 per ounce in 2008 when platinum prices peaked. Since then, platinum has lost its luster versus gold, with the spread making lower highs and lower lows. At around a  1,075 discount for platinum under gold on October 26, the spread is sitting near a record low, and the bearish trend remains intact, with platinum underperforming gold for the past decade and a half.In September 2023, the  reported a 2.2  larger platinum supply deficit than previously expected for 2023 at a record one million ounces. Growing requirements and flat supplies drove the shortfall between supply and demand.Catalytic converter, jewelry, and glassmaking demand has grown 27  to 8.2 million ounces in 2023, while supply remains at 7.2 million ounces, the same as in 2022. Platinum supplies have not increased because of ongoing electricity shortages in South Africa, the world's leading producer.The WPIC expects automotive and industrial consumption to deplete above-ground stocks in 2024, likely increasing the fundamental deficit next year. Meanwhile, the price action tells us that investors have ignored the supply-demand deficit, with platinum sitting just above  900 per ounce on October 26.The chart highlights the bearish pattern of lower highs and lower lows over the past months. Since peaking at over  1,100 in May, platinum futures fell below  860 per ounce. The price was not far above the low in late October as a stable U.S. dollar, and the rising interest rates have weighed on the price. This week, the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures fell to the lowest level since 2007. Higher rates increase the cost of carrying commodity inventories. The dollar is the international pricing benchmark for most commodities, and platinum is no exception. A higher dollar increases the cost of platinum in other currencies, weighing on the demand.Meanwhile, investors have shunned platinum despite the fundamental deficit. Trend-following traders have no reason to purchase the metal, given its bearish trend and underperformance compared to gold for years.The total annual platinum production of 7.2 million ounces equates to 224 metric tons.As the chart shows, South Africa produced 62.5  of the world's platinum in 2022, with Russian output accounting for 9 .The bifurcation of the world's nuclear powers, the wars in Ukraine and Israel, and tensions between the U.S. Europe and China Russia may only exacerbate platinum's supply shortage in 2024. While China is the leading platinum-consuming country, Europe and the U.S. are second and third. Since over 70  of the world's annual platinum supplies come from BRICS countries, the tensions could lead to supply disruptions or even trade embargos. BRICS countries are moving towards a BRICS currency, challenging the U.S. dollar for cross-border trade. Sanctions on Russia and trade restrictions on China have caused them to seek alternatives to the U.S. currency. Since China is the world's second-leading economy, a BRICS foreign exchange instrument could diminish the U.S. dollar's reserve currency role. When it comes to platinum, the tight fundamentals and production from BRICS countries may only exacerbate supply concerns, leading to higher prices.Moreover, platinum is a thinly traded precious metal. On October 25, COMEX gold's open interest was 467,547 contracts, representing 46,754,700 ounces worth over  93 billion at  1990 per ounce. NYMEX platinum's open interest at 81,905 contracts reflects 4,095.250 ounces worth  3.72 billion at  908 per ounce. The 2022 annual gold mine supply of 3,100 metric tons was 13.8 times higher than platinum production.The bottom line is that platinum is a thinly traded futures market, which could lead to significant volatility if the price turns higher. Low liquidity creates an environment where prices can rise or fall to illogical, irrational, and unreasonable levels that defy fundamentals. While platinum has been under pressure for years, the potential for a sudden and violent upside move remains a clear and present danger, given the supply-demand equation, BRICS production dominance, and gold's price appreciation.If platinum will resume its previous position as ,  the current price is a bargain. Risk-reward favors the upside, making platinum highly attractive in the current environment.The most direct route for platinum investment is via the physical market for bars and coins. However, physical platinum investment involves significant premiums to the spot or futures price because of the limited supplies.NYMEX futures are another investment avenue as they converge with spot prices during delivery periods as the exchange offers a physical delivery mechanism. Each NYMEX contract contains 50 troy ounces of platinum.The fund summary for the   statesAt  83.14 per share on October 26, PPLT had around  870 million in assets under management. PPLT trades an average of 68,729 shares daily and charges a 0.60  management fee.I continue to be a very frustrated platinum bull. However, I will add to long positions on further price weakness as the fundamental deficit, and BRICS production dominance is a potentially bullish cocktail for the metal long overdue for an explosive rally. Leave room to add, as picking bottoms in any market is dangerous. Platinum is cheap compared to gold, and its low liquidity could make a rally over the coming months and years explosive.The  is one of the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from a top-ranked author in commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Cenovus Energy: Cash Drain Ending,"  made a few acquisitions that resulted in a bunch of one-time expenditures.  also began operations whileCenovus Energy has a cash flow advantage over many competitors because the thermal business often requires a relatively large cash investment first before production begins. Therefore, there is a depreciation component that protects cash flowCenovus management appears to have determined that some cash flow will be used to grow the company business. That decision is part of the free cash flow calculation used to determine the cash available to return to shareholders. Investors need to remember that Free Cash Flow is not GAAP or any other accounting standard. Therefore, the calculation of Free Cash Flow can and in fact does vary among companies. This should be expected when there is no formal standard. That means Free Cash Flow is often not comparable until the numbers are reviewed and adjusted for an  apples to apples  comparison.Obviously, the debt progress came to a grinding halt when the acquisitions were made. But management remains focused enough to resume progress as shown above.Rising prices of commodities should help that forward progress. But so will the transition of cash-using assets to cash generating assets.Longer term, the acquired refining assets need to be optimized to maximize the profits of the combined company. That means that the refining and upgrading process will need to handle more thermal oil production in the future while turning that oil into profit maximizing products. Given that the market price relationships can change due to supply and demand imbalances, this demands a flexible manufacturing process.The  be thought of as a starting point. The same can be said for current utilization rates and other key production figures that help to determine overall profitability.The main goal is to avoid periods of thermal oil pricing weakness that decimated results in the past before there was more refining capacity. Some products like asphalt, could well reflect thermal oil pricing weakness even though they are value added because the primary source of asphalt is a discounted product.Others, like gasoline, can also be made from light oil and therefore are likely to have a sales price that  holds up better  during times of weak commodity prices  during a cyclical business downturn cycle .This process will likely take years  rather than happen overnight . That implies a gradually widening corporate margin when compared to the past under similar conditions. Given that commodity prices fluctuate all the time, this is the kind of progress that shareholders find hard to see happening.The other thing is that the acquisition of more refining capacity over the last few years means that there is a switch in suppliers to the Cenovus thermal production. This can be traumatic for the refining business as well because thermal supplies can vary. Sometimes, the variation is so great that capital expenditures to the refinery are required. Therefore, using Cenovus products at the acquired facilities may take some time in addition to taking the time needed to maximize profits using this supply source.Long term, there is still a very clear need for more refining capacity.As can be seen above, there is still a fair amount of production that is exposed to commodity prices because there is no downstream capability for that excess production. Clearly, management can make money on that production selling it at commodity pricing, or they would not produce it in the first place.But long-term, enhanced profitability will likely happen through the expansion of downstream capabilities. Management has noted some debottlenecking opportunities. But left unsaid is that management is probably opportunistically shopping for a refinery or two that can fit the corporate organization.While the company has made considerable progress, there is clearly still a lot of potential upside in the optimizing profits process.In addition to the previous discussion, management plans to grow upstream production. While that makes downstream production expansion capabilities a priority as well, it does mean that this management has a full plate of future growth projects  on the table.An integrated company often means that growth in place often implies growth elsewhere to optimize profits.What this appears to point towards is high single-digit growth rates for the company well into the future. Now that the company is far larger than it was when I first initiated coverage, the initial frantic growth rate will give way to a growth and income strategy for the foreseeable future.That means total annual returns from growth will likely decline. But the increased safety of an enhanced downstream division will remove some of the corresponding risk to achieve what management likely believes is an acceptable proposition to Mr. Market.There are other possibilities in the offshore and overseas business. But probably the most attractive idea is for the unconventional business  or conventional depending upon the area  to find condensate that can be used by the company to make the oil produced flow through the pipelines. If this happens and is successful, then it would eliminate a major purchase from outside suppliers.Management has at times mentioned the need for condensate and wants to explore the acquired acreage for more products than the current natural gas production. But there is no guarantee of success. The speculative upside for shareholders would be company supplied condensate as a major cost reduction.Cenovus Energy Inc. management has done very well, as quarterly cash flow is up something like 16 to 32 times  depending upon commodity prices for the quarter  since I began coverage of this company about 5 years ago. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done.There is also a potential foray into the Chemicals business that many diversified giants have.The very low stock price valuation protects against the threat of downside principal loss over the long term. It should be noted that Mr. Market really has yet to give the company any credit for the larger downstream operation. This company is a strong buy consideration because the upside potential from all those acquisitions far exceeds any downside potential at the current price.As long as Cenovus Energy Inc. grows, I intend to hold the stock until the story changes materially. However, the volatile trading price does allow for a lot of trading opportunities along the way. So, there are likely to be a lot of ways to make money. With the currently low market valuation, the odds are in your favor.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

UAW Strike And Saudi Oil Cuts Are The Fed's New Inflation Nightmare,"August CPI and retail sales numbers  this week, signaling a new phase in the Fed's battle to bring down inflation. Adding fuel to the inflationary fire, United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain has declared a simultaneous strike at theHonor, trust, and respect are key in some aspects of life. Labor negotiations with Corporate America are not one of them. All that matters with union negotiations is leverage  Enter Shawn Fain, bulldog leader for the United Auto Workers union. Negotiations over the past year show that labor unions in key bottlenecks of the economy have been able to demand eye-popping deals with companies. Airline pilots demanded and , the Teamsters grabbed a deal to push UPS  driver pay in five years, and  and  have threatened strikes as well to renegotiate pay packages. This ramps up the pressure on the UAW to go big or go home in its own negotiations.So what's going on here with these huge pay increasesThe fact that major unions are demanding and getting large pay increases speaks to the amount of damage that has already been done to the purchasing power of workers. In the 1970s in particular, these kinds of wage demands led to inflation by creating what's known as a wage-price spiral. Now it's interesting to see these coming back in a big way, including the UAW's  to price increases.The UAW chose to begin by striking roughly 13,000 workers here, with the implicit threat that they can double down a couple of more times without depleting their strike fund. Their tactics are sharp here because they can virtually guarantee that they'll cost General Motors , Ford , and Stellantis  billions of dollars in lost profits either way. It's quite possible that the UAW could win the battle but lose the war, as the Big 3 auto manufacturers are not the most competitive globally and have a poor track record of handling change.Key parts of the American manufacturing economy are not competitive with Mexico, China, and Eastern Europe. As such, unemployment should naturally be a good amount higher than it is now. To keep this from happening in the post-2008 world, industry in the US and parts of Western Europe has been propped up by tax cuts, subsidies, and rock-bottom interest rates. Now inflation is taking this option away, which is likely to lead to a more difficult process of reeducating and retraining workers to be competitive in the 21st century. Elon Musk's Tesla  is competitive globally, but  than the union workers make, and the unions are demanding a 40  raise.The UAW striking here will directly increase inflation because they're walking off the job when they would be making cars. In the short run, this means consumers are likely to have fewer choices of cars and will face higher prices. This directly complicates the Fed's inflation fight, which has relied partly on used cars dropping to bring overall consumer prices back towards target. Also notable is how poorly stocks have performed after getting crushed by unions in negotiations. UPS stock is lagging the market by roughly 30 percentage points this year, while American Airlines  is lagging by more than 10  with the flight attendant union looking for a new deal as well. My guess with the automakers is that the union will get a surprisingly good deal, or will strike long enough to punish the stocks anyway. I'm less certain that the UAW is prepared for the shift to electric cars, many of which will be made overseas or in more employer-friendly jurisdictions like Texas.The Saudis are ramping up the pressure with supply cuts, and it's working. Oil fell from its highs of around  120- 130 per barrel when the economy slowed last fall and stocks entered a bear market. Now, supply cuts have WTI oil back into the  90s. One way to think about this is that the Biden administration wants oil as low as possible for the 2024 election and that the Saudis want it as high as possible. The Saudis won the first round in 2021 and 2022, but the Biden administration won the second with a warm winter in the US and Europe and the Inflation Reduction Act bringing optimism about the supply chain. The results of the third round remain to be seen, but it's going to be very difficult to escape higher oil prices in the short run if Saudi Arabia doesn't play ball.This is a huge challenge for the Fed. Though the Fed targets core inflation with its policies, the August CPI report showed that transportation services rose 2  for the month, the biggest rise of any category outside of energy  Transportation services are part of core inflation, underscoring the risks of another inflation surge happening under our noses. Does the increase in transportation services have anything to do with the Saudis driving oil up and labor unions in the transportation sector dropping the hammer  You bet it does. Oil has been higher in the past, especially when adjusted for inflation. The current surge in inflation has occurred without out-of-control oil prices. Imagine how bad prices for all kinds of goods and services would be with oil at  150. This isn't my current base case, but history shows that it's possible with war or supply cuts. If you believe  showing continued growth in oil demand over the next few years, this is going to be a structural problem for prices.Due to the base effects from last year and higher energy and transportation costs, inflation is increasing and getting further from the Fed's 2  annual target. Adding a prolonged strike at the automakers is not helping the cause, calling into question the market's belief that the Fed is most likely done hiking interest rates.The Fed has more or less boxed itself in from hiking in September by public comments various Fed speakers have made in recent days. For year-end, is showing that the Fed has roughly a 60  chance of staying put, vs. a 40  chance of hiking more. The Fed had already said they would hike once more in 2023, so traders will get more information about this from this week's meeting.  the Fed is still behind the curve by trying to do the minimum. The 30 30 Taylor Rule model runs in my latest calculations are calling for at least one more hike. What should the Fed do at this week's FOMC meeting  My guess is that they'll hold interest rates steady, but signal a hike in November and a higher level of interest rates and inflation for 2024 in their .The European Central Bank  the ECB  indicated that they're likely pausing hikes this week, and markets reacted mechanically by dumping the euro and panic-buying US stocks. However, what the ECB is really saying with their actions is that they're concerned about how deep the coming recession will be and are trying to limit the damage. This is likely why the panic buying completely reversed itself on Friday, while yields continued to grind higher. Over in Japan, they're struggling with inflation as well, and recent moves to relax their interest rate controls are . If the BOJ hikes interest rates and abandons yield curve control, that cuts off another key source of money that's helped hold interest rates low.The Fed is in the same quandary as the ECB. Union negotiations at home and oil prices shooting up mean that the economic models are probably right and that the Fed can't simply pause and pray. They'll need to hike one or two more times to avoid losing control of prices, even into early signs of a moderate to severe recession. 30-year mortgage rates are creeping towards 8  in the US, while car loans are moving towards 7 . It's hard for interest rates to go down with stubborn inflation and deficits as big as they are, and there doesn't seem to be any appetite to raise taxes or cut spending. I don't think the economy is going to handle this very well at all.Inflation was supposed to be gone by now, but recent data shows that  back to the upside. With labor trouble at home and the Saudis cutting oil production abroad, the Fed likely will have to tighten a bit more to balance supply and demand. This comes as leading economic indicators continue to worsen amidst rates for mortgage and auto loans hitting fresh post-2008 highs. That's bad news for traders expecting a Fed pivot and a corporate profit boom. The stock market remains overvalued. Therefore, I'm still firmly in the camp of holding money in cash paying 5.5  and waiting for a steep correction or crash in stocks before doing any significant buying. While there are always a few good deals in any market, the broad market indices look increasingly overvalued.

This Is Why You Should Stay Bullish,"One year ago, I advised investors in this report not to be bamboozled by conventional thinking. Most economists and market strategists were convinced that the rapid rise in short-term interest rates from the zero bound to what is now more thanThe fault in this line of thinking was failing to recognize that we are not in a typical business cycle. The combination of the pandemic, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, and the war in Ukraine over the past three years resulted in extremes in supply and demand that required us to step outside the box of conventional thinking. Regardless, the pessimists have dug their heels soFriday's jobs  for August was another step in the direction of a soft landing. We saw a continuation of slower job growth  187,000 , easing wage inflation, and an uptick in the supply of labor, which increased the participation rate. This is music to the Fed's ears in its effort to restore price stability without ending the ongoing expansion in the economy. The increase in the unemployment rate from 3.5  to 3.8  was largely due to new entrants in the workforce.The pessimists are already pointing to this increase as a warning sign that a significant stock market decline and recession are on the horizon, but they are again failing to recognize the strength of the foundation to this expansion and bull market.It makes sense to assume that when interest rates go up rapidly, consumers will spend less on goods and services, businesses will spend less on equipment and expansion, corporate profits will decline sharply, and unemployment will rise meaningfully enough to result in an economic contraction. The anomaly that helped us avoid this fate one year ago when inflation was more than 9  and interest rates were starting to rise was an unprecedented amount of excess savings held on consumer balance sheets. Bearish forecasters failed to appreciate the potency of this phenomena. It was the fuel that kept real  inflation-adjusted  consumer spending growing, which is why we avoided a recession.Now that excess savings has fallen closer to pre-pandemic levels, those who failed to recognize its significance are asserting that consumer spending will collapse under the weight of the lagged impact of higher interest rates. Again, a logical conclusion, but one that fails to recognize a new development long in the making.Earlier this year, I forecast that we would see a return to real wage growth just as excess savings no longer became relevant. To that point, last week's jobs report showed average hourly earnings growth of 4.3 , which is in excess of the latest Consumer Price Index figure of 3.2 . That is helping to soften the blow of lower savings levels and softer wage gains, but it does not explain economic resilience in the face of higher interest rates. Today's resilience is due to the fact consumers and businesses are far less sensitive to rising borrowing costs than they have been in the past.For all the concern about overleveraged consumer balance sheets, household debt as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product has fallen from more than 100  during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 to a two-decade low of 77 . This is a result of more responsible lending standards and more reasoned consumers.In addition, there has also been a dramatic decline in the amount of after-tax income required to service outstanding debt. The debt servicing ratio fell from a record high 13.2  to an all-time low during the pandemic, and it remains near a multi-decade low of 9.6 .The decline in outstanding stock of debt is the reason that the 500 basis points in rate increases by the Fed over the past 18 months only resulted in a 1.5  increase in the percentage of disposable income required to service that debt. This is helping to sustain consumer spending levels, and prolong the expansion, but it isn't just the consumer who is less sensitive to changes in monetary policy.Corporate debt has seen similar . The stock of outstanding corporate debt as a share of GDP at 43  is not far from its 2008 peak of 45 , but as a percentage of corporate net worth it is at a 50-year low. Additionally, the debt outstanding is predominately fixed rate and longer term with average maturities ranging from four to 10 years, depending on asset class. The percentage of investment-grade debt maturing after 2028 has risen to 56 , while the percentage of high-yield debt is up to 42 . This means that corporate America is also less sensitive to rising interest rates. In fact, the Fed's rate-hike campaign has been a windfall for most sectors of the S P 500 , because net interest costs as a percentage of post-tax profits have collapsed.During the ultra-low interest rate period from 2020-2022, corporations refinanced outstanding debt at fixed rates for longer terms in the same way that homeowners refinanced mortgages. When the yield curve inverted, due to the surge in short-term rates, corporations started earning huge sums on their cash balances in the same manner that retail investors are profiting from money market funds. This is boosting corporate profits and helping to fuel capital spending, as net interest costs have plunged to a 60-year low.Those who remain pessimistic will chant  higher for longer  when it comes to the Fed's monetary policy, which they assert will end the expansion and send the S P 500 to much lower levels than we see today. I could not disagree more for the reasons I have outlined. Consumers and corporations are far less sensitive to rising interest rates than they have been in the past. With the Fed's rate-hike cycle having likely concluded, and the disinflationary trend intact, a soft landing is looking more probable with each passing month. Estimates for corporate profits in 2024 are inching upward. I expect the S P 500 will achieve new all-time highs in the coming 6-12 months.Lots of services offer investment ideas, but few offer a comprehensive top-down investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense.

"XLE: Crude Oil Goes Boom - Protect Yourself, Buy Energy","On April 20, I wrote an  titled  In that article, I made the case to buy energy stocks to be protected from what could become aHere's a part of my takeawaySince then, the Energy ETF  has rallied roughly 11 , beating the S P 500 by 300 basis points.Now, it's time for an update. Not only have I written countless articles on various energy stocks, updating my bull case, but we've also seen a confirmation of my thesis.After breaking out in July, crude oil futures are back at  90. That's despite poor consumer confidence and a general downtrend in economic growth.In this article, I'll discuss the drivers of this bull case and explain why I continue to believe that owning energy stocks is so important.So, let's get to itLike every other commodity, oil is all about supply and demand.The supply picture is what worries me  meaning, it could cause high inflation for many years to come  because major basins in the U.S. are running out of steam.After the Great Financial Crisis, U.S. shale production was the reason why global oil prices were subdued most of the time  especially after 2014 . In 2007, the U.S. produced roughly 500 thousand barrels of oil per day using unconventional measures  horizontal drilling . Now, that number is 8 million barrels per day higherThis annoyed OPEC a lot. It even annoyed U.S. producers, as they were producing so much that every decline in demand caused oil prices to crash.So many smaller players went bust in the past few years.Now, things are changing. U.S. shale is running out of stream. We're not seeing peak oil but a significant decline in supply growth. Producers are seeing rapidly declining Tier 1 drilling reserves. They focus on free cash flow generation instead of production growth and reward investors through dividends and buybacks.They have learned their lesson - especially in an environment where new climate movements want to put big oil out of business.As the chart above shows, shale production is barely higher than it was prior to the pandemic. The only basin with growth left is the Permian  the big one .Even that basin is expected to reach peak production in 4Q24.With the U.S. losing pricing power, OPEC is witnessing a chance to become more powerful.One of the reasons why oil is back at  90 is aggressive output cuts from OPEC  mainly Saudi Arabia . Saudi Arabia wants to protect  80 Brent at all costs. It also seems to be willing to defend  90 Brent, given that they announced an extension of the cuts.Because of the supply squeeze, we're dealing with an increasing supply shortfall, pushing up prices.We can assume that OPEC is likely playing a political game here. While I'm obviously not a political insider who knows what, for example, the Saudis are up to, I can imagine what they are doing here.Looking at the chart below, we see that crude oil storage levels in the U.S. are way below anything we've seen over the past five years  and before that .Including the strategic reserves, reserves are more than 200 million barrels below their longer-term average. Also, we're going into a major election year. I doubt Biden - or any Democrat - wants to buy back oil in this environment.Having said that, demand developments are also favorable.As reported by  on September 14, forecasts from leading energy analysts suggest that global crude oil consumption is on an unstoppable ascent.The International Energy Agency  IEA  projects a record-breaking 102.2 million barrels per day for this year, with a relentless climb to 105.7 mb d by 2028.Exxon Mobil  also anticipates demand to surge by roughly 7.5 mb d until it peaks in 2040.What's interesting is that the IEA  do not confuse this with the EIA  isn't  that  bullish. Its outlook includes barely any demand growth through 2028.They do not expect 2018 levels to be reached before 2025, as most consumption is expected to come from natural gas liquids and biofuels.According to Bloomberg's David Fickling, we could be looking at a peak demand scenario for crude oil - despite the overall positive demand picture of fossil fuels.Having said that, I agree with the outlook that fossil fuel demand isn't peaking. I do not believe that we're anywhere close to a peak, as we're at the start of massive growth in the middle-class population of India and various African nations.While India will make sure to build a future with less dependency on foreign energy  learning from China's mistakes , I do not see a scenario where oil demand turns into a headwind - ignoring cyclical recessions that happen occasionally. I'm talking about the bigger picture.OPEC also issued a  on September 14, reacting to the IEA's outlook and comments.Allow me to share a few quotes from OPEC's letter. I will add emphasis and my own view on things.OPEC is 100  right here. While suggesting that we could peak demand may very well be a wrong thesis, actively pushing for fewer investments in oil and gas is a serious issue. We're currently finding out what happens when rising demand meets slower supply growth. The middle class  and everyone below  gets squeezed.I often make the case that I am not rooting for high energy inflation. Although I have close to 20  energy exposure, my main concern is the protection of my portfolio, as elevated inflation is generally bad for the stock market.That's also why I'm writing this article.Lastly, I agree with OPEC when it comes to alternatives.I've been a number of times on Dubai-based Asharq TV, where I discussed energy policies. My point has always been to use the proceeds from fossil fuels to build alternatives. We should NOT cut reliable sources before we have good alternatives.That's the biggest mistake we're currently making.Putting all things together, I'm bullish on oil. While I do not rule out potential recession risks that could push oil down  20 to  70, I'm a buyer on major weakness, protecting my portfolio against what I believe will be a long-term uptrend in crude oil. I believe that triple-digit dollar prices are likely, which could come with a second wave of inflation - especially if the Fed is forced to cut rates at some point.While I do not own XLE, I believe that XLE is a great way to hedge against energy inflation without having to take on elevated risks.Incepted in 1998, XLE is one of the oldest ETFs on the market. It has a 0.10  expense ratio and a quarterly dividend. The current yield is 3.6 , which is mainly driven by Exxon Mobil and Chevron , who account for roughly 40  of this ETF.Furthermore, as the overview above shows, investors get access to refiners as well. The ETF also includes providers of energy equipment and services.This provides some diversification.Despite not having the benefit of owning tech stocks, XLE has outperformed the S P 500 by roughly 450 basis points over the past 12 months.

Vonovia: Potentially Rewarding Due To Macro Tailwinds,"Note  All amounts in the article are in EUR. At the current exchange rate, 1 EUR is around 1.05 USD.In line with the German real estate sector, Vonovia   has seenI have been buying up German real estate companies since early summer, which was a contrarian move. I am a big believer in this approach. When everybody seems to think everything is bad and can only get worse, it is   not always, but very often   a good time to start buying. I was also following the discussion on Seeking Alpha on German real estate stocks and found the arguments of the bulls much more convincing. However, I am grateful for the bearish articles because they gave a balanced view.I started investing in almost every publicly listed German real estate company of a reasonable size which was not too dependent on new real estate development. I now think it is time to look at companies with significant exposure to new real estate development, too. I thought it was still too early a few months back, and it seems this was the right call.I ended up with a large position in Vonovia, Grand City Properties , and Aroundtown  AANFF . I did not intend to have a large position in Aroundtown. The company has significant exposure to commercial real estate and is the largest shareholder of Grand City Properties. As I own Grand City Properties too, it creates a cluster risk, and I generally see commercial real estate at the moment as riskier than rental real estate. However, the stock has gone up more than 90  since I started buying, so my Aroundtown position is now sizeable, too.I have a smaller position in LEG Immobilien  and did own TAG Immobilien , but I have already sold those shares. My position was small, and TAG Immobilien went up too quickly over a short period, so I did not buy more. I usually build up positions over several weeks or months, and sometimes longer, if the investment thesis does not play out as I think it should, but I am still convinced it is correct.In total, this investment in German real estate companies is among the best ones I ever made, and additionally, it played out in a very short timeframe. While I went in with conviction in the beginning, I admit it was not with a lot of research. It is now time to evaluate what the next steps are.Conventional analysts are not much help here   in my view. When I started buying there were Sell ratings with the target prices 10-30  above the share price. JP Morgan issued a Sell rating for Vonovia at the end of March with a target price of 18 euros. The share price was around 15 euros at the time. It is not much better now. Recently, Baader Bank  a German broker and investment bank  repeated its Buy rating for Aroundtown with a target price of 1.15 euros. The last time Aroundtown traded at or below 1.15 euros was in July, and it is already over 2 euros now. So, there is a lot of confusion around German real estate companies, at least among analysts.I did a deeper dive into Vonovia as this is my largest position, and I now think that I will be holding on to the stock for maybe one or two more years. Once the interest rates environment turns, Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds. I expect the share price to go back to 30 to 40 euros  where it was just a year ago , a further upside of 40-80 .Vonovia owns 550,000 rental apartments. Almost 90  of them are in Germany, around 40,000 in Sweden, and 21,000 in Austria.Housing construction in Germany is doing miserably. There is already a significant supply demand imbalance, and it looks like it will get worse. According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt  Federal Statistical Office   almost 28  fewer building applications for apartments were issued between January and July this year than in the same period last year. For single-family homes the numbers are even worse  building applications for single-family homes were down 36.5  YoY.The reasons for the lack of new housing construction are obvious  increased financing costs due to interest rate developments and high construction costs because of inflation.The official goal of the German government is to create 400,000 new housing units every year, to cope with the demographic development. This is not even that ambitious. Since 1950, when the German Federal Republic was founded, on average . In 1995, 602,800 new units were built, but in 2022, only 295,300. It looks like 2023 and 2024 are going to be even lower.Vonovia benefits disproportionally here. Firstly, . Secondly, growth mostly happens in  where Vonovia s apartment portfolio is concentrated. The top 7 large urban areas  Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, and Düsseldorf  account for more than half of the portfolio in Germany.The situation is so desperate that the local government of Berlin appointed a Commission on the  Expropriation of Large Housing Companies , in response to a public referendum in September 2021. It came back with the  that this would be legally feasible, although owners would need to be compensated. The  is that this has a next to zero probability of being executed, even if the legal opinion would turn out to be correct. This is not assured either. In 2019, the City of Berlin introduced a rigorous rent control law  called Mietendeckel , which was struck down by the German Federal Constitutional Court.Accordingly, Vonovia s vacancy rate in Germany is at a very low 1.9   it is 2.2  including the units in Sweden and Austria . The company has  due to rising construction costs and interest rates. Recently the  that this could continue into 2024.Compared to other countries Germany is a nation of renters   fewer than half of Germans own their own homes. Accordingly, tenant protections are strong. However, I find it hard to imagine a situation where the largest provider of rental apartments in Germany is not going to benefit from this supply demand imbalance in the long run. There does not seem to be a quick fix.I do not think this is reflected adequately in the share price yet. The EPRA NTA  net tangible asset value  per share was 49.67 euros at the end of H1, compared to a current share price of around 22 euros.A related topic is rent growth. Inflation and rent growth are strongly correlated but with a time lag. Vonovia s most recent investor presentation includes the following graph to illustrate the point.When inflation accelerates, rent growth initially lags because implementation is delayed by factors like regulatory constraints. However, rents are expected to grow faster and for longer once the inflationary pressure has subsided.In  the 12M rolling organic rent increase was  3.5 , compared to  3.4  in H1 2022  however, the rental EBITDA grew by 7.8  YoY due to reduced expenses and maintenance costs . According to management, it should reach between 3.6  and 3.9  by the end of the year.While accelerating, rental growth is still below inflation   for now, and it looks like this could change sooner rather than later. In September 2023,  slowed to 4.5 , significantly down from August when it was still 6.1 .Vonovia has three core debt KPIsDue to the write-downs in Q1 and Q2, the LTV is now 47.2  and Net Debt EBITDA multiple is at 16. The only KPI above the target is the ICR, which was 4.7.So, Vonovia is breaching two out of the three KPIs.While this is not great, I would argue that Vonovia has managed the downturn reasonably well so far.The company has enough liquidity, and all debt maturities are covered until the end of 2024. But It will need to refinance  or pay back  around 4-5bn euros of debt every year between 2025 and 2030. An investment grade credit rating and a revolving credit facility of 3bn euros  which was extended until 2026 in Q2  should help, but I assume that further disposals are necessary. In its , Vonovia says it is working on a JV in Northern Germany with a fair value similar to the sold Südewo portfolio   so around 1bn.Vonovia usually pays out 70  of Group FFO as a . As is common for German and European companies, this is once per year. To preserve liquidity, the payout was halved this year, but the dividend yield was still around 5  at the payout time in June.Most other German real estate companies skipped their dividend this year, so Vonovia stands out. The cash out was further reduced to around 373mn euros as the company has a scrip dividend program in place, and 45  of shareholders took advantage of that. For reference - the total FFO was 1,944mn in 2022 and 948.6mn so far in H1 2023  -9.5  YoY .As Vonovia has breached two of its debt KPIs this year due to the write-downs, a dividend payout next year is not assured, even though there would be ample room for one given the expected FFO. However, management is still guiding for a 70  payout. The expected FFO per share for the full year is 2.15-2.39 euros. So, the dividend yield would be between 6.8  and 7.6 , based on a share price of 22 euros.Even if a dividend payout does not happen, investors should keep the scrip dividend in mind. It is a nice way to avoid the German dividend withholding tax. The process is bureaucratic for retail investors, and from my own experience, I know it can take up to two years. For that to work, investors should not buy the ADR shares.As earnings were negative in H1 2023 due to the write-down, it is better to look at funds from operations to see how the valuation looks compared to the operational performance. FFO per share was 19.14 in H1 2023, so around 9.5 on an annualized basis. This is not expensive, and significantly below the historic average of around 20 over the last 5 years from 2018 to 2022.But it is in line with other German rental real estate companies. LEG Immobilien comes to 20.36  based on the H1 FFO , and TAG Immobilien to 19.64. Only Grand City Properties is lower with 15.71.The companies are also comparable regarding their NTA values per share compared to the share price, while all have a low number. Vonovia is at 0.45, LEG Immobilien at 0.46, TAG Immobilien a little higher at 0.53 and Grand City Properties again lower at 0.34.The difference in valuation is because Grand City Properties has appreciated much less YTD than the other three.My takeaway here is that Vonovia's valuation will probably only improve in line with the real estate sector and real estate prices. Once the macroeconomic environment for the sector improves, I think shares will go back to a range between 30-40 euros. So I intend to hold at least until shares reach 30 euros, and I realize that this could take at least one to two years.I own both Vonovia and Grand City Properties, but my position in Vonovia is larger. This is because of the difference in company size and the resulting difference in risk. Vonovia is part of the German DAX index and has a market cap of 18.39bn euros, Grand City Properties is much smaller with just 1.75bn.The biggest risk is the interest rate environment. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the investment thesis is still correct, in my view. As I consider the long-term macroeconomic environment favorable for Vonovia, it will just take longer to play out.A further need to write down the value of its assets is another risk. This would be bad for the share price, but Vonovia also has an additional covenant risk on its debt.The need for further write-downs could arise if prices go down more, but it is also possible that there is already a mismatch between what Vonovia thinks its assets are worth currently and what the real market prices are.This does not seem to be the case though. Vonovia has written down the value of its real estate portfolio by around 11  since the peak in June 2022. This looks to be at least in line with where market prices went. According to the numbers from , which are based on actual market transactions for new and existing buildings, prices have declined by an average of 9.9  in that period. There are regional differences, so Destatis segments the numbers into five categories, from rural to larger cities  where Vonovia has most of its apartments . In the top 7 large urban areas  Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, and Düsseldorf  prices for apartments fell by 9.8  in Q2 2023 compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Therefore, I think the depreciation Vonovia applied to its portfolio is adequate and gives maybe even some cushion.That does not mean prices cannot go down further. However, the downturn in Q2 2023 was already significantly weaker when compared quarterly  compared to the first quarter of 2023, residential properties were 1.5  cheaper  in the two previous quarters the QoQ decline was significantly higher at 2.9 and 5.1 , respectively.In the  from September 28  so quite recently  Vonovia says it is too early to give an H2 valuation guidance, but notes that based on the Q2 valuation there is a 25  headroom for compliance with bond covenants  not considering any positive impact from further rent growth and disposals .My takeaway here is twofold. First, prices can go down further in the short term, but probably not significantly. Second, it would take a very drastic macroeconomic shock for prices to go down a further 25  and for Vonovia to breach its debt covenants.Longer term, the dynamics of supply and demand point to rising prices, and rising rents.Once the interest rate environment turns, Vonovia should benefit from significant macroeconomic tailwinds. This could not happen in 2023, but I assume sometime in 2024.We have seen the share price above 50 euros in the past. However, I do not think we will get there anytime soon again. Those prices were driven by basically free money and those days are over for now. However, I expect that over the next two years, the share price could go back to 30 to 40 euros where it was just a year ago, an upside of 40-80  from where the shares are now.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cautiously Bullish Oil,"For the most part, indicators of the physical market for crude oil remain relatively bullish - as they have been for much of this year.On the term structure front, both WTI andThe same can be said of diesel futures. Through a combination of reduced Russian diesel exports, reduced production of Saudi heavy sour crudes  which are generally easier to refine into diesel as opposed to gasoline  and a number of other factors, the diesel market remains incredibly tight and is certainly something energy bulls will want to see in addition to crude oil backwardation.Meanwhile, WTI calendar spreads  represented The gasoline market on the other hand looks much weaker than that of diesel or crude oil as a whole. The EIA's  historically noisy  estimates of gasoline demand suggest demand has been waning, but whether this is a result of an oversupply or falling demand remains to be seen. Regardless, the market for gasoline is clearly far less favourable at present.We can assess this by examining both the RBOB gasoline futures term structure above, as well as looking at refined product crack spreads. As we can see below, gasoline crack spreads have moved materially lower over recent weeks, while diesel and jet fuel cracks have held firm.Clearly, the market for refined crude oil products is becoming increasingly bifurcated, a dynamic which suggests to me the tight market for crude oil is more so being driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.Such dynamics are beginning show up within refinery demand, whose throughput and utilisation rates have largely trended back toward their seasonal averages. Refiners are in a bit of a tricky spot at present, having to decide whether to continue to refine at above seasonal rates to capture the higher diesel and jet fuel margins on offer and thus continue to oversupply the market with gasoline, or to reduce runs, thus reducing the amount of crude they consume. This is why crack spreads provide such valuable insight into the state of the oil market. After all, refiners are ultimately on of the primary buyers of crude oil.Thus, all else equal, unless we see gasoline demand pick up and thus gasoline cracks firm, it will be very difficult to see oil move much beyond the  95- 100 area in the near future, particularly when European and Singapore gasoline cracks are also moving lower.Though, as we have seen, outside of gasoline the physical market remains strong and bullish overall for oil. Other key differentials are confirming this dynamic, with the Dubai-Brent spread  a proxy for Asia China oil demand  continuing to trend lower overall and near parity.While the various Africa-Brent crude oil differentials also remain strong. This is an important relationship to track, as West African crudes tend to be the first to sell off.While the physical market overall looks to still be rather tight, we are not seeing this translate into inventory draws to the same degree that we saw from August through September. Indeed, if we look at weekly changes in total crude and petroleum product inventories relative to their seasonal averages, the picture has now turned unfavourable, as we are seeing far more builds than draws.In terms of commercial inventory levels overall, total crude and petroleum stocks are more or less in line with seasonal averages. Crude oil stocks on the other hand remain below seasonal averages, as do diesel stocks. The recent build in gasoline stocks is again reflective of the bifurcation between the crude market and the various refined products we are seeing at present. For me to once again become uber bullish  though I remain cautiously bullish , persistent inventory drawdowns across the board would need to become the norm.In terms of the outlook for supply and demand, consensus forecasts continue to suggest we are likely to see the Q3 deficit continue through Q4, though to a lesser extent, prior to the market returning to surplus at some stage during Q1 of 2024. Although such forecasts are full of assumptions and thus fraught with error, it is worth noting what the EIA, IEA, OPEC and others are expecting in terms of production and consumption. For now, consensus is expecting a 0.5-1 mb d deficit to close out the year, which if true, will show up in persistent inventory drawdowns as well as the key indicators of the physical market, which to me are far more reliable indicators of the outlook for oil. When it comes to positioning, this is unfortunately where things take a bearish turn.All good bull markets in energy are driven by low levels of speculative positioning  i.e. hedge funds and CTAs  who are then forced to cover shorts and drive prices higher on the back of favourable fundamentals. This is exactly what has occurred since speculators were caught heavily underweight crude oil around mid-year, thus providing the fuel for much of the subsequent rally from  70 to  95 crude.Now, despite a significant level of unwinding of speculative longs in RBOB gasoline and ultras low sulfur diesel  ULSD  futures, hedge funds and CTAs remain heavily long WTI futures, a dynamic which will prove a material headwind for oil. This is not to say speculative positioning cannot become even more extended, but the fundamentals need to be significantly bullish for them to do so.From a technical perspective, however, it is difficult to argue that recent price action remains favourable for bulls. We continue to see a trend of higher highs and higher lows, with the  90- 92 level now acting as key resistance. Should we fail once again to break through this level, then I suspect this is the market telling us how high the ceiling is for oil prices for the time being. But, as it stands, price action remains constructive and a break above  92 for WTI should usher in  100 crude in short order.The same can be said of the energy equities, with the XLE ETF  continuing its relative strength and very much looking like it wants to break out above the  93 level which has acted as key resistance for over 12 months now. Again, a decisive break to the upside would be telling in relation to the future movements in the energy space.On the other hand, it is also worth noting we are now entering the worst seasonal period for oil prices in the final few months of the year. The Northern Hemisphere's summer driving season is behind us, although it must be said seasonal swings in demand have had very little impact on price movements this year, as supply shortages have been the primary market driver.

Could We See $100 Oil In 2023?,"Goods things finally appear to be happening for energy bulls. After languishing in mediocrity over the first half of 2023, oil prices now appear to be recovering and could well be setting up for another leg higher. WTIAs it stands, the fundamental outlook for the market appears quite constructive for the second half of 2023, and, should these bullish factors remain in place, a rally to  90 bbl or even as high as  100 is not out of the question.Starting with the physical market, crude oil inventories have flirted with both builds and draws for much of the year - giving little fundamental signal in theThis was the largest weekly drawdown of US crude oil inventories since the data was first recorded in 1982. And, as we can see below, not only does this appear bullish on an absolute basis, but also on a seasonally adjusted basis.For crude oil, analysing inventory changes and inventory levels provides a decent real-time proxy for the supply and demand dynamics within the market. Should this record drawdown be a sign of things to come, this bullish turn in inventories should continue to support prices for the months ahead.In similar fashion to changes in inventory levels, the shape of the crude oil futures curve provides valuable insight to the ongoings within the physical market.Although the actual prices of the various futures contracts are themselves not useful predictors of future prices, the shape of the futures term structure does provide valuable information into the underlying fundamentals of the oil market, and is another excellent indicator of the status of the physical market. GenerallyAgain, similar to inventories, the term structure has provided mixed signals for much of the year as it has flirted with backwardation and contango.As it stands, the curve now resides in firm backwardation across the board, though not the same degree as was seen during 2021 and early 2022. Nonetheless, this remains a bullish outcome for now, as the market looks to be becoming increasingly tighter as we enter the second half of 2023.Prompt and longer-dated time spreads are also confirming this dynamic. Both are sitting firmly in backwardation and confirming the recent move higher in WTI.Meanwhile, US crack spreads for refined products such as diesel, jet fuel and gasoline have all also moved higher in line with the recent rally in crude, thus confirming the tightness in the market as indicated by the backwardated term structure. Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined products.From a positioning perspective, everyone and their dog has been either short or bearish oil for quite some time now, so there has been  and remains still  plenty of scope for a sustained positioning driven squeeze higher.Indeed, the managed money component of the futures market  i.e., hedge funds and CTAs  recently had their smallest exposure to oil in almost a decade as recently as early July. And, while their buying activity has fuelled much of the rally thus far, there remains plenty of scope for speculators to drive prices higher still.Likewise, total speculative positioning as a percentage of open interest remains close to favourable contrarian levels despite the recent rally.In terms of the supply and demand outlook for oil, it appears we could see deficits return to the market throughout the second half of the year  if they are not already present . Though I view their forecasts with a grain of salt, the EIA s projections suggest global demand will exceed production by 0.98 mm b pd deficit in Q3 followed by an additional shortfall of 0.38 mm b pd in Q4.Similar projections are being made by commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, who  suggesting a  Likewise, the IEA have also recently revised upward their demand forecasts, and now predict a 1.7 mm b d shortfall through 2H23.While demand overall still lags its pre-COVID trend, it has recently hit an all-time high. As  by Bloomberg s Javier Blas,  Whether we like it or not, it continues to look increasingly apparent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar lack the efficacy, efficiency and base load capacity to replace fossil fuels, so it stands to reason peak oil demand is still likely decades away.On the supply side, Saudi Arabia have confirmed they will extend voluntary production cuts through September, this puts the cumulative effects of Saudi s total production cuts over the past year or so at around 3 mm b d, meaning their overall production is now around 9 mm b d, below their estimated maximum of 12 mm b d. Meanwhile, Russia have also suggested they plan to cut exports by 300,000 b d by next month, after already agreeing to reduce exports by 500,000 b d in August.It seems increasingly the case Saudi Arabia have now positioned themselves as the world's swing producer of crude oil, given the lack of investment in US shale of late. This is likely a dynamic the Saudis will continue to leverage in the short term, as they have hinted that current cuts could be extended or even deepened. While Saudi Arabia s production cuts are largely responsible for the supply shortfall, we are likely to see throughout the second half of 2023, such supply shortages - coupled with reasonably strong demand - suggest the market will remain tight at least through the next quarter.From a technical perspective, the picture has improved dramatically this past month. WTI looks to have broken out of its downward ascending wedge pattern that has been slowly developing over the last year, whilst also breaking through key moving averages. As it stands, the  82 level looks to be key resistance for now, and whether or not we can break through this level will be very informative as to how sustainable any potential 2H23 rally can be.From a seasonality perspective, the outlook remains favourable for the next quarter.On the whole, the outlook for the oil market over the second half of 2023 looks quite bullish. Market technicals, trend and seasonality look to be taking a turn for the better, while fundamental indicators of the physical market such as the term structure, inventories and crack spreads also look to be leaning toward the bullish side of the equation.Ultimately, there appears plenty of scope for higher prices in the coming months. But, while I remain very bullish oil over the long term and expect to see prices reach mid-triple digits at some point in the future, I am skeptical that this will occur in 2023.Indeed, there are a number of factors at play which could put a ceiling on prices in the medium term. For one, as discussed earlier, much of the supply shortages seen in the market today are a result of Saudi s numerous production cuts. Should prices spike to the  90- 100 bbl level, it seems likely they will once again ramp up production to take advantage of these higher prices. What s more, while Chinese oil consumption has disappointed this year, we have seen the Chinese work to significantly increase their commercial and strategic stockpiles in recent months, and history suggests they could release these barrels onto the market should prices rise sufficiently. And finally, while the economy remains robust for now, the  for economic growth continues to appear subpar, which may or may not impact demand in late 2023 to early 2024. Either way, the second half of the year looks to be an existing one for energy bulls. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",27,2023-08-05T09:15:00.000-04:00
"Phillips 66 Vs. Valero Energy: One Is A Buy, And One Is Not","In the last 60 days, the refining segment has seen strong gains. So much so, that  have downgraded the entire group based mainly on valuation and risk ofThe viewpoints expressed at Bank of America make sense on the surface. After a nice run and the continuance of historically high crack spreads, the group could take a beating if margins regress to historical levels. However, all refiners are not created equal. In fact, when looking at the three biggest refiners in the US  Marathon, Valero, and Phillips 66 , you will find three different business structures.In this article, I will discuss two refiners, Phillips 66  and Valero As a whole, the refinery industry has gotten smaller since the pandemic. Total refinery capacity has actually shrunk to 2014 levels as a result of under investment in the industry . We are now entering the hangover period from the pandemic. The pandemic's sudden shock to the industry has resulted in refiners closing up shop, and those who stayed in business put off large maintenance projects to stay afloat. This has shifted the supply and demand balance resulting in higher rates for refiners. These new rates have allowed refiners to post outstanding numbers over the last 12-18 months.Since greenfield refineries aren't exactly appealing in the public eye, and electric vehicles are becoming more ingrained in the transportation industry, the industry has shifted its investment focus. The big players are now focusing growth initiatives on renewable diesel for both its environmental and economic benefits.To that end, several companies aim to start up renewable diesel projects to capture the high margins that are offered by renewable credits  more on that later  for producing renewable diesel. Below are some of the notable renewable diesel projects in the works.As with most things, the market takes some time to respond to these incremental changes. Currently, the EIA projects the 3-2-1 crack spread to remain elevated for 2023 before settling back to a slightly elevated level by 2024.Does all of this point toward the demise  or at least regression  of the refinery sector  Let's dive in to VLO and PSX to find out.VLO is a moderately sized company with a market cap of  46 billion, just a bit smaller than PSX  50 billion . VLO is also a highly visible brand with its logo on top of over 7,000 gas stations nationally. VLO also has 15 refineries and a renewable fuels segment. The renewable fuels group consists of two renewable diesel facilities and 12 ethanol plants.When I look at Valero's , I see a lot of discussion points regarding their renewable diesel technology, the Green Diamond Diesel brand, and ethanol production. These could easily be dismissed as admirable endeavors with minimal  possibly negative  economic value. As with any renewable initiative in an investing format, the measuring stick will always be how much 'green' it can generate and how do these assets stack up against traditional refineries.Below you will find Valero's Q2 10-K report. You can see that after impressive growth from 2022's numbers, the renewable diesel and ethanol groups accounts for 12  of the companies operating income, up from approximately 5  in 2022. While not an overwhelming number, it is certainly a contributing factor to the company's bottom line.In my opinion, the VLO investor presentations do a poor job representing the renewable fuels' potential. To get our facts straight, I like to put my engineer hat on and let the numbers speak for themselves. The table below displays overall profitability for each segment Based on the above data, is it very evident that the renewable fuels fetch a considerable premium compared to conventional refining, although at much smaller volumes. Before we jump on the renewable bandwagon, we need to understand how renewables are incentivized and what risks are involved.Diamond Green Diesel is VLO's brand for renewable diesel. In the 4th quarter of 2022, VLO completed its third DGD unit at Port Arthur. The premium generated by this product results from the multiple credit sources the government has established to spur its production. As shown below the price of RINs, LCFS credits, and BTC credits all play into the margin generated by DGD.It is important to note that currently LCFS credits are only offered in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington and thus the addressable market is relatively small. The pricing mechanism for these credits is affected by the number of 'credits' produced by low carbon sources and the number of credits 'consumed'  i.e. penalized  by high carbon sources. Therefore, this pricing mechanism could deteriorate as more renewable projects come online and replace high carbon fuel sources.More detail can be found at the The remaining price mechanisms for renewable diesel are the  and the   BTC . Both of these programs are administered at the federal government level. Similar to LCFS credits, RIN credits fluctuate based on supply and demand that is created by government established criteria.From the graph below  right side  you can see that the entire monetary value of renewable diesel is based purely on government subsidies with the feedstock costs significantly exceeding the selling price of the basic diesel commodity  Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel or ULSD . Ultimately, dollars are dollars so I choose not to judge the source. It is important however, to understand the origination of profit.The ethanol group is by far the smallest of the three segments. But Valero has big plans for the small unit, again intending to capitalize on the government's various incentive mechanisms. It intends to do this via the combination of LCFS credits and by connecting the ethanol plants to a CO2 sequestration pipeline.VLO plans to connect eight of its 12 ethanol plants to a common pipeline to support CO2 capture. This entitles the company to the  invoked by the Biden administration. The 45Q tax credit is expected to contribute an additional  0.25 per gallon uplift when the pipeline enters service in late 2024. This credit, combined with the LCFS credits pose to significantly boost the profitability of the ethanol group by roughly  100 to  300 million on a quarterly basis.Given all the above data there is certainly opportunity for Valero to continue to boost overall profitability based on various government incentives. However, given the general size of both the DGD and ethanol segments, this most likely will not be sufficient to sustain the company's current performance should crack spreads decline as we enter 2024.Therefore, I believe VLO will face downward pressure in the medium term. This is based on two assumptions.1. Additional renewable projects come online that reduce the value of government incentives. RBN Energy has a very detailed discussion of this risk in its series, .2. The gradual adoption of electric vehicles will erode demand  or at least hamper meaningful growth  for conventional transportation fuels. This will gradually reduce crack spreads over time. I don't believe the pace of the EV transition will be sufficient enough to pose any near term risk. I view this transition as gradual, becoming more impactful over the course of a decade.PSX has a slightly smaller capacity and retail presence than VLO, coming in at just shy of 2 billion BPD refining capacity with around 2,500 gas stations. What I like about PSX is its diversification and not relying solely on refining. In the chart below you can see that refining only accounts for about 50  of its income. The remainder is spread amongst its midstream segment, marketing, and chemical businesses.Globally, the transition to cleaner burning fuels centers around the use of natural gas  methane  and or similar natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, and ethane. Europe and Asia are consuming these fuels at an accelerating rate, with a large percentage of it being sourced from the United States. This is where PSX's midstream business shines.PSX recently completed the transaction to boost its  in DCP midstream to 86.8  at the end of Q2 of this year. Following the DCP acquisition, the company owns or operates 72,000 miles of pipeline to transport products such as crude oil, refined products, NGLs, or Natural Gas to its export terminals. This allows the company to extract profits at every phase of the value chain from the wellhead to the docks, making it ideal for energy producers to transport using the PSX system.I am extremely bullish on LNG and NGL exports beginning to ramp significantly over the next 12-18 months.  for liquefied natural gas is expected to come online by the end of 2024 with additional projects still in the pipeline. This initial wave of projects accounts for nearly a 75  increase in US exports.Increased demand for midstream services will allow for margin expansion. This will enable PSX to have a thriving secondary business that provides solid and dependable cash flows. More importantly, since midstream businesses are generally fee based with only slight commodity exposure, they can hedge against declining refining margins.In the first quarter of 2024, PSX is expected to start up the Rodeo Renewed unit which is a conversion of the original refinery into a renewable diesel unit. As mentioned earlier, in the current market this carries significant potential for high margin production. PSX targets an annual EBITDA of  700 million from this project once it is operational.This project will be important for PSX to meet its stated projection to return  4.5 billion to  6.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024. , I showed that even taking conservative numbers for the Rodeo Renewed project and factoring in a 40  decline in refining margins, PSX should still be able to beat the high end of their return package guidance.PSX has overall less exposed to pure refinery risks than VLO. This is mostly attributed to the presences of its midstream business in DCP which provides a powerful diversification tool.Additionally, PSX is on track to complete an extremely large renewable diesel project in Rodeo Renewed. As mentioned earlier this has the potential for very high margins in the near term. As with VLO, I do feel the renewable diesel industry may see margin contraction due new supplies coming online.Another important comparison point would be the overall health of each company's balance sheet. The table below shows a stark difference in debt cash profiles between the two.PSX clearly will have some debt obligations to tend to over the next several years that could rob meaningful cashflow unless refinanced out into the future. Conversely, VLO is sitting in a very solid position, with more than enough cash on hand to meet all debt obligations for the next three years with ease. VLO certainly has the edge in this regard.Source  VLO PSX Quarterly and Annual 10-K reportsObviously, the common risk to both of these companies is declining crack spreads. With several incremental projects coming online in the next several quarters it is possible crack spreads drop in response to the supply increase. In this scenario, the overall profitability of both companies would drop back to more historical levels.I believe PSX's current business structure helps preclude much of this risk by having alternative forms of income from its midstream business that is inherently stable. Further, the midstream business focuses on natural gas resources that is in high demand around the globe. This attribute is key to my thesis that PSX is a more stable long term investment than VLO.A secondary risk to both companies is declining government incentives to produce renewable diesel as several new projects come online. A reduction in incentives will clearly impact these high margin products as they are not economically viable without this aid due to high feedstock costs. Due to the relatively small volumes of renewable diesel, neither company has sufficient exposure at this time to dramatically alter the course of the business. However, any anticipated growth aspects would be muted in this scenario.In this article, we reviewed the operational differences between VLO and PSX. Despite both being large scale refiners, their business structure is significantly different with VLO almost entirely focused on refining and PSX diversified with midstream, and chemical segments. However, VLO does have an upper hand in its balance sheet and near term debt requirements.The BoA thesis surely has merit, but is more applicable to VLO than PSX due to the latter's diversification from refining. This diversification provides for a safety net should crack spreads drop over the medium to long term. I therefore, in spite of the comparably inferior balance sheet, find PSX to be a more desirable long term investment than VLO. Further, PSX should have sufficient cash flows to manage its near term debt obligations. I previously included PSX in my  for a look into how I view its purpose in a dividend portfolio.

Move over Federal Reserve. Investors eye refunding at U.S. Treasury,"This week's FOMC announcement on interest rates would typically be the big-name event for investors, but not this time around. While a Fed hike in December is up for debate, no one expects the central bank to raise rates this week, especially given recent To satisfy the federal government's borrowing needs, the U.S. Treasury Department sells many types of bonds that span popular 2-year , 10-year  and 30-year  securities, floating-rate notes, inflation-linked bonds and other types of debt with differing maturities. Every quarter, the Treasury details its menu of debt that it plans on issuing, in what is known as its  quarterly refunding  statement. Investors have recently taken a renewed interest in the announcement, given the volatility in the Treasury market and what it means for other sectors of investment and the broader economy.Heavy borrowing by the Treasury has been a big factor behind the recent run-up in long-term yields, which last week hit  since the financial crisis in 2007. Other types of spending and tax-revenue shortfalls have also added to the national debt, which doubled in the fiscal year through September and now stands at nearly  34T. The Fed's most aggressive tightening of monetary policy in decades has prompted further worries over the amount of borrowing, with Fitch  the U.S. of its AAA sovereign rating before the last Treasury refunding announcement in August, citing factors like an expected fiscal deterioration and growing debt burden.

Safe Bulkers: A Dry Bulk Shipping Value Opportunity,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Christos Kolorizos as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Safe Bulkers, Inc.  presents a compelling investment proposition, currently trading at a substantial 38  discount to its target price and 24  below its recent 52-week high. Notably, its P E and P NAV ratios significantly outshine those of industry peers. My Buy recommendation is underpinned by the company's robust financial health and enticing valuation. This opportunity is nothing short of substantial for value-minded investors seeking exceptional potential. I recommend considering an investment in Safe Bulkers for the long term, as the stock boasts remarkable prospects for significant gains.Safe Bulkers is a global dry bulk shipping company that specializes in the transportation of bulk cargoes, including grain, iron ore, and coal. The company maintains a fleet comprising Panamax, Kamsarmax, Post-Panamax, and Capesize class vessels. It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  under the ticker symbol  SE , and its corporate headquarters are located in Greece.The company currently operates a fleet of 45 dry bulk vessels with an average age of 10.6 years, including Capesize, Post-Panamax, Panamax, and Kamsarmax vessels. Given that the global dry bulk fleet age averages approximately 11 years, the company is in a favorable position. Additionally, the company plans to expand its fleet by adding five more Kamsarmax vessels by 2025. On October 6, 2023, the company announced that it had entered into contracts to acquire two dual-fuel Kamsarmax vessels, set to be delivered in 2027. These new vessels have been designed to meet EEDI requirements. The company's robust newbuilding program for fleet renewal has already delivered 12 new vessels since 2019, firmly establishing the company as a modern and forward-looking player in the dry bulk industry.According to BIMCO's  report, it is anticipated that global dry bulk cargo volume will expand by 1.5  to 2.5  in 2023 and by 1  to 2  in 2024. The expected increase in average haul for 2023, ranging from 0.5  to 1.5 , is primarily driven by sanctions on Russian coal and increased shipments of iron ore and grain from Brazil.In October, the International Monetary Fund  IMF  , forecasting a 3  growth rate for the global economy in both 2023 and 2024. While this marks a slight improvement from their previous forecast, it remains notably below the average annual growth rate of 3.7  witnessed throughout the 2010s. I would argue that the prevalent issue of inflation persists as a significant concern in several economies, necessitating central banks to undertake interest rate increases, a measure that has the potential to impede economic growth.The IMF has projected that China's GDP will experience growth rates of 5.2  in 2023 and 4.5  in 2024, surpassing the Chinese government's target of 5  for 2023. Nevertheless, since June, there has been a noticeable deterioration in China's economic conditions, leading to apprehensions. In response, several banks have revised their forecasts downward, with Barclays, in particular, , falling below the government's target.Global iron ore shipments are expected to grow by 2.5  to 3.5  in 2023 and 1  to 2  in 2024. In China, steel production has risen by 3.5  this year, driven by higher steel exports, leading to a slight buildup in steel inventories. However, weak domestic steel demand due to a decline in new real estate projects could further decrease demand in the remainder of 2023 and 2024. Chinese iron ore imports have exceeded steel production, with imports growing by 6.9  between January and July, potentially leading to some inventory rebuilding in China. Excluding China, global steel production fell by 3.3  between January and July, impacting iron ore shipments due to lower import demand from China and competition from Chinese steel exports. Additionally, steel production in regions like Japan, South Korea, and Europe faced challenges, including high energy prices and low domestic demand.China is one of the main drivers of the dry bulk market. As , Chinese stocks rose a report on October 11 that a . I think this will give the push needed for the country's construction industry, which is a positive sign for the dry bulk sector.As per the International Energy Agency's assessment, there is a potential for global coal demand to experience a 0.4  increase in 2023, reaching an all-time high, followed by a slight decrease of 0.1  in 2024. There is also a potential for continued growth in China's coal imports in 2024, driven by the cost advantage of imported coal over domestically mined sources. Furthermore, should India effectively enhance its domestic coal production, this has the potential to expedite the decline in global coal shipments during the same year.The anticipated expansion of the dry bulk fleet is forecast to be 2.8  in 2023 and 2.1  in 2024. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that supply growth may remain constrained at a range of 1-2  during both 2023 and 2024, primarily attributed to reduced sailing speeds. Due to this, fleet productivity is expected to decline by 1-2  in 2023 and 0.5-1.5  in 2024. I believe the dry bulk shipping market outlook for 2023-24 is mixed, with demand expected to grow slightly but supply also forecast to increase, albeit at a slower pace. This suggests a slight tightening of the supply demand balance, but I am concerned that a probable low-demand scenario could lead to a weakening of the equilibrium.Average dry bulk freight rates have been on the decline since the second half of 2022. In August, the Capesize segment was the only category to witness an improvement in freight rates compared to the previous year. This improvement was driven by increased volumes and average hauls in iron ore and bauxite shipments, as well as a modest 2.2  year-on-year growth in the Capesize fleet. In contrast, all other smaller segments saw rate reductions due to decreased grain volumes, limited growth in minor bulk volumes, and an average 3.5  year-on-year expansion of the fleet. Reduced growth in iron ore shipments and declining coal volumes are anticipated, which may negatively affect the shipping sector.With China being one of the main markets of the dry bulk segment, its recent slowdown has raised concerns for me. However, I am cautiously optimistic that the Chinese government's new stimulus package could boost demand for construction materials and support the dry bulk sector. Overall, I believe that the dry bulk shipping market is likely to remain challenging in 2023-24, but I see some positive signs, such as the Chinese government's new stimulus package and strong coal demand. In 2024, from my perspective, the freight rates may either hold at similar to 2023 levels, based on the supply demand balance.In the , the company experienced a 19  drop in revenues compared to the previous year. This decline was attributed to 30  lower time-charter equivalent rates and a larger number of vessels exposed to the spot market. EBITDA decreased by 38  and Net Income declined from  87 million in 2022 to  35 million in 2023. These results were primarily due to increased financing expenses resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in operating expenses due to inflation. Over the last 5 years, the company has also been steadily reducing its leverage, which currently stands at 60  based on the latest financial statements. Furthermore, the company's Net Asset Value  NAV  has been consistently increasing at an annual rate of approximately 10  over the past 5 years.Safe Bulkers is well-positioned to benefit from current market conditions. Although I do not expect to see a significant improvement in the market, as indicated in the analysis above, the stock still holds strong upside potential. In 2024, only 24  of the total fleet will be under contract, leaving the remaining 76  to be deployed on the spot market. In my view, earnings for 2023 are anticipated to be lower than those in 2022 due to lower spot rates and increased market exposure as a substantial portion of the fleet's time charters expire in September. However, in the short term, the  since the end of August. However, this increase is primarily supported by the , an expected cyclical upside for the Capesize segment, which has risen from below 1,000 points to above 3,000.Key Assumptions and Valuation Methodology  as of the valuation date, October 9, 2023  Enterprise Value  EV  is determined through a combination of the Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  method, Net Asset Value  NAV  analysis, and Market Multiples. These three methods are weighted at 60 , 20 , and 20 , respectively. The terminal value is calculated as the average between the EV EBITDA multiple and the Discounted Terminal Value, which is based on a 1  perpetuity growth rate. The Weighted Average Cost of Capital  WACC  is computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM , resulting in an average WACC of 11 .Market Multiples  The market multiples used for the valuation are drawn from comparable shipping companies that exclusively operate in the dry bulk sector.Cash Flow Projections  The valuation accounts for all cash flows until September 2028. In calculating revenue, two distinct periods are considered. Firstly, for the remaining months of 2023, current spot rates are used for uncontracted vessels. Secondly, for 2024 and beyond, freight rates are calculated based on the five and ten-year average 1-year Time Charter  TC  rates for each vessel type, amounting to approximately  16,000 per day, depending on vessel size. For any loans maturing before the end of the evaluation period, it is assumed that they will be refinanced at prevailing rates.The company demonstrates significant potential for an upward trajectory, with an estimated upside of 38  from the current share price. The rates used for the projection are slightly below the company's last reported average rates, as the revenue projections are based on the 10-year historical average.The current P E and P NAV ratios are 37  and 29  lower than the market average, respectively, when compared to peer dry bulk companies. This fact lends support to my  BUY  recommendation.I have examined and presented below various sensitivities of the stock price both on WACC and on the projected Charter Rates. Before investing in the company, please consider the followingValuation  I have employed my own assumptions for calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital  WACC . The addition of a  3  equity premium is a reflection of my personal judgment. It's important to note that the weighting of the methods used to calculate the Enterprise Value  EV  may vary. The historical rates used were obtained from . In addition, I sourced certain financial data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Wall Street Journal and Infront-Analytics.Shipping Sector Cyclicality  The shipping industry is subject to cyclical patterns, marked by periods of prosperity and decline. These cycles are influenced by the volatile nature of shipping rates, which are shaped by shifts in supply and demand. Significant drops in shipping rates can negatively impact Safe Bulkers' profitability. The market outlook considered in this analysis is based on BIMCO's Dry Bulk Outlook Report.Market Risk  Like any stock, Safe Bulkers is exposed to global market risk inherent in the equity market.Safe Bulkers is a compelling value play within the dynamic dry bulk shipping sector, offering not just potential, but a clear path to significant upside. The company's combination of a formidable fleet, positive earnings outlook, and an enticing valuation make it an attractive proposition, particularly for value-focused investors seeking long-term rewards.From my vantage point, what sets Safe Bulkers apart is its commitment to a modern fleet and a forward-looking newbuilding program, strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the forthcoming improvements in the supply demand balance across the dry bulk sector, extending until the end of 2024. Furthermore, the fact that Safe Bulkers is currently trading at a discounted valuation relative to its peers sweetens the deal, presenting an attractive entry point for astute investors.

Uber: Profitable For Now,"Uber's  business has finally achieved profitability, on the back of higher margin advertising revenue and a more favorable competitive environment. While the cost discipline demonstrated by the company in recent years is admirable, Uber must find avenues to support growthUber is currently facing a highly variable demand environment, with post-pandemic normalization leading to increased demand for mobility services, partially offset by a softening of demand for delivery. In addition, freight markets have been weak due to a decline in consumer spending on products and a supply chain bullwhip effect. Some of this demand variability should begin to even out in coming quarters, leading to a further moderation in headline growth.From a competition perspective, Uber's main markets continue to be dominated by two players, although competition appears to be easing. The rapid shift in interest rate environment over the past 18 months is likely at least partly responsible for the improvement in profitability in ride sharing. The increase in the cost of capital has caused ridesharing companies to pull back on spending.Lyft was not competitive on pricing, but this has changed over the past 12 months. Uber now believes that its pricing is generally comparable to Lyft's. Despite this, Uber's share of gross bookings continues to be at or .Much of Uber's current efforts are focused on providing a greater range of services so that it can maximize revenue and profits. For exampleThis portfolio of products is currently at an  gross bookings run rate and is growing over 80  YoY. Uber also offers a range of service levels that help with price discrimination, like Uber Black and Uber Comfort. Offering a range of products across price points should help to drive growth and profitability, albeit at the expense of consumer surplus.Uber's new products are also extending the company from its traditional ridesharing background into more general transportation services. Uber now offers high-capacity vehicles at a low price point through its Uber Shuttle service. These vehicles that can support  at a time, running on fixed routes and timings across several cities in India, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt. In the UK, Uber recently added the ability to book .Uber's growth is also being supported by a number of international markets  Germany, Spain, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Argentina, amongst others  which are providing high growth, with Uber referencing a pool of bookings worth around  growing over 100  YoY.Membership is another focus area for Uber as it promises to reduce churn and increase user spending. While this may be a near term headwind for the business, increasing user LTV CAC ratios will be critical driver of improved profitability in the long run. Uber One members are profitable, but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members. This is offset by the fact that  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50  greater than non-member retention. Uber currently has something like , with membership numbers doubling YoY, and around 25  of the company's gross bookings come from memberships. Uber is also trying to upsell monthly members to an annual membership.Advertising is another important area of Uber's business, as it provides an incremental source of growth and has high margins. Uber's advertising business currently has an annual run rate of over , with a 1 billion USD target for 2024. This appears to be a solid revenue stream as well, with Uber suggesting a return on ad spend in the 7-9x range. Most of the advertisers on the platform are SMBs, although Uber is trying to increase penetration amongst CPG companies, enterprise customers and companies like Apple. The economics of this business are not really known at the moment, and Uber is likely investing fairly heavily in attracting advertisers and developing its ad product, but it seems likely that growth of the advertising business is in large part responsible for Uber's transition to profitability.With its recent transition to profitability, Uber is having its moment in the sun, but investors should not forget that the transportation, delivery and freight markets are likely to face a serious shakeup over the next decade, with the rollout of autonomous vehicles gaining steam. It should also be noted that Uber's revenue likely follows a power law distribution across cities, meaning that only a relatively small number of important locations need to be disrupted by robotaxis for Uber's business to begin to struggle.AVs could lead to more riders, as it will lower mobility costs, but depending on how the market evolves, it could increase competition or result in Uber being disintermediated completely. Uber has partnered with Waymo, amongst other companies, and believes that it can be a routing layer between supply and demand, allocating demand to autonomous partners when it makes sense. This vision will likely require that the supply of robotaxis is fairly diffuse, with a number of competing service providers. If there are only 1-2 service providers, Uber is likely to be disintermediated. At this stage, it seems prudent to assume that AVs will be a fairly concentrated market. The technology is complex and the heavy reliance on data creates global economies of scale. There are also likely to be significant economies of scale involved in building and maintaining a fleet of vehicles, which supports the development of a concentrated market.The robotaxi threat is likely to take time to play out though, due to the complexities involved in developing the technology, regulatory uncertainty and safety concerns. Despite this, progress is being made, and appears to have accelerated in the last 1-2 years.  its fully autonomous taxi service city-wide in San Francisco, after being spun out from Alphabet in 2016 and initially offering services in a public trial in Phoenix in 2017. Waymo and Cruise both recently received approval from California's Public Utilities Commission to charge riders for autonomous rides without a safety driver, day and night. Cruise has announced testing in 14 new cities and is targeting 1 billion USD revenue in 2025. Seattle, San Diego, Miami, Nashville, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. Dallas and Houston are .A wider spread rollout of robotaxis is an interesting development, as it will provide a greater volume and variety of data, which should lead to improved performance. Commercialization also provides cash flow, which will help to support the development of businesses that have so far been a black hole for cash. For example, Waymo reportedly spent at least  on autonomous vehicle development between 2009 and 2015. This could also represent an inflection point in the market, as Cruise's CEO has suggested that the underlying technology is now adapting relatively quickly to new environments.It is also a risky period though, as the proliferation of robotaxis is raising awareness of both the pros and cons of the technology. If large scale data demonstrates adequate performance, the regulatory environment is likely to become more favorable. A wide-spread rollout could also lead to coordinated action on regulations. High profile incidents that anger the broader population have the potential to set the technology back though.A  of Waymo's autonomous vehicles led by Swiss Re suggested that they are safer than human-driven vehicles, supporting broader adoption of the technology. Based on over 3.8 million miles driven by Waymo without a human behind the wheel, there were zero bodily injury claims and a significant reduction in the frequency of property damage claims. Swiss Re believes that the results are highly significant but given a human driver baseline of 1.11 bodily injury claims per million miles, more data may be needed to be sure. In addition, it is likely extremely difficult to compile data for humans and robotaxis where the vehicles face similar risk environments, adding to uncertainty in any analysis.While the technology is improving, it has not all been smooth sailing for autonomous vehicles in recent years, with Cruise facing the ire of protestors, as well as scrutiny from incidents with pedestrians and emergency vehicles.  its Via self-driving truck ambitions, although the reason for this is unknown. A number of employees have been laid off and the timeline for commercialization has been pushed back. Waymo plans to continue working with Daimler on a driverless truck though.After a period of distortion caused by the pandemic, Uber's growth is rapidly approaching the single-digit level. Revenue increased roughly 14  YoY in the second quarter, down from approximately 29  in the first quarter. Between pricing, frequency and users Uber believes it can maintain double-digit growth though.Uber has stated that drivers are currently the . As a result, the company is trying to add more drivers and improve retention and engagement. Uber believes that labor environment is now looser than it has been, with around 70  of drivers stating that they're using Uber due to inflationary pressures.User growth is rapidly returning to its pre-COVID trend, with no real sign of a slowdown in sight. In Uber's developed markets, less than  aged over 18 have ever used Uber, potentially providing a significant growth runway.Average frequency is still down from pre-COVID levels, but it is difficult to know whether this is just due to a shift in the user base. Spend per trip is up significantly, which more than offsets the lower frequency.Take rates are up, although Uber's Mobility take rate is elevated by the UK merchant model, with the company stating that the underlying take rate in the , driven lower by supply investments in international markets like LatAm and APAC.Uber's profitability has been improving rapidly in recent periods, with the company having a . The improvement in profitability is being driven by a shift in revenue mix, operational efficiency and operating cost control.For example, algorithmic improvements have led to something like a  over the last year. The rapid growth of Uber's advertising business has also been a significant margin tailwind. Some of these improvements have been offset by weakness in freight and shipping markets though. Insurance costs are also significant for Uber and have been rising sharply. In response, Uber has  in certain markets. The merit of an investment in Uber at this point is heavily dependent on how much the company can increase its profit margins, and whether robotaxis begins to negatively impact the business at some point. If Uber can eventually raise its profit margins to the mid-teens, it would be fairly attractively priced at the moment. I think there is a high probability that a strong drive for margins will eventually result in consumer pushback or increased competition though.I also feel that over a 5-10 year timeframe there is a reasonable probability of autonomous vehicles beginning to negatively impact Uber's business, making an investment in Uber a high-risk proposition. While this view has a high chance of being wrong, I don't believe the stock offers sufficient upside to warrant an investment.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

OPEC Upate October 2023 And EIA International Energy Outlook 2023,"The   MOMR  for October 2023 was published recently. The last month reported in most of the OPEC charts that follow is September 2023 and output reported for OPEC nationsThe IEO reference scenario has a sharp drop in OPEC output of 5.5 Mb d from 2024 to 2026, an alternative scenario  OPEC-DC est  is presented which will be discussed after the OPEC part of the post.OPEC crude output was revised higher in August 2023 by 33 kb d compared to last month s report and July 2023 OPEC crude output was revised higher by 22 kb d. When the World was at its CTMA peak for C C output in 2018, OPEC crude output was about 31300 kb d and by September 2023 OPEC crude output had fallen to roughly 3545 kb d below the CTMA peak in 2018.Preliminary data indicates that global liquids production in September was 0.1 Mb d less than last month and averaged 100.6 Mb d. World liquids output increased about 2.9 Mb d in the past 23 months  from 97.7 Mb d in October 2021 .Preliminary August 2023 data sees total OECD commercial oil stocks down m-o-m by 11 Mb. At 2803 Mb, they were 82 Mb higher than the same time one year ago, but 117 Mb lower than the latest five-year average and 182 Mb below the 2015 2019 average. As World Oil stocks continue to fall the risk of an oil price spike will increase.There was a significant draw on World oil stocks in 2023Q3 of about 133 Mb, if OPEC estimates of World Supply and Demand for Oil are correct. A continuation of OPEC cuts in 2023Q4 could lead to another 300 Mb of stock draw if OPEC estimates for oil supply and demand are correct in 2023Q4.Now a quick discussion of the EIA s IEO 2023. The IEO reference scenario for World C C output has a sharp drop in crude output from 2024 to 2026 of about 3.3 Mb d, but this is not reflected in their estimates for demand for the main liquid fuels  gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and residual fuel . From 2021 to 2022 the ratio of these 4 liquid fuels in barrels of oil equivalent to C C produced was about 89 , but the ratio jumps sharply from 2024 to 2026 as shown in the chart below to over 93 .My alternative scenario  DC scen  for World C C assumes the ratio of liquid transport fuel to C C production rises gradually from 89  in 2022 to 91  in 2031 and then remains at that level until 2035 and assumes the quantity of liquids fuel demand is unchanged. My expectation is that after 2030 the demand for transportation fuel is likely to be lower than the EIA reference scenario, but I did not add that assumption to the DC scenario presented below. The OPEC-DC est presented in the second chart of the post simply subtracts the EIA s IEO reference scenario for non-OPEC C C output from the World C C- DC scen presented in the chart below. I also expect that non-OPEC output may be slightly lower than the EIA has published in the IEO 2023 reference scenario and that OPEC C C output will likely need to be about 30to 31 Mb d from 2025 to 2030 in order for World C C to match the DC scenario in the chart below.

Why Lithium Stocks Are Falling,"It has been a difficult year for lithium producers. Heck, it has been a difficult six months, with the past month tumbling most noticeably.WhyAs I wrote on aNew entrants and old have been plunging headlong into developing more sources of lithium around the world. At the same time, this new supply is coming online   1  Chinese auto sales have declined since the government removed the juiciest of subsidies  and  2  EV sales in Europe and the U.S. have been held back because of semiconductor shortages.  On a larger level, China ended almost all subsidies and tax breaks for green energy, which triggered an across-the-board selloff inMore supply   less demand   falling prices for lithium.As of today, here is the decline in lithium, with this month being either the beginning of the end for lithium or somewhere close to the panic point from which it is more likely to recoverIt isn t just lithium prices, though lithium is the poster child for the Battery Revolution. Any minor glitch in electric vehicle  EV  sales tends to create panic in the streets. For instance, EV charging equipment provider Beam Global  reported better-than-expected  recently. Sales came in at  17.8 million, up about 380  year-over-year. BEEM is still a micro-cap company, but it seems to be on the right track. Yet the stock opened the next day at  10.20 and closed at  9.05.General Motors  sales of EVs fell in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The first quarter marked the end of certain U.S. subsidies. Ford  recently reduced some of its growth expectations for EVs. This is the type of news that makes skittish people think,  The sky is falling  The sky is falling  No, it isn t.One 12-week period is not indicative of future sales. And this interruption in demand does not mean there is likely to be any pause in seeking new sources of lithium. There will be new technologies that make it more efficient, however.The first step in making Li-Ion batteries is getting the lithium. Lithium is extracted from three different venues  brines, pegmatites, and sedimentary rocks. How the lithium is extracted means very different project requirements, extraction methods, governmental regulation, environmental considerations, and processing times.Historically, lithium extraction from brine sources has been more economical than production from pegmatite or sedimentary sources. Living in Nevada, I am geographically close to the action in that Tesla s  gigafactory is just down the road from me, and Albemarle s  Silver Peak mine  the only producing lithium brine operation in the U.S.  is only a few hours away. Often, our local news will pick up a story well before the rest of the nation sees it. Such was the case for my earliest purchases of Lithium Americas .We do not know how much more lithium may be found in the USA   once upon a time, America produced the most of any nation. Those days are long gone, however. Now, most of the brine-evaporation sources of lithium are in different desert areas with dependable solar evaporation.These basins are called salt lakes, salt flats, or salars. Lithium  brine  deposits represent about two-thirds of worldwide lithium resources. The best known are found in the salt flats of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.Even though most of these reserve deposits are found in The Lithium Triangle of these three nations, Australia is the world s largest lithium producer in total output, with much of it coming from the Greenbushes hard-rock lithium operation. More on that later.Among many other lithium producers, I own shares of Livent , which produces lithium carbonate from a world-class lithium brine deposit in Argentina  the Salar del Hombre Muerto. Allkem , an Australian lithium producer, is ramping up production at a contiguous site. These two companies are currently jumping through various regulatory hoops to be able to merge their assets, making it an even bigger factor in brine-evaporation lithium.Bolivia is likely to have the globe s biggest deposit of lithium, the Salar de Uyuni, which might contain as much as between 50 to 70 percent of  known  world reserves. But the statist government of Bolivia, for now anyway, insists on government control of all activity   and the Bolivian deposits are more costly to refine and have a much lower evaporation rate, anyway.Geothermal lithium brine deposits have been much in the news lately. Lithium has been found in Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland as super-hot saline is spewed from geothermal sites. In this stew are also found good quantities of potassium, boron, lithium, and other elements.I have a personal connection here, as well, albeit from a more distant time. Back in the mists of antiquity, I was working my way through UCLA with a dozen or so different jobs. One of these was selling lots on the shores of California s Salton Sea. It never became the next Palm Springs  just up the road a piece , but I thought it had potential, so I scraped up the then-massive chunk of money --  1,000 -- to buy a 2.5-acre lot there.I would have done better placing my money in a 2  savings account and compounding it over the intervening period, but at least it has kept me interested in the goings-on down there. There is already significant work being done. The Hell s Kitchen lithium and power project looks to have an estimated 30-year life with a total lithium resource capacity of 300,000 metric tons -- MT -- per year of lithium carbonate equivalent. We ll see.Lithium brine deposits can also be found in some deep oil reservoirs in North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and East Texas. In fact, Standard Lithium  claims to hold a property  and a unique process  on the U.S. gulf coast containing more than 4 million MT of lithium carbonate equivalent resources.I find this interesting because the oil   gas drillers have significant seismic and 4D technologies already in place, -- as well as deep pockets. Is it possible we will one day get our lithium from these energy companies, as wellPegmatite is a coarse-grained igneous rock that is formed from crystallized magma. Pegmatite lithium deposits  also known as  hard-rock  lithium deposits,  often contain extractable amounts of not just lithium, but also tin, tantalum, and niobium. We most often find the most lithium where mineral spodumene dominates.Australia produces the most lithium from pegmatite deposits of any country. Australian lithium production is on fire, with numerous global mining companies elbowing for position. Canada, the US, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and even nations we do not think of as producing lithium, like Finland and Ireland, hold financially viable pegmatite lithium deposits.Hard-rock ore that contains lithium is extracted at open-pit or underground mines using conventional mining techniques. The ore is then processed and concentrated in a number of different ways to produce lithium and its compounds. This kind of mining is more expensive than using evaporative techniques like brine deposits. The good news is that hard-rock lithium deposits have higher lithium concentrations than brines, making them still economically viable. Also, producing tin, tantalum, niobium, and more can help offset costs.Sedimentary deposits account for a growing piece of the lithium pie. These are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites.  Lacustrine  just means that these are sedimentary rock formations that formed at the bottom of ancient lakes.In clay deposits, lithium is typically found in hectorite, which is rich in lithium, but also in magnesium.  The name hectorite comes from a deposit first discovered in Hector, California.Many companies are in the research and development phase for their clay deposits, but no companies currently produce meaningful lithium from them.The most commonly known form of lithium-containing lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia. This deposit is owned by another company in my portfolio, one which is not often thought of as a lithium producer  Rio Tinto . RIO says it believes this deposit likely contains more than 200 million MT of lithium, which would make it one of the largest lithium deposits anywhere.In January 2022, after Anglo-Australian RIO had committed to pay more than  2 billion to execute the project, Serbia revoked its license. The ostensible reason was public protest over environmental concerns. It probably did not help matters that Australia deported Serbia s favorite son and tennis star Novak Djokovic for failing to comply with Australia s Covid-19 protocols. We shall see if one day royalties to Serbia become more important than other issues.Another example of sedimentary deposits is, yes, yet another of my  future energy  holdings, Lithium Americas. I have written early and often about the trials and tribulations of trying to extract lithium in this litigious United States of America. I first followed LAC as I read reports of the numerous lawsuits to protect  the environment  in my local newspapers.  The Lithium Americas site, Thacker Pass, is a couple of hours northeast of Reno, my nearest airport gateway.I find it curious that the voices most demeaning of nature s batteries  fossil fuels  who demand that we replace these forms of energy immediately with  green  sources are also the loudest in protesting our best opportunity to do so. LAC was sued in court by various First Nation tribes, by farmers and ranchers, and by all manner of organizers and followers from outside the area. These lawsuits went on for years.If we want green energy, we must understand that lithium does not grow on trees, that the sun does not shine 24 7, and that wind turbines are composed of all sorts of metals and materials that must be dug from the ground then, at the end of their useful life, disposed of by returning much of the dangerous materials with which they are built into the earth and atmosphere. TINSTAAFL.Possibly  bringing closure to this farce is the decision just this week between LAC, General Motors, which has agreed to off-take some  600 million of LAC production, Bechtel Construction, and North America s Building Trades Unions for the Thacker Pass project, which will now hopefully tap into the largest deposit of lithium in North America.If you ask me what lithium prices, and thus lithium companies, will do this week or this month, I haven t a clue. Since China removed incentives to buy electric, EV sales there are down. That says there is less demand, so prices may stay depressed. On the other hand, if governments or regulators or protesters dead set against disturbing Mother Earth -- from Serbia to Bolivia to the USA   prevent adequate supply, while demand increases, then the shares of lithium producers will rise again.I cannot say that a rebound will be immediate. I do believe the tale of Lithium Americas, having exhausted all opposition all the way to the 9 Circuit Court   yes, the 9 Circuit    may create enough precedent that other firms might not face the same uphill battle.I don t know exactly when the supply demand balance will create the momentum to resurrect these companies  share prices. But I am 100  certain that the balance will shift. When it does, earnings will increase or explode. When that happens the same people now selling  because they are going down  will be anxious to buy  because they are going up.I prefer to eliminate those middle steps. I own and am continuing to add to my holdings in the very best lithium producers. If you want some history, there are scores of articles written on SA about these firms. You will also find a half dozen or so that I have written, detailing in greater depth my belief in every one of these.

I Might Double My Pioneer Natural Resources Investment - Again,"I doubt it's a surprise to any of my regular readers when I say that I've been bullish on oil for a while. In this case, I turned bullish on oil in 2020, as I expected a significant shift in supply andEssentially, my thesis has been tightening supply growth and consistent long-term demand growth. The end of the U.S. shale revolution, OPEC cutting output to protect  80 Brent, and geopolitical risks are putting a floor under oil prices.Even the mighty Permian basin in the United States, which is the only driver of unconventional oil supply growth, is now losing steam.The most recent report showed that declines in legacy production are now more than offsetting production gains from new wells - natural gas remains in an uptrend.If we get peak productionThis is what long-term oil demand might look likeTo prepare for such a scenario, I have bought 19  energy exposure, which I expect to increase even further.I'm not rooting for elevated inflation. I just want to be prepared. After all, if I'm right, we could see a development that is negative for the market, in general. This would also apply to a lot of my other holdings.The chart below reinforces my view, as investments in oil supply remain well below levels that would support rising demand growth. This is inflationary, especially if demand comes roaring back.Given the shift in supply dynamics, I believe that upstream oil companies  the ones that drill for oil  are the best way to get the job done.In this case, I focus onOne company that checks all boxes is .On May 14, I wrote an  titled .That's exactly what I did, as the company now accounts for more than 5.3  of my portfolio.In this article, I went with a bullish title again, as I want to consolidate my energy holdings. I'm looking to shift some money from Chevron  into PXD purely because I prefer its aggressive shareholder distribution plans.While I haven't made a final decision on the CVX to PXD shift, I'll also deploy new capital, as I believe I need to own more oil.And what better way to buy oil than via PXDSo, let's dive into the detailsWith a  55 billion market cap, PXD is one of America's largest onshore oil producers. In the second quarter, the company produced roughly 370 thousand barrels of oil per day. It also produced 341 thousand barrels  48  of equivalent.It has a 0.5x net leverage ratio with a BBB  credit rating.The company exclusively produces its oil in the Permian basin, where it achieved industry-leading efficiency.For example, the company not only achieved higher-than-expected production in the second quarter, but it is also capable of boosting output with subdued CapEx.In the second quarter, the company raised its production guidance for the year while reducing the capital budget allocated to drilling, completions, and facilities.The oil production guidance midpoint is now 369 thousand barrels of oil per day, and the revised drilling, completions, and facilities capital budget is  125 million lower than the initial 2023 outlook.This adjustment was attributed to the efficient execution of well-productivity and operational activities by its teams, leading to a more capital-efficient program.The company's investment framework remains aligned with moderate annual production growth of up to 5 .Furthermore, the company's 2023 average well productivity significantly surpassed both 2022 and 2021 levels over the first 24 months of production.According to the company, its focus on full-stack development enhances long-term recovery and optimizes returns.Essentially, the company's substantial inventory of low-breakeven, high-margin locations positions it favorably compared to peers. With roughly 15,000 top-tier locations, Pioneer believes it is set for best-in-class development in the years to come.While it isn't visible in the chart below, the company has more than 20 years' worth of top-tier drilling, which surpasses any of its major peers.But wait, the good news continuesThe company is also getting better access to export markets for its natural gas. In the second half of this year, the company expects to sell 70  of its gas out of the basin. Next year, that number is expected to be 80 , thanks to new pipelines leading to the Houston Ship Channel.In 1Q23, the company received 19  higher prices for its gas than its peers.In general, it has much higher cash margins. In 1Q23, the company had cash margins close to  37 per barrel, exceeding any of its major peers.Thanks to these efficiencies, the company believes it can generate  27 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the next five years at  80 WTI - that's the current oil price.27 billion is 49  of its current market cap. At  100 WTI, that number rises to  40 billion  73 .I'm adding the implied free cash flow yield because the company has a very ambitious capital return plan.The company aims to distribute at least 75  of its free cash flow to shareholders through its base dividend, the variable dividend, and buybacks.At  90 WTI, the company has the potential to achieve a double-digit return yield, which would be great for income-focused investors.On a long-term basis, I expect investors to benefit from total annual dividends exceeding 10 .For the third quarter  payable on September 21 for shareholders of record on September 6 , the company is paying  1.84 per share. This consisted of a  1.25 base dividend and a variable component of  0.59.The annualized yield is 3.1 .Please note that the steep drop in its special dividend is likely temporary.Now, oil prices are much higher, and investment volumes will likely subdue.I expect the next dividend announcement to come with a much juicier special dividend.I've spent the past few years praising PXD. Hence, I'm happy that PXD is outperforming its peers.Compared to pre-pandemic levels, PXD shares have returned 67  compared to five years ago. The Energy ETF  and Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF  have returned 52  and -2 , respectively.Going back ten years, the performance is somewhat equal at 67 , caused by the poor price levels of oil and gas after the 2014 peak.Going forward, I expect PXD to continue outperforming its peers and the S P 500, as I believe in prolonged sticky inflation and the tailwinds that come with a new era for oil supply growth.Hence, I'm considering buying much more PXD, including the proceeds of my successful Chevron investments. While I believe that Chevron is one of the best-diversified energy investments, I prefer PXD because of its focus on drilling and high shareholder returns.Please note that I haven't made a final decision. I may keep CVX and boost PXD purely using new cash.Valuation-wide, I believe that PXD is undervalued. This is mainly based on my oil outlook and its potential to generate strong, double-digit free cash flow at elevated oil prices.Investors will likely recognize that and keep moving funds into the company and its peers.The current consensus price target is  257, which is 9  above the current price.On a longer-term basis, I expect PXD to move well beyond  350 if oil prices go into triple-digit territory.My bullish outlook on oil has been reaffirmed as supply dynamics shift and demand remains strong.The decline in legacy production and the end of the U.S. shale revolution are bolstering oil prices, with the Permian basin losing momentum.To capitalize on this trend, I've increased my energy exposure, favoring upstream companies with deep reserves, efficient production, and healthy balance sheets.Pioneer Natural Resources stands out as a prime candidate, boasting industry-leading efficiency and substantial low-breakeven locations.With its strategic focus on shareholder distribution and potential for substantial free cash flow, PXD aligns perfectly with my long-term vision.While I may still decide on the Chevron to PXD shift, PXD's reserves, the potential for outperformance, and special dividends make it a compelling choice in the evolving energy landscape.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

First Industrial: Buy The Dip On This Fast-Growing REIT,"There are some stocks in growth industries that one can put on the back burner, and that may be the case with First Industrial . It s been a while since I last visited the stock It appears that my bullishness around the stock has paid off, as the stock has given investors a 16.6  total return, surpassing the 10  rise in the volatile S P 500  over the same timeframe.Like most REITs, FR s stock price has fallen over the past 30  days, but has held up well on a 12-month basis with flattish performance. In this piece, I discuss why growth investors may want to consider buying the stock on the dip, so let s get startedFirst Industrial is a self-managed REIT that specializes in ownership of distribution centers and light industrial properties across the U.S., with 69 million square feet of industrial space. With an equity market cap of  6.3 billion, FR is larger than peer Terreno Realty , smaller than Rexford Industrial  and industry giant, Prologis .Like its aforementioned peers, FR targets large, supply-constrained markets with higher focus on coastal regions. As shown below, FR s properties are concentrated around 15 target metropolitan statistical areas, with a quarter of rents coming from Southern California and a fifth coming from the Northeast.Unlike other REIT classes like office properties, the industrial segment has seen strong demand and FR is no different, with occupancy sitting at a high 97.7 . Moreover, FR set a company record cash rental rate increase on new and renewal leases of 74  during the second quarter, and this contributed to a robust 11  YoY same store NOI growth.These strong trends are supported by low vacancy rate of just  across the U.S., driven by tailwinds such as e-commerce, tenant needs for supply chain diversification as a result from the pandemic, and reshoring trends of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. As shown below, FR s high occupancy is in line with that of recent years, while its cash rental rate and same store NOI have accelerated.The supply and demand imbalance is further exacerbated by the fact that many higher leveraged private market developers are priced out due to higher rates. FR is well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic with its strong balance sheet and existing property base in property-scarce markets along the coasts. As shown below, industry-wide construction starts are down 47  from the peak in the third quarter of 2022 and the number of properties in the construction pipeline  industry-wide  is shrinking.Meanwhile, FR carries a strong BBB rated balance sheet with a reasonably low debt   preferred stock to EBITDA ratio of 5.2x, sitting well below the 6.0x level generally considered safe for REITs by ratings agencies, and has a high fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.0x. This gives FR capacity to support its developments, with expected completion rates ranging from Q3 FY23 to Q3 FY24 at an attractive weighted average estimated cash yield of 7.9  across 9 development sites. As shown below, FR has plenty of development pipeline across its  land bank  in its existing portfolio, giving it plenty of runway in supply-scarce markets.While FR s 2.7  dividend yield isn t particularly high, it has grown its dividend every year over the past 5 years, with it having grown by 47  since 2018. This has been nearly in lock step with FFO share, which grew by 49  over the same timeframe. At the current annual dividend rate of  1.28, the dividend is well-protected by a 54  payout ratio, leaving plenty of retained capital as a source for internal funding.Risks to FR include the fact that the industrial segment is cyclical in nature, and a hard landing resulting in a recession would impact nearly every industry, and could suppress rent growth. In addition, while FR carries a strong balance sheet, it isn t immune to higher interest rates, which could offset some of the benefits from rental increases.Lastly, I see value in FR at the current price of  46.63 with a forward P FFO of 19.3. While FR isn t cheap, it s not expensive either, considering its moat-worthy property base with plenty of development opportunities, its strong balance sheet, and recent growth metrics. Plus, analysts estimate  annual FFO share growth over the next 3 years, and considering the above, I believe FR has the potential to trade in the 20 P FFO range, which is its normal valuation over the past decade.In conclusion, FR appears to be a strong self-managed REIT with its specialized, irreplaceable properties in supply-constrained markets along the coasts and key inland markets. I would expect for strong rent growth and occupancy trends to continue due to secular tailwinds in e-commerce, reshoring trends, the supply demand imbalance, and the company s development pipeline. As such, investors seeking quality real estate and income ought to consider FR at the current price.Gen Alpha has teamed up with to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.

It never became the next Palm Springs  just up the road a piece , but I thought it had potential, so I scraped up the then-massive chunk of money --  1,000 -- to buy a 2.5-acre lot there.I would have done better placing my money in a 2  savings account and compounding it over the intervening period, but at least it has kept me interested in the goings-on down there. There is already significant work being done. The Hell s Kitchen lithium and power project looks to have an estimated 30-year life with a total lithium resource capacity of 300,000 metric tons -- MT -- per year of lithium carbonate equivalent. We ll see.Lithium brine deposits can also be found in some deep oil reservoirs in North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and East Texas. In fact, Standard Lithium  claims to hold a property  and a unique process  on the U.S. gulf coast containing more than 4 million MT of lithium carbonate equivalent resources.I find this interesting because the oil   gas drillers have significant seismic and 4D technologies already in place, -- as well as deep pockets. Is it possible we will one day get our lithium from these energy companies, as wellPegmatite is a coarse-grained igneous rock that is formed from crystallized magma. Pegmatite lithium deposits  also known as  hard-rock  lithium deposits,  often contain extractable amounts of not just lithium, but also tin, tantalum, and niobium. We most often find the most lithium where mineral spodumene dominates.Australia produces the most lithium from pegmatite deposits of any country. Australian lithium production is on fire, with numerous global mining companies elbowing for position. Canada, the US, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and even nations we do not think of as producing lithium, like Finland and Ireland, hold financially viable pegmatite lithium deposits.Hard-rock ore that contains lithium is extracted at open-pit or underground mines using conventional mining techniques. The ore is then processed and concentrated in a number of different ways to produce lithium and its compounds. This kind of mining is more expensive than using evaporative techniques like brine deposits. The good news is that hard-rock lithium deposits have higher lithium concentrations than brines, making them still economically viable. Also, producing tin, tantalum, niobium, and more can help offset costs.Sedimentary deposits account for a growing piece of the lithium pie. These are found in clay deposits and lacustrine evaporites.  Lacustrine  just means that these are sedimentary rock formations that formed at the bottom of ancient lakes.In clay deposits, lithium is typically found in hectorite, which is rich in lithium, but also in magnesium.  The name hectorite comes from a deposit first discovered in Hector, California.Many companies are in the research and development phase for their clay deposits, but no companies currently produce meaningful lithium from them.The most commonly known form of lithium-containing lacustrine deposit is found in the Jadar Valley in Serbia. This deposit is owned by another company in my portfolio, one which is not often thought of as a lithium producer  Rio Tinto . RIO says it believes this deposit likely contains more than 200 million MT of lithium, which would make it one of the largest lithium deposits anywhere.In January 2022, after Anglo-Australian RIO had committed to pay more than  2 billion to execute the project, Serbia revoked its license. The ostensible reason was public protest over environmental concerns. It probably did not help matters that Australia deported Serbia s favorite son and tennis star Novak Djokovic for failing to comply with Australia s Covid-19 protocols. We shall see if one day royalties to Serbia become more important than other issues.Another example of sedimentary deposits is, yes, yet another of my  future energy  holdings, Lithium Americas. I have written early and often about the trials and tribulations of trying to extract lithium in this litigious United States of America. I first followed LAC as I read reports of the numerous lawsuits to protect  the environment  in my local newspapers.  The Lithium Americas site, Thacker Pass, is a couple of hours northeast of Reno, my nearest airport gateway.I find it curious that the voices most demeaning of nature s batteries  fossil fuels  who demand that we replace these forms of energy immediately with  green  sources are also the loudest in protesting our best opportunity to do so. LAC was sued in court by various First Nation tribes, by farmers and ranchers, and by all manner of organizers and followers from outside the area. These lawsuits went on for years.If we want green energy, we must understand that lithium does not grow on trees, that the sun does not shine 24 7, and that wind turbines are composed of all sorts of metals and materials that must be dug from the ground then, at the end of their useful life, disposed of by returning much of the dangerous materials with which they are built into the earth and atmosphere. TINSTAAFL.Possibly  bringing closure to this farce is the decision just this week between LAC, General Motors, which has agreed to off-take some  600 million of LAC production, Bechtel Construction, and North America s Building Trades Unions for the Thacker Pass project, which will now hopefully tap into the largest deposit of lithium in North America.If you ask me what lithium prices, and thus lithium companies, will do this week or this month, I haven t a clue. Since China removed incentives to buy electric, EV sales there are down. That says there is less demand, so prices may stay depressed. On the other hand, if governments or regulators or protesters dead set against disturbing Mother Earth -- from Serbia to Bolivia to the USA   prevent adequate supply, while demand increases, then the shares of lithium producers will rise again.I cannot say that a rebound will be immediate. I do believe the tale of Lithium Americas, having exhausted all opposition all the way to the 9 Circuit Court   yes, the 9 Circuit    may create enough precedent that other firms might not face the same uphill battle.I don t know exactly when the supply demand balance will create the momentum to resurrect these companies  share prices. But I am 100  certain that the balance will shift. When it does, earnings will increase or explode. When that happens the same people now selling  because they are going down  will be anxious to buy  because they are going up.I prefer to eliminate those middle steps. I own and am continuing to add to my holdings in the very best lithium producers. If you want some history, there are scores of articles written on SA about these firms. You will also find a half dozen or so that I have written, detailing in greater depth my belief in every one of these.

"Kinder Morgan: Higher Leverage, But Lower Profitability Vs. Its Peers","Kinder Morgan  is a well-separated midstream company with operations in several fields. Among all, natural gas is the most important element that brings opportunity for the company from the management s point of view. That is because natural gasIn my previous  on Kinder Morgan, I rated the stock as a buy, and after that, it rose by approximately 6 . In my previous update, I investigated KMI s first quarter results and mentioned that according to the higher short-term demand outlook for natural gas, Kinder Morgan has strong opportunities for higher export. In this analysis, however, aligned with the short-term outlook, I investigated the long-term outlook for LNG supply and demand. Based on theFigure 1The management noted that although they have several projects in backlog, they are sure these projects will be getting done at attractive returns, well higher than the capital spent on them. Similar to their update on the first quarter of 2023, they have targeted  3.7 billion in committed growth capital on their backlog projects. But the point is what if these projects reach lower returns than what the management expects  In that case, they may lead to higher leverage for the company and lower distributed cash flow. For example, KMI s Wabash Valley RNG projects, which are part of the Kinetrex acquisition, have been more expensive than expected.During , Kinder Morgan s distributable cash flow declined slightly by 8  and sat at  1,076 million versus  1,176 million in 2Q 2022. Moreover, KMI s dividend yield is in the top 10-yield in the S P 500, which is an attractive element of the company. Meanwhile, the company s net debt amount is at a high level of  31.7 billion in 2Q 2023, which was almost constant with  31.6 billion at the end of 2Q 2022. Albeit high net debt levels are almost normal for companies in this industry, I believe the management is required to have some plan for deleveraging to reduce its interest expenses. With decreasing inflation rates, there is no need for high-interest rates in the future. However, we do not know when the Fed will decide to drop interest rates back to previous levels. As the management has no specific plan for deleveraging, it seems they have relied on lower interest rates in the near future, which I assume is not reliable.Figure 2To investigate KMI s financials more accurately, I have analyzed its leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers  Energy Transfer  and Enterprise Products Partners . In the case of leverage condition, Kinder Morgan s debt-to-Asset ratio is 45.4 , which is almost the same as ET s amount of 45.7 , while EPD has performed better and sat at 42.3  of the debt-to-asset ratio. Additionally, KMI s debt-to-equity level is circa 0.8x, which is slightly lower than ET s debt-to-Equity of 1x. Again, PDE has had the lowest level of circa 0.5x during the last 5 years  see Figure 3 .Figure 3   KIM s leverage condition vs. peersMoreover, analyzing KMI s return ratios versus the peer group indicates that ET and EPD have used their debt more efficiently. As it is indicated in Figure 4, KMI's return on invested capital is 3.9 , which is far lower than ET s and EPD s levels of 7.4  and 18 , respectively. This ratio indicates that EPD has been able to turn its capital from investments to profits more successfully. Additionally, KMI has the lowest return on assets level among its peers. Its ROA is 3.6 , which is in line with ET s 3.9 . However, well below EPD s ROA of 7.9 . Ultimately, KMI s return on equity sat at 8 , which is beneath ET s 12.6  and EPD s 20.4 . All in all, considering Kinder Morgan s leverage and profitability conditions in comparison to its peers indicate that the management could use debt more efficiently and thus provide more benefits for investors.Figure 4   KMI s return ratios vs. its peersFurthermore, considering KMI s dividend payment indicates that the company has paid dividends consistently and is growing slowly. Their last payment of , which was paid on August 15th, was in line with the previous quarter of  0.282 per share. Also, their dividend yield is 6.43 , which is very attractive. As a result, although Kinder Morgan is not an appropriate choice for growth investors in my point of view, the company is strong, and reliable for paying back dividends, thus a good choice for investors who would like reliable dividend payments albeit with slow growth  see Figure 5 .Figure 5   KMI s dividend payment and yieldKinder Morgan is one of the prominent midstream companies in North America. The company has a diversified portfolio of operations like services, refinery products, and infrastructure. Thankfully, their potentials and pipeline networks bring the opportunity to soak economic downturns and commodity price fluctuations. In this analysis, I have investigated short-term and long-term outlooks for LNG market supply and demand. Also, I have analyzed KMI s leverage and profitability conditions in comparison with its peers  Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners. KMI has almost higher leverage ratios vs. its peers, while it has provided less profitability for its investors. When all was said and done, I believe a hold rating is appropriate for KMI stock.Thank you for your time, and I welcome your opinions and comments.

Lyft: Sub-Scale Discount,"Lyft  has made substantial progress toward profitability in recent quarters, but it remains a distant second to Uber . This raises questions about Lyft's ability to effectively compete, particularly as the market is becoming more dependentLyft generally competes in markets that are dominated by two main players. This could result in favorable competitive conditions if a stable equilibrium can be reached, but any easing of competition is likely to be tenuous due to the fact that Lyft offers a commodity service in a two-sided marketplace.Lyft's management team is not currently worried about a price war, likely due to a shift in the macro environment. The rapid increase in interest rates over theScale is a potential issue for Lyft though given that it is small relative to Uber, but this is dependent on a number of complex factors. While scale is a potential issue, it should be noted that economies of scale for ride sharing are largely local, meaning that Lyft is more competitive in the area that matters most than it might appear. Lyft's business is more concentrated geographically and is more focused on the ridesharing vertical. Ride sharing companies need sufficient scale to create a liquid marketplace, but beyond this, the balance of supply and demand is more important than scale. A denser network of riders and drivers can lead to better routing though, improving driver income and reducing pricing for riders.Data can also provide economies of scale at the national global level in areas like insurance costs and advertising. Advertisers will be attracted to platforms that can provide them with reach, accurate targeting and attribution data.Auto insurance is a problem for ridesharing companies at the moment due to elevated inflation in categories like auto parts and medical costs. Lyft has stated that insurance costs per ride  in 2022 and a further 17  in 2023. Data can be used to reduce risk exposure through better routing and network density can reduce the distance driven, resulting in lower insurance costs per trip.The balance between riders and drivers improved in the second quarter, resulting in the percentage of Lyft rides affected by prime-time pricing  and a larger percentage of intended rides converting into actual rides. The number of drivers using Lyft increased by over 20  YoY in the second quarter, and driver hours increased by more than 35 . This strength has carried over into the third quarter, with driver numbers up 25  YoY in July and driver hours increasing by nearly 45  YoY. The importance of drivers is supported by an  that drivers are currently the limiting factor in growth. Lyft appears to be well placed in regard to drivers, with the preference for Lyft amongst drivers who use both Lyft and Uber increasing .Lyft recently started pricing more competitively, which is supporting growth but weighing on margins. This change has contributed to strong growth in new and returning riders, along with an increase in the number of rides taken by each active rider. Intended rides increased , suggesting that strong demand will carry over into the third quarter. The conversion of intent into actual rides also continues to improve, which is likely closely related to the balance of supply and demand.Similar to Uber, Lyft now offers a range of products that aim to maximize the company's revenue and profitability. Wait and save is Lyft's most affordable rideshare option, allowing riders to pay less if they are not in a hurry. While this is a headwind to margins, it could help to reduce price shopping between apps. Wait and save trips , with volumes far exceeding what Lyft's shared ride business ever achieved.Lyft also offers a non-emergency healthcare product that provides patients with access to medical treatments and has government support. Healthcare rides grew by  in the second quarter and growth should be supported over the long term by aging populations.Lyft also offers B2B services which allow an employer to provide transportation for staff. Uber has a similar business and has  of these trips are on a premium product, which should be supportive of margins.Micro mobility is still a small but growing part of Lyft's business, aided by Lyft's acquisition of PBSC in the second quarter of 2022. PBSC has  and 95,000 bikes to 45 markets and 15 countries, with the acquisition roughly doubling Lyft's micro mobility business.Lyft is focused on branding, service differentiation and making the app stickier to drive growth and margins. Lyft's LTV CAC appears low, meaning the company needs to extract more revenue from existing users and reduce the cost of attracting new users. Uber is trying to improve its LTV CAC through memberships. Uber One members are profitable, but margins are lower because Uber is incentivizing members. This is offset by the fact that members spend  on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50  greater than non-member retention.Advertising should provide Lyft with high-margin incremental revenue going forward as the company recently introduced in-app advertising.  on serving display ads, introducing video ads by the end of the year. This is potentially lucrative as users check the app nearly 9x per ride. Lyft is also able to offer advertising across 6,500 in-car tablets, 800 car-top displays, and digital screens at its bike share stations.Lyft's revenue in the second quarter was , up 3  YoY. The increase was driven by strong rideshare ride growth, partially offset by lower revenue per ride and a non-recurring legal expense that was classified as contra-revenue. Bike and scooter systems sales growth was also strong in the second quarter.Lyft expects third quarter revenue to be in the  range, a 7-9  YoY increase. This is based on anticipated rideshare ride growth of 20  along with lower revenue per ride due to Lyft's focus on pricing competitively. Lyft also suggested on the second quarter earnings call that fourth quarter revenue growth would be in the low to mid-single digit range QoQ, which implies that revenue will be fairly flat YoY.Rideshare rides increased 18  YoY in the second quarter, and the number of active riders and drivers each reached multiyear highs. The number of active Lyft riders in the second quarter was , an 8  increase YoY. Lower pricing negatively impacted revenue per active rider though, which was down 5  YoY.While it is easy to theorize about the impact of network density, economies of scale, etc. gross profit margins provide little evidence of a revenue   COGS benefit. Uber and Lyft's gross profit margins are similar and have shown no improvement with scale. This is impacted by revenue mix shifts across geographies and verticals though, making the impact difficult to assess.Lyft's  in the second quarter, increasing 10  YoY. This improvement was only due to a 275 million USD expense associated with Lyft's legacy insurance reserves in Q2 2022. Excluding this impact, Lyft's contribution margin declined by 18 , due to both lower revenue per ride and higher insurance costs. Lyft's contribution margin is expected to be roughly 45  in the third quarter, with the improvement driven by healthier driver supply dynamics and less contra-revenue.Lyft's third-party insurance contracts will renew in the fourth quarter, resulting in higher costs. The company plans on staggering renewals in certain states going forward, which it believes will give the company better optionality. Lyft is also trying to lower the burden of insurance costs through product and safety initiatives that help reduce accident frequency and improve settlement outcomes. This includes things like better routing and greater network density.Lyft's operating expenses  in the second quarter as a result of its cost restructuring initiatives. Lyft conducted a reorganization in April, creating a flatter organizational structure and resulting in more effective communication and decision making. While the benefit of recent cost saving initiatives is expected to flow into the third quarter, operating expenses will face upward pressure from volume driven costs and an increase in targeted marketing spend.While Uber and Lyft have both been able to demonstrate significant operating leverage over the past few years, it is operating expenses that demonstrate Uber's advantage. Lyft's operating expenses are quite low given the company's size, but Uber is able to spread its operating expenses across a much larger revenue base.Lyft's stock is priced broadly in line with peers based on its current profitability and growth rate. The stock trades at a significant discount to Uber though, which may be a reflection of the difference in scale between the two companies.Lyft remains some way off profitability, which is probably a concern for investors, even though Lyft's cash balance still provides it with a sizeable runway. Increased advertising revenue will be supportive of margins, but this will be somewhat offset by rising insurance costs. Lyft needs to significantly expand its business to remain competitive, which is questionable given current low user growth.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

This Holiday Shopping Season Could Be A Nail-Biter," The holiday selling season represents around 25  of annual retail sales and has always been an important catalyst for investors.When it comes to understanding what this holiday season may hold, it's helpful for investors to consider how the experiences of the past two years might inform retailers  expectations, especially around supply and demand.We also need to consider how consumers are faring in a much more uncertain macroeconomic environment.Back in 2021, consumer demand was strong coming out of the pandemic, but supply chain issues resulted in longer lead times for products to reach stores and inventories were depleted quickly.In response, retailers prepared for 2022 by increasing inventory, but demand plummetedFast forward to today, we find that while inventory levels are more balanced compared with the excess of 2022, the demand picture remains uncertain.Inflation has moderated, but the outlook for consumers has otherwise weakened. Despite recent improvements in real wages, many low-income consumers are still living paycheck to paycheck.The cost of living, including food and fuel, remains a significant concern, and we re seeing consumer spending dedicated to  needs   and food in particular  rather than  wants.Even higher income consumers are feeling the pinch with increased market volatility, a slowing housing market and employment uncertainty.Given the more challenging spending environment, we expect to see variation across the retail landscape this holiday season.Promotional sales have long been a holiday tradition, and this year companies may employ them to boost traffic. We don t expect promotions to be excessive, but we may see retailers announce sales earlier in the season to help smooth out holiday shopping peaks and troughs.In the end, we think that the success of the holiday season  and the year  is going to come down to the wire for retailers. And while they are better positioned in terms of inventory, consumers are in no rush and have the upper hand in waiting for deals.For investors, it will be important to identify areas of opportunity, notably in athletic wear and beauty.Retailers and investors remain defensive in their positioning, as it is difficult to identify a catalyst for accelerating demand heading into 2024.

Opportunity Knocks For Municipal Investors,"Municipal bonds posted sharply negative total returns in September amid heightened volatility. Interest rates rose rapidly and pressured fixed income assets as the market navigated a moderate rise in inflation, continued strength in the labor market, surging oilIssuance was light at just  28 billion, 23  below the five-year average, bringing the year-to-date total to  263 billion, down 8  year-over-year. However, issuance still outpaced reinvestment income from maturities, calls, and coupons by nearly  6 billion, weighing heavily on the market as seasonal net negative supply during theWhile the recent sell-off was significantly larger and more volatile than expected, seasonal performance weakness in the autumn was broadly anticipated. With the Fed nearing the end of its tightening cycle, we view the reset in yields and valuations as an attractive long-term buying opportunity. We foresee using any material pickup in issuance to add some duration and lock in durable yields.We maintain a neutral-duration posture overall, albeit slightly longer than last month. We prefer an up-in-quality bias and remain both cautious and selective in noninvestment grade. We advocate a barbell yield curve strategy, pairing front-end exposure with an increased but modest allocation to the 15-20-year part of the curve.Last month, Moody s revised its credit outlook to  positive  from  stable  for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority s  MTA   20.6 billion in outstanding transportation revenue bonds. Moody s also affirmed the MTA s  A3  rating. S P followed with a rating upgrade to  A-  from  BBB  and revised its outlook to  positive  from  stable  on October 4th. Additional state support has offset post-COVID-19 ridership losses and has enabled the MTA to nearly close forecasted budget gaps and stabilize liquidity. Weekday subway ridership on the nation s largest mass-transit system has slowly risen but remains at about 70  of 2019 levels. To offset fare losses, a state-approved 0.6  increase in New York City payroll taxes will provide an estimated  5 billion of revenue over the next five years. Continued support from the state, a full recovery of ridership, and the implementation of operational savings are key factors in any future rating upgrades.A recent rating downgrade of a small issuer highlights the importance of credit research and the need to analyze an issuer s entire debt structure prior to purchase. For example, S P downgraded Maryland Heights, MO from  BBB  to  BB  last month based on the city s refusal to support its nonrated 2018B Industrial Development Authority revenue bonds. The city was rated  AA  as recently as November 2020. The 2018B bonds were secured by revenues from a multipurpose ice arena that never became fully operational due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ice facility has faced operating imbalances since its opening in 2019, having relied on general fund transfers from the city to make debt payments on three separate occasions. Given the city s recent decision not to provide additional support for the ice complex bonds, S P has become wary of the city s willingness to pay its outstanding debt backed by annual appropriations. This technical default by a previously highly rated city underscores the need for in-depth credit analysis.This material is not intended to be relied upon as a forecast, research or investment advice, and is not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

AvalonBay: I Will Buy If Strong Growth Persists In Q3,"AvalonBay Communities  is a major apartment REIT with properties located in legacy markets on the East and West Coast. The REIT focuses on higher-end rental units with an average monthly rent of about  2,500 andLast time I  the stock was in May, when I issued a HOLD rating at  180 per share. I liked the way in which AVB was positioned and didn t mind the legacy market exposure, but I couldn t see a clear way to 10  returns. Since then, the stock has been quite volatile, reaching as high as  200, only to settle around  180 again. More importantly, the company has also released very good Q2 2023 results. Today s article is meant to update my thesis based on Q2 numbers and to give investors some insights of what to look for in Q3 earnings, which will be I ve touched on the topic of new supply in my original article. Here I want to provide a little bit more of an insight.It s no secret, that a large number of people and jobs moved to the South during and after the pandemic. This has resulted in a spike in construction activity in the region to about 4-5  of new supply each year. At the same time, new supply in the coastal regions has remained relatively stable at 1.5  per year.Over the past 24 months or so, the Sunbelt region has seen unprecedented growth, as confirmed by double-digit FFO increases of Mid-America Apartment Communities . But now things seem to be slowly changing, and legacy markets are starting to catch up. This will be clearly illustrated by very high rent growth in AVB s markets, but the point is that demand is strong, while supply remains at relatively normal levels compared to history  certainly the growth in new supply post-pandemic has been much lower in Costal markets than in the Sunbelt. With strong demand and stable supply, I see the risk of oversupply as minimal. For this reason, I actually slightly prefer the Coastal markets over the Sunbelt at this time.I think that one of the best ways to determine how a REIT is doing is to look at their ability to raise rents, which is especially important in a high inflation environment like the one we have today.Over the first six months of the year, AVB has done remarkably well on this front by increasing their same-store NOI by 7.9  YoY. It s notable, that the increases weren t uniform across the portfolio. Florida has seen the fastest levels of growth, but since this region accounts for less than 3  of the overall NOI, it didn t contribute meaningfully to AVB s bottom line. The Northeast, on the hand, has a high weighting and saw very high double-digit growth of 10-12 , suggesting that demand is coming back to cities such as NYC or Boston. On the other side of the country, California  and especially Southern California  has struggled with low rent increases of only 2  YoY.Right now, management s full year guidance calls for a 7  YoY increase in NOI. When Q3 earnings come out, one of the first things I ll want to see will be rent increases across various regions to confirm my thesis that demand is indeed coming back to Coastal markets. If management hits their target, FFO per share will reach  10.50.Last year, Sunbelt REITs experienced double-digit rent-growth, but that seems to be thing of the past as MAA's growth guidance for this year is largely in line with AVB's.Management didn t provide any insight on what growth will be like in 2024 and 2025. The general consensus seems to be for 5  same store NOI growth. On top of that, the REIT will be able to grow by adding new properties to their portfolio. Currently, there are 3,600 units scheduled for completion until the end of next year, which  if leased  will contribute another 4-5  to growth. As a result of these two factors, I expect AVB to deliver 6-8  annual NOI growth until 2025. This is largely in line with the expected growth for AVB's closest peer Equity Residential  and actually above the expected growth for MAA  and most other Sunbelt peers  which are likely to experience a temporary slowdown in rent growth due to a large spike in new supply.There are relatively few things that could derail this. AVB has an A- rated balance sheet with low leverage of only 4x EBITDA and the vast majority  92  of debt fixed-rate. Moreover, near term maturities are low and can easily be repaid from rental revenue if refinancing terms are not favorable.With that said, higher interest rates for a long period of time will hurt the stock price in the short-term as the market re-rates to adjust to higher interest rate expectations. But what's important is that even with high interest rates, cash flow is likely to grow as rent growth will most likely out-weigh interest expense increase. For this reason, I see AVB as quite well positioned for a higher for longer scenario - this would be supported by the fact that it is one of only seven REITs with an A- or better rating.The main risk to my thesis is that the tick up in rent growth in the Northeast will be short-lived, and growth rates will decline as soon as Q3. This would negatively impact future growth expectations and therefore the stock price. In fact, I see Q3 earnings as the breaking-point which will decide whether Coastal markets are actually coming back strong or not. This will, to a large extent, be determined by rent and NOI growth.A share price of  176 today puts the stock at a forward P FFO of 16.8x, which is slightly below where the stock traded last time, thanks to increased growth guidance for this year. The long-term average for AVB stands around 22x FFO. But I don t really expect meaningful multiple expansion, until rates come down.Until then, investors will continue to receive a 4  dividend yield and are likely to see cash flow increase by 6-8  per year. That s a slight improvement compared to my last article, as a result of very strong rent growth in Q2. I will be watching Q3 results closely and if strong rent growth persists, I will initiate a position, for now I reiterate my HOLD rating for AVB.If you really like AVB, though, it might be prudent to initiate a small position before earnings come out, because I suspect that if strong NOI growth persists, the stock price will move substantially higher on the announcement.

General Motors: Good Opportunity To Buy,"General Motors  continues to develop the EV business and is committed to its plans to capture this market by launching new models in various auto categories. Despite the recession, GM will continue to invest heavily in EVs, bothSemiconductor shortages for the automotive industry are almost obsolete, and strong consumer spending and still excess savings among the U.S. population have supported U.S. auto .From 2014 to 2020, the normal demandAmid a significant imbalance between supply and demand and still low auto production, the U.S. new car price index continues hitting .A similar situation can be seen in the US used car market, but price growth is considerably slowing .The situation on the new and used car markets is different. While automakers are struggling to restore production, new players are entering the used car market. Amid falling real incomes, rising utility bills, loan and mortgage rates, individuals are starting to sell their own cars.That said, new car makers like GM do see progress in terms of supply chains and semiconductors. However, due to the still high shortage of new vehicles on the market, automakers are still passing costs on to the consumer, albeit at a more moderate pace. GM's dollar margin per auto, according to our estimates, in Q2 2023 was  4700 vs.  5000 in Q1 2023,  4100 in Q2 2022 and the historical average of  2500.GM  about 980k autos, which was above our forecast of 889k autos. Although the consumer remains strong, production is recovering faster. At the same time, price increases are not stopping, forcing dealers and auto companies to build up inventories  GM's inventory level has increased from  15.4 bn to  17.9 bn since the beginning of the year . We have revised our 2023 auto sales forecast from 3.7mn units  3  YoY  to 3.8mn units  5.5  YoY , but cut our 2024 full-year sales forecast from 4.5mn units  21  YoY  to 4mn units  5  YoY  amid a nearly full recovery in US sales levels, but extremely weak sales in Asia due to the prevalence of high penetration in electric car sales in that region. GM's sales in Asia are 40  below GM's pre-market average sales of 250k autos per quarter. However, Asia's EV sales have gone up to 20-25  of all auto sales.As a result, we have revised our 2023 GM revenue forecast upwards from  172.5bn  10  YoY  to  173.8bn  11  YoY  and our 2024 forecast downwards from  209.5 bn  21  YoY  to  185.7bn  7  YoY .We have revised 2023 EBITDA forecast downwards from  22.8bn  9.3  YoY  to  22bn  2  YoY  and 2024 forecast - from  27bn  18  YoY  to  22.7bn  3  YoY  due to a decline in dollar margin per 1 auto from the average  5400 to  4700 in 2023-2024 amid reduced shortage of autos in the US and increased supply in the secondary auto market.The fair value for the stock is  51, based on our EV EBITDA multiple approach.Continued wage growth in the U.S., along with lower inflation rates, has supported demand for cars. As a result, GM's US car sales in Q2 2023 returned to pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the steady rise in auto prices and falling metal prices increased GM's dollar margin per vehicle. We expect the consumer to remain strong going forward and GM is a major beneficiary of the US auto market recovery.A key risk for GM is a potential recession in the U.S., as well as a decline in buying activity amid rising borrowing rates.Due to high market volatility, we recommend to form a position in several steps.

A Good Time To Be An Energy Bull,"In terms of oil market fundamentals, things remain relatively bullish, at least in the short term. Starting with commercial inventories, the EIA reported another 2.2 million barrel draw this past week, following a 2.1 million barrel draw last week.Following what has been a few months of persistent inventory drawdowns, crude oil supplies in the US are becoming increasingly tight.Not only are commercial inventories overall reaching the lows of 2022, prior to the Biden Administration draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but crude oil levels at Cushing, Oklahoma have fallen to only 22 million barrels  down from a two-year high of 43 million barrels in June .Such stockpiles are worryingly close to minimum operating levels, a point which brings into question the quality of remaining stocks.With inventories continuing to track well below their five-yearWith the inventory picture suggesting excess demand relative to supply, other indicators of the physical market also confirm this notion. Notably, the crude oil futures term structure is currently at its highest level of backwardation in over a year.Backwardation implies there is a supply deficit as market participants are willing to pay a premium for instant delivery, despite the associated delivery and storage costs. As a result, any deficit will need to be met via drawing down inventories. Clearly, this is exactly what is unfolding at present.Not only is this true of the term structure as a whole, but front-end prompt spreads are also suggesting the oil market is tight.However, while backwardation is bullish for prices, extreme backwardation and significant spikes in prompt spreads also tend to coincide with short-term peaks in price, something energy bulls should be aware of.The fact that crack spreads have diverged lower throughout September despite higher prices is one physical market indicator suggesting a correction in the oil price could be on the cards, particularly as we are entering refinery maintenance season.Crack spreads measure the difference between the price refiners purchase crude and the price they sell the various refined products.One of the big drivers of this recent rally has been the significant level of speculative buying we have seen from hedge funds and CTAs.After being caught bearish  to the highest degree in nearly a decade  earlier this year, managed money positioning in the futures market has quickly gone from extreme bearishness to extreme bullishness.If we measure managed money positioning as a percentage of longs relative to total managed money, we can see hedge funds and CTAs are now equally as long oil as they have been in years.Similar spikes have at the very least coincided with short-term pullbacks in price. Given how swift this rally in oil prices has been, I suspect we are due for some kind of pullback, if only minor.While a short-term correction may be due, the medium-term outlook remains bullish. Indeed, not only do the real-time indicators of supply and demand remain favourable, but forecasts for the remainder of 2023 suggest this deficit is set to continue.Notably, the EIA - who are notorious for underestimating demand - continue to see a deficit through Q4 of this year.A view eschewed by Morgan Stanley.Meanwhile, oil analysts at Standard Chartered continue to call for a 1.3 mb d deficit through Q4, and expect inventory draws to continue into 2024.Although such forecasts are inherently difficult and error-prone, it seems we are likely to continue to see a supply and demand imbalance toward the bullish side of the spectrum as we close out 2023, an environment that should help put a floor under the oil price.From a price action perspective, the daily chart for crude continues to trade bullishly. The downtrend that encompassed the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 is clearly behind us, with the major moving averages now turning up and the important  82- 85 resistance level well and truly broken.However, as I have stated, it seems we are probably due for some sort of technical correction, if only briefly.Indeed, WTI recently triggered a 9-13-9 DeMark sequential sell signal and is now butting heads with the  92 resistance level.Thus, if I were a betting man, I would wager the next  5- 10 is to the downside, with any move back toward the mid to low  80s seemingly an excellent buying opportunity.On the whole, I continue to remain cautiously bullish on oil prices and energy stocks for the remainder of 2023. The real-time fundamental indicators such as inventories and term structure remain supportive, while the technical, momentum and trend picture is now firmly on the bullish side.The level of speculative buying and falling crack spreads do suggest we are probably in need of some kind of short-term shake-out, an outcome that would go a long way to setting up another leg higher as we close out 2023.However, having said that, as I  in my previous oil market update, there remain several factors in play that are likely to put a ceiling on oil prices.Indeed, much of the current supply deficit is a result of the ongoing Saudi production cuts and Russian export cuts. OPEC  spare capacity is now the highest it has been since 2010  ex-COVID lockdowns , and it seems they are once again becoming the primary swing producer of oil.Meanwhile, Chinese stockpiles have also been filled to the brim, so, should WTI or Brent prices spike into triple digits, I suspect the Saudis would be happy to ramp up production, with China also likely to release some of their commercial and strategic stockpiles onto the market.For these reasons, don t expect a spike to  150 oil just yet. That will happen, but I suspect it will be a story for 2025, once the US election has come and gone.Though a blow-off top is not impossible, it remains unlikely. For now, enjoy the favourable fundamentals as we close out 2023. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",12,2023-09-28T03:30:00.000-04:00
UGI Corporation: The Company Needs To Improve Its Leverage And Liquidity Conditions,"UGI Corporation  is a leading American company operating in several segments throughout the United States and Europe. The company distributes, stores, and transports energy products and services through its business territories. UGI s main operations are in four business segments  AmeriGasFigure 1   UGI s capital structure  in millionsFigure 2 -Propane is a super volatile business because it is affected by warmer weather, which lowers demand volumes and the supply and demand of both natural gas and crude oil. Analyzing UGI s leverage condition indicates that the company should improve its leverage condition in my opinion. In minutiae, after the downturn of 2020, when the leverage ratios sat at high levels, the company could improve its condition gradually. However, challenges like the Russia and Ukraine war, warmer-than-expected winter, energy conservation efforts in Europe, higher inflation rates, and the current interest rates environment caused the company s leverage ratios to almost hit their 2020 peaks. UGI s debt-to-capital ratio is circa 62 , which shows that 62  of the company s capital is funded by debt. Moreover, its debt-to-asset ratio has surged considerably since last year, reaching over 46 . Ultimately, UGI s debt-to-equity ratio is 1.2x, which indicates for every  1 of equity or ownership, the company has  1.2 debt. This ratio is higher than approximately 1.1x in 2020  see Figure 3 .Figure 3   UGI s leverage conditionFurthermore, the company s liquidity ratios are almost as low as the downturn of 2020. As it is demonstrated in Figure 4, UGI s current ratio plunged to 0.97x, which is far lower than its level of approximately 1.7x in mid-2022. Moreover, the company s quick ratio sat at 0.6x, which is far lower than the same time in the prior year and almost the same as 2020.Figure 4   UGI s liquidity conditionAs a result, the company s current liquidity condition has become their first priority as the management Figure 5   UGI s price return vs. S P 500As a result, I downgraded my previous rating to a hold for UGI stock.Thank you for your time, and as always, I welcome your opinions.

Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,"At the outset, our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in Israel.This past weekend, we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments, the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus, given their potential implications for oil production. Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high. This was part of a complex deal, brokered by the U.S., that aimed for Saudi Arabia's recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production. The talks were under close scrutiny by investors, asHowever, the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics. The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of near-term normalization in Saudi-Israeli relations. This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans, leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period, which could further deplete already low global oil inventories.Another significant player in the global energy market, Iran, is also expected to see a major shift in U.S. policy. Before the attacks, the U.S. had adopted a softer posture toward Iran, allowing it to approach pre-2018 levels of oil production. However, given recent events and Iran's known support for Hamas, the U.S. may adopt a stricter stance, potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supply.These developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties. Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation, affecting both stocks and bonds. In these uncertain times, assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge. In particular, we believe the energy sector, which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics, may offer an opportunity.That said, the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge, and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy. 2009-2023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC.

Plug Power: Profitability By 2025 Is Unlikely,"Despite its potential, hydrogen is currently not competitive due to its high cost and lower efficiency. Plug Power's  profitability projections  profitable in 2025  appear overly optimistic, given the company's increasing expenses relative to its revenues. In addition, share dilution and highThe total addressable market has immense potential as a possible storage option for excess electricity. Furthermore, it could include various transportation methods. However, predicting the future remains difficult  Factors such as production costs, competition from electric cars, future costs of batteries as potential competition for energy storage, future oil prices, andWhat seems to be clear, however, is that hydrogen has not yet established itself on the free market. After all, we still drive, fly, and heat with oil today and not with hydrogen. Global demand has increased in the last decades, but it remains more of a niche product. At the moment, many things are being politically pushed and subsidized, but in the long run, this will not be able to cancel out the free market.In the CO2-neutral future scenarios, it is assumed that hydrogen will be produced from surplus energy from renewable energy sources. But so far, this production method is by far the least profitable compared to hydrogen production from gas or coal.The way hydrogen can be used reminds me overall of oil and gas. Ultimately, it is also just a medium to release stored energy. The problem is that, so far, the hydrogen process is costly and not competitive. And if you use gas, coal, or oil to produce hydrogen, the entire process becomes pointless. Because then, we could burn these energy sources directly, which would be even more efficient since, with each energy conversion, a lot of energy gets lost, .Plug Power, however, bases its own story on the assumption that this future scenario of renewable energy to hydrogen will occur on a large scale and that the company will play a significant role in it.This may happen  I don't want to exclude that at all. With the previous paragraphs, I just wanted to say that there are still many question marks and, so far, few actual, hard facts that hydrogen will become established on a large scale. There are a lot of political plans, but ultimately the free market with supply and demand will prevail.First, a short overview over a more extended period for revenues, expenses, and net income.I have created this overview of the income statement of the last quarter compared to the previous year, showing where money is spent and how the revenue and cost development is in general.Overall, we can see that the trend is continuing, that expenses are increasing faster than sales, and thus the net income is becoming increasingly negative. The current margins are terrible. It is all the more astonishing that analysts expect the company to make a profit as early as 2025.I think this is highly unrealistic, and history does not support it either, as you can see from the fact that the earnings revisions look like this.The company is currently valued at an enterprise value of  6.4B. The market cap is  7.2B, and the company has about  1.6B in cash. Given the current losses of about  200M per quarter, these reserves would be depleted after another two years. This does not include issuing new shares  which will probably happen, see below . It is also possible that the cash burn will slow down as sales increase, but as shown above, this is not the case so far.Otherwise, a valuation of the stock is difficult. Surely it's not a revelation to alert readers to the expensive price-sales ratio.Ultimately, it is also somewhat subjective whether one considers the current valuation to be justified  Because if one believes that hydrogen has a glorious future ahead of it and Plug Power is a company that is operating in the entire hydrogen ecosystem and will multiply its sales in the coming decades, the share would be justifiably expensive.But this glorious future is uncertain  even the opposite could be true. At the moment, hydrogen is being pushed by politics and subsidies, and if these are removed one day, and the hydrogen industry has to stand on its own two feet, it is not sure whether it will survive.Also not mentioned yet in this article is competition. If hydrogen becomes a global cash cow, more and more companies will want to enter the market, which sometimes results in a price war and lower margins.Another risk for the adaptation of hydrogen is that this happens globally in different ways. The danger is that countries that increasingly rely on hydrogen as an energy carrier may have structural disadvantages compared to other countries that stick to oil and gas. If this were to happen, companies would relocate their production locations. Ultimately, hydrogen can only become established long-term if it gets cheaper.For me, these three things are standard checks I make in every article, as excessive stock dilution and stock-based compensation can put us, shareholders, at a disadvantage. In addition, insider trades sometimes contain valuable info about the confidence of management itself. Massive selling has occurred in 2021 but none within the last six months. Otherwise, we can see that the number of outstanding shares has risen massively and continues to rise slowly. Also, the SBCs are huge and currently account for more than 10  of this year s revenue.For my taste, not only Plug Power, but the entire hydrogen industry still has far too many question marks to be considered as an investment. If at all, then as a tiny position, but I'll stay out of it for now and watch further development. High valuations mean high falling heights, and there could be several reasons for this  disappointing financial figures, permanently little global adaptation, or waning political support, for example, after changes in government.

REIT Meltdown: 3 Rarely Discounted Buying Opportunities,"Is there a more reviled and shunned sector of the stock market today than real estateSince the beginning of 2022, publicly traded real estate investment trusts  REITs  have been one of the worst, if not  worst, performingIn sharp contrast to soaring energy stocks , real estate stocks  have suffered a decline of nearly 30  since early 2022.WhyIn ,  I talked about the three ways that rising interest rates typically cause REITs to dropThat last point is a major one. I hear from commenters again and again   WhyOf course, the 5  yields on cash offer no upside, growth, or inflation protection. But in any case, this is a big reason why investors have shunned REITs.And then there's one last reason why REITs have performed so badlyIt is true that real estate still faces continued struggles for years to come as hybrid work takes its toll on leasing demand, capital spending requirements ramp up in order to retain or attract tenants, and low-interest loans mature and need to be refinanced at much higher rates.For example, in the next three years, a steady slate of mortgage loans will continue to mature for mid-quality Class B office properties, which will put tremendous pressure on landlords and undoubtedly create ample pockets of distress.I would not want to be a Class B office landlord in Houston, for example, because of its unappealing combination of  25  vacancy rate and  25  of square footage with loan maturities in the next three years.Surely this will inhibit the growth of most office real estate going forward as the competition for tenants heats up.Again, though, office REITs make up a  sliver of the overall REIT universe.Perhaps some investors assume that other property sectors are suffering similar problems as office, but that assumption is incorrect.According to , both FFO and NOI for the overall REIT index hit new all-time highs in Q2 2023.Moreover, as I explained in ,  high interest rates are not  bad for REITs.That is because the higher cost of capital is causing construction starts of new properties to absolutely  across all real estate sectors. Hence you see headlines like this one from Yes, REITs are hurt by high interest rates. But they are not hurt  as bad as the many bank-dependent, highly leveraged private real estate owners out there.And now, with REIT prices down  30  from their early 2022 highs, publicly traded real estate stocks look like a phenomenal value, especially for certain heavily punished yet high-quality REITs.I'll pitch three of my favorite discounted yet high-quality REITs below. But first, let me demonstrate real estate's ability to powerfully rebound from selloffs like the current one.Across the last 7 recessions, REITs have been the worst performers, averaging a 22  drawdown during these periods. Although we have not been in an officially declared recession, consider that the almost 30  drawdown since the beginning of 2022 is worse than this average.But then, notice that real estate has been the  1 strongest performing sector during recoveries. Moreover, it is among the strongest performing sectors during expansionary periods.It is only during slowdowns and recessions that REITs underperform. And when it does underperform, the underperformance is typically  than what we've experienced during the current REIT bear market.As such, if and when a recession is finally declared and interest rates come down from current levels, REITs should be among the strongest performing sectors, if not  strongest performing, going into the next recovery phase.Let me demonstrate the power of this from the Great Financial Crisis.During the GFC, the REIT index got obliterated, losing nearly 2 3rds of its value from the Summer of '08 to the trough in March 2009, compared to  only  46  for the S P 500 .  and this is extremely important  those who bought REITs anywhere near their bottom in early 2009 were richly rewarded in the years after, as the REIT index outperformed the broader market   not considering REITs' higher dividend yields  until 2018On a total return basis  including dividends , REITs outperformed the market from their GFC trough all the way up to the beginning of COVID-19.The current selloff creates a very compelling opportunity for the long-term investor.Interest rates don't need to go all the way back to zero for REITs to outperform. They just need to stabilize at a more modest level in order to better align costs of capital with property cap rates. That will be a massive boon to REITs.Let's look at three of my favorite high-quality picks that I view as coiled springs, ready to outperform in the years ahead while generating strong dividend growth.If you've read my articles before, you've probably heard me pitch ARE multiple times. The Buy thesis remains the same, so I'll keep it brief here.ARE owns Class A, state-of-the-art life science   biotech laboratory properties located in the nation's most innovative and productive research clusters and leased to the world's most innovative and productive biotech companies.ARE has zero balance sheet stress. Its credit ratings are BBB Baa1. It has over  6 billion in liquidity. Slightly over 99  of debt is fixed-rate. And the weighted average debt maturity sits at 13.2 years  among the highest in the REIT space , with no maturities until 2025.The real concern is the amount of life science supply coming to market. Labspace is different than traditional office, and its demand outlook is vastly superior. But there are lots of traditional office owners redeveloping their empty buildings into new labs.The market is worried that this will spell the end of ARE's impressive record of double-digit rent growth.I'm not so sure.For one thing, the life science development pipeline is slowing down amid a drop in leasing activity This should eventually diminish the oversupply worries.Another, perhaps more important point is that ARE's property location and quality acts as a  moat  in itself. The best biotech tenants want to be located in the best life science buildings, especially those that are situated in highly productive research clusters -- multi-building campuses where biotech researchers congregate.Case in point  ARE expects to grow FFO per share by 6.4 , only a little shy of its 10-year average growth rate of 7.4 .Looking at price to operating cash flow, a proxy for FFO, we find that ARE has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFC.Between a 4.3  dividend yield and 6  average annual dividend growth rate, ARE looks like a phenomenal Buy for long-term dividend growth investors.CCI owns perhaps the largest telecommunications infrastructure portfolio in the United States, consisting of about 40,000 towers,  120,000 small cell nodes, and over 80,000 route miles of fiber cables.The telecom infrastructure REIT has taken a huge hit to investor sentiment from cancellations of tower leases used by Sprint due to the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile .The market seems to fear that CCI will never be able to revive growth. But management insists that it will be able to return to 5  organic revenue growth and 7-8  dividend growth after the bulk of the Sprint lease cancellations take effect in 2025. In fact, around 75  of this 5  revenue growth is already contracted through 2027.As I wrote in CCI's scale, cost of capital, and leading market position in small cells together act as major competitive advantages that should serve it well in the long run.Being priced at 13.3x AFFO, I think CCI has about 60-70  upside to a post-2025 fair value AFFO multiple of about 22x. That's on top of its 6  yielding dividend.By price-to-AFFO  and price to operating cash flow, as pictured above , CCI has  during its lifetime as a REIT.After its merger with Life Storage  LSI , EXR has become the largest owner and operator of self-storage properties.I like storage REITs because they have a strong history of outperformance as Americans have accumulated more stuff than they've been able to fit in the amount of housing they can afford, and therefore they've increasingly relied on storage units.In my estimation, EXR boasts best-in-class management  19-year average tenure for the executive team , cost of capital  BBB  credit rating , portfolio quality in top markets, and operational excellence. This operational advantage includes a top-tier technology package, which is one of the primary ways management expects the newly added LSI properties to outperform in the coming years as they are added to the system.There is perhaps no better way to exhibit EXR's quality than by looking at its massive long-term outperformance in total returns over its primary peer Public Storage  as well as the broader REIT index and the S P 500As for ARE, there is a lot of recent new supply of storage properties in many markets, which is expected to blunt rent growth for at least the next year. But also like for other property sectors, construction starts for new storage properties has plunged, which means that supply and demand should eventually come back into equilibrium and allow for organic growth to resume.EXR now yields 5.1 , far above its 5-year average of 3.4 , and the REIT has an extremely impressive history of dividend growth.And with an  80  payout ratio, that dividend looks well-protected and able to continue EXR's 13-year dividend growth streak.I wouldn't expect anything more than a measly raise next year, but a top-quality REIT like EXR is likely to return to strong growth within a few years.By price to operating cash flow, EXR has not been this cheap since the wake of the GFC in 2011.And at an AFFO multiple of 16.2x, EXR has about 35  upside to its 5-year average price-to-AFFO of  22x. I think shareholders will enjoy that upside and perhaps more within a few years.This is an exciting time to be a long-term REIT investor. The discounts offered for high-quality names across various sectors are ridiculous. But I'm not complaining. I'm buying.I believe buyers of blue-chip REITs will be richly rewarded for their bravery -- eventually.If you want access to our entire Portfolio and all our current Top Picks, feel free to join us for a  at High Yield Landlord.We are the largest real estate investment community on Seeking Alpha with over 2,000 members on board and a perfect 5 5 rating from 400  reviewsAustin Rogers is a REIT specialist with a professional background in commercial real estate.

The Apartment Sector: Increasing Demand For Affordable Living,"In this paper, we will focusOver the past 12 months, demand for apartments has remained near record levels across key strategic markets and vacancy rates are well within their equilibrium ranges.Strong rent growth since the start of the pandemic has continued to fuel impressive NOI growth as leases have continued to roll up to market asking rents.SinceIf there has been a question mark regarding the apartment sector in both regions, it has been the high levels of development. In the U.S., the pace of new deliveries has pushed vacancy rates up toward their long term historical averages for institutionally managed properties  Exhibit 1 .Recent supply and demand trends may be somewhat misleading, however. Despite an increasing number of projects that are under construction, apartment units have been under-delivered over the past decade.Consequently, there has been a shortage of housing which has resulted in an affordability crisis in many major cities for both the rental and for-sale markets.In the U.S. for example, Exhibit 2  left chart  shows that since 1990 only 2.5 new multifamily units have been built for every thousand households - well below the average of 6.4 between 1960 and 1990.In Europe as well  right chart , construction permits issued for residential dwellings have yet to recover to their preGlobal Financial Crisis  GFC  levels.Most major markets in the U.S. and Europe are now facing a housing deficit with many needing more units to accommodate population growth than are currently being supplied. In fact, a research report from Freddie Mac - a U.S. government sponsored entity founded to provide liquidity to the residential sector - recently stated the U.S. needs an additional 3.8 million housing units to meet current demand growth.In Europe, the construction of new residential buildings is also unable to keep up with demand. The German Property Federation for example has reported that the deficit of housing in the country has reached its highest level in 20 years and that by 2025 the shortage may increase to 700,000 flats.As a result, across both sides of the Atlantic, the outlook for current landlords and developers remains positive and suggests that secular demand through demographics will provide a steady flow of new renters looking for space. While all property sectors rely on demographics as a primary demand driver, the residential housing sector, especially apartments, has an outsized reliance on population growth in prime renter age groups.Of particular importance is the shape of the population pyramid, which dictates where demand falls. Other important factors in conjunction with demographics are cultural norms that impact household formation and homeownership trends across regions.In the U.S. and Europe, a majority of households own their homes. Homeownership rates can vary greatly by country, however, with Romania having the highest rate of home ownership at 95.3  and Germany the lowest at 49.1 .Such high homeownership rates among Eastern European nations are an artifact of the rapid shift from planned- to market-based economics in the early 1990s.Due to the fiscal stress placed upon most former Eastern Bloc nations, tenants were offered a chance to purchase the dwellings in which they lived at low prices from the government.When we take into consideration amenities and quality of dwellings, high homeownership rates in these countries should not necessarily indicate a lack of demand for newer and higher-quality rental units.Rather, in many Eastern European nations, the relatively poor quality of existing housing stock could offer an interesting entry point for developers to provide more modern and highly amenitized apartment communities.If we look more broadly at the demographics associated with the rental population base, we establish that in both the U.S. and Europe, it is quite large.If we include the UK, there are roughly 357 million households in these regions, of which 32.1  are renters, meaning there are nearly 115 million rental households.The population trend charts suggest that in addition to existing rental households, there is an ample pool of renters that can provide increasing demand over the next decade.Millennials - those aged 27 to 42 - remain a dominant population group in both the U.S. and Europe, accounting for 20  of the population. Including Generation Z, the prime-renter age group expands to nearly 40 .While the U.S. and Europe are getting older with median ages of 38 and 44 years old respectively, younger generations have officially taken over from the Baby Boomers  Exhibit 4 .Young adults living with parents are another source of untapped demand. In many countries young adults are living at home longer than ever before. Data from the U.S. Census and Eurostat shows that between 2010 and 2022  the last year of available data , the share of young adults has increased.In the U.S. for example, people in the potential renter category living at home increased from 30  in 2010 to 31.4  in 2022, which represents roughly one million additional individuals who could form households and increase the demand for apartment units over the next few years.In Europe, the share of young adults living at home is structurally higher but has also increased over the past decade. More recently though, the share of young adults living at home has started to decline particularly post-pandemic, which will help drive demand for apartment units over the next cycle.Although the decision for young adults to live at home may be driven by numerous considerations, including cultural and social norms, family ties, and structural factors, it is also increasingly the case that affordability is becoming a larger issue.While affordability cuts across all segments of the residential sector, the current interest rate environment is both a blessing and a curse for the rental market. Monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe is very restrictive.In the U.S. for example, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate - the most popular financial options for homeowners - has increased to over 7  adversely affecting home price affordability, particularly for first-time home buyers looking for an accessible entry point into the for-purchase market.Historically, housing affordability has been dictated by a simple rule of thumb that allows a potential home buyer to estimate affordability as a house price of roughly three times their annual income.This has generally held up when applied to the median household when mortgage rates conform to spreads at equilibrium long-term rates. Nearly a decade of extraordinarily accommodative policy has rendered that relationship useless.House price-to-income ratios in the U.S. and the UK for example, have increased to roughly 5.5 due to exceptionally low interest rates following the GFC and again during the COVID-19 pandemic.In the U.S. for example, the median price of an existing house was  284,488 in December 2019 with an average commitment rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 3.7 .Today in the U.S. the median house price is roughly  400,000. Put another way, the rise in both interest rates and prices has increased the average payment for a home buyer by about  1,200 per month.The apartment sector to date has been a primary beneficiary of pricing increases within the singlefamily for-purchase market in both the U.S. and Europe. Just following the pandemic, U.S. markets saw net absorption in 2022 of 627 msf, which exceeded the prior record by more than 200 msf.The net result was a tightening of the market that saw apartment rents increase by 21  between 2020 and 2022 and, with it, a decline in overall affordability.In the U.S., the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  defines affordable housing as housing on which the occupant pays no more than 30  of gross income, including utilities.In the U.S., roughly 25  of markets we track would be deemed either unaffordable or at risk solely based on average asking rent and median household incomes across metro areas  Exhibit 7 .On the other side of the Atlantic, statistics from Eurostat revealed that 50  of market renters spent at least 40  of their income on housing in the European Union in 2021.Although more recent figures are not yet available, the spike in the cost of living and the rise in rents that occurred over the last year and a half have certainly worsened the average housing overburden rate, as nominal wages failed to keep up with rampant inflation.In Greece and the Netherlands for example, renters spend more than 30  of the income on housing. Across most European capitals, renting a one-bedroom flat in a central location can easily exceed the average worker's salary. The erosion of apartment affordability amid tight market conditions and strong rental increases recently has presented a quandary for many investors. While apartment rental values remain attractive relative to home ownership, they continue to stress household balance sheets on a practical basis.Portfolio managers looking to increase their allocation to the living sector and apartments are increasingly cognizant of rising cost pressures, particularly when it impacts new demand and tenant retention.While data on affordability are ample, hard data on the affordable housing market s performance are more nuanced and elusive. Many investors have multiple terms and definitions of what they deem to be affordable and there exists no hard benchmark for performance.Using HUD s definition of no more than 30  of a household s budget as a guideline for affordability, we can calculate the threshold for an affordable unit. At the median household income of  74,580 for 2022 in the U.S., the limit for an affordable unit would be  1,854 per month.Investors using a range around median household income of between 60  to 120 , which is typical in the industry today, would be able to target households with incomes between   45,000 to   90,000. This translates into a rental range of between of  1,120 to  2,240 per month.In the U.S., the national average for an institutionally managed two-bedroom unit is near the top of the affordable range. Fortunately, within the U.S. and Europe, there is a wide disparity between regions and apartment formats that provide investors with diversity.We suggest that investors focus on matching households in the middle of the income distribution with appropriately priced rentals. In the U.S., the middle of the household income distribution, as shown in Exhibit 9, ranges from  50,000 to  150,000 and represents 44  of all households and creates a very meaningful investment opportunity to serve. By focusing on middle-income households and diversifying investment portfolios across regions where apartment rents are more affordable, investors can ensure the ability to retain tenants and push moderate rent increases, thereby ensuring solid NOI growth and, ultimately, capital appreciation. While there is a decided lack of performance data for affordable or moderately priced housing, the literature suggests that such a strategy can offer both higher returns and lower volatility over time.A recent research paper, Moderate Income Rental Housing  Its Viability as an Asset Class for Real Estate Investment with Environmental, Social and Governance Criteria, used NCREIF data to estimate the performance of moderately priced rental properties against other segments of the NPI Apartment index, as well as comparing those results across other sectors.It found that between 2011 and 2021, moderately priced apartment properties produced a 9.3  return, outpacing all other major property sectors except for industrial  Exhibit 10 .4 The study can provide investors with some perspective and confidence as they look to increase exposure to the apartment sector.The apartment sector in both the U.S. and Europe continues to benefit from several structural tailwinds that are reshaping the way individuals live. Shifting dynamics within housing affordability and the distribution of income and wealth should provide the sector with a steady pace of demand over the coming decades.As the younger generations take over to become the dominant demographic groups in both size and spending power, we believe that investors should focus on the needs and desires of this growing pool of potential renters.The economic climate will dictate that investors focus on underserved segments of the income distribution, which will provide a stable renter base amid lower levels of affordability in the for-purchase market in both the U.S. and Europe.Shortages of rental units are also driving rents to unsustainable levels in many U.S. and European cities, thereby forcing many younger people to live at home longer.This has created a pool of untapped demand for the apartment market, particularly for affordable or moderately priced units. We believe that investors should concentrate on these underserved groups, particularly those in the middle third of the income distribution, which will allow for a diverse economic cross-section of renters at attainable entry points. , May 2021 , February 2023 Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2011 The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",1,2023-10-25T02:35:00.000-04:00

Jim will begin with some prepared remarks about the business and Sheri will follow with the financial review. Then we'll open up the call for questions.Today's call contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, and assumptions as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them after this call.Discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can be found in today's press release posted on our website.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. JimThank you, Rhonda. Total revenue for the third quarter came in as expected, increasing 3  over the second quarter. Our product business grew just over 5  as some WFE fundamental dynamics began to show small signs of improvement.We believe that some progress has been made for equipment inventory reduction throughout the system and expect several more quarters until normal levels are achieved.WeOur typically high-margin service business saw an abrupt decline in revenue due toFor the foreseeable future, we will continue to focus on optimizing our global footprint, driving operational efficiencies, and other strategic initiatives to further increase our value for our customers. These efforts will lay the foundation required to capitalize on share gain opportunities heading into the next ramp.We are in a strong position to increase our semi manufacturing leadership position with the available capacity and geographic flexibility to meet accelerated demand when it returns.Along those lines, we are very pleased to report that we have acquired HIS Innovations Group. They provide design, manufacturing, integration of components process solutions, and fully integrated subsystems to the semiconductor subfab segment.This acquisition adds a higher gross margin and value product offering, increases our vertical capabilities and synergies, extends our reach into the subfab area, and expands our addressable market by approximately  1.5 billion.With over 60 fabs under construction globally, this acquisition aligns with our long-term strategy to pursue sustained and profitable growth and will be rolled into our product division.Lastly, we are deeply saddened and concerned by the current events in the Middle East. We are taking the situation very seriously and I'm relieved to say that all our employees are accounted for and we're doing all we can to assist with their safety and well-being.Both of our facilities in Israel are running at the capacity required to meet production targets. Our commitment to support our customers worldwide remains a priority. Israel's policy ensures business continuity across the industrial segment, some ports and airports are currently functioning, and we can ship and receive the products and raw materials required to meet customer demand. We're also working together with other multinational companies that have substantial operations in Israel to ensure we are aligned and supporting each other.Overall, we are navigating through the demand variability in the current environment. Longer term, our increased scale, operational efficiencies, expanded capacity, and new capabilities position us well to maintain our leadership position and outperform the industry.And with that, I will turn the call over to Sheri.Thanks Jim and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. In today's discussion, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers only. As Jim noted, our products business performed well from a revenue standpoint in the third quarter. Our services business, however, was impacted by a sudden larger-than-expected reduction in wafer starts in Q3 and that impacted our overall profitability and earnings.Total revenue for the third quarter was  435 million compared to  421.5 million in the prior quarter. Revenue from products increased 5.1  to  380.9 million compared to  362.5 million last quarter. Services revenue was  54.1 million compared to  59 million in Q2 due to the scale back and wafer starts as I just mentioned.Total gross margin for the third quarter was 15.5  compared to 16.7  last quarter. Although product revenue grew sequentially, gross margin came in at 13.8  compared to 14.5  in the prior quarter and services was 27.4  compared to 30.3  in Q2.The reduction in margin was due to lower volumes for service and overall mix within each business unit. We continue to focus on cost improvements and operational efficiencies to strengthen profitability.Operating expenses for the quarter was  48.6 million compared with  49.4 million in Q2 and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 11.2  from 11.7 . Total operating margin for the quarter was 4.4  compared to 5  in the second quarter.Margins from our Products division was 4.5  compared to 4.3  in the prior quarter and services margin was 3.7  compared to 9.3  in the prior quarter. The drop in services margin was due to lower volumes and mix.Based on 45 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter was  0.04 on net income of  2 million compared to  0.16 on net income of  7.1 million in the prior quarter.Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.3  due to a shift in profits by geography. Our tax rate was trued up in Q3 for year-to-date expense and we expect our tax rate for Q4 and 2023 to be approximately 20 .Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents were  342 million, an increase of  21.2 million over Q2. Cash from operations was  36.2 million, similar to last quarter at  36.4 million.As we navigate through the current cycle, we will continue to manage our working capital. Given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and current industry dynamics, we are keeping our guidance range wide.With the addition of HIS Innovations Group, we project total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 between  420 million and  470 million. We expect EPS in the range of  0.02 to  0.22. This includes approximately  10 million of revenue and  0.01 of EPS for two months of operations from the acquisition.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator InstructionsThe first question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Krish. Let's see first just in terms of the service sales this quarter. I know they're a bit weaker on utilization rates last quarter, and you mentioned the sudden reduction of wafer starts impacting in September.Was there -- the main qualifier for this quarter  Or was there anything else in maybe just in terms of the mix that goes into the service division, if you've ever broken that down.Yes, hi Robert. The first part, we have seen reductions in wafer starts across the broad spectrum of fabs prior to this last quarter. What we saw early in the third quarter was one particular chipmaker, ratchet down mostly their memory fab pretty dramatically. They've been holding that up for half the time when others had already brought their utilizations down. So, that was -- I guess, you'd say, the last month will really fall. So, that was the main impact there.As far as your second question around the mix, I think maybe my answer on the first might answer that. But service is typically more dependent on logic than memory, but this is a rather large memory fab and had an outsized impact.Great. Thank you. And then maybe just real quick in terms of the timing of seeing the ramp down of that one customer is there any indication of maybe when the sales would pick back up. Is that something you think services would be growing next quarter or something more into calendar year 2024  Thanks.Yes, really difficult to predict. We're starting to see some of the fundamentals of supply and demand of these chips start to move towards a better balance. We start to see some ASP on some of these chips start to recover a bit.So, things are moving in the right direction, but as far as when the customers will start ramping up the supply side of the chips and use their utilization is up, it's still unclear. But I would say it's doubtful to see anything meaningful within this year.Great. Thank you. That s helpful.Operator Instructions  At this time, we're showing no more questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Scholhamer for any closing remarks.Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-25T19:57:08.000-04:00
"Mixed Signals For Earnings And Spending In Japan, But The BoJ Is Likely To Move On","We had expected to see some acceleration in earnings given the reasonably strong wage negotiation results from the last quarter, but disappointingly, headline growth rose 1.1  year-on-yearSeparately, real household spending rebounded 3.9  month-on-month in August, more than offsetting the previous month's decline of 2.7 . In year-on-year terms, it fell 2.5  versus 5.0  in July and the market consensus of 3.9 . We believe that household spending held up relatively well despite high inflation andThe Bank of Japan will meet for its upcoming policy decision meeting at the end of this month. The BoJ's policy choices are fairly limited, which puts the central bank in a difficult situation. Inflation has been above target for more than a year with no clear signs of slowing down, especially in core inflation. Meanwhile, both supply and demand inflationary pressures will likely add up even more in the coming months.The weak JPY is likely to pile more pressure on import product prices alongside the recent rise in global commodity prices, while strong tourism should also push up private service prices. Surveys and other activity data showed quite a solid recovery in services, which should remain the case in the second half of the year despite global headwinds.However, long-awaited wage growth remains quite lacklustre so far. As a result, the possibility of the BoJ hiking rates will be off the table for quite some time. Yet, the higher-for-longer narrative seen in the US pushed up JGB 10Y yields to the 0.8  level, which immediately raised concerns for the BoJ. We think it needs to respond to the recent market move with another yield curve control  YCC  policy change   and perhaps even consider the option of scrapping the policy. We believe that changes in forward guidance could be a good way to communicate with the market on its future policy move.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

"TotalEnergies: Energy Prices And Russia Drag On Earnings, But Still Decent Company","On Thursday, October 26, 2023, European energy supermajor TotalEnergies SE   its third quarter 2023 earnings results. At first glance, these results were mixed, as TotalEnergies managed to beat the expectations of its analysts in terms of revenueThe fact that TotalEnergies' revenues went down year-over-year is not necessarily anything that we need to worry about. After all, it was certainly not the only energy company to have experienced such a phenomenon with respect to its results. Exxon Mobil , which also reported lastAs long-time readers are no doubt well aware, it is my usual practice to share the highlights from a company's earnings results before delving into an analysis of its results. This is because these highlights provide a background for the remainder of the article as well as serve as a framework for the resultant analysis. Therefore, here are the highlights from TotalEnergies' third-quarter 2023 earnings resultsIt seems essentially certain that the first thing that anyone reviewing these highlights will notice is that many measures of TotalEnergies' financial performance came in weaker during the third quarter of 2023 than they did during the equivalent quarter of last year. One of the biggest reasons for this is that energy prices were lower on average during the most recent quarter than they were during the third quarter of last year. We can see this quite clearly hereWe can see that the price of oil did finally start to rise during this quarter following several months of suppression partly caused by the United States Federal Government flooding the market from oil using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Basically, as I  earlier this year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia made the decision to cut crude oil production in order to keep the balance between supply and demand very tight. In effect, what these cuts were intended to do was offset the impact of the sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The cuts remain in this place to this day, yet the Federal Government stopped selling oil from its stockpile back in mid-July. As of right now, there are 351.274 million barrels of crude oil in the nation's storage, which is the lowest level that has been seen since the early 1980sAs such, the United States probably cannot use its national storage stocks to artificially manipulate the price of crude oil anymore. After all, there is a minimum amount of crude oil that needs to be stored in the salt caverns simply to maintain their structural integrity. Thus, with the cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries remaining in effect, the balance between the supply and demand for crude oil became tighter and pushed up energy prices.However, we still see in the chart above that the average price of crude oil was lower in the third quarter of this year than during the equivalent quarter of last year. This is reflected in TotalEnergies' results, as the company reported that it received an average of  78.90 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the quarter compared to  93.60 per barrel of liquid hydrocarbons sold during the equivalent quarter of last year. It should be fairly obvious why this would have a negative impact on TotalEnergies' financial performance. After all, if the company received less money per unit of product sold, then its overall revenue will be lower all else being equal.However, all else is rarely equal with a company like TotalEnergies. As noted in the highlights, the company saw its production decline in the most recent quarter compared to the equivalent one last year. During the third quarter of 2023, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.476 million barrels of oil equivalents per day. That was a 7.23  decline from the 2.669 million barrels of oil equivalents per day that the company averaged during the year-ago quarter. That also had a negative impact on the company's financial performance. After all, a lower production means that it has fewer products that it can sell in exchange for money.When we combine the company's lower production with the fact that it received less money per unit of product sold, it should be fairly easy to see why the company's revenue would go down from period to period. The decline in revenue generally means that the company has less money available to cover its fixed expenses and similar things, which results in a decline in operating income. That is exactly what we see here.With that said, the company's crude oil production was actually up, even though its total production was down year-over-yearAs we can see, crude oil production went up by 101,000 barrels per day on average, which represents a 7.78  increase. This was more than offset by a massive decline in the company's production of natural gas, which decreased its oil-equivalent production overall. Perhaps the biggest reason for this appears to relate to the sanctions that the United States and the European Union have levied on Russia. According to a  that the company issued in March of 2022The company does not explicitly state in its earnings press release that it was the removal of Novatek  from its results reporting around the end of last year that is responsible for the production decline that we see reflected in these results. However, it seems likely as the company states that its hydrocarbon production went up once Novatek's production is excluded from the year-ago figures. During the third quarter of 2022, TotalEnergies produced an average of 2.356 million barrels of oil equivalents per day excluding Novatek's contribution to its upstream production figures. The company's production excluding Novatek was 2.476 million barrels per day on average during the most recent quarter. That was a 5.09  year-over-year increase. Thus, it seems likely that one major contributor to TotalEnergies' weaker financial performance year-over-year is because of the Russian sanctions that were levied due to the situation in Ukraine.TotalEnergies did benefit from a few new sources of production in the quarter. These include the following projectsThe company states that these projects alone increased its year-over-year hydrocarbon production by 5 . While this was partially offset by things such as natural field production declines and the aforementioned problems with TotalEnergies' stake in Novatek, it is still good to see that some projects are coming on that are having a positive impact on the company. Clearly, it is not all bad news here.As I have explained in numerous previous articlesAs of the time of writing, interest rates in most developed nations are at the highest rates that have been seen in many years. After all, most developed countries printed enormous amounts of money to help support their economies through the COVID-19 lockdowns and this sparked a worldwide inflation crisis. Most central banks in the Group of Twenty nations have been raising interest rates over the past two years in an effort to combat this inflation crisis. However, TotalEnergies has not really been impacted by rising rates so far. As we can see here, while the company's interest expenses have indeed been rising over the past few quarters, its investment income has also been risingThis is partly due to the fact that energy companies in general have been using some of their good fortunes from supportive energy prices over the past few years to strengthen their balance sheets. That has been quite necessary considering that the market has not been especially friendly to traditional energy companies in general. As might be expected given these two factors, TotalEnergies has been reducing its net debt over the past several quartersThis has allowed the company to offset some of the impact of higher rates as it has a lesser amount of debt upon which it needs to pay financing costs. Meanwhile, the company has kept its cash and cash equivalents at a relatively stable levelThis has allowed the company to increase the amount of interest that it collects from things such as money market funds and short-duration bonds. This has helped to offset the added amount of interest that the company needs to pay on the debt that it continues to carry. Thus, the company's net interest expenses have not really been too badly impacted by the rising rate environment. This is certainly a better situation than what we have seen with companies in sectors such as utilities  see .As is always the case, we should take a moment to have a look at TotalEnergies' financial structure. The usual way that we accomplish this is by looking at the net debt-to-equity ratio. As shown above, TotalEnergies had a net debt outstanding of  26.690 billion on September 30, 2023. On the same date, the company had a total equity of  118.424 billion. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.23 today. Here is how that compares to some of the company's peersAs we can see here, TotalEnergies has considerably more debt than comparable American companies but it does compare reasonably well to its European peers. This is a sign that the company is probably not overly reliant on debt to finance its operations. We should not have to worry too much about the company's debt load, even in today's relatively high-rate environment.TotalEnergies has long been known for offering a relatively high dividend yield compared to many other assets that are available in the market. It is not necessarily alone in this though, as the entire energy sector is one of the highest-yielding sectors in the market. Indeed, the iShares Global Energy ETF , which tracks a portfolio of major traditional energy companies from around the world currently yields 4.58 , which is substantially higher than many other sector index funds.For its part, TotalEnergies currently has a 4.64  yield so its stock certainly does not disappoint in this respect. After all, there are not very many common stocks that boast such a high yield and have relatively strong forward growth prospects. Unfortunately, TotalEnergies' dividend has not been especially stable over the yearsOne of the biggest reasons for this is that TotalEnergies declares and pays its dividends in euros, despite the fact that the company actually reports its results in U.S. dollars. The fact that it actually pays the dividend in euros means though that those investors who hold the American Depositary Receipts  which is anyone who buys the shares that trade on an American exchange  receive the U.S. dollar equivalent of the dividend. It is pretty common for foreign companies owned by American investors to have a dividend that fluctuates with exchange rates for this reason.As is always the case though, we want to ensure that the company can actually afford the dividends that it pays out. After all, we do not want to be the victims of an unexpected dividend cut since that would reduce our incomes and almost certainly cause the company's share price to decline.The usual way that we judge a company's ability to cover its dividend is by looking at its free cash flow. During the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2023, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of  27.2054 billion but only paid out dividends of  7.5940 billion. Thus, the company easily generated more than enough cash through its ordinary operations to cover its dividends.We see the same general thing when we measure the company's free cash flow and dividends in euros. During the twelve-month period, TotalEnergies reported a levered free cash flow of  25.7336 billion but only paid out  7.1832 billion in dividends to the shareholders. Thus, the company is clearly not having any particular difficulty maintaining its dividends. We should not need to worry too much about a potential cut., TotalEnergies will grow its earnings per share at a 9.30  rate over the next three to five years. This gives the stock a price-to-earnings growth ratio of 0.73 at the current price. That suggests that the stock is undervalued at the current price. However, as I have pointed out in a variety of articles and blog posts over the past several months, nearly everything in the traditional energy industry appears to be significantly undervalued right now.Thus, the best way for us to value the company is by comparing TotalEnergies' valuation to its peers in order to determine which stock offers the most attractive relative valuation.As we can see here, TotalEnergies appears to boast a very reasonable valuation relative to many of its peers. This could suggest that the company's stock is worth purchasing today. That is especially true considering the rather strong fundamentals for crude oil, which we have discussed in numerous previous articles here at Energy Profits in Dividends.In conclusion, TotalEnergies' third quarter 2023 earnings results were overall quite decent even if they were worse than the company's numbers during the prior-year quarter. The fact that energy prices were lower in the reporting period compared to 2022 was a major drag on the firm's performance and the sanctions that have been levied by the Western powers on Russia also do not help. Despite this though, TotalEnergies still looks like a reasonable purchase right now as the company's valuation remains attractive and its balance sheet is strong. The fact that it sports a 4.64  yield at the current price only adds to its appeal. Overall, the company may be worth considering today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Ladder Capital: The Perfect Storm,"A few days ago, I wrote a  highlighting a few of my favorite commercial mREITs.As I consistently remind readers, I like owning commercial mREITs because I get the best of bothNow, to be clear, price appreciation is not guaranteed.And neither are high dividends.And that s why I maintain a healthy mix of mREITs and preferreds.I ve been adding more of both to my REIT portfolio that now looks something like thisI like this blueprint because it provides me with enhanced yield  preferreds and mREITs  as well as attractive total return attributes.I was fortunate to get greedy during COVID-19 and increase my exposure within the commercial mREIT sector.Of course, these returns were generated during unprecedented times, andAs you can see  above ,  was one of my top COVID picks which means that our team had to dig deep into the business model in order to gain confidence in our Strong Buy recommendation.As you can see, LADR is now trading at  10.58  per share  and shares have returned 12.3  year to dateLet s dig deeper into this interesting commercial mREIT so you can see firsthand why I m buying more shares hand over fist.In case you re not familiar with mREITs, a few excerpts from our overviewWithin the commercial mREIT sector, you can break down the REITs into two categories They originate or purchase loans for their own balance sheet and hold these on their balance sheet. Examples include Blackstone Mortgage  and Apollo Commercial . They originate and or purchase loans for their own account  balance sheet  or to be sold into a securitized vehicle such as CMBS  conduit . Examples include Starwood Property  and Ladder Capital.While senior secured lending is Ladder s core business, the REIT is diversified as shown belowAs you can see, more than 50  of LADR s assets are unencumbered and 84  of these unencumbered assets are comprised of first mortgage loans, investment-grade securities, and cash and cash equivalents.LADR maintains a considerable surplus of unencumbered assets over the amount required by its covenants, currently totaling over  1 billion. This cushion provides the company with a great deal of flexibility and enhances its liquidity profile.The balance sheet portfolio totals  3.5 billion with a weighted average coupon of 9.15 .Breaking down the loan portfolio, LADR focuses on middle market borrowers with an average loan size of  25 million  largest loan in the portfolio is  221 million . Compare that with these peersThis means that LADR takes a nimbler approach and is less exposed to large loans that could result in concentration risks. Since inception in 2008, Ladder has originated  45 billion of loans in more than 475 cities across 48 states.As you can see, Ladder is not a construction lender and has modest funding of just  272 million  as of Q2-23 . Importantly, the company s loan portfolio is 99  senior secured  first mortgage loans  with an average LTV  loan to value  of 67 . Compare that with these peersAs you can see above, LADR s loan portfolio is comprised ofWhile LADR is exposed to the office sector, 75  of these loans were originated post-COVID.In addition, two of the office loans  Miami and Aventura  account for 36  of the office exposure. These two larger loans  221 million and  110 million  have 30  borrower equity  around  138 million in total  with excellent performance.LADR did add a new loan to nonaccrual in Q2-23, a  35 million loan on a mixed-use asset in which LADR is pursuing foreclosure. The borrower s basis is  55 million which is comprised of 174 newly constructed multifamily units and three floors of office and commercial space in Pittsburgh.As mentioned previously, LADR owns around  900 million of  brick and mortar  real estate that consists of net lease properties  72  of real estate owned  and others  28 .The net lease portfolio consists of 156 properties leased to high-quality tenants  69  investment grade  like BJs, Walgreens, and Dollar General. The portfolio s gross asset value is around  663 million with a weighted average remaining lease term of nine years.The net lease portfolio generates  41.7 million of NOI and the other properties generate around  18.8 million annually.LADR s CMBS business is mostly confined to five-year loans, the carrying value of the securities portfolio is around  458 million, comprised of 82  AAA-rated and 99  investment-grade rated securities.In Q2 LADR received  75 million of paydowns. In Q2 LADR began to take advantage of opportunities to add to its securities portfolio by acquiring additional AAA CLO securities that are currently offering highly attractive returns.As of Q2-23 LADR had  1.1 billion of liquidity with a leverage ratio of 1.7x. This liquidity was comprised of  777 million plus undrawn revolver capacity of  324 million  with a maturity in 2027 .Unsecured bonds anchor the capital stack with  1.6 billion outstanding, or 40  of debt with a weighted maturity of 4.3 years with an attractive fixed rate cost of capital of 4.7  average coupon.LADR has a strong financial condition with a corporate credit rating one notch from investment grade  two of three rating agencies . LADR has a  50 million share buyback authorization in place with  44 million of remaining capacity  no purchases in Q2-23 .One key differentiator for LADR is its modest total leverage with a highly durable composition of financing alternatives.LADR emphasizes on unsecured and non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing with a substantial unencumbered asset base  as shown below .84  of unencumbered assets are cash, first mortgage loans, or investment grade securitiesAnother differentiator for LADR is management.The company is one of the few internally managed mREITs in which management and directors own  10  of the company  150 million equity investment . Also, employees are compensated based on profits and with a significant portion in stock.The executive management team averages 27 years of industry experience and the majority of the management team has worked together for  25 years.As seen below, this deep bench of seasoned professionals   managers average 11 years at Ladder and 23 years of industry experience.As seen below, LADR trades at  10.58 per share with a P E multiple of 8.1x   around 50  below the normal P E.The dividend yield is 8.7 , lower than most of the peers that average around 11 .Like many mREITs, LADR s earnings history is choppy.Unlike traditional equity REITs, mREITs like LADR generate revenue from loans which makes the earnings stream less predictable.As you can see below, the company generated EPS of  2.03 in 2018 and fell to  .49 in 2021. In 2022 the company generated EPS of  1.16 and analysts forecast  1.37 in 2023.LADR was forced to reduce its dividend in 2020 which resulted in a dividend payout of  .80 in 2021.Last year LADR paid out  .88 per share and currently the company is paying out  .23 per share  .92 per share annualized .Analysts are forecasting EPS of  1.37 in 2023, which means there s a cushion in which the company could payout a special dividend this year  which it has in previous years .Using the analyst numbers, LADR s payout ratio in 2023 is around 67 .As one analyst pointed out on the Q2-23 earnings call, LADR has  significantly over-earned it  dividend  year-to-date  which means that there s a good chance that LADR will boost the dividend  and perhaps gift a special dividend in December .Let s compare a few peersNow let s compare LADR s P E with the peersInterestingLADR has the lowest payout ratio and one of the best balance sheets in the sector and yet shares are trading at a discount  to the peers .Now let s take a look at analyst estimates for 2024 and 2025.While LADR may be the lowest-paying mREIT on our shopping list, we believe the total return prospects are compelling. The dividend is well protected, and I like the fact that LADR owns real estate  mostly net lease real estate .I believe shares are worth more than  10.58 and they could fetch as much as  12.00.Given the fact that commercial banks are slowing down dramatically  which faces more pressure on small developers with lingering debt maturities , LADR is well positioned to capitalize on new demand.Some of the demand will be in the form of traditional senior secured lending, and some will be in the form of growing mezzanine loans. As CEO, Brian Harris, said,  This is a market that is ripe for mezzanine lending, obviously, in special situations.I like this line of thinking.Traditionally mezz loans are riskier, but Harris is looking to provide an A B component which means splitting up the senior secured  in a 10-year fixed rate instrument  and the mezz loan  on LADR s books .Given the fact that LADR s wheelhouse is  middle market  customers  average  25 million loan size , this could create a lot of demand.Of course, LADR has plenty of powder right now   around  900 million   and I suspect the company will begin to put that to good use sooner than later.We believe LADR could return over 20  annually, which ain't bad given the fact that the yield is currently 8.7  with a likely boost coming soon.If I were a regional developer  like I once was  and I knew my shopping center loan was coming due  and my bank would not renew it , I would be knocking on LADR's door.Remember folks, the game is all about supply and demand.And managing risk is what separates the best from the rest.I like my odds with LadderJoin  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREIT, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, Builders, Asset Managers, and we added Prop Tech SPACs to the lineup.We recently added an all-new Ratings Tracker called iREIT Buy Zone to help members screen for value. .And this offer includes a .Brad Thomas has over 30 years of real estate investing experience and has acquired, developed, or brokered over  1B in commercial real estate transactions.

"Clarus: Promising Initiatives, But Risks Still Present","Shares of Clarus  have fallen 20  YTD. Despite the fact that the company's management is quite optimistic about the future performance of the business, I believe that it is still not the best time to open aDespite significant pressure on both revenue growth and operating margins, management is fairly optimistic for the second half of 2023, but I believe the company's financials will continue to be under pressure in the next quarter, while shares are still not cheaply priced. In addition, the improvement in profitability is largely due to the recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment, which, in my personal opinion, is associated withClarus designs, develops, and manufactures outdoor equipment and products. The main business segments are Outdoor  48  of revenue , Precision Sports  31  of revenue  and Adventure  21  of revenue . The company makes sales both in the domestic market  56  of revenue  and in the international market  44  of revenue . The company was founded in 1957.The company . The company's . Domestic sales were down 27.2  YoY and international sales were down 27.1  YoY. In terms of business segments, the largest contribution to the decline in revenue was made by the Outdoor segment, where revenue decreased by 23.8  YoY, while in the Precision Sports and Adventure segments sales decreased by 26.7  YoY and 34.2   YoY, respectively. You can see the details of the revenue mix changes in the graph below.Gross profit margin decreased from 38.0  in Q2 2022 to 36.7  in Q2 2023 due to unfavourable changes in product mix and unfavourable FX. Separately, I would like to note the change in gross profit margin for each of the segments. Thus, we see the greatest decrease in the Precision Sports segment, where gross profit margin decreased from 44.9  to 31.7  due to the need to reduce prices due to high inventory levels in the industry, and in the Outdoor and Adventure segments, gross profit margin increased from 33.1  to 37.5  and from 38.5  to 42.2 , respectively. SGA expenses   of revenue  increased from 30.8  in Q2 2022 to 36.1  in Q2 2023.Operating margin decreased from 6.8  in 2Q 2022 to -0.3  in 2Q 2023. In the graph below, I would also like to demonstrate adjusted operating income, because in the 4th quarter of 2022, the company faced one-time expenses for impairment of goodwill and indefinitely-lived intangible assets in the amount of  92.3 million.If we pay attention to the operating margin by business segment, we see that profitability continues to decline in all segments. Thus, operating margin in the Outdoor segment decreased from 2.8  to -3.1 , and in the  Precision Sports  and  Adventure  from 34.8  to 20.4  and from 2.4  to -2.8 , respectively.In addition, the company published guidance for 2023. Thus, management expects that in the second half of the year the company will show a decrease in revenue growth rates in the range from 0.5  to 7.3 , and the adjusted EBITDA margin will improve to 20.6 -22.8 .On the one hand, I am impressed by the current management initiatives  transforming our product development and innovation process, improving customer service and digital transformation , which are aimed at restoring business revenue growth rates and improving profitability.However, on the other hand, in my personal opinion, the operational and financial performance may take longer to recover, so I expect the company's financial performance to continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters. First, I think pressure on sales in the Outdoor segment  48  of revenue  will continue in the second half of 2023 because I do not expect a quick recovery in consumer spending, even if we see a slowdown in inflation, because consumers will continue to face increased day-to-day costs. If we look at  following the earnings release, we can see that management is talking about similar trends.In addition, the company published strong guidance, which implies a recovery in growth rates and profitability, however, if we look at the guidance in more detail, we can see that the main recovery is associated only with the 4th quarter of 2023, while in the next quarter  3Q 23  the pace Sales growth will continue to be under significant pressure.I would also like to note that the restoration of profitability is associated with an improvement in gross margin in the Precision Sports segment, where the company experienced the largest decline. However, it is my personal opinion that high inventory levels in the industry, consumer pressure from macro headwinds, and a decrease in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home will continue to put pressure on profitability in the segment. So I think the current guidance looks optimistic, but the financials are still quite uncertain.Moreover, I think that additional pressure on profitability may be exerted by the deleverage effect due to a decrease in the scale of the business because part of the operating expenses  salaries, distribution  is fixed. lower consumer spending, high industry inventory levels, and a decline in the amount of time people choose to spend outside the home could put pressure on revenue growth rates in the coming quarters. investments in prices, unfavourable product mix, unfavourable changes in FX, increased marketing costs, and deleverage effects due to reduced economies of scale may have a negative impact on the operating profitability of the business. launch of new products, simplification of the cooperation model with partners, and expansion of the e-commerce platform for B2B and B2C sales may contribute to revenue growth in the future. recovery of gross margin in the Precision Sports segment due to the normalization of supply and demand before the hunting season can provide significant support to the operating profitability of the business.Valuation Grade is C . In accordance with the P E  FWD  and EV EBITDA  FWD  multiples, the company's shares are trading at 7.5x and 8.5x, respectively, which implies a discount to the sector median of about 47  and 7 , respectively. Despite the fact that the stock doesn't look expensive, I believe investors need to wait for the next quarter's financial results before making a purchase decision because  1  I believe the company deserves a discount based on the size of the business 2   shares may trade at relatively low prices for long periods of time in the absence of clear growth drivers catalysts  revenue growth, improved profitability .Thus, at the moment my recommendation is hold. I believe that pressure on both revenue growth and profitability may continue in the coming quarters, while the shares are still not cheaply priced. I will be happy to change my recommendation to buy if I see that the company is able to demonstrate stable and sustainable improvements in financial performance in both domestic and international markets.

Argentina Lithium: $90 Million Investment From Stellantis Implies A Substantial Upward Rerate,"Argentina Lithium   Energy Corp.  has been a trending stock in Canada since the afternoon of September 27th when it  a  90 million USD-equivalent investment made by Stellantis N.V. . StellantisDespite the move up, I believe that LIT still has an upside potential of over 100  as a  0.55 stock price implies a  72 million CAD market cap, less than the money being received in the deal. Not only does LIT require a substantial upward re-rate, I believe that this deal is an absolute game-changer for all junior lithium plays in the region.Canadian junior market traders have witnessed a long history of claims from microcap resource explorers getting deals with larger companies that were either faked or greatly overstated. So there was understandably some nervousness or skepticism about this deal. Once it closed and documentation on SEDAR  the Canadian equivalent to SEC.gov  filed, there was no longer any issue about the deal being fake. What remains are two other criticisms1. Stellantis overpaid for LIT and could have just bought it out for that level of investment.2. Stellantis overpaid for LIT relative to other lithium players in Argentina.Had Stellantis just offered  90 million in a takeover offer, it likely would have succeeded in a buyout attempt based on the stock price prior to the deal being announced. However, Stellantis isn't interested in making an investment in a lithium company the same way private investors would, nor is it interested in operating a mine itself. Its interest in LIT is primarily in sourcing and securing a supply of lithium in Argentina so that it has enough of the resources to build its fleet of electric vehicles. It is willing to far overpay relative to market cap in order to ensure that LIT has enough cash and financial motivation to build out a mine and ship lithium to the company's front door starting in 2028. Stellantis has the right of first refusal on any future financing needed or sale of lithium to third parties on production beyond the 15,000 tonnes outlined in the offtake agreement. Further evidence that the company's primary motivation is securing supply and making sure LIT has the cash to get the mine operational, regardless of cost.The second argument is a more interesting one, and could imply a substantial upward re-rate for other junior lithium players that have mostly been overlooked while the price of lithium has crashed recently. But after speaking with LIT's CEO Nikolaos Cacos, it's clear that Stellantis had direct company-related reasons to target LIT. The two companies were negotiating the deal for over a year, and closed it despite the drop in the price of lithium. One prime motivating factor was Joseph Grosso being the Chairman of LIT, and the . Grosso has a history of success bringing resource projects to operations in Argentina, a very important factor when dealing with the sensitive and volatile nature of the country's geopolitical and economic climate.The other major motivating factor was location. LIT's  is Rincon West, a 3,742.8 hectare-sized land package  460.5 hectares wholly owned, the rest under option  that is adjacent to Rio Tinto Group . Rio   825 million for the 83,000 hectares of mining rights from Rincon Mining less than two years ago. Stellantis was very interested in securing supply from this specific spot as the lithium arm's race in the Argentinian Lithium Triangle heats up.However, Stellantis isn't solely interested in Rincon West, although that will likely be the near-term focus. LIT has three projects just south of Rincon West with Antofalla North, Pocitos and Incahuasi being approximately 10,000, 26,000 and 25,000 hectare projects, respectively. So Rincon only makes up around 5  of the total land in the Lithium Triangle that is either wholly owned or under option to LIT. There is a lot of lithium potential for this company and it's all proximal to each other, which was likely the clinching factor for Stellantis calling first dibs. In this context, a  60 billion market cap company  overpaying   90 million for a  20  stake in a company that has secured about 65,000 hectares within the Triangle makes sense.The company's  shows that Rincon has an active drill program underway with drilling planned in Antofalla North in 2024. These projects are all in the early to very early stages and will take years before fully operational mines are present, but this is no issue for Stellantis as it's looking to secure resource for planned production five years from now. The single biggest obstacle to roadmaps being achieved in the junior capital world is a company's ability to fund all of its plans. With that obstacle removed for LIT and a large partner interested in seeing things move along as quickly as possible, I expect these timelines to be met or possibly even exceeded. Subject to timing of government permits and availability of equipment and labor in the region.If we are thinking from the perspective of a large automaker trying to secure supply within a competitive Lithium Triangle, Stellantis didn't overpay, it paid the amount it needed to pay to accomplish a needed goal for future development plans. I liken this to an NFL football team that is desperate to secure a quarterback in the draft with the 5th overall pick. The teams drafting ahead of them already picked quarterbacks. Now this team has to draft what it feels is the next best one available with the 5th pick, even if that QB is rated the 10th or 15th or 20th or 25th best prospect overall by all the so-called experts. The team will have tryouts and interviews with the QBs leading up to the draft, and then analyze which one still available best fits their organization.It doesn't matter what other people think of LIT's land package or accomplishments relative to other junior explorers in the region. They aren't the multi-billion dollar vehicle manufacturer ponying up  90 million betting on LIT's future ability to perform. It only matters what Stellantis thinks. The rest of the investment community must make its own buy and sell decisions knowing that Stellantis is highly motivated and capable to ensure LIT succeeds.As one member of that investment community, I have to assess what I believe to be a fair value for LIT based on the information I have, as well as the caveats and potential roadblocks that must be overcome to get to that valuation in a timely fashion.As with every explorer, LIT is pre-revenue. It has about  2 million in expenses a quarter and this burn rate will substantially increase going forward as it attempts to accomplish the plans laid out in the roadmap for its four properties. Given the substantial investment by Stellantis, I believe that financing risk is completely taken off the table, as long as Stellantis remains a solvent entity. Any unexpected cost overruns or delays to expected production in 2028 might result in dilution but won't result in insolvency. I expect the cash runway from the investment to be a minimum of three years and if that cash is spent wisely, any further financing will happen at a superior valuation than today.Argentina has historically been reasonably friendly to mining, and I don't expect that to change given the economic opportunity that lithium will provide the country. Being a member of the Grosso Group and getting the deal with Stellantis are two pieces of assurance that the company will be able to navigate at least one project through to production by 2028.Stellantis is paying  90 million for an option to hold a 19.9  stake in the public listing, fully diluted. If Stellantis exercises this option, it would receive 53 million shares  out of a then total 266 million , essentially paying approximately  1.70 USD or  2.30 CAD for the shares. The simplistic analysis would be that if Stellantis is willing to pay that much, investors should be able to feel comfortable holding until at least that price range. But it may not be that simple.The first issue to overcome is that this deal is in Argentinian Pesos. Due to the country's high inflation rate, the currency has been on a consistent downward trajectory. Therefore, LIT is looking to transfer most of that cash into USD and CAD, with some expected slippage in the 10  range. I expect the net result to be  80 million USD or  110 million in CAD.There are currently 130.2 million shares outstanding along with 71.7 million warrants with a weighted average strike of  0.44 and 11.3 million stock options with a weighted average strike of  0.31. In the week between announcing the deal and closing the deal, SEDAR documentation shows that 150,000 warrants were exercised for shares. This share overhang may have accounted for the pullback in the stock price and may continue to apply some selling pressure going forward. Upon exercise of all of those derivatives, the share count would increase to 213 million but would also lead to an additional  35 million in cash.Between the  110 million CAD-equivalent received from the Stellantis deal and  35 million from the exercise of derivatives, total cash in the bank would be  145 million,  0.68 per share. This is a reasonable floor valuation for LIT. The cash from Stellantis is earmarked for exploration and mine development costs or the purchase of additional properties in Argentina with some corporate expenses allowed. It can't be used for purposes like buying back stock or paying dividends. However, I don't see how cash received from the exercising of warrants would have that same restriction. It might seem silly to use cash received from the exercise of warrants to buy back shares, but in this circumstance, it makes sense to do so should the stock remain below the  0.68 level for an extended period of time. That may be one way to offset any overhang from the warrants being exercised.The component of the deal that will provide LIT investors with the highest long-term value is the offtake agreement. It calls for  up to  15,000 tonnes per annum of lithium produced over a seven-year period. However, with the way the offtake agreement is worded, I interpret it as Stellantis being at LIT's all-you-can-eat lithium restaurant and other customers only being allowed in once Stellantis has had its fill. For the purpose of my analysis, I will assume 15,000 tonnes shipped starting in 2028. The price paid by Stellantis will be market pricing based on the prior calendar quarter's price of the relevant sub-type of lithium as quoted by Fastmarkets with a small freight discount.Violent swings in the price of lithium will likely continue, making price predictions for 2028 difficult. Though the bearish movement seen in 2023 is very unlikely to be the same market sentiment five years from now, unless a new battery technology comes along that puts a significant damper on the demand for Li-ion batteries. Pricing is much more likely to be above  50,000 per tonne than  20,000 per tonne, but I will take a reasonably conservative middle-ground price of  30,000 per tonne.From there it's a matter of simple math. 15,000 tonnes at  30,000 per tonne is  450 million in revenue. Assuming a 35  margin, that's  158 million in gross margin. Take off another  30 million or so for SG A and 25  for taxes and LIT is left with approximately  100 million per year in net income. Apply a 10x multiple and we are looking at a billion dollar company. Now it's time to look at the obstacles to be overcome in order to get to that level.As I mentioned before, this deal takes financing risk off of the table. Any additional funds needed for construction will be found. However, that will come at the cost of dilution. While Stellantis wouldn't have signed this deal without having a strong inkling that LIT will have the resource ready for shipment starting in 2028, until we have feasibility studies available on the properties, this remains a big  if  for the investment community. As seen in the roadmap above, LIT is still at the starting stages of drilling.Based on the vague nature of the economics and timing of lithium operations - the same level of vagueness any early-stage explorer would have - I require a discount rate of 75 . That would take the billion dollar valuation down to  250 million. My analysis assumes LIT's full ownership of the operating subsidiary, and that Stellantis exercised its option to convert into shares, leading to a total of 266 million outstanding. All cash would be used in mine development so nothing would be available to buy back shares or could be added to the enterprise value to pad the valuation. This leads to a  0.94 US per share target, or approximately  1.30 for LIT's Canadian listing.The steep 75  discount is a by-product of a 4-5 year wait before LIT generates revenue, a lithium price which has been volatile and will continue to be volatile towards 2028  though I expect more upside than downside , and the fact that we have no economic reports out to assess construction costs, cost to mine, grade or total resource estimate yet. If any of these variables were to be substantially below mine and Stellantis' expectations, it would hurt the  1.30 price target. Conversely, if these issues met or exceeded expectations, the stock should head towards this target. But because of the strong cash balance today, I believe the floor on LIT is high enough that there is an asymmetrical reward-to-risk outcome even in a less than favorable performance scenario.I have three ways to evaluate a fair price target on LIT. First, the CAD cash per share estimate assuming all derivatives are exercised leads to  0.68. That could be seen as a minimum target for short-term holders who aren't really that interested in the lithium story, but want to take advantage of the opportunity provided by Stellantis' aggressive cash-heavy investment. The second method would be to use Stellantis' valuation based on paying  90 million US for a 19.9  stake, leading to a valuation of over  600 million CAD or  2.30 per share. The third would be to take my back-of-the-napkin math on the offtake agreement to come to  1.30 per share, then re-assess the position should the stock price hit that level but company accomplishments might require an improved discount rate. No matter what method I use, at  0.55, LIT is ambiguously a buy and hold.Going back to my NFL Draft analogy, let's say Team Stellantis decided to draft the QB that was deemed the 15th best pick by the pundits. Now only the 10th, 20th and 25th best-rated players are available at the QB position. The options for QB for the rest of the teams just dropped from four to three, and it also doesn't preclude Team Stellantis from drafting another quarterback because they plan to do A LOT of passing in the next few years. Okay, so the analogy isn't perfect, but it gets the point across. Stellantis just made an aggressive move to take one junior explorer from the Lithium Triangle essentially for itself, but that doesn't mean that it's done. Buyout offers for  and  have also taken place in 2023, further limiting cheap junior options to securing lithium supply.This M A activity makes the remaining explorers inherently more valuable and the companies looking for lithium supply more desperate. We should be seeing a substantial upward re-rate across the board in Argentina, but the price action since LIT's deal first came to light hasn't indicated as such so far.One such floundering company is Lithium South Development Corporation , which sits just about at its 52-week low. It sits around a  40 million CAD market cap, a little more than half where LIT is now without a  90 million deal. There may be a good reason for that as LIS is further along with its drilling and resource estimate.Lithium South's flagship project is , which sits right in between LIT's Rincon West and Antofella projects. There are a number of larger players in the region, namely POSCO Holdings Inc.  which is directly adjacent to LIS' 5,687 hectare project.LIS  a preliminary economic assessment in the past and has recently  its lithium resource estimate by 175  after further drilling in 2022 and 2023. It now has 1,583,100 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent with 1,462,900 of that being measured. If there was another company looking for 15,000 tonnes of LCE per year, it appears that LIS would be able to provide that for the next 100 years.LIS is a company I own and therefore have more familiarity, but there are numerous publicly traded companies with early-stage projects in the Lithium Triangle, such as Argosy Minerals Limited , Lithium Energi Exploration Inc.  and NOA Lithium Brines Inc. . Companies with holdings primarily in Chile but within or close to the Triangle also can't be overlooked, such as Lithium Chile Inc.  or First Lithium Minerals Corp. FLM CA . I encourage investors who are interested in the region to do some research into those names.Junior lithium companies have been pounded into the ground due to the general bearish market in the small-cap space and with the diving price of lithium in particular. What LIT's deal with Stellantis shows, along with other M A activity in the region, is that high interest rates, inflation and general geopolitical instability is not going to stop the supply and demand imbalance of the lithium industry. The electric vehicle manufacturers will determine the viability of this industry, not the general macro climate nor Wall Street pundits. If a deal like this between LIT and Stellantis can be made in the fall of 2023, imagine what the value of lithium companies in Argentina will be when bullish supercycles become the buzzwords of day again.

URNM: Your Stepping Stone To Uranium Mining," is exposed to U.S.-listed uranium miners. Here I discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of investing in this space. I also discuss the key drivers behind URNM andUranium serves as the crucial fuel for nuclear energy, playing a pivotal role in supporting our transition towards a net-zero carbon future. Nuclear energy possesses a distinct advantage in providing a cost-effective, dependable, flexible, and scalable source of baseload power.Unlike renewable sources like wind and solar, nuclear power generation does not rely on favorable weather conditions, making it highly reliable and available around the clock and during different seasons.Furthermore, its scalability ensures that we can meet increasing energy demands without the need for extensiveInvestors who understand the need for uranium but don't want to figure out how to invest in this space may consider investing in an ETF, like the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF.URNM is a U.S.-listed uranium ETF focused on uranium miners and physical uranium. Below you'll see its top holding by weight.What should jump out to you is that this ETF is significantly weighted towards Cameco  with 17  of its total weight. That being said, it also includes a range of other miners.And this brings me to another consideration. As investors in this space, you may be aware that this ETF is not the only ETF offering similar exposure. Indeed, the Global X Uranium ETF  is for the most part quite similar. There are some minor differences, such as substantially more concentration, for instance, Cameco makes up a quarter of the URA ETF rather than less than 20  with URNM, but I don't believe that's a real game-changer.I know that this may irk some readers, who may point out that URA has more liquidity or an ever-so-slightly lower expense ratio, but I believe this is overthinking the uranium thesis.I contend that the uranium thesis is either going to work or it's not. And that's tied, for the most part, to uranium prices.And if it does, one ETF may be slightly less volatile, meaning the URNM will probably be slightly less volatile given it is less concentrated at the top, but overall they are tied to the same idea, which is indirectly the uranium price, see below.If the underlying commodity, uranium, does well, the whole sector will move higher.Furthermore, readers should also know that the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF is not the only way to seek exposure.In my opinion, the drawback of investing in URNM or URA is the cyclical nature of the uranium industry. As you know, the uranium mining industry is cyclical. When uranium prices are high, mining companies can thrive, but this will bring on excess uranium supply, which will dampen uranium prices.That being said, I would counter that notion by asserting that in the next couple of years, there appears to be a shortfall between uranium supply and demand estimates.As you can see above, there are close to 200 million pounds of uranium in demand right now, with around 150 million in production. Meanwhile, even now, despite more attention towards this sector, it remains quite a small space, see below.And opening a new uranium mine can take many years, requiring capital and favorable regulation.Yes. I believe that if one is right on the thesis, one may consider investing in a uranium producer, such as Uranium Energy Corp.   disclosure  I'm long UEC . Investors don't need to only consider UEC  indeed, there are several other uranium producers in North America that are also worthwhile considering.The significant advantage of investing in the producers, rather than an ETF, is that individual producers will benefit from operating leverage. However, the drawback will be the volatility of the underlying stock.Investing in the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF offers exposure to U.S.-listed uranium miners, which is essential given uranium's critical role in supporting the transition to a net-zero carbon future through nuclear energy.This energy source boasts cost-effectiveness, reliability, flexibility, and scalability, providing a stable baseload power supply that isn't dependent on weather conditions, unlike renewables like wind and solar. URNM, although slightly less concentrated compared to other similar ETFs, presents an opportunity for investors to tap into this sector.However, it's important to understand that the uranium industry is cyclical, with potential fluctuations in uranium prices. Yet, with a current demand-supply gap, uranium producers like Uranium Energy Corp. offer a more leveraged investment option, albeit with higher volatility.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

"D.R. Horton: Likely To Outperform, Despite The Cyclical Housing Market","D.R. Horton  is a stock that requires no introduction, as the largest homebuilder by volume in the US since 2002.With a well-diversified home portfolio rangingDHI's performance over the past few quarters exceeded expectations indeed, with growing home sales and backlog, despite the elevated borrowing costs and uncertain macroeconomic outlook.For example, the  Mortgage Average is still highly inflated at 7.49   0.59 points MoM   0.83 YoY  as of October 05, 2023, compared to the 2019 averages of 3.8 .The US housing shortage is likely triggered by the  at 4.04M units in August 2023  -0.03M MoM  -0.4M YoY  as well, compared to the hyper-pandemic era peak of over 6.5M homes and August 2019 levels of 5.25M homes.The combination of reduced inventory and robust housing demand has directly triggered the expansion in the  to  420.28K by August 2023  -2.9  YoY   47.3  from August 2019 median of  285.27K .Based on these developments, Chen Zhao, lead of Redfin's  economics research, also projects that home prices may remain elevated moving forwardFor now, DHI has been able to report an  of  9.1B   5.1  YoY  in FQ3'23. This is on top of its impressive home  land sale gross margins of 23.2   1.5 points QoQ  -6.7 YoY , compared to the   -1.4 points YoY .Part of its tailwinds may be attributed to the management's price adjustments and increased incentives  to  caused by higher mortgage rates.These strategies may have narrowed the gap of the median sales price between  and  to only 5.4  at  407.10K and  430.40K by August 2023, respectively. This is compared to 11  in August 2022 and 14.7  in August 2019.These developments have naturally resulted in increased demand for new homes, as demonstrated by DHI's growing net sales orders of  8.7B in the latest quarter  1.1  QoQ   26  YoY .Despite these incentives, the homebuilding company still records a robust Return On Equity  ROE  of 24.3   and a Homebuilding Return On Inventory  ROI  of 31.8  over the LTM  -9.9 points sequentially .These numbers also well exceed its FY2019 levels of 17.2   -0.4 points YoY  and 18.1   -2.1 points YoY , respectively.As a result of its outperformance thus far, investors need not fret about DHI's growing total inventories of  22.98B in the latest quarter  1.8  QoQ   6.1  YoY  in our opinion, which are compared to its FY2019 levels of  11.28B  8.5  YoY .This is because 44.8  of its total inventories is attributed to residential lots held for sale, 14.4  is attributed to its ongoing rental portfolio, and  33.7  is attributed to construction in progress.With only a small percentage of its total inventories attributed to completed and unsold units at  6.9 , based on our estimation, it is apparent that new housing demand remains red hot no matter the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.The estimated numbers above are based on the DHI management's FQ3'23 report hereThe DHI management has also offered a FQ4'23 consolidated revenue guidance of  9.9B  1.8  QoQ   2.8  YoY  and home sales gross margins of 23.75  at the midpoint  0.45 points QoQ  , compared to .For now, the Fed expects to achieve its  only by 2026, implying that the higher interest rate environment may also continue for a little longer.These factors point to DHI's likely outperformance over the next few years, since the gap between existing and new house median prices may remain narrow for a little longer, naturally sustaining its profitability and backlog as discussed above.For now, DHI mostly trades at impacted FWD valuations compared to its 5Y means, though still improved compared to its 1Y means and the sector medians, implying Mr. Market's confidence in its outperformance compared to its peers.For example, DHI is expected to sustain its impressive pandemic era-like outperformance ahead, with the consensus FY2025 estimates implying more-than-doubled top line expansions and more-than-tripled bottom line expansions against the pre-pandemic levels. This is on top of the normalized EPS CAGR of  38.3  between FY2016 and FY2022.This growth rate well exceeds the second and third-largest homebuilding companies in the US, Lennar Corporation  at a normalized CAGR of  26.4  and PulteGroup  at  28  between FY2016 and FY2022, demonstrating why we believe DHI deserves premium valuations.Based on the consensus FY2026 adj EPS estimates of  15.66 and its adj FWD P E valuations of 7.83x, we are also looking at a long-term price target of  122.61, implying the DHI stock's decent upside potential of  17.5  from current levels.Then again, thanks to DHI's impressive rally since 2020, the stock's forward dividend yield of 0.96  appears lackluster compared to its 5Y average of 1.09  and sector median of 2.51 .With it currently retesting its previous 2021 and 2022 resistance levels in the  100s range, there may also be moderate volatility in the near term.As a result, while there appears to be a relatively attractive risk  reward ratio for DHI, warranting our Buy rating, interested investors may want to observe the situation for a little longer and add according to their dollar cost averages.While market analysts from the National Association of Realtors  NAR  have already postulated the end of  the August 2023 data still indicates a very tight housing supply at 3.3 months. This is compared to  the historical , which is associated with moderate price appreciation  and  a .Since 82.4  of all American homeowners report an average fixed-rate mortgage rate of , market supply may remain tight over the next few years of an elevated interest rate environment, potentially delaying the eventual recovery of the US property market.While DHI is a homebuilding company and therefore, not directly exposed to the resale market condition, the ongoing headwinds may still pose uncertainty to its eventual valuation and stock recovery. This implies that the stock is only suitable for investors who are patient and have a higher risk appetite.Lastly, investors must also note that the housing market is highly cyclical, with the macroeconomic outlook remaining uncertain over the next few years. While  is still robust in September 2023, we believe that the housing market may remain sluggish moving forward, due to the imbalance between supply and demand.This is a chicken and egg problem, in our opinion.

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services: Things Are Likely To Get Worse Before Getting Better - Sell,"  Last year, Israel-based liner company ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd., or  ZIM,  attracted strong retail investor interest dueWhile ZIM barely makes the Top 10 of the world's largest liner companies, the company has pocketed its fair share of the recent container shipping bonanza.Since  on the Big Board in early 2021, ZIM has declared a whopping  38.45 per share in dividends.Like all liner companies, ZIM has been enjoying record-high earnings and cash flows for most of the past two years, but with container rates essentially back at pre-pandemic levels and significantly increased operating expensesLast month, ZIM  weak second quarter earnings, with freight rates down 67  on a year-over-year basis thus resulting in negative Adjusted EBIT and Net IncomeZIM's total cash position  which includes cash and cash equivalents and investments in bank deposits and other investment instruments  decreased by more than  1 billion sequentially to  3.24 billion, mostly due to the massive true-up dividend payment for 2022 and material debt service paymentsNet debt at the end of Q2 was up by almost  1.0 billion to  1.6 billion as newbuild deliveries with long-term charter commitments continue to increase the company's lease liabilities, a trend which is expected to accelerate over the coming quarters.Please note that year-to-date, the company has only taken delivery of four out of a total of 42 publicly-disclosed newbuilds chartered on long-term contracts from various lessors between 2020 and 2022In addition, ZIM has recently taken delivery of four 12,000 TEU newbuilds from Seaspan, but the company has not disclosed the terms of these leases.Please note that the newbuild vessels are of substantially larger average size than the company's existing fleet.While ZIM has a total of 47 vessels with lease expirations in 2023 and 2024, even when assuming zero extensions, the company's total capacity is going to increase substantially at the worst possible timeMoreover, based on management's statements during the questions-and-answers session of the , ZIM is likely to renew the majority of its expiring leases while redelivering only the oldest and least efficient vessels in the fleetFurthermore, the company has agreed to make an aggregate  490 million in down payments upon delivery of the Seaspan newbuilds While the new vessels should help reduce unit costs over time, they will also increase overall lease expenses and particularly net debt very substantially over the next few quarters. For my part, I wouldn't be surprised to see the company ending 2024 with well above  5 billion in net debt.Just last week, competitor A.P. Møller - Mærsk A S or  Maersk  , ,   of a further increase in industry-wide blanked capacityFollowing a short recovery in July and August, container rates have resumed their multi-year decline in recent weeks with rates again approaching post-pandemic lows.Not surprisingly, the company has reduced its original 2023 outlook substantiallyAssuming ZIM's second half results mirror the first half of the year and considering the above-discussed down payments upon Seaspan newbuild deliveries, I would estimate the company's cash balance to decline to approximately  2.6 billion by year-end.Should 2024 be more of the same, I would estimate ZIM's cash balance to decrease by another  1  billion dollars next year.To put it another way  The company needs the market to turn around by 2026 at the latest point to avoid running out of funds.ZIM Integrated Shipping Services reported weak second quarter results and reduced full-year expectations materially.Even after net cash outflows of more than  1 billion in Q2, the company still commands more than  3.2 billion in cash, bank deposits and liquid investments, albeit this number is likely to come down further over the next couple of quarters.Assuming no changes in industry conditions, the company would likely run out of funds by 2026.Considering the weak market environment, which is about to be exacerbated by an elevated number of newbuilds scheduled to join the worldwide fleet over the next few quarters, I am reiterating my  rating on the shares.A surprise improvement in consumer sentiment would almost certainly result in higher demand for far east-made goods thus supporting rates on the company's most important .Investors should always keep a close eye on charter rate movements as reported by  or other leading industry services.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

What Will Stop The Sell-Off? Putting The Brakes On Treasury Yields,"The 10-year US Treasury yield has climbed ever higher in recent weeks. Technical conditions are in the driver s seat for now, but fundamentals should prevail over time.US Treasury yields have surged, withTechnical conditions the dynamics of supply and demand are out of balance in today s bond market. That is, bond prices have succumbed to selling pressures because marginal buyers have so far failed to materialize. We see a number of contributing factors.First, the sell-off has developed momentum thanks to a series of triggering events since early this year. In April, it was the resolution of the banking crisis. In May, the debt ceiling debate. June saw better-than-expected growth, and July concerns around Treasury supply. August saw reduced liquidity, as is typical of late summer. September brought breaches of technical support, with prices reaching new lows when quantitative strategies and momentum followers that trade based on technicals shorted the market. A dearth of counterparties exaggerated the effect on valuations.Second, foreign buyers have been selling US debt in the continuation of a longer-term trend. China s holdings of US Treasuries, for example, are down about  175 billion since last year. Japan, the largest non-US holder of Treasuries, has also been trimming its position.Third, in the last couple of weeks, fund flows have begun to slow, following strong flows of more than US 200 billion into core and government bond funds year to date. This has put a crimp into marginal buying, since asset managers in aggregate are already long duration and have little dry powder left. Dealers have been slow to provide a backstop. And banks are reluctant to extend duration, with the regional banking crisis still in the rearview mirror.To our mind, today s macro picture doesn t support an extended sell-off, which historically has accompanied a very different set of . For example, fundamentals look quite different today than in October 2022, when yields reached prior peaks.Then, the fed funds rate was at 2.5 . Today it s at 5.5 . Then, the Federal Reserve had just begun its aggressive hiking cycle. Today, the Fed is likely finished raising rates or close to it. Then, consumer price inflation  CPI  was at 8.2 . Today, it s at 3.7 with core CPI running 2.5  and approaching the Fed s target. The , too.The outlier among economic conditions is the labor market. September s addition of 336,000 workers is the strongest since January. Clearly, the jobs market is still strengthening, albeit at a slower rate than in 2022. This means the Fed will need to see tangible evidence of slower growth to have confidence in the inflation outlook.We don t think we ll have to wait forever. Higher yields mean tighter financial conditions, which in turn weigh on growth. We expect  as data weakens in the coming months.Once the tide begins to turn, sidelined cash should flood back into the market, rapidly driving yields down and prices up. In the meantime, elevated yields are good for bond investors, since over time most of a bond s return comes from its yield.That s why, with yields at once-in-a-generation highs, we believe the current bond rout is creating .

The market was falling, with banks and other financials leading the way down. Silicon Valley Bank , Signature Bank , Credit Suisse , and First Republic were plastered all over the news as failing banks, with dire predictions that things would get worse.Fast forward four months, and bank failures aren't in the news anymore. As banks start reporting their Q2 earnings, they are off to a very strong start. Wells Fargo  and JPMorgan  both raised guidance as Net Investment Income  'NII'  is doing very well in a higher interest rate environment. When you are a lender, higher interest rates are a good thing for you in the long run. After all, what do lenders profit from  Collecting interestIt is a common theme with investing that Wall Street is frequently near-sighted. Panicking over the issues of the moment without regard for whether these issues will be resolved with time. The banking industry is alive and well. Yes, there are issues created by the rapid rate hiking cycle, but the Fed is now slowing down. As interest rates stabilize, absolute higher rates are a positive for banks.Next week, we will see earnings reported for a lot of regional banks, which is the area that Wall Street has been the most concerned about, and is trading at very low valuations. We can take advantage of this fear and grow our income.  is a Closed-End Fund  'CEF'  that invests in banks, both large national banks and regional banks.  was hit hard in the March panic, giving up its gains for the year and then some.While BTO has recovered 30  from May lows, there is plenty of room to go. As Wall Street warms up to the idea that bank failures were isolated to a handful of banks and not a broadly systemic cause as we saw with mortgages in the Great Financial Crisis, we can expect valuations of banks to return to average levels.Until that happens, we can buy BTO and collect a great yield while we wait  is a REIT specializing in medical office buildings or MOBs.  owns a diversified portfolio of 715 medical office properties in 35 states.Last year, HR shareholders  with HTA, creating the largest pure-play MOB REIT in the United States. HR's merger with HTA has significantly improved its portfolio scale, diversification, and efficiency. Large mergers always take time to integrate, but HR management has stated that they are on target for 5-7  earnings growth and 4-6  same-property rent growth in 2024 by taking advantage of redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio.HR has a healthy development redevelopment pipeline that will contribute to earnings growth. HR's strategy is what they describe as a  cluster  strategy. The goal is to own multiple buildings in close proximity to each other, either  on campus  or adjacent to the property of a major healthcare system like a hospital. For instance, here is an example of a cluster that HR formed in Atlanta.HR acquired five buildings in two transactions and then acquired development property nearby. They currently are renting 357k square feet and have the ability to develop an additional 184k square feet in an area where HR is already managing property and is very familiar with the supply and demand dynamics. All real estate is local, and there is a lot of value in developing in an area where you are already a successful landlord.Like most REITs, HR has seen its valuation compress thanks to rising interest rates, despite the fact that HR has no material debt maturities until 2025, giving them plenty of time for rates to change before they are forced to refinance.Now is a great time to be buying up shares while you can receive a much higher yield than HR has historically had. The market is selling off REITs based on the near-term reality of higher interest rates while ignoring the long-term benefits of rent inflation, growing demand for medical properties, and improved efficiency for HR with its larger scale.We are happy to get paid while we wait for the market to realize the value it has overlooked.BTO and HR can provide strong income from the banking sector and the healthcare sector without having to take any additional steps. BTO allows you to leverage strong portfolio managers who own top-quality banks within their portfolio and pay you. HR continues to keep on ticking and providing excellent dividends to its shareholders year after year.Neither one of these sectors are part of the latest and greatest fads. COVID is long in the rearview window for a while now. Banking was out of favor due to the collapse of multiple banks. It's amazing how times have changed so quickly. The banking is now starting to move back into favor as we start seeing the benefits of higher rates on the bank's bottom lines.Regardless of the newest trend or craze, some sectors can be relied upon to consistently provide excellent income, year in and year out. These two opportunities allow you to leverage two sectors that can do just that.When you're retired, you're not going to want to have to fiddle with your portfolio every day, just like you're not going to want to have to fiddle with everything else in your life. You'll want to be able to enjoy each day  Each day is an opportunity to discover something new and find a new way to enjoy it. I want you to have the income to be able to do that. Nothing is more discouraging than being limited by your income and stopping you from being able to do things that you enjoy.

PHX Minerals: A Good Natural Gas Royalties Play,"  is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale plays in Oklahoma, Texas, and LouisianaThe company does have operations in a few otherAs stated in the introduction, PHX Minerals is an independent exploration and production company that primarily operates in the SCOOP and Haynesville Shale regions of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas but also has operations elsewhere in the country. The company s operating locations are not the only unique thing about this company, though. Its business model is somewhat unique as the company does not actually drill for resources on its acreage. Rather, it simply takes a royalty or working interest in any well drilled on its land.I explained the difference between a royalty and a working interest stake in my previous article on this company, but the important thing is that PHX Minerals receives a portion of the production from any well that is drilled on its acreage. The well is actually drilled and operated by an upstream exploration and production company such as Southwestern Energy , Continental Resources, Chesapeake Energy , and several others depending on the basin in which the company operates. However, the company s practice of taking a stake in a well s production does expose it to some of the same factors that affect the performance of other energy companies. One of the most important of these factors is energy prices.Unfortunately, energy prices were something of a drag on PHX Mineral s recent financial performance. As of the time of writing, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is down 10.90  over the past year but it was down quite a bit more over most of the trailing twelve-month periodThe performance of natural gas has been even worse. Natural gas at Henry Hub is down a whopping 69.03  over the past twelve monthsThere were a few reasons for this poor performance. In the case of crude oil, the Federal Government was selling crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for much of the second half of last year as well as through July of this year to attempt to keep the supply of crude oil high and prices down. I explained the reasons for the low natural gas prices in a  earlier this year, but two of the major reasons were the warm winter and the temporary shutdown of the Freeport LNG facility. These two factors caused a glut of natural gas in North America, which pushed prices down due to the economic law of supply and demand.Natural gas prices are generally more important than crude oil for PHX Minerals due to the production profile of its acreage. In the second quarter, the company received a total of 2.304113 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent. Of that, 1.854485 billion cubic feet was dry natural gas. Thus, approximately 80.49  of the company s business is natural gas as opposed to crude oil or other hydrocarbons. Clearly, natural gas fundamentals are much more important to the company than crude oil. This is a good thing because the long-term fundamentals for natural gas are better than crude oil s long-term fundamentals as we will now discuss.This decline in resource prices has certainly had an impact on PHX Minerals  financial performance. In the second quarter of 2023, the amount of natural gas that was produced on the company s acreage was close to record levels, but the price was substantially lower than in the same quarter of last yearPHX Minerals reported an adjusted EBITDA of  4.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to  7.2 million in the second quarter of 2022. This lower cash flow is despite the fact that the amount of natural gas that the company received as royalty payments was quite a bit higher than in the same period last year. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a near-term catalyst that would drive natural gas prices back up. We are seeing some upstream producers beginning to reduce their production, but this will take quite a while to make its way through the system. Currently, forecasters are  that the upcoming winter will be more typical than last year, so that could help reduce some of the natural gas oversupply if they are correct. However, it remains to be seen if the forecasters are correct about this, and how much of an impact it will have on the balance between natural gas supply and demand.The long-term fundamentals for natural gas are much better than the near-term ones though, which is fortunate for PHX Minerals. As already mentioned, PHX Minerals has significant acreage in the Haynesville Shale. The Haynesville Shale is very well-positioned to supply natural gas to the liquefaction plants that are being constructed along the Gulf Coast. The demand from natural gas from these facilities will likely be enormous. Indeed, Wood Mackenzie states that the liquefaction plants currently under development will increase the demand for natural gas by 10 billion cubic feet per day by 2030It seems reasonable that a significant percentage of the natural gas that will be supplying these plants will be produced in the Haynesville Shale and the Permian Basin. This is due mostly to their proximity to the Gulf Coast. The other major natural gas-producing region in the United States, Appalachia, will probably end up supplying East Coast utilities and the handful of liquefaction plants that are being constructed near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As of the time of writing, 48.74  of PHX Minerals  total royalty production is in the Haynesville Shale, which is substantially more than any other basinThus, it is reasonable to assume that the company will benefit from any growth in natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale. After all, that scenario would almost certainly result in the company s customers needing to lease more acreage on which to produce natural gas to satisfy the demand. PHX Minerals seems to realize this as it has been focusing its recent land acquisitions on the Haynesville Shale. We can see that quite easily hereAs we can see, about half of the acreage that the company acquired this year was in the Haynesville Shale. It was substantially more than half of its acquisitions in 2021 and 2022. This all represents acreage that the company can lease out to its customers. Clearly, management sees a great deal of opportunity in the Haynesville Shale. I do, too, and this is one of the things that we can appreciate about this company.As mentioned in the introduction, PHX Minerals has a very strong balance sheet. We can see this by looking at the net debt-to-equity ratio. As of June 30, 2023, PHX Minerals had a net debt of  23.5 million compared to  120.1 million in shareholders  equity. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.20 today. This is lower than the 0.29 ratio that the company had the last time that we discussed it. That is a positive sign as it indicates that the company managed to strengthen its balance sheet somewhat over the past quarter. Here is how the company compares to some of its peersI pointed out one important thing for this comparison in my previous article on PHX MineralsThis is a good situation that strongly implies that we should not have to worry too much about the company s leverage. The company s use of leverage or lack thereof is somewhat more important for an energy producer like PHX Minerals than it would be for many other companies because of the inherent volatility of energy prices. Overall, everything looks good here.As I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, pretty much the entire traditional energy sector appears to be substantially undervalued relative to the broader market. This continues to be true despite the fact that the energy sector has outperformed the S P 500 Index  by quite a lot over the past month. This chart shows the iShares U.S. Energy ETF  against the S P 500 IndexThe weakness in the broader market has brought the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S P 500 Index to 19.88 at the current levelPHX Minerals is quite a bit below this, though. As of the time of writing, the company s forward price-to-earnings is 9.35 . Here is how that compares to the energy producers that we used for the peer comparison earlierPHX Minerals is only the median company here, which might imply that the stock is fairly valued. However, it is clearly substantially well below the comparable ratio for the S P 500 Index. As such, it is very hard not to call this company undervalued. Overall, it is probably worth thinking about adding to a portfolio, especially if you want to have some exposure to the liquefied natural gas growth story.In conclusion, PHX Minerals is a somewhat unique independent exploration and production company that appears to be well-positioned to profit from the coming liquefied natural gas boom. The company s cash flow has struggled a bit from the low-price environment, but this will hopefully resolve itself as the demand for natural gas continues to grow since producers will probably restrict output until prices rise. PHX Minerals Inc. stock is trading at a reasonable price and the company boasts a very strong balance sheet. Overall, it might be worth considering as a play on natural gas.At Energy Profits in Dividends, we seek to generate a 7  income yield by investing in a portfolio of energy stocks while minimizing our risk of principal loss.

K2 Hedge Fund Strategy Outlook: Fourth Quarter 2023,"Higher macro and market volatility, along with greater dispersion, creates an environment rich with opportunities for active trading. We think the key to success for hedge funds is to identify these opportunitiesThe US Federal Reserve  Fed  marked an investment regime shift in March of 2022 by raising interest rates and the cost of capital. Since then, all stakeholders have been in a constant state of adjustment and recalibration. We do think that central banks have a big hurdle to tame inflation to their stated target levels. As we look at the world today, we see real cash rates at very attractive levels, the cost of capital rising to even higher levels for companies, governments expanding their debt levels, increasing costs for consumers, and intensified geopolitical tensions. We expect the cost of capital to remain high for the foreseeable future as central banks keep the cost of funding elevated to keep inflationary pressures at bay. The resultant investment climate is one of increased market volatility across all asset classes, more divergent security performance, and investors shortening their time horizon.Equity market neutral hedge funds are positioned well, in our view to capture security dispersion in a responsible, risk-oriented, non-directional approach. We continue to overweight global macro discretionary managers for all the reasons mentioned above but want to highlight that manager selection is of upmost importance in this regime. Insurance-linked securities are one of the most idiosyncratic investments to pick up excess yield while offering diversification to portfolios.Rates have risen higher and faster than just about any market participant would have predicted two years ago. That transition has been difficult for certain assets and investment strategies, but history suggests that higher prevailing rates create attractive opportunity sets for hedge funds. The table below demonstrates that hedge funds, and long short equity in particular, perform better in higher rate regimes, which tend to separate winners from losers. In a low-rate environment, weaker companies can more easily secure financing, that financing is less impactful to the bottom line, and customers may be less discerning given their own financing situations. With rates now significantly higher than they have been for the past decade plus, those weaker companies will start to shift to risk management mode while the stronger companies can seize opportunities and profit. We believe equity market neutral managers are well suited to capitalize on this setup as returns are very much a function of dispersion.Cross-asset correlations are a key consideration in most portfolio construction and risk management techniques. Many modern investors have implicitly or explicitly built in an assumption of negative correlation between equities and government fixed income over the last few decades. However, this dynamic has recently flipped, with the two asset classes no longer offsetting each other s risks, and instead, seemingly compounding risk within a portfolio. Investors may need to seek diversification elsewhere, whether through allocations to other asset classes or to tactical trading strategies with no structural long or short biases.Macro managers, who tend to focus on these types of big-picture cross-asset relationships as a matter of course, and who can shift dynamically between longs and shorts, may be facing an attractive trading environment and may also provide a source of much-needed diversification for broader portfolios. To the extent hawkish central bank policy is a contributing factor to this new correlation dynamic, we believe those managers with the expertise to evaluate policy paths may be well-suited to capture the opportunity set.The focus of most ILS managers has shifted to the January renewals as we move through the end of a relatively unimpactful hurricane season  at the time of this writing . There remains a supply and demand dislocation within the broader insurance and reinsurance markets. This dislocation, while not as pronounced as last year in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ian, is likely large enough for spread and pricing levels to remain elevated. Given the increase of demand for risk transfer and relative lack of capacity in traditional reinsurance markets, we expect to see several sponsors and cedants utilize the catastrophe bond market to transfer retrocessional and reinsurance risk. In response to loss trends and challenging reinsurance markets, many cedants have materially shifted their portfolios since the start of 2022. In some instances, cedants retained higher levels of risk in 2023 given the severe supply and demand dislocations ahead of last year s renewals. This will likely lead to pent-up demand for reinsurance from these cedants at higher price levels and cleaner risk from a structural perspective.Investments in alternative investment strategies and hedge funds  collectively,  Alternative Investments  are complex and speculative investments, entail significant risk and should not be considered a complete investment program. Financial Derivative instruments are often used in alternative investment strategies and involve costs and can create economic leverage in the fund s portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses  as well as gains  in an amount that significantly exceeds the fund s initial investment. Depending on the product invested in, an investment in Alternative Investments may provide for only limited liquidity and is suitable only for persons who can afford to lose the entire amount of their investment. There can be no assurance that the investment strategies employed by K2 or the managers of the investment entities selected by K2 will be successful.The identification of attractive investment opportunities is difficult and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. Returns generated from Alternative Investments may not adequately compensate investors for the business and financial risks assumed. An investment in Alternative Investments is subject to those market risks common to entities investing in all types of securities, including market volatility. Also, certain trading techniques employed by Alternative Investments, such as leverage and hedging, may increase the adverse impact to which an investment portfolio may be subject.Depending on the structure of the product invested, Alternative Investments may not be required to provide investors with periodic pricing or valuation and there may be a lack of transparency as to the underlying assets. Investing in Alternative Investments may also involve tax consequences and a prospective investor should consult with a tax advisor before investing. In addition to direct asset-based fees and expenses, certain Alternative Investments such as funds of hedge funds incur additional indirect fees, expenses and asset-based compensation of investment funds in which these Alternative Investments invest.This material is intended to be of general interest only and should not be construed as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy.

How KNOT Offshore Partners LP Is Poised For Significant Share Price Rebound," is a leading company in the shuttle tanker industry. The company operates 18 shuttle tankers out of global feet of 78. The company is listed in New York with a USD175 million form is a master limited partnership  MLP , and its general partner is Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers Management AS  KNOT Management . An MLP is a type of publicly traded partnership that combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded company.KNOT Management is responsible for managing KNOP's shuttle tanker fleet and handling the various operational aspects of the business. This includes vessel operations, maintenance, crew management, and adherence to safety and environmental standards.After the company cut the dividend in January 2023, the stock went down by 70 . The company revenuesOnce dividends are reinstated, the share price should start regaining the previous trading levels, which means tripling the current share price. are specialized vessels used to transport crude oil from offshore oil fields to onshore facilities. There are only 78 shuttle tankers in the world serving the North Sea and the fields of offshore Brazil. They are designed to be able to work on high seas where conventional FPSOs cannot operate. The industry was pioneered by Knudsen, the parent company, in 1978.There are only  by three companies in two regions  Brazil and Norway . Only five new ships have been ordered while over 20 ships that are more than 20 years old should be scraped soon. As it takes three years for a ship to be delivered there is very good market visibility for the next at least five years. The market on the supply side is tight and with the scraping will get even tighter.Demand for shuttle tankers is increasing. There is a rapid expansion in production in both the North Sea  the large Johan Castberg field, for example  and Brazil via Petrobras, and others will require additional shuttle tankers.Higher production, new fields about to start producing, and limited supply or potential supply of vessels make for a nice bottleneck situation later in 2023 and in 2024 as producers scramble to secure the transport of their oil on shore.In the 2Q23 the While shuttle tankers can perform the regular function of the regular oil tanker fleet  they are a bit slower because they are heavier , regular tankers cannot substitute shuttle tankers. In periods of lacking demand for shuttle tankers, these operate as regular oil tankers, which limits the downside. When demand is high, the rates increase materially. This is happening now in the Brazilian market, where KNOP operates 14 of its 18 vessels. The Norwegian market should tighten from early 2024 as the new fields come into production.Since the 3 Quarter of 2022, KNOP stock has been totally annihilated. Several reasons caused the share price fallThe above resulted in a dividend cut from  2.08 year to  0.11. Reaction to this was predictable. Dividend investors sold in droves for tax reasons, for the lack of visibility and income. Moreover, many MLP investors became concerned that the group would buy 70  of what they don t own on the cheap, like many other MLP sponsors.As of 2Q23 none of the adverse scenarios have materialized. Most concerns were resolvedThere are only , none of which is materialKNOP secured charter coverage for 2023, is negotiating to extend the two Petrobras tankers coming due, and is starting to explore long-term charters for the remaining assets. It also appears that the best opportunity to take the company under the sponsor has passed, at least at the low. As the dividend was decreased, the company used its cash to pay down debt. The issues have been resolved and the remaining are being addressed.The company's The company position has normalized - KNOP is now in a similar state it was when it was paying above USD2 in dividends per year Gary Chapman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of KNOT Offshore Partners LP, stated  emphasis addedDespite all this progress, the company has been left for dead. Trading at  5.5 per share it is remaining at a steep discount to the  15-20 share NAV of the ships and the  3-4 share of free cash flow generating capacity.So what should we expect in 2024  Given that the FCF share should expand to over  3 share, there should be a resumption of dividends.It is not possible to model such a scenario with sufficient accuracy but given the previous precedents, it is not hard to imagine a  2-3 share dividend in 2024 and beyond. Either way, the net present value of any of the outcomes is very attractive. At a little over  5 per share, we should be able to get all our investment back over the next 3 years or so, representing a very attractive IRR. Given how oversold the shares are, any incremental good news should help to rerate the stock higher.Since this is not a biotech stock or economically sensitive equity, there are exogenous factors that can affect the stock. Delays of the Equinor project, geopolitical conflict near the Norwegian waters, an accident, or a belated offer by the parent company to take the stock under may cause the stock to underperform my expectations. However, given that the stock is already trading well below steel, the risk-reward of investing in KNOP is very positive.KNOP is down 70  due to multiple concerns that resulted in a dividend cut. Most of the concerns have been resolved and the financial performance remains stable. As the issues have been resolved, the dividends should be reinstated. Before the dividend cut, the stock was trading at a dividend yield of over 12 . At the current share price, the previous dividend would represent a dividend yield of 40 . The stock is up for a material rerating.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Quick Thoughts: Should We Fear The Rapid Rise Of Interest Rates?,"Since July, bond yields have been on a tear. The US 10-year Treasury yield has jumped from 3.75  in the third week of July to a recent high of 4.81 . Rising government bond yields have pushed up new borrowing costs for companies and households. For instance, the conventional 30-year US fixed rate mortgage is about 7.3 , its highest level since 2000. Compared to its lows during the pandemic  closer to 4  an American taking out a US 325,000 mortgage will today pay nearly US 10,000 more per year in interest.Rising term premiums haveObserved long-term interest rates  often referred to as nominal bond yields  can be decomposed into three components  1  the path for the neutral real short-term rate of interest  2  compensation for expected inflation  and 3  the term premium.The neutral real rate of interest is the rate adjusted for inflation that neither stimulates nor hinders economic activity. It should prevail when the economy is in equilibrium, i.e., enjoying full employment and price stability.However, when savers lend money to borrowers, they must also consider inflation. Inflation erodes the nominal value of their loans. Lending rates  whether in the form of loans or bonds  therefore embed an expectation of future inflation, which lenders tack onto the real rate of interest when extending credit.Finally, lenders whether individuals, banks, or bondholders typically require extra compensation to account for uncertainty and for the likelihood that the value of long-term credits  e.g., bonds  will fluctuate more than that of short-term credits. For example, the price of a 10-year bond will move more in response to a given change in interest rates than the price of a two-year note. As compensation for both uncertainty and price volatility, therefore, long-term lenders also tack on an additional rate of return, commonly referred to as the  term premium.  The term premium explains why yield curves typically slope upward, reflecting higher interest rates for long-dated notes and bonds relative to shorter maturity borrowings.Here s the rub  Real interest rates, inflation expectations and term premiums are all unobservable. That doesn t prevent clever economists and bonds specialists from trying to estimate them based on other pieces of data. Using various analytical approaches, it is possible to derive reasonable estimates for all three.Armed with estimates of the real neutral interest rate and expected inflation, subtracting those two numbers from the observed bond yield gets you to the term premium. The following chart shows one such estimate of the term premium the Federal Reserve  Fed  Bank of New York developed, and how it has behaved since 2009.Note that since mid-July, the term premium has spiked, jumping by 1.3 percentage points, a move that accounts for even more than the observed rise in nominal bond yields. That s because measures of the real rate of interest simultaneously fell and expected inflation only increased a bit.More noteworthy is the fact that term premiums were negative for most of the past decade. That flies in the face of theory, which says that lenders need to be compensated for longer-term lending.The negative term premium of recent years reflects several special factors, of which probably the most important being the monetary policies of the Fed and other central banks. Those had two components  1  large-scale asset purchases, dubbed  quantitative easing,  or QE for short  and 2   forward guidance,  namely strong reassurances that super-low interest rates and QE would remain in place for considerably longer  i.e., until full employment and price stability had been sustainably restored .Accordingly, lenders  knew  that interest rates would remain stuck at low levels. That removed uncertainty that in normal times probably would have prevailed. Lenders also didn t have to fret much about the volatility of their long-term bonds, given that the actions of central banks firmly pinned down both short- and long-term interest rates. Extraordinary monetary policies effectively crushed term premiums the extra compensation investors would otherwise demand for uncertainty and volatility.As previously noted, the components of the nominal bond yield cannot be observed. That leaves open room for doubt. For example, using different methodology, the Fed Bank of Richmond has constructed a measure of the neutral real interest rate that in contrast to the one the New York Fed produced indicates that the neutral real rate has recently been rising. If so, then the term premium has not been the only reason behind the recent surge in bond yields.In our view, however, the New York Fed s approach to disentangling bond yields is more persuasive. To state it as simply as possible, if the Richmond Fed s estimates of a rising neutral real rate were correct, it would imply that the economy s speed limit would have accelerated.That seems unlikely, as there is little evidence in the incoming productivity data to warrant that conclusion. For well-known demographic reasons, the growth of the labor force has slowed. And if trend growth were accelerating, why would it have suddenly jumped in mid-2023  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if the US economy were suddenly embarking on faster, non-inflationary growth, the equity market would probably be leaping ahead. Instead, since mid-year it has stumbled.In short, the New York Fed s estimates of the real neutral rate and, by extension, of the term premium are more closely aligned with other data gleaned from the economy and markets. The term premium appears to us to be the primary culprit for rising bond yields in recent months.Some observers have argued that the latest jump in bond yields is tied to changes in the supply and demand for bonds. Little wonder  Just as the Fed  and other central banks  have stepped back from bond buying  and have shrunk the holdings of bonds by not replacing all of those that mature , governments around the world have run up big deficits, requiring heavier bond issuance. In the United States, the issuance calendar has become particularly loaded in 2023, as the Treasury had to also replace depleted cash levels from earlier this year when it was trying to prevent a US default stemming from Congress  delay in raising the debt ceiling.Yet all these things have been  known-knowns  for much of this year, even in the second-quarter of 2023 when interest rates were much lower than today. So those who argue that a combination of QT and big budget deficits are behind rising bond yields are left without an answer to  why now  To us, the timing of the latest surge in bond yields is difficult to explain merely in supply demand terms.Finally, it is worth recalling that the US economy has proven resilient to the massive Fed rate hikes since early 2022. Fiscal stimulus, the ability of households to draw on savings, a tight labor market, and a greater reliance on fixed rate borrowing  insulating for a time households and companies from higher borrowing costs  explain that resilience. But consequently, the Fed has clearly signaled that its policy will remain tight for longer. The Fed s resolve to see the economy weaken to assure its inflation target is met has probably contributed to the rise in yields because it has removed hopes for rate cuts in 2024. Still, it remains a mystery why 10- and even 30-year bond yields should have reacted so strongly to changes in interest rate expectations over the next few quarters. Hence, even  high for longer  cannot fully account for the observed rise in bond yields since July.Our conclusion, therefore, is that rising term premiums are behind the rise in bond yields. For the economy, it is important to note that resilience is not forever. New borrowers and those who must roll over their maturing debts will soon have to pay much higher borrowing costs, as highlighted in the example at the beginning of this note. Moreover, there is some evidence that the labor market is showing signs of softening.Studies from the Fed Bank of San Francisco show that household excess savings are almost depleted. And additional shots of fiscal stimulus are unlikely, given Washington gridlock. Accordingly, an economy that was almost certainly set to slow now runs a greater risk of recession. That matters for equity and credit investors, where asset values depend on corporate profits. Before the latest jump in interest rates, optimism was growing about the outlook for higher corporate profits later this year and in 2024. That optimism had helped to underpin strong 2023 gains in equity markets. Now investors must wonder if those expectations weren t too rosy.Higher US yields also boost the value of the dollar. All else equal, that tends to undermine commodity prices. And, on cue, oil prices have recently plunged. Meanwhile, a strong dollar is not welcome in some parts of the world. Japan is reported to have intervened to prevent the yen from sliding below 150 versus the dollar. Emerging fixed income and equity markets typically fare poorly when the dollar becomes too strong. Finally, no region has been spared higher yields stemming from rising US rates. Bond yields in the eurozone, which is already teetering on the edge of recession, are heading higher.Bond yields have surged. Many explanations have been offered. We think it is mostly about term premiums. But whatever the cause, the effect is mostly unpleasant. Unless bond yields settle back into lower ranges, global growth is likely to be lower, profits expectations will come under pressure, and risks to equities and credit fixed income markets will be on the rise. are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. involve interest rate, credit, inflation and reinvestment risks, and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls.

I Believe Rio Tinto Is A Long-Term Bargain Thanks To Net Zero,"It's time to talk about mining and the climate. In this case, we'll discuss the impact of climate measures on metals demand and related developments.On May 15, I wrote an  titled For example, an electric car requires more than 5x more metal than a conventional car. Offshore wind requires massive amounts of copper and zinc. Solar requires silicon and copper.In this article, I'm updating the bull case, using new findings and new data on  own progress. The company is tremendously well-positioned to benefit from rising copper demand, robust iron ore demand, and investments in rare earths like lithium.ISo, let's dive into the detailsAlthough I have 20  fossil fuel exposure, I'm not opposed to clean energy. On the contrary, the reason why I own so much oil exposure is that I do not trust the way governments are handling the energy transition. It's a way to protect myself against energy inflation, not a protest.A forced energy trend leads to inflation, especially because we're now closing perfectly fine coal plants and reducing investments in affordable energy sources.The problem is that the energy transition requires a lot of time and resources. This cannot be forced.For example, looking at the data below, we see that according to the IEA, demand for rare earths will explode. Under current government policies, we could see close to 15 kilotonnes of rare earth demand by 2040. If we follow sustainable development goals, that number could be 35 kilotonnes. Right now, that number is barely a fraction of that.The chart below also shows that China dominates the production of rare earths - even after accelerated investments by other nations.To make things worse, China does not only mine 70  of global rare earths, but it processes 87  of it and refines 91  of it.In other words, if Western nations  the main drivers behind net zero  want to expand their footprint, new mining needs to be accelerated, not just because of a lack of demand.That's where Rio Tinto comes in.  reported last month that the company is on its way to becoming a meaningful lithium producer, focusing on its own capacities instead of buying other producers.According to the article  emphasis addedHaving said that, let's take a closer look at how RIO is doing.Despite strong secular tailwinds, RIO's stock price isn't going anywhere. The problem is that cyclical growth is weak.Looking at COMEX Copper futures, we see that prices are elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels but well below the post-pandemic highs.I believe that favorable supply and demand dynamics prevent commodity prices from going much lower. This was different in the years between 2011 and 2020.It also helps RIO's financials.Despite challenging operating conditions, Rio Tinto showed resilience in the first half of this year, achieving solid underlying earnings of  5.7 billion, a free cash flow of  3.8 billion, a 20  return on capital employed, and a 5  production increase in the first half of 2023.As a result, the company will return  2.9 billion to shareholders, reflecting its disciplined capital allocation and maintaining a net debt of around  4 billion.The company also made a number of strategic investments.As one can imagine, commodity prices were a significant factor impacting financials, with a notable decline in prices for iron ore, copper, and aluminum compared to the first half of 2022.Also, during the earnings call, it was noted that despite some moderation in inflation, it continued to affect costs. The firm also reported cost pressures due to tight labor markets and operational issues in specific projects.The Iron Ore business remained a strong performer, benefitting from increased sales and production, notably from Gudai-Darri. The aluminum business saw operational improvement, with metal volumes up 9  due to the recovery at Kitimat. The highlight was Oyu Tolgoi's first sustainable copper production, a significant milestone for the company. However, operational challenges were noted in Escondida and Kennecott.Having said that, and with regard to the aforementioned growth plans, Rio Tinto plans to steadily increase capital allocation for essential CapEx, sustaining and replacing projects, and decarbonization efforts.Growth investments, including Simandou and other potential projects, are in the pipeline. The company outlined a clear capital expenditure profile, expecting CapEx to rise to  10 billion in each of the next two years.During its earnings call, the company made clear that it sees opportunities in sustainable metals production, driven by increased demand in sectors like solar panels and electric vehicles.The trajectory of aluminum demand in the solar sector, especially in China, is promising. EV sales growth, supported by government policies globally, is expected to boost copper demand, benefiting Rio Tinto. These trends align with their strategy for growth in aluminum and carbon production.However, in China, the company sees slowing iron ore demand.According to In light of these investments, the company maintained its commitment to dividend payouts, declaring a 50  payout to shareholders, amounting to  2.9 billion in the first half of this year, as I already briefly mentioned.When it comes to financial stability, the company has an A-rated balance sheet with a sub-0.5x net leverage ratio.So, what about its valuationThe chart below shows the percentage RIO shares are trading below their all-time high compared to the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite economic indicator. As we already briefly discussed, cyclical headwinds are overshadowing secular growth tailwinds.Nonetheless, analysts are very positive about the stock.The consensus price target hasn't declined since early 2022 and is still at  80, roughly 27  above the current price. Even the lowest price target is above the current price.RIO shares are trading at just 4.7x forward EBITDA, which is one of the best valuations of the past ten years.I believe that RIO has the potential to soar well beyond  80 or  90 per share over the next 2-3 years.However, I also believe that as long as global economic growth indicators are hinting at elevated recession odds, we won't see much upside.Hence, my strategy would be to accumulate RIO shares on weakness. If I didn't have so much cyclical exposure already, I would be a gradual buyer at current prices. If it drops further, investors can average down.For now, I own Caterpillar , which is highly correlated to mining stocks.Eventually, I believe that RIO is poised to benefit from a perfect storm of cyclical and secular tailwinds, pushing commodity prices beyond prior highs.At that point, growth investments will pay off, allowing the company to benefit from better prices and higher volumes.As a result, I will stick to a  rating, which I will upgrade the moment we get a rebound in cyclical growth expectations.In a world where climate measures are reshaping the mining landscape, it's essential to understand the growing demand for metals in the transition to net-zero technologies.Rio Tinto, a major player in the mining industry, is strategically positioned to capitalize on this demand surge, particularly in lithium for electric vehicles, aluminum, and copper.Despite cyclical challenges, the company shows resilience, with solid financials and strategic investments in various projects to sustain and grow supply.Its commitment to sustainability and growth, combined with an attractive valuation, suggests promising potential.Given ongoing economic uncertainties, accumulating Rio Tinto shares during market dips could be the way to go.Ultimately, Rio Tinto is well-poised to capitalize on both cyclical and secular industry shifts, making it a promising long-term investment.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Orient Overseas International: Weakening Freight Environment Leads To Downgrade,"In our  on Orient Overseas  International  Limited   from the 1st of May this year, we concluded that our view ofThe share price is down 24  since our previous article, which had a Hold stance. However, due to the monstrous dividend payment, the return for investors has been a positive 4 .OROVY published its FH 2023 financial results at the end of August, so we want to revisit the thesis again.They say that a picture can tell a thousand words.This graph from OROVY s  shows howIt was not so much the volume that dropped, it was the freight.The total number of containers shipped in FH of 2023 was only reduced by 1 , but the revenue from the operation dropped by 59  Y-o-Y. The operating costs only dropped by 26 .The main reason for this large difference between the drop in revenue and cost lies in the fact that OROVY needs to pay charter hire on vessels chartered in, regardless of whether they sail or not.Their lease commitments on vessels chartered in, as of 30th June 2023, stood at  382 million spread evenly over the next five years. OROVY should be able to trim their fleet even in the SH of 2023 as more than 30 vessels, totaling over 200,000 TEU capacity are coming off charter in SH of 2023.That is good news.Their Capex requirements as of 30th June 2023 were  3.75 billion, which is mostly payments to be made on their new-builds. Most of this will be financed, so it is not a total drain of cash.On the topic of cash, it is quite large at  7.8 billion, but it is important to note that they did  burn   3.4 billion over the last twelve months. Since it would be too optimistic to expect a quick recovery in the market, it will only take a couple of years, and that cash pile will have disappeared.To get a better understanding of this cash drain, you may want to read SA's excellent contributor Henrik Alex's last   which is in the same predicament as they too will burn cash. We agree with his thoughts that the negative cash effect of having expensive vessels under charter and a falling freight rate environment will cause cash to be drained.OROVY will be able to release a portion of these vessels throughout 2023 and early 2024. This will help their situation. On the other hand, they have new building payment installments to be made, which is also a negative impact on their cash flow.This leaves us with the topic of dividends. It surprised us that the company decided to pay a large dividend and even a special dividend for the interim period of FH 2023.After all, the operating cash flow in FH was  548 million, a far cry from the  6.24 billion it was a year earlier. From this cash flow, they will pay out to shareholders a regular interim dividend amounting to  455.6 million plus a special dividend of  112.3 million.Here is their dividend history over the last five years.It is in our opinion not prudent to distribute more in dividends than what the free cash flow is. Especially, in view of the challenging market condition.OROVY did not do any share buyback over the last six months.It is, as we just mentioned, a challenging market. One could say it is the perfect storm, with a reduction in demand and an increase in supply.It is particularly the supply that is the most worrisome, and this author has pointed this out in several articles covering companies such as SFL Corporation  and Maersk .A vast majority of the new ships coming out are large vessels plying the main routes.To make things worse, there is not enough scrapping of tonnage.Even the pointed out in their FH 2023 financial report, that demand is not coming back any time soonThese comments came in relation to a liability they have toward Long Beach Container Terminal, which is lasting for 20 years from October 2019. OROVY has guaranteed a certain minimum volume for each contract year. Failing to meet this, they will have to pay the terminal owners a compensation. It has been estimated they need to make a provision of  894 million to cover this.It is difficult to predict. Especially about the future, as the Danish physicist Niels Bohr is said to have proclaimed.How will the economy look like a year from nowWe can only rely on past data of supply and demand and try to inject a  reasonable  estimate of what it is going to be in the relatively near future of say  one year .Even the respectable economist John Galbraith once said thatOur prediction is that the giant liner companies will have no choice but to fight for the business of filling up the growing fleet of vessels by offering lower prices.At least for the next two years. What happens thereafter, is anybody s guess.The risk to the thesis is that we misjudge the supply demand equation. A sharp improvement in demand could help OROVY to deal with the over-supply of new vessels.However, we believe the chance of this is small.We believe lower freight and volume will continue to drain liner companies, such as OROVY of much-needed cash and dividends will be a thing of the past.In terms of putting a valuation on OROVY, many fellow authors here on SA like to use the traditional method of Price Book value. From that perspective, OROVY and most of its peers look very attractive, although OROVY is not as attractive as its peers.In a falling market, which all of them are experiencing, how much you theoretically could get for the assets is not that important.Surviving - that is what matters now.Fortunately, for most of them, they do have manageable debt loads. Now they need to batten down the hatches and sail through this storm, as they have done in the past.We cannot put an exact price where we would judge OROVY to be a  fair price . Lower, or no earnings, will resent any kind of valuation we may put on it.We believe the share prices will come down, and that is the main reason why we are inclined to downgrade OROVY from a Hold to a Sell.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements that represent our outlook and current expectations as of the date of this release. Other additional factors not anticipated by managementI would now like to turn the call over to FabioThank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.For the third quarter of 2023, we reported net revenues of  4.4 billion with adjusted EBITDA of  324 million translating to a 7.4  margin. Throughout the quarter, we experienced very volatile market fundamentals and persistent consumer inflation. Nonetheless, we remained focused on our strategies of diversification, key customer partnerships and operational excellence. Given our consistent execution, improved margins relative to prior quarters across all regions.In the U.S., our key customer partnerships drove significant growth in case-ready and strong performance in Small Birds where our operational excellence efforts improve our efficiencies in Big Bird. We continue to further diversify our portfolio in both branded fresh products and prepared offerings given our growth with leading retailers and food service providers. Based on this combinated efforts, the U.S. improve its profitability compared to previous quarters.As for the U.K. and Europe, we further diversify our marketplace presence through branded innovation and recently launched new products, secured additional long term supply arrangements with key customers and drove further efficiencies in our manufacturing network and back office to operational excellence. As a result, we have reinforced our foundations for profitable growth.In Mexico, we experienced a strong third quarter given improvements in live operations, favorability and feed inputs and currency and balance supply and demand fundamentals. Our diversification through branded and prepare offerings continue to gain marketplace traction and our operational excellence efforts to drive efficiencies and expand capacities remain on track.In the third quarter of 2023, ready to cook production of U.S. chicken experienced a decrease of 1.9  relative to the same period last year. USDA estimates primarily influenced by fewer headcounts along with more typical changes in industry production given seasonal trends. The most recent USDA outlook for Q4 of 2023 indicates that the industry continues to reduce excess and chicks placement relative to last year, suggesting a more restrained supply scenario in the near future.Concerning our cold storage supply, reported September 2023 USDA cold storage inventories are below prior year and indicate the levels have declined relative to June 2023. Breast meat remains in line with the end of June levels and dark meat inventories continue to trend below last year.Considering the overall supply of protein, USDA expect a slight reduction in domestic protein availability for the remainder of the calendar 2023. This reflects a view of slow growing broiler supply compared with contracting beef and pork availability. With relative lower beef and pork availability, food inflation higher than historical average and current economic uncertainty, chicken may be advantaged given its availability, affordability and flexibility.Domestic volume demand for chicken improved significantly in the third quarter of 2023. The retail channel momentum continued, providing more balanced growth in volumes across all departments. The fresh department was supported by volume growth coming across both front half and back half cuts, and we are finally seeing increased promotional activities.We remain positive on the potential of this category expected in competing protein supplies, increasing competing meat prices and more normal promotional activity has contributed to consistent sales volumes over the quarter. Elsewhere in the retail category, the frozen department has added incremental volume and unit sales, and we are now seeing volume sales growth from both the commodity and value-added frozen segments. Meanwhile, the dairy prepared department has steadily added in both units and dollar sales.In the foodservice channel, volume sales also increased. Commercial distribution volume demand has improved as the number of operators purchasing chicken has grown and those operators, already with chicken have experienced an increase in velocity. Similar to retail, Q3 of this year was reflected of a more balanced volume growth across front half cuts and back half cuts. The non-commercial distribution sub-channel increased volumes, albeit at relatively lower prices compared to the record prices of last year.As a result of improving retail and food service volume sales and balanced supply during the quarter, wholesale pricing for commodity chicken experienced price improvements during August and September, especially on breast meat and tenders providing a lift to cut out pricing.Commodity prices have recently reverted to the normal seasonal pricing patterns and are now close to historical leverage, which is not a sustainable level, considering the industry's elevated costs from grain, labor and other inputs relative to prepandemic levels. Nonetheless, the supply and demand balance appears to be improving as we enter Q4 of 2023.On the exports, Q3 was remarkably stable and with solid demand for U.S. broiler. The reduction of 2.2  on year-over-year exports was mainly driven by China, where sales were down 28 , mainly due to ongoing high path avian influenza and relative limited eligibility for export among poultry-producing states. Excluding this impact, U.S. exports will have been up 2.5  year-over-year, a good indication that strong demand exists for U.S. products globally.High path avian influenza emerging commercial turkey flock towards the end of September and beginning of October. Although these were the first deductions since mid-April and occur far from major broiler producing states, it does increase vigilance throughout the industry. As for business implications, most of our trading partners have adjusted their trade restrictions to reflect impact zones or states in the event of a commercial outbreak.Other than China, we do not expect to see material disruption to trade in the event of an  HPAI  break in commercial broiler. Consistent with the previous quarter, as volume sales have maintained growth in the channel, U.S. cold storage inventories of combined dark meat have trended below a year ago and up 19  below the five-year average. Driven by a 32  reduction in year-over-year last quarter inventories at the end of September.Based on our current trajectory, we expect our exports to continue to outpace last year, as we further diversify our client base and country of destination portfolios. We're exporting supporting an already healthy U.S. dark meat market potentially exists for relatively strong pricing and demand than typical expected in the fourth quarter.Turning to feed ingredients. Harvest is progressing in the U.S. despite below-trend yields, the historically large corn acreage has contributed to a recovery in U.S. corn ending stocks for the '23, '24 crop year. Production is forecast at just over 15 billion bushels making the largest crop since 2016. Ending stocks are currently forecasted at 2.1 billion bushels, an increase of 55  year-over-year.The large U.S. production comes certainly after a record Brazilian corn crop that is still compete priced. Global ending stocks for '23, '24 are forecasted to sell 14 million metric tons, assuming favorable South American weather and Argentina's production returns to normal levels after a remarkably weak prior year. As for soybeans, U.S. crop is estimated to be nearly 4  lower year-over-year, because of a reduced acreage and limited yield improvements, resulting in another year with historical low ending stocks.Nonetheless, last year's record crop in Brazil remained competitive in export markets, creating a large demand for the U.S. production. Though only in the planting stage, both Brazil and Argentina soy-crops are expected to be larger year-over-year, boosting global supply, like corn, South American weather will be key in realizing growth.U.S. soybean meal market should be well supplied, given continued crush industry expansion, assuming Argentina's forecast rebound in soybean production is realized. Further price pressure could arise. Although soybean or inflows can be heavily influenced by biofuel policies. The growth in production and diversification of import inflows should balance supply and demand.Turning to wheat. Global production is currently forecast to fall by 6 million metric tons from last year, largely driven by a drop from Russia's record crop. In U.S., wheat production increased 4.4 million metric tons from last year whereas Australia and Argentina estimates have been reduced, given slightly unfavorable growing conditions. Black Sea exports continue without an agreement between Russia and Ukraine that should be monitored.Our U.S. business continued to navigate very volatile market fundamentals in big bird segment, along with persistent consumer inflation. Our diversified portfolio across bird sizes mitigated this prolonged challenges and we maintain our intense focus, and operational excellence and cultivation of key customer partnerships. Within big bird, the team continue to drive action points to further enhance operational excellence in our manufacturing locations.During the quarter, we achieved improvements in production efficiencies, both at the live operations and other clients. These efforts were also aided by enhanced market fundamentals during the quarter, but work still remains to consistently realize sustainable margin levels.In case ready, the team improved our volumes to keep customer partnerships. We increase distribution additional, promotional activity and improvement mix. In addition, the team maintained its operational excellence in both quality and service levels despite significant disruptions from Hurricane Idalia in the Southeastern United States. Equally important, we further diversify our sales pipeline, we differentiated high attribute effort that helps driving traffic and differentiation to our key customers.Small Bird remains strong given stable demand from QSRs, robust daily performance with key customers and sustained operational excellence. Given their consistent quality and service levels, the team secured additional business throughout the quarter and beyond across retail and foodservice. Our efforts to further diversify our portfolio to prepare foods continue to gain momentum.As the team realized significant growth through increased distribution, promotional activities and innovation. In retail, our fully cooked branded offerings Just BARE and Pilgrim's collectively grew 65  compared to last year. Within foodservice, the team reinvigorated growth with distributors, schools and commercial chains through our targeted expansion teams.Digitally influenced sales continue to play a role on commerce for prepared branded offerings. Our key customer media partnerships and investments have demonstrated their effectiveness as click-through rates are nearly double industry standards and consumer acquisition costs have fallen off. Equally important, digitally sales increased 90  over the past year.Given the exceptionally well-received shopper reaction, we look forward to increase partnership through the trade to further diversify our portfolio through branded offerings. Similar to the U.S., our U.K. and European business experienced an environment with continued consumer inflation. Improved pork fundamentals and relative affordability of chicken help mitigate this impact, but the team remains focused on our strategies.To that end, the business trended its key customer partnership with leading retailers and foodservice providers through targeted promotional activities and customer-specific offerings. The team also secured additional long-term business with selected retailers through efficient supply chain capabilities and differentiated product offerings.Our diversification through branded products continue to progress as both Fridge Raiders and the Richmond brands gained share throughout the quarter. Innovation also continues to play a key role as we launched over 100 items, many of which are designed to reinvent our fresh meals category.Our new product performance is becoming increasingly recognized throughout the trade as we receive multiple awards for development and launch execution. We continue to drive diversification and key customer focus through operational excellence efforts. To-date, we've made significant progress in the optimization of our manufacturing network and back-office support activities.Moving forward, will explore additional opportunities throughout our production footprint to increase efficiencies and drive scale to meet our growth aspirations. We will also continue to closely monitor various economic indicators. Wage growth is now ahead of inflation and consumer confidence has resumed in support trajectory.Based on these factors, consumers may be willing to increase protein consumption, trade up within retail, or pursue away-from-home eating opportunities in foodservice. Given our diversified portfolio and key customer presence across channels and operational capabilities, we are positioned to adjust to these trends and accelerate our growth.Turning to Mexico. The business experienced a strong performance in the third quarter, given improvements in live operation, grain and currency favorability and more balanced supply and demand fundamentals in the region. The business strengthening its key customer focus, given continued growth with leading retailers and QSRs. Equally important, our diversification efforts through branded offerings continue to gain traction among retailers and consumers alike.In Prepared Foods, the Pilgrim's brand grew double-digits compared to last year, whereas our recent Just BARE launch has been exceptionally well received through the marketplace. Moving forward, we'll further cultivate our branded presence through additional marketing support for the Unique Taste and Favorites and the introduction of a Just BARE fresh offering.We continue our commitment to driving profitable growth through continued investment and operational excellence. We have completed our expansion in the Merida region and expect to initiate production in the first quarter of 2022, increasing the geographical diversification of our progress. Also, our projects to enhance biosecurity for live operations, our progress as planned, and it should be completed according to schedule.We're also proud to have published our sustainability report in September to highlight our continued progress on our journey to become a leader in environment, social and governance matters. We have made significant progress against the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals since 2019 as our team members' Global Safety Index improved by 54  and our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse emissions intensity fell by 20 .We continue to invest in the communities in which we serve as we have funded over  50 million in projects through our Hometown Strong initiatives and we provided higher education tuition fee for 350 team members, all members of their families to our better futures.Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Matt Galvanoni.For the third quarter of 2023, net revenues were  4.36 billion versus  4.47 billion a year ago with adjusted EBITDA of  324 million in a margin of 7.4  compared to  460.5 million and a 10.3  margin in Q3 last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 7.0  in the U.S. compared to 14.7  a year ago.For our U.K. and Europe business, adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 6.1  for Q3 compared to 4.0  last year. In Mexico adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 12.4  compared to a loss of 1.5  a year ago.Moving to the overall U.S. results, our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 came in at  174.1 million compared to quarterly profit of  418.3 million a year ago, when the Jumbo Cutout was just starting to come off its all-time highs. Over the last three quarters we've grown U.S. profitability sequentially despite volatile market conditions.Our key customer partnerships helped drive strength in our case-ready business during Q3 and we see further momentum in retail volumes continuing. Also, the U.S. Small Bird and Prepared Foods businesses continued to their strong 2023 performance during the third quarter. Our Big Bird business realized quarter-over-quarter improvements through a combination of operational excellence programs and enhanced market fundamentals.In the U.K. and Europe, adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was  80.4 million versus  48.5 million in 2022. Through its previously discussed operational excellence efforts, the business improved profitability over 65  year-over-year and it is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing profitability.During Q3 the business also continued to benefit from the back office integration and its network optimization programs. As inflation moderates, the U.K. consumer should return to more normal shopping patterns, enabling further growth for our business.Mexico generated  69.5 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 compared to a loss of  6.3 million last year. The Mexican businesses experienced more balanced supply demand fundamentals or reduction in birds disease challenges and it's live operations due to teams extraordinary efforts and foreign currency favorability. Overall, our SG A in the quarter was lower year-over-year primarily due to a decrease incentive compensation and legal defense costs in the U.S., as well as other targeted cost efficiencies achieved in the U.S. and U.K., Europe businesses.We spent  146 million in CapEx in the third quarter which is higher on a more normalized run rate basis primarily due to our investments in the Athens, Georgia expansion and construction of our new protein conversion plant in South Georgia. We reiterate our commitment to investment in strong ROCE projects that will improve our operational efficiencies through automation and tailor our operations to address key customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for Pilgrims.Although the U.S. chicken commodity market has been quite volatile over the last year, our overall balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. As of the end of the third quarter, we had over  2 billion in total cash and revolver availability. After quarter-end in early October, we completed a  500 million long 10-year notes offering and paid off our 2027 notes through a tender operating process.Also in October, we entered into a new five year U.S. credit facility which was upsized by  50 million to  850 million is now unsecured. We're pleased with the results of these recent transactions and the overall interest in our debt offerings. Following these transactions, our net debt maturity is now not until 2031. Our liquidity position provides us flexibility during times of volatility in the U.S. commodity markets and allows us to explore further growth opportunities.As at the end of Q3, our net debt was approximately  2.8 billion with the leverage ratio of 3.5x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which is outside of our target ratio range of 2x to 3x. We anticipate this quarter to be the peak of our leverage ratio as we're about to last very challenging fourth quarter '22 and first quarter 2023 results, given the depressed U.S. commodity market pricing during those periods.Net interest expense in the quarter totaled  33.5 million. We anticipate our full year net interest expense to be approximately  160 million excluding refinancing costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.8  and 9.8  year-to-date. We are now estimating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14 . As a reminder, this amount could fluctuate depending on the final mix of earnings across our tax jurisdictions.Our capital allocation approach will remain disciplined as we look to grow the company and will continue to align our investment priorities and their overall strategies and portfolio diversification. Key customer growth, operational excellence and commitment to team member health and safety.Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead.Good morning, Fabio and Matt. Congrats on the very strong results. On the two questions, so first of all, we saw a very nice improvement and continued improvement just sequentially as it relates to the business in the U.S. from an operating income perspective. Now as we look into next year, and assuming maybe Mexico to stay as strong in the U.K., as well to continue to improve. How do you think about the potential of profitability in 2024  Or in other words, do you think it's achievable to reach what would be more of a normalized level of 6  to 8  operating income margins in 2024  That would be my first question.Sure. Thanks for the question. Ben, as always, we look at our differentiated portfolio. We created this portfolio a long time ago where we target to have a portfolio that can capture upside on the commodity market. So, we have a big exposure to the commodity in the U.S. with the Big Bird operation, but we can protect the downside and have more stable business with our kids ready, our Prepared Foods and our Small Bird business.If you look at the performance this year, the Small Bird, the Prepared Foods and the case ready has performed really well. At the same level as the year before. What has been very volatile has been the commodity business or the Big Bird segments. Looking into the next year three things, I think, are very important for us to identify and to monitor. I think, one is the competing proteins.As we see by the USDA numbers released yesterday, we're expecting limited growth in the domestic availability of total protein in the United States, being beef really down, compared to year-over-year. And at a very expected high price, which tends to favor chicken in promotional activities, both in the retail and food service. I think we're also seeing a moderation in the high prices of grain.As we said, we are having very favorable production, especially on the corn side, which should help our costs overall. And also the promotional activity for the chicken, both, again, in the retail and food service. Also, our operations have improved. I think we're lapping - the big problem that we have in staffing, because of the pandemic. All of our operations are now fully staffed.We still have a lot of operational improvements to capture based on training and based on full operations and better mix, but I think that should help our operations next year. So what we have is a scenario that is posing some headwinds for chicken overall. Or tailwinds, in terms of now what can change, of course, the economy can be different if the consumer has less available money to spend. But on the overall chicken has been more resilient to even economic downturn scenarios.Okay. Perfect. And then my second question, I guess that one is for Matt. Just coming back on the capital allocation side, and you just said on the call, to continue to invest in high returning projects, et cetera. Can you update us on what you're expecting full year CapEx to come out  I mean obviously, we're year-to-date already almost at the levels we were in full year last year. So is that run rate about  150 million for the fourth quarter, should we expect that to come in as well  And how do you think about CapEx into next year  Is there a normalization  Or you would still expect some elevated levelsYes. Good question, Ben.  We dealt  in fourth quarter and look, I think in total for the year, we'll definitely be north of  550 million. Our run rate should maybe slightly slow down as we wind down the Athens construction, but we still will be finalizing our construction in our South Georgia facility, which are two of the bigger strategic projects, which we've been mentioning over the last year.So the run rate that we've been having at kind of this  140 million probably pretty close to what I would see kind of going into the fourth quarter in full year north of  550. I think relative to next year, I think what we'll do as we get through our budget process and our strategic focus here as we wind through our budgets here in the fourth quarter and meeting with our Board, we'll be giving updates to you guys on that, at our earnings call in February.But generally speaking, we break this minute, we don't have those larger strategic projects that have been initiated similar to the Athens and South Georgia protein conversion, which would tell us to it'd probably be down slightly for sure year-over-year.And also, over the last two years, Ben we invested heavily in automation as we have been talking about, especially on the breast deboning automation. And as we have the plants fully staffed, of course, we're always looking to the payback of those projects, but we don't expect significant investments in that scenario.Okay. Thank you. Congrats again.Thank you, Ben.Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning.Hi Ben. Good morning, Ben.Fabio I want to pick up on some comments you made just around the fourth quarter. You noted that supply production levels are trending down through kind of most of the third quarter, and it looks to be continuing into the fourth quarter based on the leading indicators. You noted prices are at a historically average level, but relative to grain prices seem unsustainably low. In light of that and the demand backdrop that you've laid out, do you think we could have a counter seasonal move in breast meat prices  As we move through the quarter, recognizing I know the prices are under pressure a bit to start the quarterYes. It's a great point. But usually, Q4 is the lowest price for chicken, because of all the events that we have Thanksgiving and Christmas is typically not the best sales moment for chicken as we have a lot of features on the other proteins. I think starting mid-November and beginning of December, what we usually see in our industry is a big increase in terms of demand because of the expectations for the beginning of the year.I think people talk about New Year's resolution. But I think it's more after the Christmas and after New Year, people go back to the normal buying patterns and chicken is an everyday item that is very important for our families. So what we expect, similar to prior years is a reduction in supply. And we're seeing, as I mentioned, that on the exits that are informed by USDA.And we're seeing a pickup in demand starting mid-November, beginning of December, and that's when we expect the prices to start increasing. I think the volatility has been really strong on the breast meat. If you look at the cut out, there'll be other parts where we are seeing a much better supply and demand scenario. I think wings that was very low last year as it was priced out of the menu and many food services.It's coming back to the menu. So we're seeing a steady increase in the price of wings. Of course, the wings season that just started also helps. And we're seeing, as we mentioned, steady improvement in the exports as the leg quarters from the United States are very competitively priced compared to all the other proteins available on the export scenario. So when you think about the cutout, we're seeing more volatility on the breast meat, but very well supported on leg quarters and on the wings.Okay. Very good. My second question is related to Mexico. Another strong quarter there. Can you provide any color on the go-forward outlook for 4Q  And then Hurricane Otis, it doesn't look like you guys have operations where that made landfall and was, most of the devastation was concentrated. But do you expect that to have any impact on operations at allYes. Sure. On Mexico, as we always mentioned. It can be very volatile quarter-over-quarter, but we expect to be really strong year-over-year, and that's not different this year. I think last year, we saw a very strong first quarter and a very weak second quarter. Of course, that was based on some internal issues that we have on the live operations.First half and second half, yes.Yes. But this year, what we are seeing is a strong demand for chicken. As I mentioned, I think the first semester and even Q3, which is not normal because what happens normally, the seasonality in Mexico is that as schools are out, people change their buying patterns, and we see a weakness in the purchasing of chicken. And as the school come back, we're seeing a lot of available income coming for school supplies and also an impact in demand.But this year has been different than other years, and we see a very strong Q3. October, September and October has always been the lowest levels of pricing in Mexico, and that was not different. This year, but we are seeing prices already recovering. There is always the competition of competing proteins and imports from both United States and Brazil, impacting the demand in Mexico as well. But I think that we are seeing a very favorable scenario coming in the next quarter.Yes. And Ben, just a couple of things to follow-up. One is I could say also foreign currency volatility is something we're currently always monitoring there in Mexico. And your question relative to the storm, my understanding the storm hit the - off  coco  area, which does not, it's not an area that has a lot of production for us, and it has now thankfully dissipated. The storm is not nearly severe. So, we're not seeing, at this point, any severe impacts to our operations at this time.Okay. Great. Thanks so much.The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on some of the operational improvements. In the press release you alluded to on covering some incremental opportunities. Can you elaborate a little bit on what those are  And is there any way to quantify, I guess, the magnitude of those or the contributions of those improvements that you've realized so far this year and then the new ones going forwardSure. Thank you for the question, Andrew. Yes, every year in the budget time, we identify the opportunities for operational improvements. We call that opening the gaps. And then also during the budgeting we created action plans to close those gaps and capture those operational improvement. Typically, we expect around  100 million to  200 million in improvements every year, doing things to more efficiently capturing better yield, better live operations and better mix.So last year was no different. We identified a lot of operational improvements that we can take I think the biggest challenge was the staffing of our plants. So, we were not fully staffed. It was very difficult to attract talent to our operations. And as the 2023 started, we're seeing an improvement in that scenario. And as I mentioned, right now, we are fully staffed. So, I think the challenge right now is to train all of our team members to operate efficiently and capture those improvements, as I mentioned.Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess I just had a question more broadly on your market share. I mean given some of the dynamics and the sales trends and distribution, et cetera, that you've called out. It would seem certainly like you're gaining share in the U.S. And I'm, in particular, interested on the distribution side with respect to case ready. If you could talk maybe about what's going on there  I mean do you think that you're taking share from other key players in the industry  Or is there a broader growth here  That you're servicing with the key customers that fits into  How would you characterize what's going on there  Thanks.Yes. That's a great question. When we think about market share, we don't look overall. We look into the individual segments, right  And as we mentioned, we have a very well-balanced portfolio. We are the leaders in the Small Bird category, and we've been gaining market share as our presence with key customers have been increasing. So we're gaining market share with our key customers and our key customers are winning in the marketplace, and that's more different on the case-ready segment.We've been growing our market share because we've been increasing our market share with our key customers and our key customers are growing faster than all the other customers or players in that segment. As an example, we increased, the market increase in Q3, 3.4  in the fresh category in the retail, and we increased 9 . Because of our penetration in those key customers, again, that are growing faster than all others.On the Big Bird category, I think there have been a lot of additions in the last for 5 years in this industry, and we have not increased in number of plants. Of course, we have improved in terms of number of heads and we have improved in terms of yields. But in that category, I think we've been having a very stable market share.Great. Very helpful perspective. Thank you very much.The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning.Good morning, Peter.Maybe to actually follow-up or ask Andrew's question a bit different on market share. One of the dynamics I feel like we're seeing, at least within U.S. retail, is maybe a shift from kind of the center store or some of the frozen categories to the perimeter, just as consumers are kind of being more, choosy with dollars. Given you guys kind of have exposure in both parts that just, it seems like that kind of is what you're seeing as well, maybe that the perimeter is gaining share relative to the frozen or seller store categories. But wondering if you can just comment on kind of that dynamic and what you're seeingNo, I think it's a great question, Peter. And yes, I think we are seeing customers shifting from the frozen category to the fresh category, maybe on IQS to the fresh category. I think we have a great offering that differentiates our key customers. As we mentioned, we produce tailored products to our customers that are differentiated and targeted towards their specific segments. So we have Fresh from Florida.We have Fresh from Texas. We have differentiated offerings in terms of no antibiotic ever in terms of Veggie Fed that we tailor our products to their specific customers. We augment that with our, just BARE brand, which is a higher antibiotic offering that complements the portfolio of our key customers. And that's why I mentioned we've been growing on the fresh category.Now on the frozen category, the fully cooked category for Pilgrim's  have been increasing year-over-year, which are Just BARE launches and Just BARE penetration. So for us, what we are seeing is the growth in the frozen fully cooked category through our Just BARE and Pilgrim's brands and a growth in our fresh offerings with partnership with key customers on customer brands.What is reducing and you're absolutely right. This is what we call IQS, which is more a commodity operation that is a frozen offering of a non-value-added breast meat or wind or tender.Got it. No, that's helpful. And Matt, your comments just around the balance sheet, right, the leverage position has kind of improved here or should continue to improve here into the next quarter. Just given where the cash position sits on the balance sheet, how are you thinking about opportunities to redeploy the cash, whether that be opportunistic share buyback, which you guys have done in the past or potentially M A opportunities that are out thereYes. And I think just one thing just to make sure everyone's cognizant of. We see the cash balance at the end of the quarter. That number will be down  350-ish million with the tender offer we did, because we did the bond offering for  500 million and paid down debt for  850 million. So just to make sure people are cognizant there that our cash balances are close to that  500 million,  550 million area at this stage.Our view on this, look, is we want to grow, but we're going to grow in a disciplined manner. We've done some nice CapEx with some key customers for some different attributes that they may want in their products that where we've had some higher CapEx run rate, more of an organic growth perspective. And we see more of those opportunities coming. And so, the way we look at it from a cash perspective right now is growth in a disciplined manner. I don't know, Fabio, do you want to add anything furtherI think that's absolutely right. We're always looking for creating value for our team members and our shareholders. And we look for acquisitions that complement our portfolio. We are always looking for things that, we can add value and operate it better or complement our portfolio of brands or geographies. So, I think the market has been really strong on M A activity, and we will do an acquisition when we believe that will create value for our company.The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.Good morning, Adam.Good morning. So a lot of discussion on boneless market and you've alluded to the volatility in the market and you did see some pretty notable almost some unusual counter-seasonal strength through the third quarter. I would love to just get kind of your thoughts on kind of how, what was really driving kind of the market just as we think about incremental potential sources of volatility moving forward, kind of more recently was an interesting one that would be helpful just to frame, think about what could, how that could recover if at allYes, sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, we've been seeing that the volatile part of the cut out has been the breast meat. As I mentioned, leg quarters has steadily increased. Wings resumed their growth trajectory with being back to the menus and more featuring, but breast meat has been really volatile. We saw some big increases at the end of the quarter, and that was mainly restocking of the, both the foodservice distributors and the, what we call industrial.So, the further processors and the branded companies that sell on the retail, I think over the beginning of the year, what we saw was with high prices at retail, those industrial customers, as we mentioned, we're actually buying less. And we saw that in every single earnings release from the big brand names that they were selling at a higher price, but a lower volume.And I think that was combined with lower production with a reduction in their inventories as well. So I think we saw during the end of the quarter, a little bit of restocking of those. And we saw some pickup in the demand on the retail. I think we saw a lot of features. We always mentioned that the commodity segment was always augmented by the case-ready demand during the grilling season. And I think we saw that late after Labor Day this year. But we are seeing that as of now as well.Where the case-ready category or the retail category with increasing features is actually buying big bird breast meat from commodity players to augment their offerings on the retail. So I think that big increase was based on these two factors, more industrial for the rebounding or rebuilding of the stocks more retail based on the features. And the foodservice continues to be strong.I think the distribution on the foodservice, as we see the number of servings and penetration on the menu, chicken has improved once again because of the availability and the higher price of the competing proteins.That's helpful. And then if I just have a second question on the U.K. and Europe and the margin had a nice kind of sequential improvement again, just help us think about the visibility that you have on the margin on the profit side moving into the first half of next year. Is there any concern on volatility in hog markets  Or do you think that you're now in a better balance between the network and the Fresh poultry, the Prepared Foods and the Pork businessYes, that's a great point, Adam. Yes, as we build this portfolio, we have a very well balanced between Chicken, between the Fresh pork and Prepared foods, both meat and meals. I think we have invested in innovation as well. I think that has been one of the great strides that we made on helping our key customers to succeed just like we do in the U.S. investing into innovation.As I mentioned, we have more than 100 new products launched, especially on the news scenario. On the fresh, I think what we are seeing is that Pork has helped with a more balanced supply and demand. I think now the live operation of pork is profitable in Europe and was negative for a significant amount of time, and we are the highest have the highest integration of all players in U.K. And on the fresh chicken, what we are seeing is a significant increase in demand because of the affordability of chicken. As we are seeing inflation in Europe was really high.And it was over the wage inflation. But right now, that change, and we're seeing that wages are actually outpacing inflation. So the consumer must have more available income. We are seeing the translation of that into the consumer confidence in the region, and we expect an overall increase in the demand of protein.Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.Thank you, Adam.The next question comes from Priya Ohri Gupta from Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi. Thank you so much for taking our question. Matt, one for you, if I could start. Your free cash flow performance has been coming in better, largely driven by strength in working capital. Just given some of the commentary you guys have made around the grain market, how should we think about working capital for the full year as it relates to cash from operations  Could we end up being in a more neutral position on working capital  Or is there even scope for it to possibly be positiveThanks for the question. I think it's probably overall more net neutral. I do see, though, as you pointed out, grain moderating. We have already started to see some of that. That started to hit our P L here we'll call it sort of in the second half of the quarter of Q3.And we do see a little bit more moderation here on the grain side. So that should be beneficial to us, both from a P L perspective, but also as you point out, a working capital perspective. So we do see a little bit of continued improvement from where we sit today, but I wouldn't take that just too far at this stage.Okay. That's helpful. And then can I, I just wanted to follow up around the more constructive comments around the European consumer. You just talked about how wages are outpacing inflation and you're starting to see increased more confidence is really sort of dovetailed with some of the more cautious commentary we've heard from others around the European consumer versus the U.S. consumer.So how, I guess, how sustainable do you think some of these stronger trends in terms of the U.S. consumer could be relative to sort of uplifting protein demand  Should we think about this as quarter-to-quarter, I think that we should track  Or is there something more sustainable that we could think about as we model out into '24Yes. I think in Europe, what we were seeing, it was an overall reduction in demand, especially on the red meat category and a little bit of pork too because it was more expensive than all others. Chicken was actually steady or gaining a little bit of, let's say, market share in the overall protein category. As we mentioned, as we're seeing the economy improving, we were seeing that the consumer with more available income, and we expect a better overall demand both in retail and in foodservice.I think also when we were seeing a little bit of higher inflation in Europe, what we were seeing people trading out of some branded and going to more the retail brands, which typically are more affordable, and despite that, we saw a growth in our Richmond because of the strength of the brand, but we believe that, that could be a nice change, and we can see consumers going back to some branded offerings. Which could help, especially the Richmond brand and our Fridge Raiders brands in the region.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Fabio for closing comments.Thank you very much. Over the past year, we've experienced many challenges throughout our business, ranging from volatile market fundamentals, persistent inflation, elevated input costs and compressed spread across proteins. Nonetheless, we continue to invest in our business and building the best team in the industry, driving profitable growth through key customer partnerships, diversification and operational excellence, making our foundation even stronger as conditions change.Moving forward, we are confident on market condition improvements as wage growth is outpacing inflation, floating spreads and return to more normal levels and grade production has increased. Regardless of external factors, we remain relentless in our focus on execution of our strategy, reinforcing our competitive advantage and becoming the best and most respected company in our industry is creating a better future for our members. Thank you for joining us today.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T15:32:10.000-04:00
W. P. Carey Is Fairly Valued: No Margin Of Safety,"The economics of REITs as an asset class is influenced by two cycles. There is the space market cycle which has to do with the supply and demand for a particular type of space. For a sale-leaseback specialist such  W. P. Carey is a spread investor. W. P. Carey acquires a company s real estate and then leases it back to them on a long-term, triple-net basis. To finance the purchase of the real estate, they access debt and equity markets at a lower cost than the rental revenue they earn from the leaseback. The tenant takes care of substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property, including real estate taxes and property insurance. W. P. Carey simply collects rent and profits from the spread between the rental income earned and the cost of the capital used to acquire the real estate.For a REIT, this spread can be calculated as the difference between the capitalization rate, or cap rate, and the cost of capital. The cap rate is the net operating income divided by the value of the assets and the cost of capital can be decomposed into the cost of debt, the cost of equity and the relative weights of each form of capital employed in the business.Let us first estimate the cap rate.Please take a look at Table 1 for the implied capitalization rate for the Diversified REIT sector for the last seven quarters.There has been a steady upward trend in cap rates for the diversified REIT sector. If we take the average of the two recent quarters, we arrive at average cap rate for the current half year at 7.54 . To this estimate, we should probably consider some adjustments. W.P. Carey has meaningful exposure to Europe and cap rates have not yet shown the same trajectory in Europe as they have in the U.S. In the , the CEO echoed similar sentiments and remarked that transactions in the first half of the year were executed at a cap rate of 7.3 . We shall use this cap rate for our analysis.For W. P. Carey to earn economic profit, their cost of capital must be less than 7.3 . Let us now turn our attention to the cost of capital for W. P. Carey.In order to calculate the cost of capital, we have to calculate the cost of debt, the cost of equity and scale each cost to the extent they are used in the business. Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by W.P. Carey. Please take a look at Table 2.Now that we have the relative weights, we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost. Please take a look at Table 3 for the cost of equity. There are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity. We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM  in which we essentially add a spread to the risk-free rate and scale the spread by the volatility of a particular stock.The beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market. The beta is 0.79 implies that W.P. Carey s stock is less sensitive than the market. Conceptually, this is justified since W.P. Carey s revenue stream is secured by counterparties that are often investment grade tenants. It is for this reason that triple-net lease REITs are sometimes considered bond-like investments and are frequently classified as a defensive holding. Moving on to the next statistic, the risk-free rate. I use the 10-year Treasury which is a frequently used proxy for the risk-free rate. The last input is the equity risk of 4.40   reflecting the most recent monthly data coming from . This is well within the historic range. The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 7.76  .Now that we have a cost of equity, let us now estimate the cost of debt. Please take look at Table 4 in which we provide the issuer rating for W.P. Carey and the median yield for similarly situated fixed-income investments.The implication of the cost of debt is that should W. P. Carey wish to secure or refinance debt at about the 10-year tenor, it would be facing a cost of debt of 5.75 . This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 5.75  of their long-term debt because fixed-rate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower. In general, businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates. Because of this, the actual cost of debt will be less. Nevertheless, W.P. Carey has a 2.45  due February 2032 priced at  77.25 that exchanged hands at a  on September 8. The issue is callable so that would lend support to our 5.75  estimate.Now that we have a cost of debt, the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital. Please take a look at Table 5.The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate level. Additionally, W. P. Carey does not have any preferred shares outstanding.In Table 6 we quantify the amount of the value that is created by W. P. Carey by subtracting the cost of capital from the cap rate.In the current macroeconomic environment, W. P. Carey is able to generate value to the tune of 30 basis points.A REIT creating value is only part of the picture. While it is necessary condition for a potential investment, it isn t a sufficient one. We also have to ask to whom does that value accrue to  Fixed income holders  Management  Equity investors  As equity investors with minority interests, we want to make sure that at least some of that value created shows up in our account.To estimate how much value is created on behalf on equity investors, we will revisit the cost of equity calculated previously.We estimated the cost of equity using CAPM which is a statistical way of ascertaining the cost of equity. There are other methods to estimate the cost of equity. Also, cost of equity is the terminology used from the company s perspective. It is the  for them to obtain  capital. From the investor s point of view, the cost of equity is the required rate of return for an investment. And for many investors, particularly REIT investors, the required rate of return has two components  the current dividend yield and the growth rate of the dividends.Please take a look at Table 7 where we look at the total return as the current dividend yield plus five-year growth rate as supplied by Seeking Alpha.In the next Table, we compare the total return just presented to the cost of equity presented in an earlier table.We can see from Table 8 that there is currently a negative value of three basis points. Had there been a minimal  difference, that would not have changed the investment picture. You want to see a wide, positive difference as a signal that there is an adequate margin of safety in the investment. An adequate margin of safety is important in an analysis like this in which a small change in one variable can exert a meaningful difference in the results.A second takeaway from the foregoing might be that the stock appears efficiently priced by the market.The spread between the cap rate and cost of capital is positive and a welcome sign for W. P. Carey in particular and probably other REITs in the diversified sector as well. While W. P. Carey creates value as a business, an investment in the equity is not as compelling. The cost of equity estimated using CAPM can be thought of as an opportunity cost and the total return that can be obtained at today s price does not meet the opportunity cost hurdle. There are factors that can change this investment picture. The factors that can change the investment picture that are beyond management s control include changes to the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium. The factors that can change the picture that is within management s sphere of influence include the value of dividends paid per share and the rate of growth of the dividends. Of the two, a modest increase in the dividend growth rate would be a welcome development.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Valero: Despite Massive Strength, I'm Considering Selling (Rating Downgrade)","It's time to discuss an investment that has been with me since I started my current dividend growth portfolio in 2020. I bought  during the depths of the pandemic whenWhile I was unable to buy it at the bottom  I was down more than 20  at some point , the stock has turned into one of my best investments, returning almost 200 , excluding dividends.I'm bringing this up because the company has gone from an underperformer with many issues and a high risk of dividend cuts to a company that is firing on all cylinders.Not only is it benefiting from ongoing strength in gasoline demand, favorable margins, and past tailwinds that have resulted in a tsunami of cash, but also newThe bull case has gotten so good that I'm considering taking some money off the table - especially in light of potential economic issues down the road.In this article, I will share my thoughts and discuss the company's risk reward so investors know what's going on in my mind.Let's start with the bigger picture.The chart below shows the relationship between the VLO stock price   below its all-time high  and the ISM Manufacturing Index, my favorite leading indicator for economic growth.While the correlation is far from perfect, we see that economic downtrends almost always result in steep losses for VLO investors. Almost always.Right now, VLO shares are up 16  year-to-date, less than 4  below their all-time high.Meanwhile, the ISM Index has been below 50  the neutral line between growth and contraction  for ten consecutive months.Despite economic headwinds, refining companies enjoy strong tailwinds that are mainly supply-related.Earlier this month,  highlighted some of the biggest issues driving favorable refining margins.According to the article, oil executives are seeing a critical issue of inadequate crude-processing capacity due to a lack of investment, coupled with more frequent shutdowns, as refiners prioritize higher margins and defer planned maintenance.This pattern emerged during the APPEC by S P Global Insights conference held in Singapore. The consequence of this situation is the heightened vulnerability of fuel prices, particularly diesel and gasoline, to abrupt fluctuations whenever unexpected outages occur.For example, unplanned plant shutdowns have been occurring almost weekly in Europe.According to Bloomberg, Frederic Lasserre, global head of research   analysis at Gunvor Group Ltd., makes the case that many refiners have delayed routine maintenance, making them susceptible to unexpected technical glitches resulting in surprise outages.Especially after the pandemic, too much supply was offline, which forced refineries to produce at elevated utilization rates.Not only is this an issue in Europe, but stockpiles are tight in general.In the United States, inventories for finished products are dropping faster than expected.To make things worse, Russia is increasingly using its energy leverage.On September 21,  reported that Russia is temporarily banning exports of diesel in order to support domestic supplies. This hurts Europe and global supply in general. After all, if one region sees a lower supply, it needs to import from other regions.Having said all of this, instead of easing prices due to new post-pandemic supply, the situation remains tight, pressured by outages, persistent demand, and new geopolitical issues.Refinery companies are winning big time.Over the past three years, America's two pure-play refinery stocks, Marathon Petroleum  and Valero Energy, are up 439  and 234 , respectively. I excluded Phillips 66  due to its massive footprint in chemicals.With this in mind, what do we make of VLO at these pricesIn the second quarter, the company massively benefited from the aforementioned tailwinds.Its refineries had a throughput capacity utilization of 94 , capitalizing on tight product supply and strong product demand in the U.S.The company also started its Port Arthur coker, which has the capability of adding up to 100 thousand barrels of crude oil capacity to the company's daily capacity.Valero also expanded its renewable products.Looking forward, Valero anticipates that low global light product inventories and tight supply-and-demand balances will continue to support refining fundamentals.Global demand for transportation fuels has rebounded substantially, with gasoline and diesel demand on par with pre-pandemic levels and steady growth in jet fuel demand.This outlook reinforces the company's dedication to its core strategy of operational excellence, capital discipline, and delivering on its commitment to shareholder returns.When it comes to its commitment to shareholder returns, the company is seeing tailwinds that were unimaginable a few years ago.For example, in 2012, the company spent more than 100  of depreciation and amortization on sustaining capital expenditures. In 2022, that number was 55 , indicating much more efficient operations.Furthermore, the company's total CapEx requirements are below the longer-term average, thanks to lower growth CapEx, as major projects have progressed nicely over the past few years, generating additional earnings.Hence, after spending 2020 and 2021 protecting the , the company is now back on track, repurchasing stock and raising its dividend.Last year alone, the company distributed  6.1 billion to shareholders, which was a blowout record and still less than 50  of its net income.In the second quarter, the company made clear that it has a strategy of balancing dividends with share repurchases to ensure an optimal allocation of capital to provide returns to shareholders.As the overview above shows, Valero's share repurchase program is a fundamental element of its capital allocation strategy.The significant allocation of funds, amounting to  951 million in the second quarter for the repurchase of shares, shows the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and belief in the intrinsic value of its shares  buying back shares when the valuation looks attractive .The repurchase of roughly 8.4 million shares in the quarter alone reflects the proactive steps Valero is taking to manage its outstanding shares and potentially enhance shareholder value.Having said that, the current dividend yield is 2.8 , which is nothing to write home about, at least not in the energy sector, where drillers often pay much higher yields.On January 31, the company hiked by 4.1 , which shows that it is still mainly focused on buybacks instead of hiking its quarterly dividend commitment.Nonetheless, going forward, I expect dividend growth to pick up.The company has a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, which is one of the best numbers in its sector. It is expected to lower net debt to less than  3 billion next year, and free cash flow expectations indicate a  12  free cash flow yield next year.In other words, if the company were to spend every penny of free cash flow on distributions, it could distribute 12.3  of its market cap to shareholders.I'm not saying that will happen, but it shows how much cash this company is generating.Note that free cash flow is expected to fall in the years ahead. This is not an indication that Valero is doing something wrong. It shows that analysts are expecting a normalization in refining margins, as no analyst is willing to incorporate prolonged geopolitical issues and other supply forces in their estimates. I can get behind that.However, it means that any tailwinds could lead to higher expectations for the quarters and years ahead.This part is so tricky. Not only because nobody knows how long refinery margins will remain tight but also because the global economy isn't doing so well right now. We could easily run into a scenario where demand destruction offsets tight supply.Having said that, the company is trading at less than 4x 2023E EBITDA. That number rises to 6.6x 2025E EBITDA due to the aforementioned decline in expected margins.If we apply an 8x multiple, we get a price target of  177. The current consensus price target is  145, a dollar below the current price.My opinion is that the company will generate higher-than-expected earnings  including EBITDA and free cash flow  over the next few years. I do not expect supply to rebound as quickly as expected, and I'm also not a supporter of the thesis that quick EV adoption will significantly hurt demand.If anything, emerging demand in markets like Asia and Africa will likely provide strong export demand growth for decades to come.Having said that, I'm considering selling a bit of VLO.This is not a call to get people to sell VLO. This is just my view on the mid-term risk reward.I believe that VLO has a very bright future, and if I decide to sell, I will be on the hunt to buy back at lower prices. That could be triggered by a further decline in economic growth, causing potential demand destruction to offset supply tailwinds.Valero Energy has transformed from a struggling investment to a major success.The refining industry, despite economic headwinds, is thriving due to supply-related factors. Recent geopolitical shifts, like Russia's temporary diesel export ban, emphasize this.Valero's strategic growth and financial discipline bode well for investors. The company's prudent capital allocation strategy, boasting a sub-0.3x net leverage ratio, signifies a commitment to shareholder returns.Nonetheless, given the current risk reward and other investment opportunities, I'm considering selling a bit of Valero Energy Corporation to potentially buy it back at lower prices if I get the chance.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

"Wall Street Bulls And Bears, A Macro Review","Investors often get caught up in the day-to-day, week-to-week market action and often let the MACRO  long-term  view get confused with what happened yesterday, orThe MACRO view captures more of the fundamental backdrop and as we know the market can and often does diverge from what that might be telling us. In the near term, sentiment can overreach boundaries to both the upside and downside. Over time it is the MACRO scene that eventually wins out and that is why it's important to always have that view embedded in anAs regular readers of my missives are aware, since early 2022, I saw the emergence of the BEAR market that eventually took the S P to a 19  loss by year-end '22. Since Q3 '22 there were numerous calls for a very bumpy ride for both the economy and the market, as investors navigated the Fed's rate hiking cycle and high inflation backdrop. In essence, I was not among those that were calling for a soft landing. Instead, my view was that a recession was inevitable in '23.Despite the 'soft' economic data being reported and many indicators pointing to recession, I was fortunate to spot the change in the market price action in May and saw confirmation of a BEAR to BULL reversal in June, and now more confirmation in July. Price as it always does was the deciding factor that outweighed the poor fundamental backdrop that still exists today.The bottom line  By using  market action  by following the MACRO long-term technical view we were able to spot the BEAR market in February '22 and now the reversal to a BULL market in June of '23Analysts and economists can point to a myriad of reasons why the market has not followed the MACRO fundamentals, but I will highlight the TWO that had the most impact.Now let's switch back to the  MACRO view. First, we'll speak to the  - then to the  The reality is that we are still navigating several confusing cross-currents in the economy.With two negative GDP prints in the first half of 2022, many  including myself  believed the recession was here and in my view, the Stock market dropping into a BAER trend confirmed that. Since then we've watched GDP climb 2.6  in Q4 '22, 2.0  in Q1 '23, and 2.4  in Q2. Clearly, the economy is more robust than most believed it would be. Economists - including those at the Fed - are quickly abandoning their recession forecasts and concluding that the Fed may have successfully pulled off a soft landing. But while GDP growth in recent quarters appears solid, the economy is not nearly as robust as the headline data suggest.2Q23 GDP growth  2.4  quarter-over-quarter, annualized  is not as robust as the headline number indicates. Personal Consumption Expenditure  PCE  contribution to GDP growth slowed from 2.79  in Q1 to just 1.12  in Q2. Recall that PCE is not only about 70  of GDP, but it is also the most stable component of GDP.Other data points are also worth mentioning. We've already discussed the fact that while GDP  Gross domestic product  is increasing, GDI  Gross Domestic Income  is declining.GDI counts what all participants make from the sale of what is produced  i.e. wages, profits, taxes .Consider the following. In Q4 '22 GDP  2.6 . GDI  by 3.3 . In Q1 '23 GDP  2.0 . GDI  by 1.8 . One measure says the economy is expanding at a reasonably robust pace. The other says that the economy was in a recession earlier this year.If we look for other clues about how good or bad this economy is going the picture remains foggy. We've seen the Leading Economic Indicators fall for 15 straight months.However, the Conference Board also publishes the index of coincident indicators which consists of four economic indicators each of which rises or falls roughly coincident with the overall pace of economic activity. One such indicator is payroll employment, which has been climbing rapidly and is contributing positively to the overall index. Another coincident indicator is industrial production, which has declined slightly in recent months and countered some of the strength contributed by employment. As a result, this measure of current economic activity has been essentially unchanged for the past six months, which seems roughly consistent with the average of the GDP and GDP data. and why this post-stimulus fundamental scene has been a nightmare to figure out. The no-recession camp has consistently  to their credit  said the steady gains in employment confirm that the economy is not in or headed for a recession. Equally important, the surprisingly large declines in GDI suggest that the economy is not nearly as robust as the GDP data indicate. Thus, the Fed's decision to let the data guide them about what to do next seems warranted.The irony is IF the economy is as strong as the GDP data suggest, inflation is going to be very stubborn and remain above 2 -3 . Steady growth at those levels will soon begin to push inflation higher and force the Fed to raise rates further to cool things down. Investors are euphoric by the recent slowdown in inflation, but the euphoria may be short-lived. Increasing Energy prices may also be another factor that supports stubborn inflation.The Blue Chip Consensus increased its Q3 GDP estimate from -0.6  to 0.4  but reduced its estimate for Q4 from 0.1  to -0.1 . For Q1 '24 the consensus is 0.4 , Q2 at 0.9 , Q3 at 1.6 , and Q4 at 1.9 . At the very least these forecasts align with what I have believed for a while. However, it's not aligned with what the stock market is saying, and that suggests this situation could change once again. That leaves investors with a scene where economic growth is in such flux that anything can happen, and that If you aren't thoroughly confused by this investing scene allow me to toss this tidbit in as well. Before I do, let me remind you again that despite the near-term fundamental mess, The SAVVY Investor strategy will follow the Just like everyone has a nose, everyone has an opinion on what happens next with this economy. Let's try to stay with an OPEN mind while looking at the FACTS. No matter what your opinion is I believe we have to recognize what we are facing. At is a STRETCH to believe is going to have  on the economy down the road. That's just not feasible, nor is it a HIGH probability of occurring.The downgrade of the U.S. credit rating started a renewed conversation on a serious issue.The U.S. is now paying a record 663 billion in debt in '23. That interest is expected to grow exponentially to a point where 1 trillion a year in interest payments will be the norm.Stay tuned.After the S P 500's three-week winning streak came to an end, investors entered the scene on Monday in a risk-on-buying mood. Buying was concentrated in the Industrials  Financials Turnaround Tuesday arrived with a massive risk-off vibe across global markets that bled over to the U.S. scene. The US Dollar moved higher, Treasuries lower, and crude oil traded down as the U.S. markets opened.The gloom was driven by concerns over Chinese growth  poor trade data , and Moody's downgrade of US banks. If that wasn't enough, Italy went into  attack  mode when Poor sessions on Wednesday and Thursday had the BEARS celebrating their dominance as they sent all of the indices down for the second straight day. Friday turned into a mixed session that left the S P with a loss for the week, making it back-to-back weekly losses. It was the same for the NASDAQ Composite , while the DJIA rallied and posted a modest gain for the week. was largely as expected and the generally benign report rallied bonds and stocks as the report saw Fed funds futures further pare risks for a rate hike next month. Implied rates now suggest less than 10  chance for a September tightening, down from about 12 . And the probability of a November boost has fallen to about 26  from about 33 .However, Powell's July  super core  measure edged up to 0.2  from unchanged, and rose to 4.1  y y from 4.0  y y, and that should give investors pause. rose 0.3  in July on both the headline and core,  These follow June's unchanged headline. For the headline, There will be another inflation report before the next Fed meeting. In my view, the door for another increase remains wide open. dipped to 71.2 in the August preliminary report after climbing to 71.6 in July from 64.4 in June. Sentiment has improved from the record low 50.0 print from June 2022 and is near the best since October 2021. But it is still well off of the cycle high of 88.3 from April 2021. The weakness was in the  component which fell to 67.3 from 68.3 previously.When the cart comes before the horse there is rarely any forward movement. That's what we have seen in the transition to EVs. The cart is here but the horse in the form of charging stations and overall  convenience  hasn't been delivered. According to automotive research firm Cox Automotive,  that's a 342  increase from a year ago when only about 21,000 did so. At the current pace of sales, it would take 92 days for dealerships to sell all their electric vehicles.What's worse many models are now selling below MSRP  Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price  adding to the losses that are already I'm not sure we have ever experienced anything like this. Rush to produce a product that will lose billions as it's manufactured. I'll simply ask, how is that not a negative for the economyWhen we open this can of worms, we discover a lot more than what is being told. .In the entry-priced segment,  at around  9.78 per 100 miles. Entry-priced EVs charged mostly at home cost  12.55, while those charged at commercial stations reach  15.97., costing approximately  11.08 per 100 miles. This is lower than the cost for primarily home EV charging  12.62  and for mostly commercial EV charging  16.10 .It's not until we get to the  luxury  segment  the EVs most can't afford and be employed  do we finally see a shift in favor of electric vehicles and there are still  issues . High-end EV drivers charged mostly at home paid around  13.50 per 100 miles, compared to  17.56 for a comparable ICE car. Luxury EV drivers Eventually, EVs  become more economical than gas-powered cars but then there are the inevitable problems with the power grid that is still powered by fossil fuels. I emphasized the word  may  because  Does anyone believe rates  as demand rises  So I'll ask another question, what is the advantage of this RUSH to electric  And reiterate the initial concern. How is this entire transition not going to impact the economy negativelyI'll stand by what I have stated since the initial phases to go electric were initiated. This will be the biggest boondoggle ever imposed on any economy in the history of civilization if these mandates aren't scrapped quickly. The negative economic impact could be enormous. - Common sense may be entering the scene. Ford reported second-quarter earnings that revealed widening losses in its electric vehicles unit. That coincidentally prompted CEO Jim Farley to say  You're going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us .It's a first step that follows the lead of Toyota. They saw the handwriting on the wall, keeping their hybrid line intact, and were roundly criticized when they announced that strategy. In my view, they had it right from the beginning.Perhaps the laws of supply and DEMAND will be allowed to play out instead of MANDATING a change that clearly is NOT ready for prime time.The aforementioned announcement of a 40  windfall profits on their Banks is another example of a ball and chain being placed on capitalism. The government wants to use the proceeds from the  tax  to help those struggling with the cost of living. We've seen how the  have backfired here in the U.S.Their strong financial system was part of the reason for helping prop up Italy's economy as GDP growth came in above forecasts recently. Punishing a business that is running successfully, producing profits, and adding to GDP growth is a recipe for general economic disaster. While Italy calls itself a capitalist country, with this announcement socialism has entered the scene. That keeps the MACRO analysis questioning the prospects for global growth, and keeping the forecast at lows.The pullback from the July 28th closing high picked up momentum this week. It wasn't until the S P hit a key support level did we see buyers come in.During these  reversion  trades it becomes a question of whether the S P can bounce from here or break lower opening the door for further weakness. It's not uncommon for an index to retreat back to the breakout level, and for the S P that would target the 4200 range. But that came to an end recently as the S P 500 recently ended its streak of overbought daily closes at 45 trading days dating back to the Friday before Memorial Day. That was the longest streak since September 2020 and the 23rd time that it closed at overbought levels for 40 or more trading days.We've noted this multiple times but it's worth repeating  while the market is due for a pullback, these types of streaks occur in BULL markets, and by definition, Bull markets are periods of above-average returns.Bespoke Investment GroupWhile the S P 500 pulled back from overbought levels this week, it remains well above its intermediate-term support levels and the uptrends off the October lows remain firmly intact. This creates a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the market hasn't shown any signs of technical deterioration, but on the other, there's still downside potential before solid support levels are even tested.The breakout levels for the S P 500, DJIA, and the NASDAQ 100 have been easily identified. After long uninterrupted rallies, it's not uncommon for breakout levels to be tested. These levels The big news recently was a sudden increase in long-term Treasury yields as the 10-year yield increased from 3.97 , up to 4.20 on August 3rd, before settling at 4.15  on Friday. That leaves the 10-year uncomfortably close to the October 2022 closing highs of 4.24 . For the moment resistance has held and what happens next in rates could determine where the stock market trades in the next few weeks.I can't tell you where the market will be at the end of next week or the end of August, and a little gut check to keep the bulls honest is always on the table, but the picture between now and year-end still looks positive. There are different patterns on display for different indices and sectors, but they all have ONE thing in common the intermediate and long-term trends are UP.That should remain in the back of our minds as we now go thru what is the first real challenge to this 2023 rally.Given the choppy action in the market this week the small-cap Index  trades sideways after another failed attempt at a key resistance level. Since the November '21 high it has been a series of LOWER highs for the small caps. History tells us the Russell 2000 small caps are a good predictor for the US economy. This price action adds to the argument that the US economy is not on a solid growth trajectory, and there could be trouble ahead.Six weeks into the third quarter and the Q3 game plan is working to perfection. Laggards are now winners, and the Leaders have pulled back. A subtle shift to Value from Growth is underway. I suspect this could start to balance the scales and leave some investors wondering why they may have worn out their welcome in the HOT momentum tech trades.The Energy ETF  continues to show strength as it cleared the March April highs. With a decisive close  89  above those levels  87  the stage is set for a run at all-time highs  94 . In addition, all of the energy sub-sectors have rallied nicely. They are overbought in the short term, but the underlying trends suggest dips should be bought.The Oil service sector  pulled for a day back after making a new high, then followed up with another new high later in the week. It is due for a pullback, but if I am correct about the long-term prospects of this area of the market, it could only be getting started. After a slow start, the sub-sector is up 14  for the year.Many individual stocks in this group are extended, however, they are BUYS on dips.The group was a big part of the Q3 strategy forecast and it's working out nicely. WTI has strung together a seven-week winning streak on its trip to a close above  83 on Friday. The rally has taken out both the 50-Day moving average and 200-DMA after prices consolidated almost the entire year. While the move higher in prices has been dramatic, it has come with tighter physical markets.Refined product prices are starting to firm as well  wholesale gasoline futures trade at the highest levels since October, while diesel futures are trading at the highest levels since January. That's thanks to both the move higher in crude oil prices and higher refining margins per barrel. Gasoline premiums over crude are around  45 while diesel margins are around  90, a level unheard of before the invasion of Ukraine. That bodes well for the  refiners . Valero  and Marathon Petroleum  are the go-to names in that groupI've highlighted the reasons why crude supply can stay constrained and with the Saudis in control of pricing, they will do what is best for  and that keeps prices elevated. On the negative side, while we aren't there yet, Energy costs may once again become a problem for the US economy. High energy prices will keep inflation elevated. If it does, Energy stocks will once again become a  in the general market. I see no reason to lower exposure to the group.After two months of sideways action in a trading range, the Nat Gas ETF  broke to the upside. In typical fashion, this volatile commodity gave most of that gain right back on the following day. I continue to HOLD my position for the long termThe Financials  were humming along holding onto support until Moody's downgrade of the banking system came along. It wasn't able to hold on to near-term support and looks destined to test the July breakout levels.The weak action now has the long-term tend back in question, this group might be another  tell  on where the general market goes next.Commodity prices more broadly have also started to trend higher off the early summer lows. As shown below, the Refinitiv CRB Commodity Index has quietly rallied nearly 10The GOLD ETF breaks down once again and is back at the lower end of the trading range. Instead of challenging the old highs, GLD will be testing support.SILVER  also completely broke down this week. I've been aggressively trading the ETF taking quick gains when available while maintaining the CORE position. This weakness has me pondering adding another  LONG  trade.URANIUM  has been the bright spot recently. It rallied nicely in July and is tantalizing close to an upside breakout. My last  trade  was at a support level and I'm still hopeful the ETF can break past minor resistance and add more gains to a profitable trade. I do like the  look  of this chart pattern.The group  remains locked in a trading range between  120- 140. The sector was more stable than the rest of the market recently as the ETF is now closer to the upper band of that trading range closing at  136 on Friday.The Bitotechs  are on a roller coaster ride that has this group testing support. Higher interest rates continue to be an overhang on a group of stocks that is capital intensive.A pullback was in order and the NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 both broke initial support levels before stabilizing at secondary support. Since the July 19th interim high on the NASDAQ, we've seen a series of LOWER highs. While the entire Tech sector seems stable now, I wouldn't rule out more weaknesses ahead. The  trade  is now towards  value  and I can see that continue for a while longer. More tech stocks have broken first support and that is the first sign that more choppy sideways action is ahead.Coming into the earnings season, Semiconductors were set up for  perfection . While the reports have generally been OK, it was time for this rally to slow, and that is what has occurred. The intermediate trend is UP, but the short-term scene looks  toppy .The all-time high is about 11  away and the breakout that started this rally is  12  lower. It remains a question as to what will come first. A deeper pullback for this group would not be surprising.A stop, pause, a moment of digestion, whatever we wish to call it, this price weakness was overdue. The S P approached the  neutral  zone quickly and while there is plenty of room for further  price  normalization , I note the internals show signs of quickly approaching oversold territory, which tells me that there is more weakness underneath the surface over the last two weeks than the simple price charts are showing.Forget about the negative headlines that came across during the week, they had little to do with the price action. What we are witnessing is a good old-fashioned mean reversion in sentiment after an impressive run in stocks this year.It's safe to say we have entered a  and that means stocks that have rallied the most will at best be trading sideways for a while.

BGR: Economic Laws Make The Case For This Energy CEF,"A few days ago, we discussed the BlackRock Resources   Commodities Strategy Trust , which is a closed-end fund that invests in a combination of energy stocks, mining stocks, and other stocks that are poised to benefit from risingWe last discussed this fund in our service back in September. The fund s share price is down slightly since that time, as its share price declined from  13.14 to  12.95 per share. However, the distribution received offsets about half of that decline. The fund s performance over a longer period of time has been much more promising. We last  this fund on the public site on May 22, 2023. Since that time, the fund has significantly beaten the S P 500 Index This is partly due to the change in market conditions since that time. During the first half of this year, the headline inflation rate was falling rapidly and many market participants  and politicians  were inclined to call the Federal Reserve s fight against inflation a  victory.  As such, there was a great deal of optimism that interest rates would eventually be reduced, and we would get back to the bubble market environment in no time. However, as I , that improvement in inflation was almost entirely caused by the Federal Government flooding the economy with crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now that the Reserve is in tank-bottom condition, that is no longer an option. In the absence of this extra oil, the balance between supply and demand for crude oil is extremely tight and energy prices have been trending up since July. That reversed the optimism about the progress that has been made against inflation, causing the S P 500 Index to start declining as it now looks likely that high rates will be with us for a very long time. As energy prices have been slowly trending upward, this fund has outperformed the broader market index.As we will discuss in this article, the fundamentals for energy prices continue to remain strong, which should benefit this fund over the next few years. As such, it may be a good idea to obtain some energy sector exposure in your portfolio, and this fund offers an easy way to do it.According to the fund s , the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return. This objective makes a great deal of sense considering that the fund invests primarily in common equities. As we can see here, fully 98.53  of the fund s total assets are invested in common stocks. Its only other asset is a rather small cash positionThis is in line with the website s description of the fund s objectives and strategyAs I have explained in numerous previous articles, total return makes sense as a primary objective for any fund that invests primarily in equity securities. After all, common stocks are by their very nature total return vehicles. This is why investors purchase them with the intention of receiving an income from the dividends that they pay out as well as benefiting from the capital gains that should accompany the growth and prosperity of the issuing company. This differs from a fixed-income fund, which will generally have limited capital gains potential and deliver most of its total return in the form of direct payments to the investors.The energy industry as a whole is well known for paying out much higher yields than other sectors. After all, as of the time of writing, the Alerian MLP Index  yields 6.91 , which is actually one of the lowest yields that this index has had in many years. The iShares U.S. Energy ETF  currently yields 2.91  and the iShares Global Energy ETF  yields 4.39  as of the time of writing. Admittedly, all of these yields are less than we have seen for quite some time, but they are still better than most other sectors. For example, the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF  only yields 1.21  and the iShares U.S. Technology ETF  yields 0.37  at the current price. Thus, dividend income is likely to make up a greater proportion of the total returns for an energy fund like this one than it would for a fund that invests in a different sector.There is a very big reason for this. The energy sector in general came under a lot of fire from investors for the subpar returns that it delivered over the decade prior to the coronavirus pandemic. From January 1, 2010, until January 1, 2020, the iShares U.S. Energy ETF underperformed the S P 500 Index by a lotThis is despite the massive increase in production that U.S. shale producers delivered over the period. We can see that the big problem is that the energy sector in general never recovered from the crash in 2015 when Saudi Arabia was attempting to destroy the shale industry. This is partly due to the fact that energy prices never really recovered from that incident. This chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil over that periodInvestors were naturally upset by this poor performance compared to everything else, so the energy industry came up with a solution. Basically, many companies decided to simply pay out the majority of their free cash flows to the investors as share buybacks and dividends. They generally eschewed investing in production growth, even when energy prices skyrocketed in 2021 and 2022. This did result in some of these companies having dividend yields in excess of 10  though, so investors in these companies did fine over the years since the pandemic, even as every other sector was crashing in 2022.Unfortunately, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust s largest positions are not in those companies that sported abnormally high dividend yields during 2022 s energy price boom. Here are the largest positions in the fundHere are the dividend yields for each of these companiesAdmittedly, none of these companies have the jaw-dropping yields that we occasionally see in U.S. shale plays or midstream companies, but TotalEnergies and BP are not really too bad in terms of yield. All of them boast significantly higher yields than we see in many other sectors, however. For example, all of these companies except for Cheniere Energy have a higher yield than the S P 500 Index. By themselves though, none of these companies has a high enough yield to justify investing in the fund in the absence of capital gains. After all, if the yield was all we got, we would be better off just sitting in a 5 -yielding money market fund.Fortunately, all of these companies are positioned to see their net incomes and cash flow surge over the coming years. One of the big reasons for this can be found in the discussion that we just had about the poor performance of the energy sector since the oil price crash in 2014.As a result of that price crash, energy companies around the world tightened their belts considerably. Long-time readers may recall that I published a few articles around that time specifically pointing out that cuts to exploration and development activities would hinder growth prospects across the industry. That proved to be correct, and unfortunately, prices never recovered enough for investment to return to its previous levels. As a result, we now have a situation where the industry has underinvested in production capacity for almost a decade. However, the global demand for crude oil has not declined. The pandemic did result in a temporary blip, but total global oil consumption has been steadily increasingThis is expected to increase going forward, with most independent energy analytics firms projecting that total consumption will be somewhere between 105 to 110 million barrels per day in 2030. Due to the underinvestment in energy production over the past several years, it is unlikely that global crude oil production will actually be at that level. One of the characteristics of oil fields is that their production output declines over time. Thus, without sufficient new capacity coming online, production will go down. That is the scenario that is currently being projected to occur. Analysts at JPMorgan Commodities recently predicted that the world will have a 1.1 million barrel shortage of crude oil by 2025 and a 7.1 million barrel shortage by 2030I do not have to explain what that will do to energy prices, as the basic economic law of supply and demand makes that case for me. As we have seen over the past few months, the stocks held by this fund tend to appreciate when energy prices rise, as does the fund itself.Thus, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust appears to be very well-positioned to deliver both a very attractive yield and share price gains to its investors going forward.As mentioned earlier, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of total return. However, as is the case with most closed-end funds, the fund s basic business model is to maintain a relatively stable level of net assets and pay out most to all of its investment returns to investors. When we consider the total returns that are available both through capital gains and dividends, we can probably expect that this fund would have a reasonably high distribution yield.That is indeed the case, as the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust pays a monthly distribution of  0.0657 per share  .7884 per share annually , which gives it a 6.09  yield at the current price. This is not nearly as high as the yield that we can obtain from a fixed-income fund or similar, but the current yield is a direct result of the share price appreciation that the fund has benefited from over the past few months pushing down its yield. Unfortunately, the fund has not been particularly consistent with respect to the distribution that it pays outAs we can clearly see, the fund s distribution has varied quite a bit over the years. This seems likely to reduce the fund s appeal in the eyes of those investors who are seeking a safe and secure source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. This is not really the best use of this fund though, as our overall thesis here is that the fund works as a play on rising energy prices. As we can see above, the distribution cuts have generally occurred during periods in which energy prices were declining. The fund has been steadily increasing its payout over the past two years as energy prices have gone up and companies in the sector have started to give higher returns. For example, we can see here that it raised its distribution earlier this yearIt seems logical that the fund will continue to increase its distribution as our thesis plays out and higher energy prices allow the companies held in the fund s portfolio to enjoy higher valuations.As is always the case, we want to investigate how well the fund is covering its distribution. After all, we do not want the fund to be overdistributing and drawing down its asset base unnecessarily. This will not work very well in the long term, for obvious reasons.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund s most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on June 30, 2023. This is nice as it covers the first half of this year. As mentioned earlier in the article, this is a period in which the Federal Government was artificially suppressing the price of crude oil by draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As such, the price of crude oil during this period was lower than we saw over much of 2022, which naturally had an adverse impact on the performance of the companies that are held by the fund. The fund s ability to handle this situation and deliver solid returns will speak well of its overall quality of management, and of course, the better management s ability to generate returns during that environment, the better it should perform during a period of rising energy prices as we are likely to see going forward.During the six-month period, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust received  8,126,851 in dividends from the assets in its portfolio. The fund had to pay foreign withholding taxes on some of this, which reduced its total investment income to  7,731,316 over the period. The fund paid its expenses out of this amount, which left it with  5,682,231 available for shareholders. This was, unfortunately, not nearly enough to cover the  10,606,571 that the fund actually paid out in distributions over the period. That is likely to be concerning at first glance, as the fund clearly failed to fully cover its distribution out of net investment income.However, the fund has other methods through which it can obtain money to use to cover the distribution. For example, it might have had some capital gains that could be paid out. In addition, this fund occasionally writes options in an attempt to generate premium income that acts like a synthetic dividend for the stocks that it owns. Neither one of these things is included in the net investment income, but they obviously represent money coming into the fund. Fortunately, the fund did enjoy some success here as it reported net realized gains of  18,132,696 but these were offset by  28,865,010 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund s net assets declined by  18,450,086 during the period after accounting for all inflows and outflows.Despite the fact that net assets went down during the period, the fund s distribution does appear to be quite reasonably covered. One reason for this is that the fund s distribution was less than its net investment income plus net realized gains. The only reason for the decline in net assets was the net unrealized losses, but these can very easily be reversed the second the market becomes stronger. When we consider that the energy sector in general did start trending up around mid-July, it is quite possible that some of these losses are not losses anymore.Secondly, the fund s net assets are still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. Over the full-year 2022 period, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust saw its net assets increase by  84,989,114 after accounting for all inflows and outflows that it experienced over the period. Thus, the decline in net assets that the fund saw during the most recent period only partially offset that. Overall, the fund s finances seem to be in good shape, and we should not have to worry about too much here.As of October 12, 2023  the most recent date for which data is currently available , the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust has a net asset value of  14.65 per share but the fund s shares only trade for  12.95 each. This gives the fund s shares a whopping 11.60  discount on net asset value at the current price. This is a very attractive discount that is relatively in line with the 11.72  discount that the shares have averaged over the past month. As I have pointed out numerous times before, anytime that a closed-end fund obtains a double-digit discount, it generally represents a good entry point unless the fund s finances are distressed. That is clearly not the case here, so the current price is more than acceptable to buy the fund s shares.In conclusion, the BlackRock Energy   Resources Trust is a very solid closed-end fund that is well-positioned to profit from any increase in crude oil prices. That is quite likely to happen considering that it looks highly likely that the world will suffer from a shortage of this necessary commodity over the next several years. As such, the fund may make a lot of sense right now as a way to obtain a 6.09  yield that is likely to increase going forward. The fund is having no trouble covering its distribution and it is currently trading at an incredibly attractive valuation, so there is no reason not to pick up some shares here.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

ZIM Integrated: Getting Risky But Holding The Stock Is Still Justified,"You've got to love ZIM Integrated Shipping . The company entered the U.S. stock exchange two years ago, at a timing that many companies would envy. After the COVID-19 pandemic, container shipping rates had reached enormous levels, leading the share price toToday, however, is a completely different story. As you should already have noticed by now, container shipping rates have plummeted, as a result of lagging demand relative to the increasing supply of tonnage. It is in this context that I m writing today s article about ZIM.On August 16th, ZIM  their earnings for the second quarter of 2023, showing an EBIT loss of  147 million. The company reported a total net loss figure of  213 million, resulting to a negative EPS figure of  1.79. For the same period inIn addition, container volume remained rather stagnant for the second quarter of 2023, while for the first six months of the year the company realized a slight decrease in carried container volume. At the same time, freight rates moved significantly lower, reaching  1193 per TEU, a drop of 67  compared to the same period in 2022.For the full year 2023, the company anticipates an EBIT loss of  100 to  500 million and adjusted EBITDA of  1.2 to  1.6 million. For perspective, for Q1 2023, EBIT loss was  14 million, which added to the  147 million of Q2 2023, brings us to the upper half of the EBIT loss guidance. However, clearly the outlier figure is the  14 million EBIT loss recorded in Q1 2023, as the next quarters will likely be much worse, despite the fact that, traditionally, they are the strongest ones. So, this brings us rather to the lower end of the EBIT loss guidance spectrum  closer to  500 million .During the company's Q2 2023 , I was very glad to hear that from a total of 148 vessels, the company operates 16 car carriers. The reason is that this particular segment offers some very appealing economics, due to the shortage of carriers and the abundance of shipping demand. Already, some car carrier operating companies are planning to  their fees charged to their customers, due to the high charter prices of these vessels, reaching  110k per day  for 6.5k CEU vessels .Regarding the traditional container shipping business, due to the freight rate collapse, the company is moving into larger and more modern vessels, in an attempt to exploit economies of scale and cut down on operating costs. In ZIM, they are expecting to get their hands on 38 newbuilt vessels in the next 18 months, while 47 of their current vessels will reach their charter contract expiration, during the same period. So in 1.5 years' time, the company will be operating a much more modern and cost efficient fleet, also containing LNG powered vessels.However, container supply and demand fundamentals are ruthless at this point. On a global basis, container tonnage is expected to grow during the next year as well, while GDP growth prospects aren't exactly stellar.As we can see in the table listed below, the global economy is going for a slowdown, to say the least, while expected container volume growth is anticipated to be negative. This situation is going to continue to put pressure on ZIM, as with the exception of new vessels, their average charter time remaining is 24.6 months.If it wasn't for their strong cash position, I believe ZIM would be in serious trouble right now. However, the company ended the second quarter of 2023 with total cash  of  3.2 billion. The problem is that during this quarter, the company burnt just above  1 billion. At the , ZIM had  4.25 billion in total cash and cash equivalents etc. The cash burn between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 was  353 million. As you read before, tonnage supply will outgrow shipping demand at least until the first half of 2024. So, one can realize that if the next few quarters are going to be just as bad, ZIM could potentially face a liquidity problem.It is no coincidence that their net leverage ratio increased five-fold, from 0.1x to 0.5x in just one quarter. Moreover, if this metric is calculated on a TTM basis, as newer and lower EBITDA figures are inserted into the calculation, we can expect a significant rise in net leverage ratio. For example, assuming that the company's net debt remains steady at  1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 lands at  1.4 billion  guidance middle point , we get a net leverage ratio of 1.1x. But net debt will not remain the same in my view. I believe it will rise, as the company burns cash. So the net leverage ratio is expected to be even higher.I don't know if you have realized it already, but if you haven't, I'll put it plain and simple  ZIM is not going to pay a dividend in the third quarter of 2023. Neither will it pay one in the fourth quarter of 2024 in my view. I sincerely doubt that they will pay a dividend during the first half of 2024 either. However, at this low price point I wouldn't sell my shares. Instead I would generate income by writing covered calls against these shares, while at the same time keeping an eye on the next few quarters. I have every reason to believe that the market has discounted the worst case scenario for the company, so that's why I consider ZIM as a  Hold .

Always perform your own research before investing in the stock market.

Jackson Hole - The Future Of Inflation And Interest Rates,"Jerome Powell  about the past, present and future path of inflation and interest rates. Here are some highlights and general conclusions from his remarksThese were very honest and measured remarks. I thought they were well-balanced and as objective as they could be. I especially like the emphasis on the causes of inflation and the ways in which Monetary Policy is working, even if it s not working as quickly as they d like.I also especially liked the risk management approach here. We d like to think of the Fed as an omnipotent entity with perfect foresight, but the reality is that they re guessing just like the rest of us. And while that might be an uncomfortable view, it is the reality of navigating the economy and markets.We all have to make educated guesses about what s going to happen, and an important part of good risk management is understanding what go wrong, even if you don t things to go wrong.the broad conclusion from all of this is that interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer. This is a tough situation for the Fed. Inflation has come down meaningfully, but remains too high.This creates what I ve described as a bimodal distributional outcome here and it s part of what makes the Fed s job so difficult. In simple terms, the longer the Fed remains tight, the longer they grind credit markets. And that creates more and more default risk across time as firms and households have to roll old debts into new higher interest rate debt.This creates a highly asymmetric risk in credit markets where economic slowdown, defaults and deflation could eventually put significant downward pressure on markets and the economy.At the same time, the Fed needs to stay tight in order to ensure that inflation is under control. But if they stay tight for too long, they could exacerbate that credit market risk. Which will happen  It s cloudy, to be sure.This is both good and bad for markets as a whole. As I ve emphasized more recently, all of this is great for short-term investors who just want to clip a real return in T-Bills at 5.5 . But it creates a good deal of uncertainty across anything that is longer duration.Long duration corporate credit and equity are especially at risk here. Although our base case remains modest economic expansion that bimodal distribution creates a smaller, but asymmetric risk where longer duration instruments continue to generate meager risk-adjusted returns consistent with the performance of the last two years  the S P 500 is up 1  over 24 months with a standard deviation of 20   not great .An outlier credit event isn t our base view, but the current rate position makes that a meaningfully higher risk than it otherwise would be. And that warrants caution, not because we expect it to happen, but because we have to hedge that risk in case the Fed is wrong.This remains an incredibly confusing period in economic history, and describing it as  cloudy  might be an understatement. The solution to this, in our view, is to optimize certainty by establishing clear time horizons across portfolios.As our Defined Duration strategy emphasizes, investors should have a specific understanding of time within their portfolio so that these matters do not unduly influence behavior.Have a great weekend.

Jackson Hole: The Fed Faces The Ghosts Of The 1970s As Stock Market Rollercoaster Continues,"Next week, the Federal Reserve hosts its annual . Each year, roughly 120 central bankers, media members, academics, and business leaders attend to share research and escape the summer heat. Unlike its Since then, stocks have been on a rollercoaster, with the S P 500  fluctuating in a range above itsStocks have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year, though volatility slowed significantly as summer arrived. The 15  selloff in the S P 500 was soon followed by a rally in hopes of a Fed pivot. The rally soon fizzled when Powell didn't give the market what they were looking for and investors began to sell popular stocks in December for tax loss harvesting. Markets rallied again on pivot hopes, only to be pushed back down after the next Fed meeting in February. Stocks fell sharply during the short-lived spring bank crisis, while the subsequent post-bank-crisis rally seems mostly driven by sentiment and fear of missing out. Some profit-taking followed, and here we are, roughly at the same price as a year ago after 12 months of tug-of-war. However, Jackson Hole may break the stalemate.In Powell's speech last year, he alluded several times to the policy mistakes of the 1970s. Then, the Fed's lack of commitment to fighting inflation contributed in large part to allowing core inflation to rise from roughly . Inflation came in three waves then, and the Fed would raise rates to halfheartedly fight inflation, only to cut them too soon and allow inflation to roar back.Most people reading this know the story of how Arab nations imposed a  on the United States, Canada, and the UK in 1973. More than a few of you reading this likely lived through the gas shortages, 55 mph speed limits, and sky-high inflation. In 1973, oil prices skyrocketed and stock markets crashed. The S P 500 fell 48  from peak to trough. fared much worse, falling over 73  from peak to trough.Less widely known is how a series of policy mistakes that traded short-term gain for long-term gain set the stage for this. This is one reason that political pundits tend to think , while  it may be harder.Compare this with todaySo far, the Fed has steadily raised interest rates until they've reached a positive real yield. Sound  this is what is needed to bring down inflation. Now, they'll have to raise them a bit more and keep them above the rate of inflation in order to avoid a disastrous repeat of the 1970s.  from the last meeting showed that members feared upside risks to inflation, which is why most members support hiking interest rates a bit more, even with some progress on inflation. The market is skeptical,  that the Fed is done hiking and will soon begin to cut. However, the Fed said they're going to hike , so there are plenty of people  including me  who will take them at their word.The key to understanding the Summary of Economic Projections is to read between the lines. By comparing the rate of core inflation the Fed projects and the interest rate it projects, we gain an understanding of how the Fed is likely to respond to rising or falling inflation. Essentially, they're looking for a about 2  real yield on cash. That means if core inflation is 3.5 , then they're going to hike one more time and hold rates at a level of 2  above inflation. This is in sharp contrast to many traders who think that if inflation goes to 3  that the Fed will aggressively start to cut when job growth slows or reverses. That's not what the Fed is saying at all, and the difference might be enough to get traders to seriously reevaluate their bets. Under this framework, rates stay above 5  until inflation is under 3 .Why wouldn't the Fed cut rates much when inflation slows down to 3  or so  Quite simply, that's how they got burned in the 1970s, so they're going to take their time. Modeling  supports this view.I calibrated the model to run using core inflation  ignoring rising oil prices  and added an interest rate smoothing feature to account for rents starting to fall. Still, almost all of the models here are calling for more rate hikes, with most favoring an interest rate above 6 . The Fed's dot-plot represents a compromise between the more hawkish members and dovish members worried about the banking system, but a cash rate of 5.75  followed by a long hold seems like the most likely outcome here. The market isn't quite pricing this, so traders may be caught by surprise that the Fed isn't looking to bail them out. Their surprise may be compounded if stocks fall sharply in the coming months and the Fed hikes again rather than pivoting to cuts.It's crucially important that the Fed doesn't allow another 1970s-style inflation surge. It's equally important for the Fed to not cave to political pressure to print money to let Congress off the hook for out-of-control spending. There is no alternative. By the end of the 1970s, Americans' trust in the government was shattered, living standards had stagnated, and the top political priority for voters was ending inflation. People were fed up. That's why they let Fed chair Paul Volcker drop the hammer on the economy and raise rates to 20 . By taking a hard line now, the Fed can ensure we don't have to end up in that position again after multiple consecutive waves of inflation, as was the case in the 1970s.This entire article really boils down to one question. The Fed is offering a 5.5  risk-free return in cash and short-term bonds. Should you take it, and if so, for how much of your asset allocation  I'm inclined to believe the Fed here. For the past year I've said yes take the risk-free return and for a decent percentage of your portfolio. The downside is asymmetric at current stock market valuations. We'll find out more about the Fed's intentions at Jackson Hole next week.What do you think  Will the Federal Reserve repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, or have they learned their lesson  Where are you investing your money now  Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Vonovia: Updating My Short Thesis Following Q2 Results,"I'm reiterating my Strong Sell rating on Vonovia SE after reviewing the 2nd quarter results.On March 28th, 2023, I issued a  against Vonovia SE   arguing that theAfter the Q1 report, I published an  in which I elaborated on several aspects that clearly send a signal of further pain to come.Let me know quickly recap the main drivers of my bear thesisNow, I have to admit that my  sell thesis  has been a complete disaster because of the strong total return performance by Vonovia -  40  since the date of my first article  shares of VNNVF bottomed out at  17 when I published near the end of March 2023 . However, looking at the Q2 figures, I have to also admit that my conviction about Vonovia's permanent value impairment has strengthened.Essentially, it is the usual problem with shorting companies that whenever the valuations are depressed pricing in a justified decline in value, each positive announcement no matter how impactful it is can send the stock price materially higher.For example, during Q2 Vonovia announced a buyback of its outstanding bonds at a 11  discount to the nominal value. Vonovia bought back    1.0 billion. While this sounds good, if we contextualize this with the total debt burden, it explains just over 2  of the total debt. And the fact that Vonovia was able to buy back bonds at 11  discount was not a surprise at all since we could see how the public market were discounting the outstanding bonds before Q2. We could also interpret this as a confirmation that the cost of financing for Vonovia has gone up and is materially above the currently carried weighted average cost of financing.So, let me now turn to the Q2, 2023 data and walk you through my thinking on why the bear case has just become more straightforward.Given that my thesis is structural without any catalysts besides the  ECB factor , which could either destroy the Company completely or make it one of the best investments in the German market, for me it is critical to assess data in the rate of change terms. In other words, I predict a  gradual bleed  process, where quarter by quarter Vonovia marches closer to a massive equity dilution event  i.e., cost of financing over dwarfing the yield component and inflicting knock-on effects on the covenant side .This is why I will focus on the quarter-to-quarter data comparing Q1, 2023 to Q2, 2023, which is the opposite approach to how Vonovia reflects its rate of change in the Q2 financial statements  they compare H1, 2023 to H2, 2022 . If I was to look at the Q2, 2022 data and contrast it with Q2, 2023, the conclusions would be rather boring - negative performance across the board.As a result of all of this, the EPRA NTA declined from EUR 53.7 per share in Q1, 2023 to EUR 49.7 per share in Q2, 2023  or 8  of a decline .Vonovia's share price reaction upon the issuance of Q2 figures was negative 2 .The key message that I would like to extract from the Q2 figures is the structural difficulty of Vonovia to ride out of the overleveraged situation when interest rates are so high. The technical term that we can see happening now is the  debt overhang situation  when the leverage has become so high that sooner or later there will be a default due to insufficient cash generation in the context of the embedded covenants  unless there is an equity dilution event .As of YTD, Vonovia has made three sizeable divestitures  i.e., Sudewo portfolio, five notable properties in Berlin with a total of 1350 apartments, and exit from French JV  monetizing their assets and   or participation in JVs, it has introduced scrip dividends, which relaxes the pressure from dividend distributions and replaces that with share issuances, and it has used most of the received proceeds to retire some part of the outstanding bonds at a discount to the nominal. Plus, performance-wise Vonovia has done a solid job by capitalizing on the favourable supply and demand dynamics in the German residential space.With all of this in mind, we can still see deteriorating performance on the underlying cash flow level and the corresponding coverage front.And dear readers, the worst thing is that Vonovia has not yet felt tangible pressure from the higher interest rates. As of H1, 2023, the weighted average cost of debt stood at 1.6 , which is just 0.1  higher than in Q1, 2023.Looking at Vonovia's publicly traded bonds, we can see YTM levels of around 5 - 5.5 . Loan  or bank  financing terms are a bit more favourable hovering around 4 - 4.5 .If we tripled or aligned Vonovia's cost of financing level to what the Company can actually get in the market, there would be a direct breach of ICR covenant  i.e., ICR falling below 1.8x .To breach the LTV covenant it would take a 25  downward correction in asset fair values. In my opinion, this is unlikely  although the market is pricing in a more aggressive drop  due to the lack of supply of residential units in Germany.Q2, 2023 results reveal in how difficult situation Vonovia is, where aggressive deleveraging efforts in conjunction with strong like-for-like performance is not sufficient to offset the consequences from astronomical leverage.Even after bond repurchases, monetization of JVs and   or several residential unit blocks, and improved rents, the results have worsened.The most shocking thing is that this has taken place despite the average cost of financing level of Vonovia going up by only 1 basis point. In reality, considering the prevailing market terms, there are some   300 basis points to go.Granted, this will not happen overnight as Vonovia has already paid off notable portion of 2023 maturities and will likely make huge efforts to do the same thing for 2024 maturities. The current debt maturity profile is rather well-staggered. Plus, Vonovia has entered several swap agreements fixing rates on favourable terms for the next two years on some portion of the outstanding debt that was still variable before Q2, 2023.However, if the 'higher for longer' scenario really takes place, Vonovia will sooner or later face significant consequences via the breach of covenants or just considerably squeezed margins. And here the key area of concern is the ICR coverage ratio. If we assume that Vonovia will eventually land its cost of financing rate close to the current market level, the ICR would clearly fall under the stipulated  minimal  level of 1.8x.In my humble opinion, the short thesis boils down to the path that ECB will be taking over the next couple of years. If we have status quo or higher rates, it will eventually erode the current headroom in the ICR coverage or significantly squeeze the free cash flows. If rates go down, Vonovia should survive without major share issuances, and bulls would enjoy decent gains from recovery in the multiple.The other key risk, which has to be considered for bears is that this will be a slow process as the current debt maturity profile of Vonovia protects the cash flows from rapid convergence to the market level cost of financing. This coupled with relatively depressed multiple can cause serious damage for the short sellers whenever there is something positive announced  no matter how material .Finally, it is great to see that some external analysts have started to believe in the short thesis as well. A month  Vonovia to  sell  from  hold , arguing that the Company is subject to  a protracted hangover  after  a seemingly endless party of growth fuelled by ever cheaper finance . Almost the exact wording that I used in my very first short article on Vonovia four months ago.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

PPLT: Dead Money With Lots Of Potential,"I last wrote about platinum and the abrdn Physical Platinum Shares ETF  on  was in early December 2022. Nearby NYMEX platinum futures were at the  1,053 level, with the PPLT ETF trading at  96.24Platinum is a rare precious and industrial metal that continues to frustrate, disappoint, and infuriate investors who buy the commodity with visions of capital appreciation. With silver over  24, gold at the  1,950 level, and palladium over  1,200 per ounce, platinum below  1,000 appears to be a bargain. Sometimes, prices are low for a reason. Platinum has been a compelling investment for years, but the performance has been nothing short of awful.The dog of the precious metals sector continues to have fleas in September 2023, but even the mangiest financial commodities eventually break their bearish pattern. PPLT at below  100 and platinum under  1,000 per ounce are inexpensive, but there are no guarantees that capital appreciation is on the immediate horizon.In February 2021, nearby NYMEX platinum futures reached  1,290.60 per ounce after reaching a bottom below  600 in March 2020 as the global pandemic gripped markets across all asset classes. After doubling in less than a year, platinum could not sustain further gains.The chart highlights the bearish pattern of lower highs in the platinum futures market since the February 2021 peak.In 2021, nearby platinum futures traded in a  893.60 to  1,290.60 range. In 2022, the price extended lower, with a  804 low and a  1,154 high. Over the first eight months of 2023, platinum has traded inside the 2022 trading band, with a  884 low and a  1,129.80 high. At  968.70 per ounce on September 1, platinum was below the 2023 range s midpoint, struggling to sustain any rallies above the  1,000 level.In 2022, total platinum mine production was 190 metric tons or just over 6.1 million ounces. At  1,000 per ounce, the value was around the  6.1 billion level. The NYMEX platinum futures market had a total number of open long and short positions of 70,041 contracts on August 31. As each contract contains 50 ounces, the open interest was just over 3.5 million ounces, worth  3.5 billion at the  1,000 per ounce level.Meanwhile, in 2022, the total gold mine production was 3,100 metric tons or nearly 100 million ounces, making platinum output sixteen times rarer. At  1,960 per ounce, the value was thirty-two times higher at  196 billion. Open interest in the COMEX gold futures market was at 442,643 contracts on August 31, each containing 100 ounces. Open interest of 44.26 million ounces translates to a  86.75 billion value, nearly twenty-five times higher than platinum.Platinum is a rarer metal than gold. The platinum market s value and transactional activity make the metal far less liquid than gold. For many years, platinum s nickname was  because it was more expensive than gold. However, platinum has not commanded a premium to gold since late 2014.The monthly chart of nearby NYMEX platinum futures minus nearby COMEX gold futures shows the bearish pattern of platinum versus gold prices since the early 2008 high when the spread eclipsed a  1,180 per ounce premium for platinum. The spread fell below flat in 2011-2013 and began steadily declining in 2014, reaching an over  1,000 discount to gold in 2020. At close to the  1,000 discount for platinum on September 1, the rare metal remains near the lowest level against gold since the precious metals futures began trading in the 1970s.The platinum market has moved into a deficit where the demand exceeds annual supplies.forecasts the 2023 shortfall at 128,000 ounces, the first deficit since 2020 and a significant change from the 2022 740,000-ounce surplus.Meanwhile,, a trade association funded by the platinum mining community, projects a 983,000 ounce 2023 deficit, the most significant since 2014 after last year s 854,000 ounce surplus. Rising investment demand, robust industrial demand driven by glass expansions in China, and strong automotive demand as catalytic converters increasingly use platinum, substituting for more expensive palladium, have caused the deficit. Meanwhile, falling South African mine output because of ongoing electricity shortages and the uncertainty of Russian supplies are weighing on the supply side of platinum s fundamental equation.While the supply and demand picture look bullish, rising interest rates, economic weakness in China, and overall uncertainty about the economic landscape have not created the environment for any significant rally in the platinum market.Economic conditions have not created a bullish environment for platinum prices, but the geopolitical landscape remains an underlying bullish factor that could cause significant supply shortages and higher prices.The chart illustrates over 84  of the world s 190 metric tons of mine supplies in 2022 came from South Africa and Russia. 74  came from the leading producer, South Africa, with Russia producing 10 . The twenty metric tons of Russian production is a byproduct of nickel output in Siberia s Norilsk region. Given the overall fundamental market tightness, the 643,000 ounces from Russia could become a significant factor.Moreover, the ongoing war in Ukraine has caused a bifurcation of the world s nuclear and economic powers. Sanctions on Russia have led to a move towards de-dollarization and the potential for a BRICS currency with gold backing. The BRICS bloc includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and their allies. The BRICS bloc dominates worldwide platinum production. In 2022, China was the world s leading platinum consumer at 75.1 metric tons, or almost 40  of global mine supplies. Europe was second, consuming 48.6 metric tons, or 25.6  of global production. Meanwhile, the United States consumed 42 tons of platinum in 2022, or 22  of supplies, meaning the U.S. and Europe depend on BRICS output as they consume nearly half the mined platinum annually. The geopolitical landscape threatens those supplies.While the fundamental case remains compelling, platinum investors have struggled. Platinum s price action fifteen years ago caused many investors to take the metal off their radar. Platinum reached a record  2,308.80 high in March 2008. Seven months later, the price plunged 67  to a  761.80 low during the global financial crisis. While gold prices also fell during the period, the precious yellow metal dropped 32.9  from  1,014.60 in March 2008 to a  681 low in October 2008. Gold outperformed platinum during the price carnage as it is a much more liquid market that is not susceptible to price gaps. Investors have shunned platinum over the past decade and a half while embracing gold as an investment asset.Moreover, gold has a far longer history as a financial instrument, and central banks validated gold s role in the global financial system as they hold gold as a reserve asset, classifying the precious metal as a foreign exchange asset. While Russia may maintain some platinum inventories in reserves, few other countries have strategic stockpiles for financial reasons. Platinum may be precious, but it is primarily an industrial metal.Given the strength in gold, silver, and palladium futures markets over the past years, platinum s price weakness remains an enigma. The profitable approach has been to purchase platinum on price weakness and take profits when the metal looks like it will break out to the upside. Platinum has invariably failed on break-out attempts, but its illiquid nature could one day lead to an upside gap as selling evaporates.The most direct route for a platinum investment is the coins and bars sold by reputable physical precious metals dealers. The NYMEX futures provide an alternative as they have a physical delivery mechanism. The Aberdeen Physical Platinum ETF product  is a liquid alternative to holding platinum metal for venturing into the leveraged and margined futures arena. At  88.68 per share on September 1, PPLT had around  966 million in assets under management. PPLT trades an average of 73,035 shares daily and charges a 0.60  management fee. PPLT owns physical platinum bullion.The chart highlights PPLT s disappointing price action since its 2010 listing.Platinum remains the weak link in the precious metals sector, but every dog eventually has its day. The supply-demand deficit, BRICS production domination, and rising demand are compelling reasons to own platinum. Investing in platinum requires patience and perseverance, as it has been dead money for years.Andrew Hecht is a 35-year Wall Street veteran covering commodities and precious metals.

"Energy In, Tech Out","As you know, the tech sector is largely responsible for driving the market higher this year on a strong bounce-back in the sector's financial performance after being pummeled by the 2022 bearYet over the past few weeks there has been a rotation out of tech and into the energy sector. Indeed, over thePrior to the last three years, the energy sector was arguably the worst sector in the entire market for over a decade. Yet despite the energy sector's strong performance over the past three years - and being the direct beneficiary of Russia's conflict with Ukraine that arguably broke the global energy  and food  supply chains - the XLE is still a relatively unloved sector. I say that because today the XLE ETF makes up only 4.5  of the S P500 - roughly half of its weight in 2010 .As a result, and despite the excellent run in energy stocks over the past three years, the sector is arguably still a value  According to , the XLE ETF currently has a TTM P E of only 8.3x and yields 3.67 , both of which are very attractive as compared to the broad S P500  and a yield of .There's currently a very dynamic and relatively complex push-pull going on between the tech and energy sectors. This week, and over the past month, the momentum traders behind the energy trade have been winning. Today I will discuss the factors behind this dynamic push-pull and what investors can expect going forward.A globally traded commodity market like oil and gas is impacted by a variety of factors that can have a complex relationship with each other and on prices. My followers know, I have long considered the price of oil to be the dominant factor with respect to inflation - and we know that the rate of inflation can directly impact interest rates. We also know that U.S. interest rates can impact the value of the U.S. dollar which in turn impacts the foreign currency translation  FX  on the revenue of technology companies that generate a significant portion of sales overseas. That being the case, let's take a closer look at how these considerations impact the push-pull dynamic between oil  i.e. energy stocks  and the tech sector. I'll start with oil because it's the main determinant of inflation in my opinion, and which, as I will later explain, directly impacts the valuation of technology stocks.Despite the false narrative that the world is somehow facing a shortage of oil supply, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, as I explained in a previous Seeking Alpha article, we live in an . The U.S. shale fracking revolution has resulted in 10s of billions of bbls of  oil and gas reserves that can be easily and very profitably drilled  with a near 100  success rate  and brought to market within a couple of months over existing pipeline infrastructure. In addition, we have elephant discoveries like offshore Guyana while the oil sands of Canada have abundant bitumen reserves  a whopping  worth .As I pointed out in my recent  on the Fidelity Energy ETF , Exxon  grew its Permian and Guyana production in Q2 by a whopping . Exxon is well on its way to achieving its ultimate goal in Guyana  Deploying six FPSOs, or Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessels, by the end of 2027 in order to bring Guyana's production capacity to more than .In Q2, Chevron  grew its Permian production to  or  11  year-over-year. As the slide below from its  shows, Chevron has an inventory of more than 6,600 drilling locations in the Midland and Delaware Basins and plans to grow production to well over 1 million boe d by 2030 and then will hold it at that level for at least a decadeConocoPhillips , the No. 3 largest US O G producer, has one of the largest Permian leaseholds and had Q2 Permian production of . - that's up from  in Q2 of last year  12 .Meantime, on the natural gas front, last year the U.S. quickly ramped up natural gas production to replace cut-off Russian supply to the EU. As a result, last year the U.S. became the world's  Which, as I have pointed out, proved that shale actually still is a  short-cycle  resource - just as energy company CEO's had been marketing it to be for over a decade  that is, at least until President Biden asked them to raise production on account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and  120 bbl oil . Currently, United States domestic natural gas production is at an all-time high and so is total United States petroleum production.The point here is that despite the popular narrative that the U.S. is somehow not energy independent or that somehow President Biden would  kill the energy companies,  nothing could be further from the truth.That said, obviously shale reserves must be actually be  in order to ultimately impact supply and price. But after the  lost decade  of pitiful returns in the energy sector, when the idiotic  drill baby drill  mantra caused over-production into an already over-supplied market, the shale producers have discovered discipline and are spending  10s of billions on emphasizing stock buybacks instead of drilling - and in many cases, even over giving shareholders a fair shake on the dividend  i.e. like with Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips . The fact is, as high as U.S. oil production is today, it could be considerably higher with relatively modest increases in the cap-ex budgets of the major players.Meantime, as the chart below from  shows, Canada has nearly doubled oil production over the past 20 yearsMeantime, Saudi Arabia recently announced it would continue its previously reported  through September. Reuters quoted an unnamed source as saying Saudi's cut may be  extended, or extended and deepened.  Shortly after that announcement, Russia jumped on board by saying it would cut oil exports by  bpd in September. As a result, and combined with previous OPEC  cuts, those countries are keeping multiple millions of bpd off the global market.So,  - so that isn't the problem. In my opinion, the problem is we are still burning too much of it and, as a result, quite literally burning up the planet as well.But of course as long as oil demand is strong and can soak up the current  restrained  production, prices will be strong too. From that standpoint, U.S. consumers responded to significantly lower gasoline prices this summer to demand more gasoline as compared to last yearIn this week's , we found out thatSpeaking of the SPR, it currently has 348 million bbls, up from 347 million last week but down significantly from 470 million bbls one year ago  see . Net-net, according to  total U.S. crude oil inventory according is down significantly over the past three yearsMeantime, the EIA reported last week that global oil demand is set to expand by an estimated 2.2 million bpd to , with China - the world's No. 1 oil importer - accounting for more than 70  of that growth. And just yesterday, the U.S. and China agreed to  between the two countries  from 12 to 24 . That will result in additional jet-fuel demand in a global travel market that is already quite robust.The bottom line when it comes to global oil supply and demand  Restrained supply by U.S. shale producers and OPEC , a significant drawdown in the U.S. SPR last year to mitigate the worst impacts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and combined with a general global recovery in oil demand has led to a tightening global oil market and a higher oil price. As a result, and predictably, oil company stock prices have risen inline along with the higher price of oilLast year, the price of Brent crude skyrocketed to over  120 bbl after Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion, and its huge and negative impact on the energy and food supply chains, resulted in boosting inflation - which was already high and rising from the pandemic - even higher. In response to seemingly runaway inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve was forced to begin increasing the Fed Funds rate  see chart below . That resulted in a strengthening U.S. dollar and a wicked bear market sell-off in the tech sector due to the combination of a strong FX headwind that would reduce bottom line profits for big global tech companies, and due to expectations of lower demand due to the potential of an imminent recessionary macro environment.I know the chart below is somewhat busy, but it shows the interplay between these variables quite nicelyStarting from the left, you can see that Brent  in purple  was leading inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index  CPI  in orange - higher. Tech stocks were still doing well because the thought process at the time was that inflation was transitory because pandemic-induced supply change disruptions were finally beginning to resolve themselves after vaccines were made available. However, starting at the beginning of 2022, you can see that Brent crude  and CPI  began to rise as tension rose over Ukraine. The tech sector - represented by the XLK ETF in green - began a sell-off that only accelerated when the invasion actually took place in February and which caused Brent Crude to temporarily jump to over  130 bbl.President Biden, after being rebuffed by U.S. shale producers and supposed ally Saudi Arabia, responded by releasing significant volumes of oil from the SPR. In parallel, the EU's natural gas supply chain was totally and surprisingly quickly reconfigured away from Russian supplies, and the price of Brent began to fall. And CPI eventually followed it lower. That led investors to think the worst of inflation was over and to the big tech rally over the first six months of this year. However, on the far right of the chart above, you can see the turn higher that oil began on July 1. You also can see the beginning of a drop in tech stock shortly afterward.Last week's  came in at 0.2 , as expected. But while energy prices are down 12.5  yoy, they're rising and no doubt investors are watching it very closely. Shelter was 90  of the inflation number, and is still a serious problem. On a yoy basis, July CPI rose 3.2 . That compared with an expected 3.3  yoy rate. While that is progress, it's still above the Fed's target rate of inflation  i.e. 2 . Still, the U.S. Dollar Index  shown below  rose for the week. I consider the DXY index to be an anticipatory indicator as it typically moves in advance of expected developments. Regardless of whether that theory is right or wrong, clearly the strengthening of the index last year was a primary factor in creating an FX headwind for global tech stocks that was a primary catalyst for the bear market.For example  Note that in   the quarter ending Dec. 31  Microsoft  reported diluted GAAP EPS that was -11  yoy, but  2  in terms of constant currency. In other words, FX was a 13  headwind to MSFT's bottom line earnings primarily because the value of the U.S. dollar peaked at the end of the year  see chart above . Due to the U.S. Dollar's fall since then, MSFT's  diluted EPS faced only a 6  headwind. That being the case, if the price of crude oil rises, and the rate of inflation rises along with it  which it no doubt will , the market will start pricing in additional increases in the Fed Funds rate. That will likely cause the U.S. Dollar Index to strengthen again. That will lead, once again, to a stiffening FX headwind for the tech sector and a subsequent revaluation of their discounted future cash flows going forward.We're already seeing expectations of this scenario playing out. Broadcom  - one of my favorite technology holdings - recently broke through its 50-day moving average after an AI-fueled rally. Once through the 50-day, AVGO hit quite an air pocket on the way downI find the interplay between the global energy markets and the U.S. tech sector to be both complex and fascinating. Currently and clearly, crude oil supply demand fundamentals and various geopolitical and macroeconomic considerations favor the energy sector over the tech sector - at least in the near term. Momentum traders have obliged with an  Energy In, Tech Out  strategy.That said, my followers know that I advise them to build a well-diversified portfolio and hold it through the market's up-n-down cycles. They also know I feel it's critical to have exposure to both the energy and technology sectors, albeit for different reasons  Energy for income and a hedge against inflation, tech for excellent growth and long-term wealth accumulation.With that in mind, a title of  Energy In, Tech Out  may have been more appropriate for this article. I say that because long-term investors would make a big mistake to go overboard energy and to exit tech. Consider thisThe fact is, and despite the newly found discipline of U.S. shale companies, higher crude prices are typically met with increased supply. That said, I do expect the second half of this year to be very strong for the energy sector. But stick with the oil producers and refiners  like Phillips 66 , which is just killing it on high diesel crack spreads - see the previously referenced article on the FENY ETF for details - and not the natural gas producers. I say that because there's an abundance of natural gas, and despite growing U.S. LNG export capacity, pure-play natural gas producers are faced with growing associated nat gas volumes from Permian shale producers that are targeting oil. In addition, older shale wells simply get gassier over time - and the U.S. has thousands of older shale wells. See .Meantime, higher gasoline prices will likely motivate consumers to only accelerate the transition to EVs - of which  already are booming  which, I would note, is a boon to the semiconductor sector .On the tech side, the recent sell-off could continue for a while longer and result in giving investors who have heretofore missed much of the tech rally a second chance to get into some of the higher-quality companies. I say that becauseI've been reporting on some of these trends on Seeking Alpha. For instance, in the article , I reported that Google continues to be a FCF machine and generated  21.8 billion in FCF in Q2 and a FCF yield of 29.2  of total revenue  up a whopping 11 percentage points yoy . GOOG ended Q2 with  118 billion in cash and has a forward P E of 23.3x. False predictions that ChatGPT was somehow going to kill Google Search pushed GOOG stock down into the low  90's back in February  I added to my position . Any significant pullback in GOOG  say under  110  in the current  correction  would be a gift for investors who have yet to establish a position in the stock.The previously mentioned article on Google also cleared up the false narrative that somehow migration to the cloud is no longer a primary catalyst for the hyperscalers. That is simply not the case - AI being one big reason why. Meantime, note that widely followed tech analyst Dan Ives agrees with me that any pullback in tech stocks will likely be  So, get ready to pounce. Indeed, Broadcom already is very attractive in my opinion  It has a forward P E of only 19.7x and - after being one of the best dividend growth stocks over the past decade  if not  best  - pays out an  18.40 annual dividend good enough for a 2.2  yield. Meantime, CEO Hock Tan noted the impact of the  during the Bottom line  Let your energy stocks run. If you want to take some profits in order to reduce your exposure at the top of a cycle, you will likely get a great chance over the next few months. For tech stocks, it's just the opposite  Prepare to pick up shares at bargain prices. I'm not as upbeat on Apple  as I'm on equities like Google, Broadcom, the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF , and the Fidelity MSCI IT ETF  - all of which I expect will grow faster than Apple over the next year or two.Lastly, and to put thing into a broader perspective, I'll end with a 10-year total returns chart comparing the Energy XLE and its two biggest components  Exxon and Chevron , with the tech XLK and a few leading tech stocks and fundsAs you can clearly see, long-term investors that bought and held tech through all the market's ups-n-downs over the past decade have been very well rewarded and done much  much  better than O G related equities. Odds are that will be the case for the coming decade as well.  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up  in the 2020s decade,  setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion  a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation .After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy  in 2018 . It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream  exploration, drilling, extraction , midstream  transportation, storage, refining , and downstream  retail sales and distribution  handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company  a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco , Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the  350-400 billion range, but declined to the  200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only  178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over  275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly  400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers   32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  15-20 billion range from 2015-2019  with a notable drop to  8 billion in 2016 , a disastrous decline to a loss of  22 billion in 2020, a return to form of  22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to  55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story   45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to  14 billion in 2020, and a rise to  48 billion and  67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P E ratio of  8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P E is 12x,  15  above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P B  price to book  and P Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25  and over 50  above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P S  price to sales  is slightly discounted at  10  below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument  the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oilTo start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources  see Lazard data referenced later , i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables  i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.  is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy  at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used , renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost  the one-time payment for the devices themselves  to generate power  the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF , Reeves Utility Income Trust , DNP Select Income Fund , Vanguard Utilities Index ETF . Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle  or virtuous cycle  stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply  meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity Energy  or  LCOE , essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced  for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,   opens in Excel .This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about   aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry . As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. ,  t he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,  and  renewables are set to account for over 90  of global electricity expansion  in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99  of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change  humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union  EU  legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA , are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause  fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is  designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing   emphasis added . In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries  this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists  however, an  of the law by  t he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks   emphasis added . While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear  ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31  increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities  i.e., choose renewables , and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common  They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism  not to be confused with partisan liberalism . By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC OPEC , which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness  this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation , The Phillips 66 Company , Sempra , ONEOK, Inc. , OGE Energy Corp. , Brooge Energy Ltd , WEC Energy Group, Inc. , White Energy Company Ltd , Magellan Midstream Partners , Sunoco LP , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. , Enbridge Inc. , TC Energy Corporation , TotalEnergies SE , , Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Corporation , Valero Energy Corporation , NuStar Energy LP , Ovintiv Inc. , Cenovus Energy Inc. , ConocoPhillips Company , Eni S.p.A. , , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Ring Energy Inc. , VAALCO Energy, Inc.  Occidental Petroleum Corporation , Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.  aka Petrobras  , Pampa Energía S.A. , , Callon Petroleum Company , Imperial Petroleum Inc. , NiSource, Inc. , Devon Energy Corporation , Energy Transfer LP , Ecopetrol S.A. , Vistra Corp. , The Williams Companies, Inc. , Canadian Natural Resources Limited , Koninklijke Vopak N.V. , , InPlay Oil Corp. , Inpex Corporation , , Shell plc , , Dominion Energy, Inc. , Duke Energy Corporation , Baker Hughes Company , Enterprise Products Partners L.P. , APA Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , Warrior Met Coal, Inc. , PBF Energy Inc. , and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. , , Ørsted A S , , Iberdrola S.A. , , ReNew Energy Global plc , Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. , Ocean Power Technologies , Tesla Inc. , Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. , Brookfield Renewable , , Freyr Battery , Array Technologies, Inc. , Nano One Materials Corp. , Novonix Ltd , , LiCycle Holdings Corp , Maxeon Solar Technologies , First Solar Inc. , Azure Power Global Ltd , Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A.  aka Eletrobrás  , Acciona, S.A. , Nextracker Inc. , AmmPower Corp. , Enphase Energy, Inc. , Fluence Energy, Inc. , and Vestas Wind Systems A S , , among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the  winners  in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time  they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets  e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline petrol station infrastructure, etc.  into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams  upstream, midstream, and downstream  in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach  carbon neutrality  or  net zero carbon emissions  by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example  a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing   expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours  of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5  in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99  dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. ,   to cut natural gas production by 40  and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its   page 14  is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by  advanc ing  other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies,   emphasis added .At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings  this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that  t hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately  17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions   and  help in  reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling     emphasis added . Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that  a ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with   emphasis added . This is in addition to the  sustained investment  in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels  notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis . Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited  appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves  their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share  in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB  solar, wind, and battery storage  System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figureUltimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Toll Brothers: Slowdown Delayed Not Escaped,"Toll Brothers  strong performance this year was still under the buoyancy provided by the previous backlog while multiple factors from the perspective of its own logistics and the macro picture suggestedWe previously initiated coverage of Toll Brothers in January this year with a hold rating when it was  55.46, expecting its price to be within a range of  45 to  62. The thesis was built on the expected slowdown from its backlog and the macro environment pressure, in addition to the normalization of the housing market. The company reported strong numbers so far this year, but our previous thesis still holds, and we will explain why.Since our article was published in January this year, Toll Brothers' annual growth rates for revenue, free cash flow, and gross profits have been trending flat to lower. Although they are coming back down from historic highs, the growth is nonetheless moderating.Toll Brothers' backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to the home buyers. Just as we predicted in the previous article, the falling backlog has shown. Not only has the absolute value of the backlog dropped from  8.87 to now  7.87 billion, but the backlog-to-revenue ratio has come down from 86.32  in October last year to 73.64  in July this year. In fact, this ratio is the lowest since 2020. According to its 10k of 2022, the company expects to deliver approximately 90  of these homes within the next fiscal year. So we can assume that backlog tends to have a lagging effect on its revenue by about four quarters. The current strong performance of its revenue is still under the influence of its backlog from July to October last year. The pull on the revenue going forward that was expected from the current backlog will become lower.Toll Brothers has continued to push into the urban apartment market to explore more potential growth engines. The company formed  Toll Brothers City Living  unit to leverage its luxury brand in urban areas. Its pipeline includes most of the major cities on the east coast, south and west, except mid-west cities. It had spent in Q3  263.5 million in purchasing contracts to acquire land for apartment development.Since the company's  affordable luxury  market focuses on millennials or empty nesters, it is not surprising the apartment market is the logical choice due to its community formation appeal to the younger professional that in turn provides higher sales volume for the investment, and its cost-saving of using steel framing in the building process. These factors underpin the  affordability  that it is trying to achieve.However, the sales of the apartment building assets are not as good as expected, which has impacted the full-year joint venture land sales and other income to be  105 million, down from the  125 million expected at the start of the year. This guidance is still hinged on the sale of three stabilized apartment communities that are to be closed in Q4. Its ancillary business, which includes apartment and city living, has reported losses for the three and nine months ending on July 31 with higher expenses than revenue.Toll Brothers' cash conversion cycle is at around 438 days, which is mostly due to its faster inventory turnaround. But it is almost as good as it gets. There is very little room to improve compared with its best records in the past twenty years, while it could become prolonged to 700-800 days, the average of the past twenty years or so.To update the previous mortgage loan held for sale data, it has fallen from  193 million to  83 million, the majority of which are residential mortgage loans. On one hand, this poses fewer risks to its portfolio that is subject to higher interest rate risks, on the other hand, with its home sales rising by 18.5  YoY in the quarter ending in July, there were 50  fewer mortgage loans held for sale on its book. This is due to 18.2  fewer mortgage loans originating in the first nine months of this year, and also reflects the tougher environment brought by the higher interest rate risks for the residential market. Either the company intentionally tightened the lending standard for cautious reasons or there were less qualified borrowers. Either way, it leads to fewer sales down the road, which brings us to the macro picture.Toll Brothers' latest presentation has a slide that compares the housing starts with the number of households, concluding the industry is undersupplied. We think this is not an accurate depiction of the situation. The number of households will always increase monotonically, in the long term. Yet housing starts can be best utilized to satisfy the incremental demands, not the entire stock of households.Therefore, we fixed up the following chart to see if we can show a picture more closely resembling the dynamics. We charted a 12-month average of monthly household formation, which is defined as the incremental change of the number of households on a monthly basis, against the monthly private-owned housing starts, from 1959 till June of this year. What we found is the average of household formation for the past 12 months although strong, when paired up with the current level of housing starts, it is right in the middle of the cluster. It is neither too high nor too low. Especially with the latest number reported in June falling slightly in the negatives, there is no significant undersupply for the industry from a high-level perspective. With that said, it is not excluding local regions heating up from supply and demand dynamics, but overall, the frenzy we saw in the past two years will not return any time soon.On the other hand, the current free cash flow Toll Brothers produce is an outlier, compared with its historical norm. What it means is it cannot sustain at these levels without regressing back to the average.The current level of the owner's equivalent rent for a primary residence is unsustainable given the interest rate environment. With 5.33  Fed Fund's rate, the current rent level is almost double where it has been historically. For the inflation situation to fully come under control from the Fed's point of view, rent being one of the largest items in the CPI basket, it will budge soon. Even if it doesn't fall back down by half, a moderation or decline should be expected. This goes back to Toll Brothers' efforts in expanding in the city and apartment living. The margin growth in that market may not be taking off in the near term.Lastly, although this doesn't necessarily provide causation for stock valuation, it's nonetheless observed that the high stock price has led to the most expensive and slowest stock repurchase for the company since 2016. With almost half of what it spent in 2022,  240 million stock repurchase has only bought back 3.5 million shares so far this year, roughly one-third of the number of shares it bought back last year.We are sticking to our previous valuation and anticipate the slowdown we expected in January to come into play in Q4 or Q1 next year. The current price has risen above our bullish case by almost 14 .Toll Brothers has made higher sales this year against a tougher interest rate environment, which resulted in better cash flow and earnings so far. But we think this is mostly due to the influence of a previously higher backlog, which has fallen by more than 10  in the latest quarter. The effect of slowing down will start showing in Q4 latest Q1 next year and the macro pressure is pointing to a normalization that is merely being delayed not escaped. With its price rising above our bullish case, we think its stock is overvalued at the moment and recommend a sell.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tsakos Energy Navigation: Call Option On Management,"Tsakos Energy Navigation  is a speculative play on a potential multi-year upcycle for oil tankers. The company has been trading at  0.35x P NAV despite two quarters of strong earnings with more to come, and a record cash balanceThe tanker industry is poised for years of strong earnings ahead as the orderbook has fallen to the . Supply continues to be restricted by high prices and , with earliest delivery dates in late 2026 to early 2027. Should oil demand meet forecast expectations or scrapping of oldThis is my second article covering tanker companies, for good reason. I believe that the supply and demand set-up will lead to multiple years of strong earnings for all owners. I highly recommend you read  on Okeanis Eco Tankers  for a more comprehensive explanation on the supportive macro factors and the industry.TNP has been a mainstay of the tanker industry for decades   in fact, the company is celebrating its 30 anniversary as a public company in 2023.It owns and operates  with an average of 10 years. Besides crude tankers, it also owns a fleet of product tankers, shuttle tankers and LNG carriers.The company adopts a more conservative strategy than its peers, choosing to employ the majority of its vessels on time charters with profit sharing components than maximizing spot exposure.In , the company reported an extremely strong TCE of  41.8k d, up 112  on Q1 2022 s TCE of  19.7k d. This compares favorably against its cash breakeven levels of around  24k d on average, leading to net income of  167.9m or  5.69 share in the period. It also announced that it would be redeeming  88m of its Series D preferred shares, alongside a charter backlog of  1.6bn.That said, the shares tumbled upon the release of their Q1 2023 earnings   owing to some questionable things that management did  and is somewhat known for . Which brings me to my pointsIt would be foolish not to consider management quality when discussing TNP. After all, it has garnered somewhat of a negative reputation for not placing minority shareholders  interests at heart. This says a lot considering the shipping industry has left many with sour tastes in their mouths, so here s a quick recap of what led the stock to sell off in Q1 2023.The company inexplicably used its   subscription required to access link  to issue shares, diluting the stake of minority shareholders. This happened all while shares traded at less than half of NAV   a cardinal sin that shipping investors frowned upon. There was no compelling reason to do this, and it made investors question management as stewards of their capital.TNP disappointed with its dividends at the end of such a profitable quarter, choosing to pay out just  0.60 share across two payments. This comes up to a pitiful 3  yield, when tanker peers were issuing special dividends to reward their shareholders. While the company touts its strong dividend paying history as a plus, I believe investors were hoping for more considering its cash balance of  475m.It also pales in comparison when it comes to transparency. Other tanker companies have beefed up their investor relations departments, even getting on Twitter to engage with investors. The company does nothing of that sort and has not even made known the date of their Q2 2023 earnings release  it is the 10 of August and many tanker companies have already reported .This has led to TNP being one of the most undervalued shipping companies on a P NAV basis, coming in at roughly 0.35x against the average of 0.85x. I strongly believe that investors have made their case and management could announce a special dividend and buyback program in the upcoming earnings call. This would undoubtedly cause the stock to re-rate closer towards the peer group and is a strong near-term catalyst in my opinion.Given all that management has done  or not done , the silver lining is that they have many options to demonstrate they have learnt their lesson.The simplest, and most direct method is to issue a special dividend to make up for the last quarter. A quick calculation shows that TNP has more than sufficient free cash on hand to atone for the small dividend announced earlier this year.After accounting for all debt and capital commitments for the rest of 2023, I find that there is still  260m of cash available for distribution. That amounts to  8.60 share. While the company obviously won t and shouldn t pay out everything, there is significant cash on the balance sheet to do so.The company could also opt to fix its dividend policy to offer more transparency to shareholders. Its peers have mostly fixed dividends as a percentage of earnings and have been correspondingly rewarded with higher P NAV multiples. Alternatively, TNP could announce a buyback program and go through with it. There is nothing more accretive than repurchasing your own shares when they trade at such a low valuation.As a shareholder, I would also like to see TNP improve its investor communications. That might not be a strong near-term catalyst but should close the valuation gap somewhat going forward.I also believe that investors overlook the fact that TNP is a very profitable enterprise, with a sound chartering strategy against its breakeven levels. Regardless of how management has treated shareholders, they have been running a tight ship in their organization.It currently has 45  77  vessels with secured revenue contracts and 31 vessels  53  with spot exposure. The percentages do not add to 100  as some vessels are on time charters with profit sharing, hence some overlap. 6 out of its 8 vessels under construction also have long-term charters attached to them, significantly de-risking the purchase costs.Looking at their  and the charters they currently have, I find that the secured revenue components alone nearly cover the entire fleet breakeven. The 18 profit-sharing vessels and 14 vessels on spot charters merely need to generate  140k d for TNP to turn an operating profit. This should not be a problem in any market, let alone the upcycle we are headed towards.TNP owns a large fleet of vessels which have seen  over the last year, in part due to inflation as well as a strong rate environment. I believe that this should act as a floor for its share price.To estimate the current market value of its fleet, I used  as a guide and arrived at a rough estimate of  3.09bn for its vessels.According to my rough estimates, a fair price for TNP  would be around  61.41, giving it nearly 180  upside from today s share price of around  22 share.But we know that is unlikely to play out, so here are my share price estimates under different scenarios with room for error on the vessel values.While this represents a wide range of possible values, it also demonstrates how asymmetric the return profile is from here. A very pessimistic view of asset values declining 15  and a P NAV of 0.30x, assuming management does not reward shareholders, results in a -38  decline in share price.On the other hand, should management become more shareholder friendly, my base case calls for a re-rating of the stock to 0.6x NAV. I recognize that investors are unlikely to view TNP as favorably as they do other tanker companies, hence the slight discount to peer averages of 0.85x NAV. This scenario results in a 67  increase in share price to  36.85, which in my opinion still understates the true value of TNP s assets.Global oil and gas demand, sanctions, and the OPEC  cuts are all headwinds that TNP faces as a business. However, I think that the company s conservative chartering strategy should help it weather any downturns better than peers operating 100  on spot. While vessel values could still come down, it poses a smaller risk to TNP which is already trading at a depressed multiple compared to the other tanker companies.Management remains the biggest unknown here. Investors are reliant on management to become more shareholder friendly to unlock value. There is no way of predicting how they will react to investors  demands and I believe it is a risk that investors must contend with in this investment.TNP is simultaneously a play on the multi-year tanker upcycle and a call option on management. It is a profitable, cash generating enterprise with a sound chartering strategy and diversified fleet of vessels. It trades at  0.35x P NAV, significantly lower than peers, as management has not been the friendliest to shareholders in the past.That said, there are multiple ways management could surprise investors in the upcoming earnings call. I believe that TNP could pay off in an asymmetric manner as valuations have been depressed and asset values should act as a backstop, as long as you size your position appropriately.

Bitcoin: Why I'm Buying 14-Year-Old Tulips With Both Hands,"Now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin . There are many upcoming catalysts for BTC to reward investors over the next year. This article will not go into those much-repeated points. If interested, research the items in this non-exhaustive list of- Bitcoin s Halving in 2024   Halvings have historically been followed by a price surge.- BTC Spot ETF   Bullish because it creates more liquidity and demand- Institutional Adoption   Institutional adoption means more liquidity and demand as well. It also means more money used to fund the development of financial infrastructure for Bitcoin.- Regulatory Clarity in Crypto   Reduces the barriers due to regulatory uncertainty. Also increases the pace of innovation in crypto.- Mining to Subsidize Green Energy Solutions   This allows BTC to be recognized as an ESG-friendly asset.  Bitcoin always was ESG friendly, hence  toThis article will talk about the utility that Bitcoin development has been unlocking, and hence economic value rather than price action from supply and demand. Think of this as the fundamentals. Bitcoin s strong fundamentals should also be overlaid with a sentiment analysis, which will be covered first. As stated, the main takeaway is that right now is probably a great time to accumulate BTC.Critics accuse BTC of being a bubble, comparing it to the dot-com bubble or to tulips. Tulips bubble assets don t last for 14 years, nor do they keep exceeding their previously established all-time high, nor are they assets with clear use cases. In  I go deep into an undeniable use case of Bitcoin that is little mentioned.If you keep calling this a bubble or keep claiming  this is beginning of the end of Bitcoin,  your actual conclusion is that the market has been wrong for 14 straight years.Of course, there are times when the market-wide time preference shortens. Morgan Housel s  explores the rationality  not irrationality  behind bubbles. The simple answer is that investors  time preference shortens. During bubbles, the next day or week is nearly guaranteed to see a higher price. The time preference of investors collapses from a  normal  focus on a longer term to an abnormal focus on this immediate short term. Abnormal and normal are not denotations of rationality, they are simply a statement that most of the time  normally  time preference is not as short as  until tomorrow.  This is FOMO in its distilled and wholly rational form. Bursting bubbles is the opposite  as time preference lengthens, discounted cash flows become the dominant force of consideration and valuations come back down.  Sentiment shifts  is another name for describing the phenomenon of changing time preference.This understanding is also why I have chosen to subdivide my analysis by time preference, because within these fluctuations are many opportunities. And without at least acknowledging time preference, one s investment thesis is hopelessly incomplete.When we look at Bitcoin in its entire 14-year history, there are moments of collapsing time preference. But 14 years is long for a  short-term time preference while also supporting an asset that is still outperforming nearly everything else over the same time. If these magic internet coins are tulips, then by their age alone they are very special tulips indeed.The crypto bear market has dragged on for nearly two years. BTC is still down 60  from its all-time high in November 2021. A lot of seemingly bullish news has been met with short-lived spikes followed by longs taking profits. BTC has had a tough time breaking through resistance at  30,000 over the last five months.Also, BTC s  is at five-year lows, signaling an apathetic market. The choppy price action of the last few months has been driven by record-low volumes. When volumes pick up again, the actual direction of the market should be clearer.Low volumes in crypto have been making . Most crypto is speculation, so I interpret this as speculative interest slowing down for a big chunk of the industry. Comments in the linked article also suggested the same interpretation. However, it is key to separate the utility of speculation from the utility of Bitcoin. If you believe that Bitcoin has intrinsic utility, then this period of apathy in which the baby is seemingly being thrown out with the bathwater is a great time to accumulate. I am reminded of the bloodbath in REITs over this last year, when astute investors were able to scoop up good deals as the market relentlessly punished all REITs simply for being associated with commercial real estate.Likewise, BTC model free implied volatility  ie. a VIX calculation from option prices  is also at 4-year lows. It is likely at all-time lows, but the IV data on  does not go back far enough. For context, crypto prices generally rise with IV. This feature is different from equities. Such lows in both IV and trading volume should indicate that the crypto bear market is on the precipice of ending.Given historical trends, BTC is also at  lows. Below are two charts that put BTC s price on a log scale with various annotations. The  is a bit like a dynamic RSI that shows oversold and overbought regions. It also annotates the halvings.The  with the 200 Week Moving Average shows that BTC rarely stays below its 200 Week Moving Average. The points when it is touching or below this moving average have been great accumulation zones.These charts all point towards a market that is exhausted and oversold. Though not fully capitulated  one might argue capitulation was last year when BTC bottomed at around  16,000 , the sentiment has been negative and apathetic.Public attention this year has been drawn away from crypto and towards trends like AI. The investment landscape has been favoring big tech, semiconductors, and even more recently energy. Again, the logical consequence of this matches up with what we see in the charts  apathy towards BTC and crypto in general as an investment.This is why now is probably a great time to start a dollar cost average accumulation. The sentiment could continue to worsen for a while, but the backstop is the fundamental, intrinsic value of BTC. New use cases have continued to develop over the course of the BTC bear market.The  fundamentals  of something like BTC is the potential for usage and adoption. BTC aims to be money, and all money is backed by the economy which uses it  note that this is very different from saying the  country that uses it  because economies can easily be international . The reason the USD is the strongest currency is that the collective households and firms which use the USD constitute the largest economic bloc in the world. This is also why countries who try to steer their economies away from using the USD are seen as a threat to dollar hegemony.  Note that being seen as a threat is different from being an actual threat. The dollar hegemony is very strong for reasons deeply embedded in basic international economic principles. I cover those in greater detail .The more people using Bitcoin for payments, the stronger BTC s fundamentals become. This same logic does not quite apply to other cryptocurrencies, especially because many have token models which make them resemble securities. In this case, greater use of the underlying blockchain network may lead to price appreciation in the short term as a function of speculation, but the price cannot be sustained by the cash flows generated in the long term.The problem with Bitcoin usage is that it s not as clear-cut as amateur analysts think. Some think that because the blockchain is a transparent ledger, they can simply look on chain to see whether adoption is happening. This works for Ethereum, and it is arguably the only good way to objectively measure Ethereum adoption. But it doesn t work for Bitcoin.Both Ethereum and Bitcoin have started to , but they have taken completely different layer scaling approaches. To put it simply  Ethereum uses rollups, which are basically separate transparent blockchains with their own set of transactions and consensus. Thus,  on-chain  activity refers not just to the Ethereum base layer, but also to all the separate rollup blockchains linked to Ethereum. These are all transparent.Bitcoin, meanwhile, has used state channels  like the Lightning Network   as its L2 scaling solution. State channels are not separate blockchains, so they do not have the transparency that Ethereum rollups have. The basic concept of a state channel is that users can share a common on-chain state with each other and then sign updates to change this state. One example of an individual  state  would be how much BTC is owned by either person. At any point, the signed state updates  called  commitments  can be published to the blockchain, and the corresponding state will be reflected in the main chain. This enables people to do an unlimited number of transactions off-chain, by exchanging commitments with their counterparts, with the option of publishing the results of these transactions on-chain at any time.Without going into details about the tradeoffs between a state channel and a rollup solution, we can clearly see that the state channel solution is much more elusive to the casual observer because it never appears on chain. In fact, after the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021, it is impossible to tell when a new state channel for the Lightning Network is being opened or closed. Before that, it was possible to tell based on on-chain information that two users were creating a multisignature address to potentially initiate a state channel. There are a few places to look to get an idea.  is a site that reports the number of channels and how much BTC is locked in these channels. Below is a screenshot of their main dashboard. For clarity, a  Node  helps connect multiple channels so that users who do not have direct channels with each other can still pay each other through a mutual connected user  in this case the Node .The important thing to remember is that Lightning dashboards like these can never provide the complete picture the way a complete picture can be provided for Ethereum and its rollups. First, these are only the  channels that the Lightning Nodes are aware of. The Lightning Nodes being surveyed are also only the nodes that this website is aware of. Because the code is open source, entire communities can set up their own Bitcoin payments system using Lightning infrastructure and never be known by sites like 1ML. Finally, while we can see how many channels there are, there is no way to tell how many transactions are going through those channels. Each transaction is a state update signed and kept by the users of the channel, so only the users themselves really know their own transaction volume. In contrast, the exact number of transactions, accounts, value, and even the time each event occurred is always known for the Ethereum ecosystem, because one can just add together everything across all the rollups. depicts the number BTC locked into channels over time. Again, these numbers are only what is known. There is almost certainly a non-zero number of  channels with BTC that is not counted in this figure. Furthermore, since the Taproot upgrade in late 2021 and the popularization of Lightning over the last three years, the likelihood of more channels being unknown grows higher and higher.Unlike Ethereum, which has largely focused on growing smart contract functionality for on-chain trading, Bitcoin development has largely focused on the more practical use cases for the average consumer, such as payments and personal banking, and nearly always focusing on BTC as the main token. In contrast, Ethereum projects tend to release their own tokens and focus on infrastructure which can be leveraged to shuffle around many different tokens  including and often especially the token the project created  for the purpose of earning yields and conducting highly leveraged trades.Thus, the flavor of innovation is yet another major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both ecosystems have innovation, but innovative energy is consumed to achieve different objectives.The Bitcoin ecosystem does not regard a high level of programmability as paramount. When I was first learning about crypto, this caused me so much confusion and misunderstanding towards Bitcoin. It seemed that Ethereum projects were very organized and standardized. Each reputable project had its own documentation, a list of smart contract addresses, a whitepaper of how its proposed features can be implemented on-chain, a section explaining the project s token details, and so forth. Though many Ethereum projects did things very differently and in very creative ways, they all followed the same basic format of being able to somehow facilitate the exchange of tokens on-chain. Initially, I wrote this off as Bitcoin being the older ecosystem where nothing happened. But then the question of why Bitcoin never retreats from its number 1 spot on the crypto market cap ranking became more and pressing. You could say this was me reckoning why the market has been so wrongI have now come to realize that Bitcoin s innovations are happening constantly, but just not in a rigidly standardized manner because the simplicity of Bitcoin leaves so much room for different methods of innovation.One example of this is clearly the Lightning Network. Another is something like , an EVM smart contract blockchain that is  with Bitcoin, launched back in 2018. Rootstock has over 50  of Bitcoin s enormous hash rate securing it, making it the second most secure blockchain and the most secure smart contract blockchain in the world. Much more recent examples are , , and . Each one is a unique approach to Bitcoin scaling that is still in the testing phase. Each one is focused on expanding the use case of the BTC token only. To keep this short, I ll only cover Fedimint, which I think is simple enough to describe both non-technically and concisely.The basic idea of Fedimint is that communities can create their own multisignature wallets and have trusted members of the community be the  guardians  who hold the keys of the BTC in the wallet. Then, the community can mint IOUs against the BTC in the wallet and use a centralized ledger to keep track of IOU transactions, while ensuring things like privacy and full reserve backing. Each community can adjust the parameters to suit their needs. Each instance of a community multisignature wallet with its own BTC IOUs is called an individual Fedimint. The Fedimint protocol is also , so Fedimints can be set up to send BTC to other Fedimints via Lightning.It s clear that Fedimint is another variation of a state channel scaling solution. Unlike Lightning, it uses a trust-based setup. This is okay because Fedimint is intentionally designed for communities   the guardians are members of the community who are known to others and whom others already trust with other things  random examples  babysitting, being a good neighbor, dog walking, etc . Any funny business will have steep social costs.This may not seem too useful in countries with strong rule of law. Also, many in the West feel no persistent need to trust the members in their community. But Fedimint is an absolute game changer for the unbanked of the world, and many of these are the exact people who must rely on their communities.Now apply this to what has already been said about Lightning. Fedimint s transactions are all off-chain. With Taproot, we can t even know if a new Fedimint is being started. Fedimints can send stuff to each other via Lightning, another off-chain solution.These kinds of technologies will grow Bitcoin adoption. And they are invisible to the casual observer, or the junior analyst looking for on-chain activity. When crypto news platforms are talking more about Ordinals NFTs, BRC-20 tokens, and the ETF than about the development of practical use cases, you can be sure that the masses are not aware of all that is happening.Bitcoin is a global settlement layer, and everything built over it helps increase Bitcoin s use case and reach. The ecosystem holds the ultimate long-term view  slowly help people around the world gain financial autonomy, slowly let the free market do its job, slowly watch people innovate and take risks without avoidable financial insecurities, slowly have each newer generation understand these benefits, then slowly become the world s de facto money.The biggest uncertainty today is Bitcoin s public relations. On the one hand, governments are incentivized to try to hold on to their monetary monopoly. But this is much harder if more people understand Bitcoin.If Bitcoin cannot attract enough public support, then governments may be able to establish some hold over it and reaffirm their monopoly over money. Thus, the risk increases with the number of autocratic regimes  governments who do not have to listen to their citizens  and increases with the number of people who cannot think critically. The former is a falling number, but the latter is a rising number.My suspicion is that as times get worse, mainly due to the state of today s money, more people will begin to wake up and ask questions likeOh, and some of these issues are due to bad life choices   not just the fact that the monetary base has  causing the dollar to  since 1970   so I ll also includeGenerally, these questions point one towards the Austrian School, sound money, and, inevitably, Bitcoin. They might also cause one to cut back on lattes  Starbucks  might be a good short idea, I don t know .Ultimately, it s a big uncertainty how Bitcoin s public perception will emerge after this time. The regulatory landscape, at least in the U.S., seems more and more crypto friendly, and this has been especially true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was notably called out as the only crypto that was certainly not a security. Yet, many people still believe it is a ponzi scheme.Those who believe that governments will move to ban it without any regard for the preference of the people are implicitly denying the power of rule of law and constitutional freedoms. They also run the risk of denying the force of the free market, which is a very dangerous bet.The more useful question is whether people themselves will want money that cannot be debased. And this is of course a PR question. The prevailing PR campaign has been to encourage the acceptance of inflationary money and benevolent technocrats who dictate monetary policy from above, all using highly robust  methodologies, no doubt. Will Bitcoin s PR campaign   involving , , less leverage, and personal wealth secured by the mere    win any hearts and minds  Who knows.There have never been tulips like Bitcoin. I am buying these tulips with both hands because I see the strong fundamentals beneath the surface. More importantly, most other people do not see these fundamentals yet. We can confirm this because many crypto commentators don t even know where to look when it comes to evaluating Bitcoin s progress. Even more importantly, the current sentiment is too negative and apathetic to ignore. My recommendation is not for you to take my word on these points, but for you to look and find the truth yourself.I reaffirm my buy rating and would upgrade to strong buy at  20,000. If it falls below that point, I will liquidate some stocks to buy more  unless stocks also happen to be down big . The next several months should be very interesting with all the catalysts listed at the beginning of this article. 2024 looks like a wonderful year for BTC.

Thoughts From The Municipal Bond Desk (October Edition),"In our latest update on what s going on in the muni market, we ask and answer The Fed s action was widely expected. Underlying inflation cooled faster than policymakers expected, suggesting that their efforts to restrain inflation have largely been successful. But the Fed has also said it s concerned that stronger-than-expected economic growth could boost inflationary trends. On balance, this suggests to me that the Fed will remain on pause   or even end interest rate hikes   unless the data indicates otherwise. That We often see disappointing performance during September and October, when returns have historically been weaker than at other times of the year. During these months, we typically have a weak coupon payment season, and generally high net issuance, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. Now through late October may be a good time to put new money to work at a potentially lower cost basis. Alternatively, November, December, and January have tended to be good months for munis, with the January reinvestment period one of the most potentially advantageous times to be invested. I think we d all like for the government to avert a shutdown, but the odds aren t good. The last time federal government shutdown was December 21, 2018. It was a partial one, lasting 35 days. Consensus is that a brief shutdown, one lasting 30 days or less, could delay certain federal payments to municipal issuers, but would have minimal-to-no credit impact on municipal debt. That said, a more protracted shutdown would be more concerning. The silver lining for munis is that, unlike previous shutdowns, municipalities have received record amounts of federal stimulus since 2020. Billions were allocated to municipalities from the American Rescue Plan Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. This is a real-life example of why strong rainy day fund balances are so important. They just might be the thing that gets munis through a potential government shutdown.A quick look at some commonly used muni market data points.Sources  Lipper US Fund Flows, JPMorgan. YTD   year-to-date.NA3150907Municipal securities are subject to the risk that legislative or economic conditions could affect an issuer s ability to make payments of principal and or interest.Junk bonds involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer s credit quality.The value of investments and any income will fluctuate  this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations , and investors may not get back the full amount invested.The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high-quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods.All fixed income securities are subject to two types of risk  credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and  or repay the principal on its debt. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa.Municipal bonds are issued by state and local government agencies to finance public projects and services. They typically pay interest that is tax-free in their state of issuance.

4 Reasons I'm Shorting The VIX Despite Geopolitical Risks,"The unexpected attack on Israel reminds us thatBut as investors, we must look at the implications for markets, and despite the shock, I think Israel's military dominance is ultimately unshaken by these attacks. The blow was psychological and tactical, not strategic. Israel is a mighty country, and I think her military prowess gives potential regional state adversaries pause, which limits the potential for a regional conflagration. Of course, the last two significant eventsWe should all be praying for the victims and their families, and we should all be asking ourselves stark questions about the future of the Middle East. Still, we should also remember that financial volatility, while redolent of physical volatility, is not the same thing. We must remember that the market's collective wisdom shrugs off our individual emotional experiences.The Hamas attack was deadly, and it will have profound implications. However, it does not look like the type of state-versus-state implications on trade from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 will materialize. Furthermore, the history of fighting in the Arab-Israeli conflict has typically been marked by short duration rather than the type of resource-intensive stalemate that is going on in Ukraine.However, war and the deterioration of foreign relations raise prices  there's often no way around it. So, if this issue expands and intensifies, it certainly could raise inflationary pressure, so I will keep a close eye on this risk as the events' momentum becomes more apparent in the coming days and weeks. I'm assuming that despite the shock factor of the Hamas attack, the effect on markets will be broadly similar to other high-intensity periods in the Arab-Israeli Conflict during the 21st century.While the relatively low-intensity conflict between Arabs and Palestinians slowly rumbles through time, it doesn't have the same profound economic effects as when a conflict interrupts food production in one of the world's largest grain producers. So, I think as devastating and sickening as these attacks were, the ultimate effect on global commerce will be much less than Russia's Invasion of Ukraine.Indeed, the market has sent two overwhelmingly bullish messages in less than a week.Anecdotally, when markets rally on bad news, I'm typically heartily encouraged. I have found this indicative of turning points in the post-COVID markets. These two events alone make me very bullish on the disposition of the market into year-end, but there are four significant reasons why I will be shorting volatility into the end of the year.I have written extensively before on why I believe have led to the VIX being a somewhat obsolete instrument for catching volatility and why many who expect spikes of levels similar to those seen in COVID-19 and the Global Financial will likely be . This is the primary reason why many investors have been fretting about a suppressed VIX. To sum up a key conclusion of my prior workOf course, a crucial distinction must be made when talking about why the VIX has been suppressed. In my past two articles on the VIX, I mainly focused on the structural reasons why volatility was relatively more suppressed while navigating an ominous group of post-COVID-19 risks than in previous periods when the market faced similar risks.You can see this at play during the recent VIX spike on interest rate fears and volatility that appeared to peak last week. The VIX briefly got above  20, but I think it will continue to retreat into year-end, given several factors. While I am still convinced the structural and market efficiency factors contribute to a more suppressed VIX, I think many factors that will work with them to contribute to a suppressed VIX for the rest of the year are also fundamental and seasonal. Here are four reasons why I think the VIX will remain suppressed until the end of 2023.1. The soft landing thesis appears intact. The jobs market is proliferating, but these aren't high-paying jobs that drive inflationary spending. Furthermore, upward wage pressure has come down, meaning the job market strength is not exacerbating inflation. The economic strength will likely lead to strength in Q3 earnings. One positive sign is that companies are issuing guidance at the highest clip in five years, and all else being equal, more visibility means less price volatility, particularly during earnings season.We often have a unique combination of robust economic data and consumer sentiment already at recessionary levels. Recessions are usually preceded by exuberance and confidence, not the perpetual fear and anxiety that leads to more conservative and rational economic decision-making in many cases. In other words, if you cut costs in anticipation of a recession, but demand stays the same or increases, you have likely just increased your margins. This appears to be going on widely in the US economy.2. The Q3 Earnings season is upon us. When markets enter an earnings season, the focus tends to shift from macro drivers and the Fed to the earnings report of respective companies. And believe it or not, despite all the hollering and moaning from bears about term premiums, earnings estimates have ticked back up after declining in a wave of pessimistic sentiment earlier in the year. But, particularly after recent data showing better than forecast economic strength, I'm VERY optimistic about the upcoming earnings season.But there is another underappreciated factor in how earnings season affects the VIX, even if it is a highly volatile one. The VIX measures volatility at the index level. Still, during an earnings season,  at the index level as it increases at the level of individual stocks, so long as an all-correlations-go-to-one sell-off does not occur. In other words, the fact that we are entering an earnings season in itself means that the VIX should naturally be suppressed.3. Seasonal factors have flipped mainly from negative to positive. The remainder of the year tends to see gains for the stock market. Little factors like a slight bump from late tax returns should prove a countervailing force on the weakening bottom four quartiles of US consumers. Yet, the top quintile unlimited purse is somewhat of a countercyclical buoy. Furthermore, standard seasonal factors generally converge to produce good gains in the Fourth Quarter.In addition to the regular monthly seasonal strength, another minor feather in the bullish cap is that this seasonality is augmented in odd years versus even years. So, many positive seasonal factors should converge in the market's favor. There is always the possibility that abnormal events derail the seasonal trends, but historical data is better than none in most instances.4. The macroeconomic impact of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, was multiplied by two factors  The Cold War magnifying and intensifying the consequences of the conflict and the developed world's dependence on foreign-produced oil. Both of these items have changed. The world is still far more globalized now than it was then, despite recent and apparent setbacks to globalization. The first significant change is that the US economy has become far less reliant on oil and is far more efficient in its use than when the Arab-Oil Embargo roiled global markets and the US economy in particular.The other significant change is that the US is now one of the world's largest energy producers. We consume a lot of our oil, and even though the current administration has made some missteps on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, America's energy dominance means that any interruption in oil markets will affect our economy less. US Energy exports hit a record in 2022.It will also affect the global economy less. While the energy sector has been a polarizing political issue, if push came to shove and the United States faced economic ruin or dramatically increasing production, it would likely choose the latter. This is a different dynamic in the global economy than when Arab-Israeli issues badly affected prices and caused recession through energy shocks. Thus, one of the primary mechanisms through which volatility could affect markets is mitigated, and I think energy prices will ultimately be more affected by .The other reasons why I think continued VIX suppression is likely are all still intact, and I think those more secular reasons will converge with the seasonal to produce a low fear index for the remainder of the year. The most significant factor driving the suppression of the VIX is a matter of simple supply and demand. There has been a mass proliferation of more precise and even more liquid alternatives to hedge against tail risk or single-stock risks.I think you should use more precise tools that will give you more upside. For instance, the Limit Up, Limit Down  LULD  rules for individual stocks will give you more upside than the market-wide circuit-breaker rules. These rules have effectively diminished the kurtosis of the VIX or chopped off the tail colloquially.Still, despite these structural factors, there is a massive demand for VIX calls, implying that quite a few market participants disagree with my take. Many risks could get worse than markets already know about. I would include this as a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of the known risks currently stalking the market.I would also point out that my assumption of declining volatility into the end of the year largely rests upon an economic soft-landing coming to fruition. If economic activity declines rapidly or the lag effects of monetary policy cause a significant credit event, then the VIX will spike and make this article look spectacularly wrong. Nonetheless, I think this is a low-probability outcome.The reason you want to buy VIX options instead of just using put options on your SPX position is because the VIX has more convexity. The underlying is the implied volatility of the S P 500, not a security, and implied volatility can spike quickly in a way that usually outpaces asset price moves. But the post-COVID markets have been of a different character than usual.The Fed has guarded financial stability more than consensus thought possible, and the US consumer has proven remarkably resilient. Now that seasonal factors are favorable, I don't think these realities will turn around on a dime. The VIX also tends to decrease after inversion and briefly inverted on recent rate fears.Of course, the main risk of shorting the VIX is getting blown out of the water by an unknown risk. The Black Swan risks we can't know, anticipate, or sometimes even imagine will always be one of the most significant risks to shorting the VIX. People often equate it to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But in addition to seasonal factors being on your side, shorting the VIX in the wake of inversions has an excellent track record.Still, if you think about the physical limitations of this metaphorical task, it is quite doable, just like shorting the VIX. However, I think the data is mainly sending the all-clear, and survey and sentiment data show that people are in a frightful Halloween spirit. This is a perfect condition for shorting the VIX, in my estimation.They say markets climb a wall of worry and fall on a slope of hope. When the inflation report came in white hot and Hamas attacked unprecedentedly, markets sold off. But then they climbed the wall of worry and closed the day higher. While two anecdotal market occurrences don't make a trend, I think they hint at how markets will respond into year-end, aided by seasonal factors. They will climb a wall of worry, and the VIX will likely remain suppressed. I am betting the recent spike just north of  20 was a local high until the end of the year.So, let's finish on ways to implement a short VIX. There are a few options I will provide for folks with different skill levels, risk tolerances, and time horizons. I'll also tell you which contracts I've used will be using. One of the points I've made about VIX suppression involved the proliferation of more precise tools. One tool that is a pretty easy way to short the VIX is a popular short short-term VIX ETF offered by ProShares .There are a lot of risks involved with this ETF, and it won't perform like the VIX, but if you're not used to trading options, it is a good way to capitalize on a collapse of SPX Implied Volatility. It is a highly short-term instrument, and you should monitor it daily. Carefully consult the prospectus before using this tool, and really do your homework. Don't use it if you don't understand itMy preferred way of shorting the VIX is through VIX options. I think you have a lot more control here with regard to theta decay and implied volatility. As I've mentioned, the proliferation of 0DTE options has increased the agility of investors and enables you to squeeze a lot of alpha out of short periods. So, for me, I'll experiment with a trade comprising both short-term VIX options, only eight days out complimented with longer duration options whose value is more supported by time value. These guys can really pop if you catch the proverbial wind right  of course, the rapid time decay can also quickly vaporize capital.For this higher-risk leg of my trade, I purchased the . These options were very cheap, around the close at . However, this part of the position is negligible compared to the October 18th puts. The theta decay is a double-edged sword because, of course, if it goes against you, your contract will quickly go to zero. But, on the other hand, you have a very pure exposure to price movement. This can serve its purpose, but it's like flying a helicopter in a hurricane.Thus, I like to balance my ultra-risky positions with little time to expiry with a longer-dated option that is near or at the money. For this particular trade, given the recent spike in fear and negative sentiment, I will purchase the . These last traded at, respectively. I will put tight stops on my riskier positions and looser ones with more time value. This way, I will prevent a total loss of capital if the VIX moves to higher levels.

Get An 8.3% Yield From Secure High-Quality REITs: RQI,"We usually do not invest in closed-endIn fact, with the closed-end fund I'm going to present today, this is once again the case.The fund's biggest holding is Prologis . For those of you who have been following closely, my favorite industrial pick is Rexford , which is much smaller and has exposure to select geographies which have better supply and demand dynamics than the market at large.However, this isn't the topic ofThe topic of today's article is the  .So why would I consider this CEF and not anotherRQI uses leverage to invest in real estate investment trusts, or REITs. It currently has a 29.5  leverage ratio, which means that for  1 in assets, it invest  1.295 in REITs As these securities pay dividends, this increases the yield on the portfolio by 30 , minus the cost of leverage.This allows RQI to pay out a  0.08 monthly distribution, which is an 8.3  yield on its current  11.46 price.As such, it is an interesting vehicle to generate a high yield while maintaining exposure to safer low and mid-yielding REITs, as we'll see later.Leverage is a double-edged sword. On the way down, a leveraged fund will see NAV erode faster.I believe now is an interesting time to initiate exposure to RQI because of my outlook for REITs over the next 6-18 months, which I have shared in the past  I think REITs have witnessed most of the pain they were going to endure, and will soon swing back up .Analyzing a CEF is somewhat different than analyzing an equity. We start our work with the prospectus, which gives us everything we need to understand about the fund. From there we of course need to do some cursory analysis of underlying holdings, especially the larger ones, and check diversification. We compare the price to the NAV and historical discounts. Finally, we analyze distribution metrics, making sure that the distribution isn't just a return of capital. Ready to dig inRQI commits to investing at least 80  of its total assets in income-producing equity securities issued by high-quality REITs. These are REITs which show prospects for above-average revenue and earnings growth, and are identified based on criteria like earnings growth history, debt to capital ratio, and quality of management.The balance is invested in corporate bonds and preferred shares of real estate companies.This is potentially one of the most interesting parts of the equation.For it to keep working, it would need interest rates to come down within 3 years, which is the average term on its low fixed rate debt on which RQI pays 1.8 .Its average cost of financing is 2.6 .The Advisor charges a fee of 0.85  annually on the average daily managed assets of the fund. A potential conflict of interest arises since this fee is based on managed assets, which includes the fund s use of leverage. However, the Board ensures transparency and protects shareholders' interests by periodically reviewing the fund s performance and its use of leverage.It is customary for funds to present the top 10 holdings. RQI has 206 holdingsIn the case of RQI, the top 10 holdings represent 50  of the portfolio.In my opinion, it is somewhat reckless to ignore the other 50  of the portfolio, but at the same time, it is not necessary to analyze all 200 holdings.Here is the weight of the top x positions for RQI.It is quite clear that beyond the top 30 positions, no individual position adds much to the portfolio, nor deserves attention.Here are the top 30 positions.I've highlighted in bold the names which are covered by the DFT.The concentration of its top positions is quite similar to concentration within our model portfolios.It is also worth mentioning that while the DFT covers 8 of the top 30 positions, their weight within the fund represents no more than 20  of total assets.This is actually quite good, as it suggests that adding RQI would actually add diversification to our real estate exposure rather than creating leveraged redundancy.It is also interesting to note that they own MPW, demonstrating that they are as able as we are to make mistakes.Furthermore, the risk section of the prospectus was quite good in summarizing the different risks of various real estate industries.Here's a short summary belowThe sheer variety of industries within REITs and their own idiosyncratic risks and opportunities shows why it is silly for the media to lump all real estate together when making assessments.While all REITs have in common that they are spread businesses on the cost of capital, and therefore impacted by higher interest rates, the micro of each industry is just as important.With RQI you get their management's preferences of being overweight or underweight certain industries.Let's now look at how good a job they've done in the past.Below are the key current details concerning price and NAVThe 5.6  discount is greater than the one-year average, and looking at the chart below, it is clear that it is a discount which is within a standard range for RQI, but at the higher end. Historically, the price has been at a slight discount, but as REITs have increased, it has converged with NAV.This creates an extra 5  share price increase in upcoming years.Since inception in 2002, NAV has grown at a 9.16  CAGR, beating its blended benchmark and the S P 500 .The share price has somewhat lagged, but this is mostly a function of the NAV and share price disconnecting somewhat.What is clear is that RQI, through over two decades, has performed extremely well, as these returns are net of management's fees.Finally, what we want to make sure of, is that the distributions aren't frequently returns of capital.Short stints of capital returns have to be endured with CEFs when performance is below expectations, but we do not want them to be the norm.Since 2010, only 3 months saw a return of capital from the distributions, in the 4th quarter of 2020.This is encouraging.It means that RQI is able to engineer its 8.3  yield through investing in very high quality REITs, which yield a lot less, thanks to an astute inclusion of leverage, preffereds, and bonds.I've included the top 10 positions in a watchlist, and as you can see, none of them are very high yielding REITs.Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund seems to be a very well managed CEF.If, like me, you are bullish on REITs, the extra leverage offers a great opportunity if REITs soar over the next 24 months, as I expect them to do.We are setting a buy for Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund below  13.7, which ensures a yield above 7 , and a sell above  18, which was the previous high and would be a good time to review the position.The first thing you want to do is hit the orange  follow  button, so we can let you know when we write more dividend related articles.Our model portfolios are ahead of the market, and our community of nearly 900 members is always discussing latest developments in dividend stocks.PS   The summer sale deep discount ends in a few daysRobert   Sam Kovac are a father   son team specializing in building diversifed dividend portfolios.

My name is Natalie, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note that this call is being recorded.  Operator InstructionsI will now hand you over to your host, Marc Biron to begin today's conference. Thank you.Thank you. Dear audience, thank you for joining the Melexis Earnings Call regarding the third quarter of 2023.As always, I will start with the business update, after which, our CFO, Karen Van Griensven, will comment on the financials. We will answer your questions afterwards.Sales in the third quarter of '23 came out with an increase of 5  compared to the previous quarter. During the third quarter, we observed that the order behavior of customers is coming back to a more historical pattern, converging into a normalized order book.For the last quarter of the year, we expect limited growth because of the usual end of year inventory adjustments.The best-performing product during Q3 were our motor drivers, our magnetic sensor and our pressure sensor product, a trend clearly driven by electrification and the need for more comfort and more safety.The embedded motor drivers benefit from the gradual decarbonization of the car because they contribute to extend the range of the car. They are extensively used in thermal management application in cabin and also in the powertrain.The other outperforming products are used in application increasing theThe size of the product, as well as itsThe high safety level and the unique magnetic operation of the magnetic sensor are the main reason for the high demand of this magnetic sensor, especially in the e-braking system.We also had a very important success in Q3 with our temperature sensor because of renewed business in smart watches and also new business in smartphone. The contactless temperature measurement and the very high accuracy of the device creates a lot of attractiveness for the Melexis temperature product family.In the third quarter, we also launched in the market new products. For example, the new current sensors, which is a perfect fit for the EV battery management, and also for the power distribution system.We have also launched 2 ultra-low power all effect switch, which are ideal for IOT, industrial and white goods applications.Before I give the floor to Karen for the financials, I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14th of November. We will be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium, where we will present our strategy, our long-term financial targets as well as the product and application that will fuel our growth in the future.Thank you. Karen, I'll give you the floor.Thank you, Mark. So welcome, everybody. So as mentioned already, we came out with  248.6 million in the third quarter. So 13  increase versus a year ago and 5  versus the previous quarter, with a 3  negative impact of the euro-U.S. dollar versus a year ago, and no impact of the dollar versus the previous quarter.The gross result was  114.5 million or 46.1  of sales, an increase of 16  compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 3  compared to the previous quarter.R D expenses were at 10.7  of sales, G A was at 4.8  of sales, and selling was at 2  of sales.The operating result was  71.1 million or 28.6  of sales, which is an increase of 16  compared to the same quarter of last year, and an increase of 5  compared to the previous quarter.The net result was  56.8 million or  1.41 per share, an increase of 16 , compared to  48.8 million or  1.21 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and an increase of 9  compared to the previous quarter.If we look them ahead, so Melexis expects sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 in the range of  247 million to  251 million. So for the full year, Melexis expects sales to increase around 15 , a gross profit margin above 45 , and an operating margin above 27 , which was previously around 27 . And all of this taking into account a euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.05 for the remainder of the year.So operator, I would like to now open the Q A session. So please go ahead.Operator Instructions  Your first question goes to Marc Hesselink from ING.Yes. Maybe the first question is on supply and demand. You shared that number in the past, that value, that how much bigger the demand is versus supply. Can you maybe share that again  And also, how you expect supply to ramp up over the course of 2024And my second question is on pricing. We've seen -- most of your business is on long-term agreements, but maybe you've also seen some price pressure in the business that not on long-term agreements. So maybe, can you talk around that and how you see that maybe impacting long-term agreements over the more longer termYes. On the first question about supply and demand, I think what we mentioned during the previous quarter is still valid. I think for a large part of the business, there is a better balance between supply and demand, but we still have some pockets of business or some pocket of products that are still under allocation or under stress.Yes, I want also to mention perhaps that it -- given the lead time, which is, let's say, 9 months before -- between the order of the wafers and the delivery to customers. Yes, it's not because we don't have supply constraint at Melexis level, then the customer is not yet -- not in constraint anymore because there is this delay. I mean, we need time to move the product from the supply chain to the customer.In terms of pricing, your second question. As you mentioned, indeed, yes, part of the business is protected by LTA, the long-term agreement that has been defined for '23, '24 and '25. And -- but it's also, as I mentioned, let's say, for the supply chain and also for the order behavior, which is coming back to normal. But there is also, let's say, kind of usual price discussion that is coming back also from part of the business. But I would say yes, we were well prepared in the past for such a discussion. And we are preparing the same way for the discussion of today, then I would say we are confident because we know how to deal it because we have dealt with this kind of discussion in the past.Maybe the second part of the first question, the supply increases for 2024Sorry, I forget it, yes. Yes, we have together with our suppliers, we are working to increase the supply. And I think, you have realized that the supply is increasing, let's say, quarter after quarter. And for the part of business, which is still under constraint, the supply will continue to increase gradually in 2024.Your next question comes from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank.You sound pretty bullish on your TPMS opportunity. Can you just talk a bit about what your market share goals are, where your share is today  And how your solution compares to the likes of Infineon, NXP,  Schrader , et cetera  And I have a follow-up.Yes. I think you mentioned in your question the competitor, and I confirm those are the competitor. Yes, I would say it's not that we are really bullish in the answer. This is just the fact, let's say, we have some application ramping up at some customers. And this is the result of the ramping up.I mean, we have the TPMS. It's the second generation of TPMS. And we have this product, let's say, available, this version since this 3, 4 years, and now it is ramping up at a different customer.Got it. And in Ambient Lighting, you didn't mention that as being strong. Is there some digestion in Ambient Lighting  And are you still supply constrained in Ambient LightingYes. I think, indeed, we did not mention it because it did not grow a lot, let's say, in Q3 versus Q2, but it's supply constrained.And are you losing share because you are supply constrained, and others are like Elmos or not  Or you don't recognize that statementYes, we still have much more harder than what we can supply.Okay. So when you say pockets of the business under stress, it's still quite a large part of your business that is still supply constrainedI think -- no. From a percentage-wise, it's not a lot. But indeed, it's correct that the  indiscernible  in the Ambient Lighting is part of them, yes.Got it. And just last question, just on the destocking. We've seen some other companies like eBlocks see quite major destocking because their lead times normalized. Have you seen the destocking effect or what you call normalization in the backlog, mainly in the products where lead times are kind of back to normal  Or is it just -- do you think customers have over ordered in the past and are now prepared to kind of normalize their inventoryNo, I think it's a bit -- it's a global across the different product portfolio.Do you have another question  Just to make sure we are still online.Can you hear meYes.HelloYes, we hear you.Okay. I don't know. I didn't hear anybody calling for me, but I'm online. I was trying because of the quiet line. So it's Francois Bouvignies from UBS.So I have two quick ones. So in your remarks, Marc, you talked about challenging geopolitical environment and softer electric, softer EV demand. You also talked about orders, normalization.Now the question is, when you look at your numbers in terms of revenue growth, it's actually growing still mid-teens, I mean, this quarter and next quarter. So when you talk about the orders and softer EV demand, does it mean that we will see that at a later stage because it doesn't seem that we see anything right now  Your demand is still fairly strong. Your revenue is very strong. When you say that, is it already impacting your revenuesSo in other words, what you're seeing on the order behavior and EV demand, is it something that we should forecast to impact a bit at a later stage, let's say, 2024  Is it fair to see that wayWe will not comment about '24 because usually, we always give this comment.No. Yes, I'm not asking for quantification guidance. I'm just talking about the mechanical around it because if you said that there is 9 months lead times between your order and your shipments, if you see the orders changing right now, it wouldn't mean, based on what you said, that we will see the impact 9 months later. You see what I meanYes. No, I think you could see it. The comment you could see them in the fact that, yes, we could have been, I think, better in Q3 and also in Q4 with all the headwind that you mentioned. I think there is, for sure, yes, some geopolitic challenge.As I mentioned, and I think it's public that the EV growth -- is still growing a lot, but let's say, slower than anticipated. I think in the -- it's clear, for example, in Belgium that OD has postponed, let's say, the release of the EV production in Brussels. It's also clear that Tesla is reducing their price in order to keep the demand as high as possible. And I think all of this may create the fact that we could have had a better Q3 and a better Q4 with all those headwinds. But at the end, we are still growing.Okay. So you're already seeing that this quarter or next quarter. Can you quantify at all  Or I mean, any help around that  What would have been without this slowdown, the growth rate, for exampleNo, it's difficult to say. It's difficult to say.Okay. The second question is on China. So we know China has been pushing hard on the semiconductor side of things in many different areas. One thing that is very difficult is on the magnetic sensor side. I mean, do you see any local Chinese competitors developing some solutionAnd maybe if you can tell us your exposure to the Chinese local market, that would be great as well. Yes, that's kind of the China situation, local competition, if you see that ramping up and the size of local China, pleaseYes. But first, in general, there are indeed or there is indeed competition in China, but it's not only in China. I mean, we have competition everywhere. It's correct that the competition is a bit magnified in China, but it's not that we don't know how to deal with competition. We have competition in Europe. We have competition in the U.S. And also in China, and as you mentioned, I confirm that the competition in China is probably magnified.But as usual, our answer to the competition is innovation. I mean we have -- we launch between 15 and 20 new products every year, which are always innovative products. And yes, the strategy of Melexis is to avoid, let's say, the price battle and focus on the innovation, which is also the case in China.And to answer your initial question about competition. Yes, we see, I would say, more and more competitor in China also for magnetic. But those are, let's say, basic products and there are, thanks to our innovation, we can bring more value to the customers, also with our magnetic product. But it's correct that the simple products are under competition in China, but it's not our core business, let's say. Our strategy is to bring to link innovation.Very clear. And the size of local China as a percentage of revenues, can you help us quantify itOverall, for Melexis, it s 25 .We'll take our next question from Janardan Menon at Jefferies.My first question is on gross margins. Your gross margin has been running quite strong right now, and you've guided for more than 45 . But to get to the 45  to 46  range would imply a gross margin decline quarter-on-quarter.So I'm just wondering, is your guidance conservative for the full year at 45  plus  Or I mean, what I'm saying is could you have guided even at this 45-plus mean also 46 plus  Or is there any specific gross margin headwind that we should expect into Q4  Or any reason for gross margins to decline into Q4Well, in general, in this year, gross margin is certainly in the first quarter because of inventory effect is actually artificially high. So we know it will come down, short or midterm to more normalized levels. What it will be in Q4 is difficult to predict exactly. But the general trend will be that it will be down from the levels that we see today because of the inventory effect that will gradually fade out. So, yes.Understood. And given that you referred to some inventory normalization correction, et cetera, would -- should we also expect any kind of effect from -- on the utilization at your testing facilities in the next 1 or 2 quartersWell, the machine is running quite stable for the moment. I don't expect major impact from that for the time being.Okay. And then just going on to your comment in your opening remarks, on you're seeing some normal end of the inventory adjustments into Q4. Is that more in the channel  Is that at your sort of direct customers  And what is the level of confidence that, that is only going to be a Q4 phenomenon  And it is truly just an end-of-year seasonal situation and it will not continue into the first half of next yearYes. It's what we see, those adjustments, and in the channel, and in our customer on our Tier 1. I would say, in the channel for the distributor, we see that the inventory is stable, even decreasing a bit. For our customers, we see that the inventory is growing and now stabilizing, but it has grown during the previous months and quarters. And we see indeed that they are adjusting their inventory towards the end of the year. And this is why we really see the effect on those 2 inventories.Understood. And just last question for me. On the -- in the last couple of years, you've always said that you are deprioritizing adjacent markets because the demand from automotive is so strong that you can't fulfill automotive demand, and you are sort of giving higher priority to automotive.Given that, that situation may be changing a little bit, which is automotive chips are coming out of shortage in most cases or in many cases, and you did get this pickup in adjacent markets in Q3. Can we expect that if the automotive side does weaken more than you expect, let's say, in the next 6 months or so, will you be able to cover that slack by shipping more into adjacent markets  Or what I'm trying to say, is adjacent demand strong enough based on your new design wins like the smartphone win, et cetera, to compensate for that weakness right now based on your current visibilityIt s difficult to answer because yes, we don t know   the weakness that you mentioned, we don t know what is the level of the weakness. But it s correct that the capacity being increased and indeed some adjustment that we   in the inventory, that we see. It s correct that then we can give more volume to the adjacent.And for sure, it s a goal of Melexis to balance one with the other, that we have indeed   we are working now indeed to move some capacity towards adjacent. And we see that, yes, in some application, the adjacent application. We see some traction of those applications.You mentioned the temperature sensors, but we see it in also other domain.We'll now move on to our next question from Ruben Devos at Kepler Cheuvreux.I've got just 1 following up on the temperature sensor, which you just mentioned. I believe this will be included in the Pixel 8 Pro smartphones.Could you talk a bit more about the prospect that this could potentially be included in other high-end smartphones as well in your view  And given the expected volumes of the Google Pixel smartphones, it appears like this could be somewhat of a meaningful contributor to your sales. Could you talk a bit about how material this could be for youYes. The Google smartphone is -- I mean, it's not, let's say, the most popular smartphone and how much more popular smartphone. It's also on the high-end version of the phone. Then, yes, I think it's a good success for Melexis because we have proved to the market that we have a product which fits the smartphone requirement.In terms of volume, it is not fantastic. I mean it's for sure, good volume. And for sure, we welcome those volumes, but it's -- I repeat, those are not as popular phone as other phone. But for us, it's really important that we have proved to the market that we can make it, and achieve this fully compatible with the expectation.Okay. And then just more generally, I was wondering like, if you think about maybe the sales, new car sales these days of, let's say, 15  for petro-electric vehicles and 85  other. How would you think about your split in automotive with your share of salesIt's difficult to answer because we have many products that are agnostic to the split between ICE and battery cars. We have let's say, 50  of the product is agnostic to this. And then the other 50  is indeed split between battery and ICE.I don't know, Karen, if you know the split, but I don't know exactly how we could mention the split.Between the ICE and battery. Yes, well, the majority is indeed agnostic. And yes, we go more and more to an equal split in what is specific. And gradually EV has taken the overhand, so it's a gradual process. But it's the minority of our business that is -- so all in all, we are not very sensitive to the move -- to the speed of the move to EV or ICE in general.Yes. I can add that from a design win perspective, it is clear that the very vast majority of the design win are for either the agnostic or the battery powertrain. But yes, there is very, very limited number of design wins for ICE because clearly, the OEM focused their development on the electric cars, and they don't develop a new application or almost no new application for the ICE.Okay. And if I just can come back on the temperature sensor very quickly. You mentioned, it's not -- they don't really have high market share, Google within the overall smartphone market.But do you see like -- do you see there's any possibility of you also making inroads into selling to other handset manufacturers  You've had this win. It's a niche feature so far. But do you see more opportunity hereI think we are working on different opportunities in the smartphone, but also in other wearables. And we believe indeed that this temperature sensors can add value on those wearable. But for the time being, from the smartphone perspective, except for Google, I mean, I don t have anything to mention.We'll move on to our next question from Guy Sips of KBC Securities.Can you update us on the situation in the Malaysian factory. So the -- is it still -- are you still working on a  70 million investment, and that the new building is expected to be completed by the end of this year  Are you speeding it up and trying to get it finished earlier  What's the situation over thereWe are still on plan. And that means that production will be ready by year-end. So we'll move early next year into the production facility.The office building will be finalized in Q1. So that will be still part of the investment in -- for next year, but the majority will be done by the year-end, as was planned in the beginning of the year.And it's still the  70 million in the next 5 years that is expectedThe overall investment, yes, that's in that range of which half is more or less the facility.That's good news in general, I think, that we managed to have a speedy execution in Malaysia.And in return, we ll get more capacity.Operator Instructions  There are no further questions, so I'll hand it back to Mr. Marc to complete this conference. Thank you.Thank you. To close the conference, I would like to thank you for the questions. I m looking forward to discuss again in February.But before that, I would like to remind our Capital Market Day on 14 of November. And again, we d be happy to welcome you in Ieper in Belgium, and to listen to our long-term strategy, long-term financial targets. Also, we d like to present the product and the application that will grow our future. And of course, we could have   take the opportunity, let s say, to discuss during the break or during the lunch on more informal way. Thank you.This concludes this call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-25T16:18:02.000-04:00
A-Mark Precious Metals: Unexpected Way To Bet On Gold,"The gold prices at the decade's end will exceed 4000  oz. To benefit from the gold bull run, the market offers multiple instruments. We can choose between bullion and gold ETFs or jump into the rabbit hole and buy mining shares. A-Mark PreciousA-Mark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry. The company has a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity. The company's revenue and gross profit margins have consistently risen for the last eight years. A-Mark's managers and directors are significant shareholders.I give A-Mark a strong buy rating because it offers excellent business at a steep discount supported by macro tailwinds.We live in exciting times. Uncertainty arises in geopolitics and the macroeconomy. Precious metals love such an environment. They benefit from the disorder  as Taleb would call them, they are antifragile. The gold price has been rising since the beginning of the century. It reached twice peak levels in 2011 and 2022 and, in the meantime, moves in a wide range.The fundamentals are lined up to fuel another leg of the gold bull market. The economic metrics, such as growing M2 aggregate and rising debt to GDP, drive the long-term demand. On the other hand, the supply is constrained by a lack of CAPEX and the approaching . New Tier 1 deposits have not been discovered and developed for the last decade. My scenario is initially for the gold price to reach the   2200 - 2500 range in the next 24 months. However, by the decade's end, we might see the gold priced beyond 4000  oz.The demand for precious metals is forecasted to grow by 9.1 CAGR till 2029. The chart below from  illustrates the growth specifics.In all segments, the demand will increase at a similar rate. Globally, the market is concentrated in North America and Europe. The newcomers as MENA and LATAM states still lag behind the Far East and the Western world. However, at a fast rate, they compensate for the delay. The chart below from  shows ETF gold holding by regionThe progress made by Asia and Europe in the last 17 years is apparent. Another overlooked process illustrating the rising gold demand is the COMEX deliveries. They have been rising steadily over the previous five years. The chart below shows the trendThe consistency is impressive. The 12-month average has been significantly higher than in the past two decades. For the last several years, the Central Banks across the globe have also been active participants in precious metal markets. They have increased their gold reserves with regular purchases. Many European Central Banks  to be repatriated from Fed's custody to their vaults.A-Mark is a diversified service provider in the precious metals trading industry. The image below from the last corporate  shows the company operationsA-Mark has a few revenue streamsA-Mark sells wholesale goods to merchants and institutional customers. Historically, wholesale segment margins averaged over 2 , compared to less than 1 . Due to the enormous supply and demand variations, predicting margins from quarter to quarter is challenging.What I like about A-Mark is its expansion in precious metals retail sales. The everyday investors has started to realize the importance of owning gold and silver. The pandemic was the catalytic event. All bullion dealers were short of inventories. A-Mark made acquisitions, thus reaching a more extensive customer base. JM Bullion, the largest precious metals retailer in the US, is included in its portfolio, and Silver Gold Bull is one of the largest in Canada.Cyber Metals is a platform developed by A-Mark and JMB. The quote below from the company's announcement briefly explains Cyber Metals.In my opinion, the app will significantly improve A-Mark's customer reach. It will attract Gen Z customers who are tech-savvy. Long-term Cyber Metals might turn into another established revenue stream for A-Mark.The directors and managers own company shares. The image below from  illustrates the large shareholdersInvesting means trusting the company's managers. No skin in the game says a lot to me. A-Mark is an excellent example of high ownership among managers and directors.A-Mark has strong financials. The table below shows the company's liquidity and solvency metrics. The data is from the company's .The numbers are good enough for me. A- Mark is not overloaded with debt and has enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations. The image below shows the company's balance sheetA few things I like about that business model  The first is the domination of liquid assets. The company owns   645 million in inventories  ex-restricted inventories . They could easily be liquidated without steep discounts hurting the company's solvency. Intangibles and goodwill constitute 10  of A-Mark's assets. Both are difficult to quantify  hence, our NAV estimate could be far off. It is nice to see such prudent levels in service-based business.On the liabilities side, the company does not hold long-term debt. It uses product financing agreements and revolving credit lines to fund its operations. Both provide flexibility and could be withdrawn when needed.The revenues have been rising for the last three years. The SG A expenses came up, too, due to inflation pressures. The company earnings are still below the levels of 2021 due to the increased expenses.The last numbers are not an exception. The company has managed to grow its yearly revenues for eight years. The chart below shows the company's line since its IPO in 2014.It is impressive to see the growing revenues have been translated into higher margins and EPS. As discussed above, efficient acquisitions were a primary driver, expanding the company's ability to cross and upsell its products.The table above illustrates company profitability metrics. The data is from the  Q2, 2023. The margins are very low in the precious metals trading industry. A-Mark management has done a great job gradually increasing the gross profit margin from 0.4  in 2015 to 3.5  in 2023. Net income per employee has improved too for the same period. Those numbers are a substantial achievement in a challenging environment for precious metals prices.A-Mark traditionally distributes dividends. The image below shows dividend metricsIt maintains a low payout ratio, which is a positive sign. That means the company can maintain its dividend policy without adversely affecting its liquidity. Another benefit is quarterly distribution and dividend growth.At this point, I will calculate the intrinsic value of A-Mark. For this purpose, I use a 2 Stage Discounted Free Cash Flow Model by Professor Damodaran. For equation inputs, I use his  and Seeking Alpha.Assumptions and inputsThe above parameters are inputs in the following steps1. Calculate Levered Beta with the formula below2. Calculate the discount rate  discount rate as the cost of equity  using the resulting value for leveraged beta. The formula I use is3. Stage 1  I calculate the present value of discounted free cash flows for ten years using 2024 and 2025 FCF estimates from . I assume the FCF will grow at a stable rate of 2.2 .4. Stage 2  Calculate the Terminal Value of the free cash flows over ten years at stable growth into perpetuity, g, and the resulting discount rate. Then, calculate the present value of the Terminal Value5. Sum the final results of stage 1 and stage 2. Their sum is called the Total Equity Value  TEV6. Divide the TEV by the total number of company-issued shares. The result is the intrinsic value of the acacia, which I compare against the current market price.For A-Mark, I get the following resultsLevered Beta   1.2Discount Rate   8.2Total Equity Value     1,196,000,000Total shares outstanding   23,000,000Intrinsic value per share     52.0Current market price     35.80  as of Sept 07, 2023To value A-Mark is difficult because its competitors are not public companies. I will weigh A-Mark against its peers from Specialized Finance  Acacia Research  ACDG  and SWK Holdings   and mid-size gold miners  Hecla Mining Company  and Coeur Mining . The latter have an asset-heavy business model and carry a lot of risk not inherent for A-Mark. While specialized finance companies might have clean balance sheets, they differ widely in business models.Ratios with sales in the denominator are useless for valuing AMRK because precious metals services have single-digit gross margins, unlike specialized financiers or gold miners. I use P B and P E in that case, despite their drawbacks. The latter is the most unreliable of all the metrics. Too often, the earnings are subject to accounting gimmicks. The book value, especially for A-Mark, could be estimated with a high degree of certainty because the company holds precious metals, cash, and derivatives with exposure to precious metals in its balance sheet.A-Mark is undervalued compared to financiers and miners based on all P E ratios while using P B, the company is overvalued. In conclusion, the company offers a 30  margin of safety based on DCF calculations - a rare occurrence for such a high-quality business.A-Mark carries the following risks  economic, liquidity, credit, and operational risk. The financial risk is related to interest rates and rising bond yields. The chart below shows the correlation between gold prices and 10-year US Treasury real yields  inverted .Both variables are inversely correlated. The gold is down when the yields are up, and vice versa. But that is a too simplistic explanation. We subtract the inflation from the nominal rates to obtain the actual rates. The current decade will be dominated by structural inflation. ZIRP will remain in the past, and the correlation between the rates and gold prices will become more insignificant.As seen on the chart for the first time since 2019, we have positive real yields. During that period, gold has been moving in a large consolidation. It broke unsuccessfully twice the resistance at 2000   per ounce during the pandemic in 2020 and April 20222.A-Mark is exposed to liquidity and credit risk because it is involved in precious metals landing and funds its operations with revolving credit lines. The liquidity risk is the inability of the borrower to cover its debt obligations on time. A-Mark is highly liquid, thus significantly reducing the liquidity risk.The credit risk is the company's counterparties' inability to pay its debts. A-Mark has a portfolio of loans valued at  100 million on 30 June 2023. The table below shows the loan structureThe company has sufficient buffer because the collateral for bullion is 75 , and for numismatics, it is 65  Loan to Value  LTV . On the other hand, A-Mark's borrowers are exposed to lower default risk.Considering the diverse operations included in the A-Mark portfolio, the operational risk is a factor we cannot ignore. Unfortunately, we can quantify and mitigate its impact. Operational risk is related to the company's processes, which depend on leadership capabilities and corporate culture.A-Mark is a solid business Mr. Market offers for 70 cents per dollar. It has a clean balance sheet, a proven track record in consistently growing revenues, and managers with skin in the game. The macro tailwinds line up for a long-term gold bull market. Being a precious metal merchant, A-Mark will benefit significantly while offering downside protection, unlike the gold miners.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Looking Towards Rate Cuts In 2024,"The technology sector led a rebound in the major market averages yesterday, but there was not a lot of participation from the remaining sectors, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index closed modestly lower. There were no economic reports to trade on, which is whyWhen a soft landing for the US economy can be confirmed by Fed officials, which I think occurs during the first half of 2024, we should start to see a normalization of short-term rate policy. That means moving from the currently restrictive stance to one that is neutral, meaning rates are neither restrictive nor stimulative. While this may be a highly subjective number, Chairman Powell has suggested that it approximately 3.5 . The soft landing will come into view onceBased on Fed funds futures, the consensus of investors is expecting the first rate cut at next year s May meeting. That would lower the target rate from a range of 5.25-5.5  to 5.00-5.25 . I think rate cuts will start sooner than that, because I see the core rate of inflation falling faster than the consensus.Shelter costs have been putting more upward pressure on core inflation than any other category and accounted for 90  of the CPI increase in the month of July. This is because it takes a full 12 months for new rental rates to work their way through the annualized number, which stands at approximately 8 . As the chart below clearly shows, when the newest rental rates are factored into the annualized number, we should see a precipitous fall in shelter inflation by May of next year. The market will anticipate the rate cuts to come, based on this disinflationary development, and the bull market should continue to broaden and mature between now and then as a result.The inflation hawks are saber rattling about rising energy prices today, which they assert will force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, if not continue to tighten monetary policy. First, the Fed s focus is on the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices. Both are subject to dramatic price swings which the Fed has little control over. The movement in the price of oil over the short to intermediate term has more to do with the speculative activities of futures traders than real world supply and demand. Therefore, it is futile to try and manage it with monetary policy. Second, rising energy prices is a form of tighter monetary policy on consumption, which self resolves over time.As this bull market broadens and strengthens, and sentiment gradually improves, I will become more keenly focused on what can go wrong rather than what is already going right. There is a big difference between a pause to refresh  3-5 , a correction  10  or more , and a bear market  20  or more . The first is an opportunity. The second is a more painful opportunity that requires more defensive action. The last necessitates a shift to wealth preservation. This still feels like a pause that has yet to complete itself. If the facts change, then so will my outlook.Lots of services offer investment ideas, but few offer a comprehensive top-down investment strategy that helps you tactically shift your asset allocation between offense and defense. That is how compliments other services that focus on the bottom-ups security analysis of REITs, CEFs, ETFs, dividend-paying stocks and other securities.  Lawrence Fuller has been managing portfolios for individual investors for 30 years, starting his career at Merrill Lynch in 1993 and working in the same capacity with several other Wall Street firms before realizing his long-term goal of complete independence when he founded Fuller Asset Management.

Strong EV Sales Growth Forced Exxon Mobil To Enter The Lithium Business,"After a strong year in 2022, , and the United States is arguably the fastest-growing market in the world.That new market reality has apparently left an impression on some of theAt the end of July, news broke that  to supply lithium to some of the world s largest EV manufacturers, such as  ,   and  .This news follows another report that , with the intent of potentially mining and processing lithium in that region. While still in the early stages, the facility could pump out as much as 100,000 tons of processed lithium annually.This part of Arkansas is viewed as strategically important because it falls within the SmackoverIf Exxon successfully launches a new U.S.-based lithium operation, that would significantly boost domestic supplies of this key global resource. Lithium has been critically undersupplied in recent years, as EV manufacturing has expanded rapidly around the world.Currently, the world s largest producers of lithium include Australia, Chile, China, Argentina and Brazil.As part of the company s Q2 earnings call, CEO of Exxon Darren Woods said that  brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and, in fact, in some of our upstream operations.Exxon hasn t yet said if it would develop the Arkansas facility on its own, or potentially partner with another company that has specific expertise in lithium mining processing.Exxon s aspiration to be a major player in the global lithium market is clearly growing by the day especially if the longtime oil giant is already talking to EV manufacturers about future supply deals.And Exxon isn t hurting for cash. The company booked roughly  7 billion in profits during Q2 2023, and has a long history of putting extra capital to work.On July 13, Exxon acquired   for  4.9 billion. Denbury specializes in carbon capture, utilization and storage  CCS  as well as enhanced oil recovery. Last year, Exxon also acquired a 50  stake in Biojet AS, which is a Norwegian biofuel company.Earlier this year, the  reported that   of  , a large American fracker in the Permian Basin. However, based on the recent Denbury acquisition, the PXD deal may have temporarily been moved to the back burner.Based on Exxon s new foray into the lithium market, it s entirely possible the company may elect to acquire a lithium miner processor at some point in the future, as well.With a market capitalization of roughly  440 billion,  and can certainly  pay to play  in the lithium sector, if it so chooses.Exxon has likely been exploring strategic alternatives in the lithium sector for some time, but may have gotten more serious in 2023 due to the recent correction in lithium prices.Considering the company s long history of success, the leadership at Exxon is keenly aware that it s preferable to buy low and sell high, as opposed to vice versa.Lithium prices along with the prices of many other global commodities spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, but have dropped sharply since October of last year.From August 2021 to October 2022, lithium prices rallied from roughly  15,000 ton all the way to  85,000 ton. However, from October of last year through today, lithium prices have corrected by about 55 , and are currently trading around  35,000 ton.The recent drop has been attributed to several factors, including the recent slowdown in the Chinese economy, as well as increased global supplies of this key resource.China is currently the largest market for global EV sales and boasts the world s largest domestic fleet of EVs, with over half of the world s electric vehicles currently domiciled in the Middle Kingdom.China s economy had been expanding after the country scrapped most of its COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2022. But the economy in China has sputtered in recent weeks, as manufacturing activity in the country has steadily weakened.In addition to a weakening Chinese economy, lithium prices have also been fighting against rising global supplies of this key material. Lithium production was extremely limited just a few years ago, but global capacity has expanded significantly in the last two years.New supplies are coming online in China this year, and in the next couple of years, some big mines in North America and South America are expected to come online.For the time being, declining lithium prices have certainly helped make EVs more affordable, which may be a key reason sales of EVs continue to rise in 2023.In June of this year,  that new EVs were selling for about 20  less than they were 12 months ago, on average. And some of that decline was undoubtedly linked to falling lithium prices., the supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market will continue to drive prices for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Moreover, the prevailing price of lithium will continue to heavily influence how much it costs to build an EV.To track and trade the lithium sector, readers can add the following tickers to their watchlistsEditor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Next Big Short - Junk Bonds,"Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates - as interest rates increase bond prices fall. Thus, a bet on higher interest rates can be executed by shorting bonds, or bond ETFs.But whatThe basic formula for bond yields is as followsNominal yields   Real yields   Inflation Expectations   Credit Risk   Liquidity premium   Maturity premiumTreasury Bonds, issued by the US Government, are considered to be Risk-free, meaning the Credit risk is essentially 0. Further, Treasury Bonds have been the most liquid asset globally, thus Liquidity premium is also 0.Thus, Treasury Bond yields are affected only by 1  Real rates, and 2  Inflation expectations  relative to other bonds with the same maturity .The nominal yield on a 10-year Treasury Bond has increased over the last 6 months from around 3.3  to 4.49 , as the chart below shows. What caused the increase in the nominal yieldThe increase in the nominal yield on the 10-Year Treasury Bond has been primarily driven by the increase in the real interest rate. As the chart below shows, the real rate, as estimated by the yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security  TIPS  has almost doubled over the last 6 months, increasing from just above 1  to 2.07 .Inflation expectations, estimated as the Breakeven Inflation have been relatively stable over the last 6 months in a 2.3-2.4  range.Thus, it's the real yield that is pushing the nominal yield higher. What is causing the increase in real yieldsThe real yields respond to the supply and demand for Treasury Bonds, and can also be used as a monetary policy by the Fed. Specifically, the Fed can buy Treasury Bonds via QE to stimulate the economy by making real yields negative. The Fed can also remove the monetary policy stimulus by selling Treasury Bonds via QT, which can push the real yields higher.Recently, the Fed has been implementing the QT, which can explain the rise in real yields from -1  to  2  over last year.However, it was the Bank of Japan monetary policy tweak in July to allow long term rates to reach 1  that triggered the recent rise in the Treasury real rates, given the expectations that Japanese investors would start selling US Treasury Bonds. Note, the Japanese investors are the largest holders of US Treasuries.Further, the US Government is running an unsustainable fiscal deficit, which has been increasing the supply of Treasuries - at the time when the demand is weakening. The July Treasury auctions were weak, which added to the price pressure and lifted the real yields.Given the rising US Treasury nominal yields, the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  has dropped by 14  over the last 6 months.In fact, during this period many investors revealed their short bets on US Treasury Bonds, for example the .But what about Corporate Bonds, especially the Junk bonds  Based on the valuation formula above, the nominal Junk bonds yields are also pricing the Credit risk or the risk premium, in addition to the real yields and inflation expectations.Stinkingly, as TLT dropped by 14  over the last 6 months, the iShares iBoxx   High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  remained essentially flat, falling by only -0.05 .How to explain the relative overperformance of HYG over TLT over the last 6 months, as the chart below showsObviously, the recent episode of rising real rates did not increase credit risk for junk bonds. But more importantly, the increase in real yields did not affect the junk bonds, which actually means that the credit risk premium actually decreased over the last 6 months.Did we witness a flight to safety to Junk Bonds over the last 6 monthsIn fact, the interest rate spread between the BBB rated bond yields  one notch above the junk  and the 10-Year Treasury Bond yields has been narrowing, from 2.3  to current 1.66 , which is the lowest level since 2007.The recent overperformance of Junk bonds HYG over Treasury Bonds TLT is likely an inefficiency - and HYG is likely to fall sharply over the next 12 months, in absolute terms, and relative to TLT.First, the increase in real interest rates is increasing the probability of a recession, given that a rise in real yields is a monetary policy tightening tool - designed to slow the demand by reducing investment - and thus cause a recession to tame inflation. The Fed has not indicated a timetable to stop the QT.Second, the increase in nominal yields increases the probability of a credit crunch as the higher yields meet the wave of the corporate bond refinancing needs in 2024 and beyond. This is directly related to the unfolding Commercial Real Estate crisis, which is likely to be the next shoe to drop.Thus, Credit Risk is likely to sharply spike over the near term, as the higher real yields trigger a recession, and the likely wave of corporate defaults. Thus, HYG is a prime short at these levels, and given the recent overperformance.Note, according to Seeking Alpha, HYG has 47  short interest, which means that it is already a heavily shorted ETF - the big short on Junk bonds is already in place, but it has not worked yet.The soft-landing narrative is possibly continuing to support the Junk bond prices, and keeping the credit spreads tight. Thus, the Junk Bond short might need a trigger that invalidates the soft-landing narrative, a data point that confirms a recessionary scenario.What's in HYGHYG is well diversified ETF with 1207 junk bond holdings. These are the top 10 junk bonds in HYG, totaling just above 4 .   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,"We are pleased to provide you with the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund s , the  Fund  report for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the first nine months of the calendar year, the Fund generated a return of  2.15   after fees  versus -4.12   before fees  for the Fund s most relevant benchmark, the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed Index.The primary contributors to performance during the quarter included certain U.S.-based real estate-related businesses  FNF Group and U-Haul Holding Company  and international real estate operating companies  Wharf Holdings and Berkeley Group . Notwithstanding, these gains were more than offset by detractors during the quarter, which primarily included the Fund s investments in areas that are perceived to be more  economically sensitive  such as real estate services  CBRE Group and JLL  and homebuilding  Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton despite these businesses possessing super-strong balance sheets and prospects to gain significant market share over time.Even though the Fund has outperformed its most relevant benchmark more recently, Fund Management maintains the view that the strategy s long-term results are the most relevant scorecard. To that end, the Fund has generated an annualized return of  7.93   after fees  since its inception more than twenty-five years ago. As a result, this performance indicates that an initial investment of  100,000 in the Fund would have a market value in excess of  675,000  assuming distributions had been reinvested , or more than the same  100,000 would be worth had it been placed into a passive mutual fund tracking the Fund s aforementioned benchmark  as well as the S P 500  over the same time period. Further perspective on the key drivers of this performance are included herein, along with more details on the Fund s additions to Sun Communities Inc. and Big Yellow plc, and overall portfolio positioning.At the end of July, the Office of Debt Management at the Department of the  U.S.  Treasury provided its to the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee  TBAC . Within the presentation, TBAC was provided with an overview of various items, including the Treasury s recent financial results, certain forecasts, and recommendations on financing. Most notably though, the Office of Debt Management revised certain figures from the previous quarter and projected that the Treasury s current annual deficit  which is amongst the largest on record as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product  would largely be maintained for the next decade. In addition, TBAC received the recommendation that the Treasury fund these shortfalls by increasing its issuance of longer-dated U.S. Treasury Notes. Alongside these revelations, the capital markets recalibrated their supply-and-demand expectations for Treasuries, leading to longer-dated U.S. Notes  i.e., 10-Year and 30-Year  selling off by nearly 20  in price in the weeks after, with long-dated Treasury yields increasing by more than 1.00  and reaching their highest levels in more than 15 years. Such moves are rare, let alone when  inflationary pressures  were reported to have moderated during the same time period as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price  CPI  Index.In actuality, this shift represented a reset in  real rates , which is the difference between the nominal yields for U.S. Treasuries and overall inflationary expectations. It is also a development that has reverberated throughout the broader capital markets as the 10-Year U.S. Treasury is considered to be the benchmark rate for debt markets globally and  the most important asset in the world  according to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. As a result, yields for other fixedincome securities factored in the adjustment in  real rates  during the quarter, impacting the prices for most  interest-rate sensitive  investments globally, including listed real estate.In terms of the impact on commercial real estate markets, this adjustment in  real rates  will undoubtedly lead to more elevated costs of capital and reduced property values in the near-term which will be particularly troubling for real estate enterprises with significant amounts of debt or meaningful near-term maturities. On the other hand, these developments seem to offer certain silver linings for distinct pockets of the commercial real estate industry, including  i  well-capitalized market participants with limited debt maturities as well as excess capital to deploy as investment opportunities arise,  ii  investors in listed real estate as the impact of higher discount rates has seemingly been factored into security prices and now offers a historically attractive basis when measured on most fundamental valuation metrics, and  iii  owners of strategic real estate assets as more restrictive lending terms will likely lead to a lack of new construction, serving to further tension the supply-and-demand picture, which could result in outsized rent growth in certain instances over the medium-term.This final point is worth expanding on as the return potential of income-producing real estate with  pricing power  is often misperceived in a higher interest rate environment, in our opinion. For instance, if one were to hypothetically purchasea portfolio of single-family rental properties at a 6.00  nominal cap rate  i.e., the  initial yield  and the income stream were to increase by 4.00  per year, on average, over a 5-year holding period, then one would realize a return of approximately 10.00  provided the  exit  cap rate  i.e., the yield at the end of the investment period  remained at the same level even after taking out an additional 15  expense for management fees and maintenance costs along the way. In fact, the portfolio would provide a return in excess of 5-Year U.S. treasuries  4.75  provided the  exit  cap rate remained below 7.90  in the scenario outlined above, thus allowing for nearly a 2.00  increase in cap rates over the holding period.Put otherwise, income-producing real estate can provide an attractive  real return  even in a higher interest rate environment provided it has  pricing power  and modest levels of  cap ex and  corporate overhead . It is for these reasons, among others, that the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund has concentrated its  income-producing  real estate investments into very well-capitalized enterprises with similar characteristics and distinct supply-and-demand drivers  e.g., emerging self-storage platforms, industrial real estate portfolios with  below-market  rents, premier mixed-use destinations, and niche residential rental businesses . It is also the framework for the Fund s additions to Sun Communities Inc. and Big Yellow plc during the quarter.Founded in the mid 1970 s, Sun Communities Inc.  Sun Communities  or  Sun  is the largest single owner of Manufactured Housing  MH  and Recreational Vehicle  RV  communities in North America, with more than 500 properties comprised of nearly 150,000 leasable sites, and a particular focus on the Sunbelt and Midwest regions of the U.S. The company is also the largest owner of marinas in the U.S. with 135 locations and nearly 50,000 slips, as well as investments in the MH and RV space internationally, primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary Park Holidays in the U.K. and 10  stake in separately-listed Ingenia Communities in Australia  also held in the Fund .As outlined in greater detail within the Fund s   these niche property types principally lease land sites  and power access  to MH and RV owners and have historically enjoyed steady demand, restricted supply, and limited maintenance costs. As a result, Sun Communities has proven capable of keeping occupancy rates above 95.0  over the past 10 years, on average, and has increased revenues  on a per-site basis  by more than 6.0  per year during that same time period, also on average most of which has dropped to the  bottom line  given the limited reinvestment required. Consequently, Sun has been amongst the leaders in the REIT industry in terms of cash flowgrowth and hardly ever  gets cheap  per se.That said, Sun s common stock has underperformed more recently. In our opinion, this not only stems from a more recent increase in borrowing and insurance costs, but is also due to the overhang of Sun s rapid acquisition activity. Historically a very focused company, Sun has increased its exposure to international markets, as well as more volatile revenue streams relative to its traditional MH and RV businesses through a series of investments in recent years. Therefore, the company s shares now trade at a sizable discount to its closest peer, as well as a conservative estimate of Net-Asset Value  NAV , in our view.It is therefore not inconceivable that Sun s aligned control group gets  back to basics  and refocuses the company on the core MH and RV communities in the period ahead. In the meantime, the Fund owns Sun common stock at prices that imply a cap rate in excess of 6.00 nearly the highest initial yield in more than a decade despite management indicating at an industry conference that they expect rental rate growth of 4-8  across the company s key segments at the same time that manufacturing wages  a key factor in MH rents  seem to be accelerating at an even more rapid clip.Founded in 1988, Big Yellow  Big Yellow  is a U.K.-based REIT that owns and operates a portfolio of 108 self-storage facilities spanning 6.3 million square feet of total space, which is primarily concentrated in London and the Southeast region of the U.K. The company is also very well-capitalized with a loan-tovalue ratio of approximately 15 , a fixed-charge coverage of nearly 6.0 times, and modest capital commitments.Fund Management remains fond of the self-storage business as this property type tends to provide remarkably steady cash flows once leased up, while at the same time requiring minimal ongoing capital expenditures. Further, should a tenant not pay rent, the items in storage can be sold off and the space can be subsequently re-leased. Self-storage is also one of the few property types that have legitimate scale advantages as companies that control platforms can operate much more efficiently than independent owners due to various operating synergies and also significantly lower customer acquisition costs  when viewed on a per unit basis  given the transition to online procurement in recent years.Notwithstanding, the primary drawback for self-storage facilities is that it is considered to be amongst the easiest property types to build  alongside industrial . However, Big Yellow has a unique position as the leading owner in a region with significantly less competition than its U.S. peers, as well as more restricted building codes in its core markets  i.e., there is estimated to be less than two square feet of self-storage space per capita in the U.K. relative to more than nine square feet in the U.S. . Moreover, due to the vast majority of its portfolio having been acquired or developed within the past decade, its occupancy rates have yet to reach stabilization providing a unique opportunity to match the utilization of its more established U.S. peers  i.e., Big Yellow s portfolio-wide vacancy rate was reported to be more than 19  in its most recent financials relative to approximately 6  for the established US self-storage REITs .When considering the fundamental backdrop  e.g., expanding awareness, demand from small business, population growth, et al , it seems as if Big Yellow has the potential to increase its portfolio occupancy rates towards 90.0  over time which would likely allow the company to match the 7.0  increase in revenues it has posted, on average, over the last 10 years. Industry followers would also likely point out that such a development would also have a disproportionate impact on the underlying cash flows given the  fixed-cost  nature of selfstorage facilities  i.e., operating margins for its recently integrated facilities are less than 60  relative to margins for its more stabilized facilities of 74 .Meanwhile, Big Yellow common stock trades at prices which imply an approximate 7.30  cap rate on the existing portfolio with only a slight uplift to the book valueof its development pipeline. In Fund Management s opinion, this price seems very modest relative to a reasonable estimate of Net-Asset Value, as well as significantly in excess of the 5.00  estimated cap rate that Nuveen recently agreed to acquire Self Storage Group ASA  a Nordic self-storage platform  for despite that entity having substantial ground leases relative to 99  of Big Yellow s locations now being controlled under  fee-simple  arrangements.Outside of these additions, the Fund s other activity was modest in nature and included a slight addition to Savills plc, as well as reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes  Lennar Corp., D.R. Horton, Prologis, Segro, Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier . The Fund also extended out its hedge relating to its Hong Kong Dollar exposure during the period.After factoring in this activity, the Fund had approximately 43  of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the U.S. and U.K. residential markets  wherethere remain supply deficits after years of under-building. In conjunction with near record-low inventory levels, there also remains significant demand for new product at affordable price points  both for-sale and for-rent . Therefore, these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multi-year recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities, particularly as mortgage rate volatility subsides. At the end of the quarter, these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding  Lennar Group and DR Horton , timberland ownership Aand management  Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier , planned development  Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings , niche rental platforms  AMH, Grainger plc, Ingenia Communities, and Sun Communities , as well as other ancillary businesses  Lowe s and Trinity Place Holdings .The Fund also had 31  of its capital invested in Commercial Real Estate enterprises that are involved with very-select segments of the property markets. At the current time, these holdings are primarily focused on companies seemingly capitalizing on secular trends, including structural changes driving more demand for industrial properties, self-storage facilities, and last-mile fulfillment  Prologis, U-Haul, Segro plc, First Industrial, InvenTrust, Big Yellow, and National Storage  as well as the further densification and improvements taking place in select urban corridors  CK Asset Holdings and Wharf Holdings . In Fund Management s view, each of these enterprises is very well-capitalized, their securities trade at discounts to private-market values, and they seem capable of providing compelling  real returns  in the face of higher interest rates primarily by increasing rents, undertaking development activities, and by making opportunistic acquisitions.An additional 23  of the Fund s capital is invested in Real Estate Services. These real estate-related businesses are generally less capital-intensive than direct property ownership and consequently have offered much higher returns on capital over the course of a cycle provided they have favorable positioning within their respective segments. At the present time, these holdings include franchises involved with brokerage and property management  CBRE Group, Savills plc, and JLL , investment management  Brookfield Corp. and Brookfield Asset Management , as well as mortgage and title insurance  FNF Group and the GSEs .The remaining 3  of the Fund s capital is in Cash, Debt   Options. These holdings include U.S.-dollar based cash and equivalents, short-term Treasuries, hedges relating to certain foreign currency exposures  Hong Kong Dollar , and an investment in the Senior Unsecured Notes of Five Point Holdings. The Fund s allocations across these various business types are outlined in the chart below, along with the exposure by geography  North America, Europe, and sia-Pacific . In addition, the discount to Net-Asset Value  NAV  for the Fund s holdings, when viewed in the aggregate, expanded to approximately 26.1  at the end of the quarter by Fund Management s estimates, and the holdings remain very wellcapitalized  in Fund Management s view  with an average loan-to-value ratio of 16  at the present time.During the quarter, the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund celebrated its 25th year of operations. As a result, the strategy now has one of the most established track records in real estate securities and has remained unique relative to other Real Estate Mutual Funds during that time span, in our view, byAlthough these core tenets of the Real Estate Value strategy have remained unchanged since its 1998 inception, the process by which it is implemented has been enhanced over the years on three key fronts. One, the strategy expanded its opportunity set by pursuing value investments in select international markets, which have been additive to returns for nearly two decades now. Two, the Fund has remained concentrated but more prudently than early on with stricter portfolio construction guidelines relating to position size, geographic exposure, and property type allocations. And three, the day-to-day management of the Fund has transitioned to a team-based effort, which utilizes a well-defined and repeatable process, making it more durable over the long-term  our primary focus .The results of this evolution have been satisfactory. To wit, the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund had generated an  8.15  annualized return at its twenty-five-year mark, exceeding its primary index as well as the S P 500 Index over that extended period of time. The results also support Third Avenue s long-held view that an actively managed fund with a sound strategy, robust process, and aligned portfolio management team has strong prospects to outperform relevant benchmarks over the long-term, on average, and most of the time.Notwithstanding, Fund Management believes in  continuous improvement , including using its experience to draw upon  lessons learned  with the goal of further enhancing the process and potential results in the years ahead. With that being the case, Fund Management recently revisited some of the largest contributors and detractors to performance over the years and found three indistinguishable themes on each side of the ledger. In terms of types of investments that have detracted from performance since the Fund s inception, the primary allocations have includedConversely, the allocations that could be characterized as the key drivers of performance over the past 25 years primarily includeWhile such investments haven t represented all of the contributors  or detractors , one should expect the Fund to eschew those that could be characterized by the former, while concentrating more capital around the latter when the price-to-value proposition is appropriate. Coincidentally now seems to be one of those moments and frankly very similar to when the Fund was launched in 1998 in a number of respects with  i  the S P Index trading at above-average earnings multiples,  ii  Real Estate securities seemingly out-of-favor, and  iii  10-Year U.S. Treasuries yielding around 5.00 . Similar to then, it also seems to be an opportune time to own  real assets  at modest valuations with prudent leverage, and to the extent the next few years of performance mirror those first few years of the strategy, it may prove to be a rewarding time to be invested in the Fund. However, Fund Management would be disappointed if the results were not even better given the  lessons learned  along the way.We thank you for your continued support and look forward to writing to you again at year-end.

Maybe talk a little bit about that and what were some of the takeaways Yeah, so this was a conference, it was hosted by the Central and Southwest Asian Studies Center. And that part of the world is connected to, Russia, China, the Middle East, Europe by definition. So, it's in the middle of so many regions that are in the news, so to speak, of late.And so it was very timely to be there. And there were absolutely foremost experts on the Middle East and the region. And so that was really educational. And I talked about energy and geopolitics, largely from the point of view of having  all the shale booms and busts and what it means in terms of geopolitics. And then it was also notable that at this time, what's happening, there's a lot of obviously geopolitical conflict right now, which is really, really ramping up markets.One takeaway from my presentation was just that U.S. oil and gas production is kind of looking like a bit of a safe harbor in some respects, it's a positive and I think that message came through.And also just the idea that physics is also driving this energy transition a lot, a lot more than people would like to think, but it's kind of the truth. And that was, sort of also my other takeaway from the conference.And just that energy production globally is really of net benefit to societies. It's a source of economic development, and it's a positive story. It's a good news story at a time when there's a lot of really tough challenges and hopefully, these conflicts can end cause there's going to be economies to rebuild and energy is going to be at the core of this as well. That's kind of some of my high level takeaways from the conference. So, before that you attended an economics conference with leaders from around the globe and the Fed, any highlights to share from that Yeah, sure. So, yeah, it was a pretty intense, you know, 7 days. This conference, it was the National Association of Business Economists. And it was a gathering of economists from around the world and economists from all the major universities, and Bloomberg was there, and top economists. Actually, I sat next to one of the former top Chief Economists of the EIA, which is our energy watchdog. And there was somebody from the Embassy of Australia.And yeah, it was really pretty amazing. And, you know, a few Fed presidents, as well as one fed Board of Governors presentation that I found, I was really struck by his presentation. The message that he delivered was just that, we're doing all this, we're trying to smooth this economy out, and they're having to do it with interest rate increases that have had to happen for all kinds of reasons that we know and we won't go into.But the whole idea is shared prosperity. Again, that same message that this is the endgame of it all, you know, and it's a really complex task to get there.And, you know, it's a tough job they have, and I know they're under constant criticism and scrutiny and analysis and I get it completely. You know, I used to do the same and I still watch quite a bit. The other thing that was, oh, and kind of one of the takeaways was just that, you know, this continued restrictive policy stance, but at the same time really trying to monitor current developments.Of course there's backwards looking data and I know that there was kind of a criticism about their approach I read today by a leading thinker, you know that they're too backward looking, they need to be more forward looking and all that. But honestly, you know, from sitting there with them and listening to what they're looking at, too, they're about as forward-looking as anyone could be, you know. I mean, who has the crystal ball, right  So, I mean, so that was sort of my takeaway.I would say I left that feeling confident, you know, confident in the leadership. And then the other thing, as I sat in on two panels, one was on this, you know, supply chains and all this idea of reindustrialization, things that you and I have been talking about, we talked about it at the end of 2022, my after the Fed work.And then we talked about it at the beginning, the first quarter in videos and articles on supply chains and chips and all this change that's happening. And it's also, of course, driving a lot in tech, as we know. But with the supply chains, one quick takeaway is just that there are these changing trading blocks happening that we're starting to see.And we see this with investment, even like Intel , investing in Germany and what is it, Taiwan Manufacturing , you know, the chip maker, you know, here in, in Arizona, you know, just all of it is happening and it's going to take time.And then the other thing is, this is just one of my thoughts, even though there are these sort of shifts in trading blocks, we're still trading with China, not much less. It's just happening through other proxies.So, it's a still very interdependent globalized context. And I think that's really apparent when you see even what's happening with the conflict going on in the Middle East. No matter how you skin that cat, we're interconnected and our markets are interconnected and everyone's invested in everyone else, that sort of thing. And there are all these legacy relationships.And yeah, there's some shifts and some new relationships. And some of it we're seeing in energy with our energy trade, even with LNG and all that, and so it's just, t's going to be something to continue to watch. This is not going to move fast, no matter what we hear, announcements and things like that.It's just going to take   it's all going to take time to see what shakes ultimately. But I can say that the North American trading block is quite robust and it's positive. I even heard that from some economists' comments and that's all, it's kind of obvious. If you look at it through the energy lens, it's absolutely obvious.And we've been talking about that. You know, I've been talking about that since the last quarter of last year, just this really national treasure that we have.But now I want to talk about, so this is just looking at oil futures. And I was looking at this from a one month view. October 5th to 7th, you see oil prices go up like 4 . They stay up, they come down, because we're not sure what's happening, they go back up. And now, as you can see, they're ratcheted, they've come up and, everything's been kind of dragged down by what's happening.Oil  have come down a little bit, S P as well. And some of that's driven by just the idea that, you know, all this conflict, all this volatility, all this uncertainty could start dinging global demand. And that remains to be seen, jury s out.This is just showing what's going on with oil supply, which is also a big driver of, and we can't see the tightness. Hang on, let me just try to do this a little bit smaller, maybe in a different view.Tightness is a big driver. And now something I would say too is just that with this tightness between supply and demand that starts changing a little bit after the first, because you know it takes a while for oil production to catch up, right  And prices are higher, so there is some incentive to produce as well. But it's just sort of looking a bit tight for a little bit, and then we'll see how that all shakes out.And also geopolitics are going to have something to do with this. One thing I would say is, these other countries that are kind of involved in a lot of the geopolitical conflicts at the moment are also energy producers. So I think there's that to also consider.This summer, we have had the hottest, most summer load demand ever. And it was like 80, 85 megawatts. And remember I'd been talking about the grid and the stress of the grid. But I can also say with Texas, you know, it's a grand experiment in energy, trying to become energy efficient.Like I said, we're well diversified with our energy mix. We have a lot of renewables. We have the transmission problems that everybody has. And I've discussed that in that kind of Texas million dollar mile story. We have the connectivity issues that everybody has.So, what it all means is, in spite of the IRA legislation, it's all still going to move slow. But there are a lot of new ideas happening. I actually listened to an energy conference on Friday and there's some really innovative things happening in Texas and that's a story for another day.And this is just speaking to the yield issue, you know with the Fed and one thing I will say too, I know there's been this focus about the term premium, and what that's just really about is the addition to long-term yields that is not just attributed to interest rate rises.And sort of what they were talking about at the economist conference was that   of the long-term yield, one half of it right now is comprised of this term premium. And that has to do with actors and behavior expectations.And something that is driving that, it is thought, is our national debt. The idea that with interest rates being higher and then the national debt going up, it's going to get more expensive to fund that. And that's a headwind, that can crowd out investment, it can do all sorts of things. So, if anything, the idea of fiscal restraint is ever more important.And then this is something else from the Economist Conference.  has a lot of debt that is not apparent and is not, you know, just discussed. And that by 2025, this debt, this hidden debt could be 5x as large as what is recognized by officially recognized counterparts. So that is something and we're in the same boat.There's been this movement towards oil and gas as an investment, just because everything that's going on , which started last year is kind of a recipe for these hard assets. Oil prices have been up, it's just kind of like a safe harbor in some respects.U.S. oil exports reached a high in the first half of 2023. And we're just going to continue to export oil. And that's a positive thing that we're on the global stage with our oil and gas production.In 2023, natural gas production per well, they've just become more efficient. And that is partly why we see natural gas prices on the lower side, just production is up because we're producing roughly 13 million barrels a day of oil. And with that, as we've discussed, comes a lot of associated gas in the Permian. And there's a lot of oil production in the .There's gas production everywhere, Haynesville and Appalachia, and a lot of this is also going for LNG exports. So, it's just showing though that the producers are getting more efficient with production compared to years past. In the past, you've written  about Pioneer , the Permian, and now there's the Exxon  . The general , what color do you have about thisWhat does this mean for the market for investors when they're looking at these deals Yes, so, you know, we talked about this consolidation happening, you know, potential happening in the industry at the end of last year. You know, in our -- after the  we had   there are slides on this - we talked about, you know, the cash on the balance sheets of large oil and gas firms. And that deals were getting bigger, going to be, and by default, they are bigger. So, we kind of nailed that back then.And it's playing out because also I think, we've had to figure out where are oil prices going to be  What's the narrative  You know, is it this green transition, or is it oil and gas, what is happening in betweenReally, right now with returns, and with what's happening around the world, this consolidation makes even more sense. And then as oil prices are up, again, what are you going to do with that cash  Are you just going to return it all to the shareholder, or are you going to invest for tomorrowWell, they've decided to invest for tomorrow. And the idea that, you know, okay, some are saying, oh, this just means oil and gas is around a lot longer. Well, that's true. And that was always true. You know, if you just look at the numbers, the demand, how much primary energy demand is met by fossil fuel usage.And the affordability and all the things we have talked about in the past. And of course, absolutely, you know, this is also a way actually to produce these resources more cleanly when you have scale, when you have efficiency, you know, so I don't think that speaks to it being done, you know, with less decarbonization in mind, not at all. That's a false narrative.And so, I would just say that the idea that Exxon and Chevron  are now making these major, let's just call it  60 billion acquisitions respectively, because that's what they are. Pioneer was 60 and Hess is just a notch under  60 billion.It just speaks to the assets that make sense for those two players, you know, Exxon has a certain culture, certain operations, the Permian is a big deal for them. This completes that part of their portfolio and their intentions, their goal, their stated goals that they've had for a long time anyway. So this kind of just fits right into that.And then with , because they're a little bit different, they have a little bit different strategic outlook. And one thing that's been noted is the Guyana assets were a big deal for them. And that's absolutely true. And also they're going to be in, you know, the basins there in the Rockies a little bit more with some of the assets they bought.So I just think it speaks to these large  working with their competencies, and so I think from an investment point of view is just a positive, I have, Exxon, Pioneer, I don't have much CVX, I have it represented in other ways. I'd always wished I had CVX. Dang it. I was just doing other things, but I do have some Hess , so that's good.So I just think it's the ideas, what we've talked about, even at the beginning of the year, remember I was talking about scale, efficiency, consolidation, all these things. And it makes sense in this environment where inflation is higher. You've got to get those costs down. And this is one way to do it. So, I think it makes a lot of sense.And the other thing I'll note is just that, you know, we've talked about this U.S. majors versus European majors point of view. I think investors in the market are voting with their feet, and with their pocketbooks. And so that is my big, big takeaway. And geopolitics supports it. Long-term economic growth and development supports it. So, do we see more deals coming down the pipeline then Probably. I imagine it's going to be happening all in the underbrush.Everything that has happened in the last year on the geopolitical front, which absolutely intersects with energy, I think it really speaks to the environment that we're in and the outlook ahead. And that, just the , it's a good bet, rightIt's a positive development. And it makes sense that there's consolidation because we are going to produce more efficiently in the future hydrocarbons, we are going to produce them more cleanly. And in fact, in these tie-ups, I think it's going to actually bode well for innovation in the future as well. So, I think it's a positive all around. Exports, I mean, this is becoming like an important story, it sounds like, or it's already an important story, but does this become the story then for energy markets, not only through the end of the year, but maybe 2024 as well Yeah, I think it's a part of the story, right  It's not the whole story. It's an important part of the story in looking at specific companies.You know, what are they able to export that has a decent growth trajectory ahead  And we know energy is positive, right  It's needed, but okay, well, will there be more shifts to energy trade routes  I mean, we've already had a huge shift once, what happened with Russia invading Ukraine. We know that Europe, stopped using, has been weaning off Russian pipeline gas, there's still LNG floating around, you know, but we have been exporting a lot more.I think the projection is, and I think we talked about this a couple of videos ago, just that I think we were exporting like   in the summers like 13 BCF a day, and it's projected in the next number of years to go up to maybe 30. So that's growth, that's consistent growth. It's a projection. It's a scenario.Same with natural gas liquids, ethane, propane, you know, all that. Crude, yes. But, there's a lot of different players in that space, right  And in different assets. So, there's a lot of nuance to the various firms as to who can do what, you know, not everybody can do it. So that's one thing.And so, I'd say be nuanced about it. It is a theme, you know, but you better understand your numbers and how things are moving around.Look at the production, look at who different players like  and the Permian, really great Permian player, you know. Who's solid, who's got solid production, that's got room to run in the future, that kind of thing as wellI mean, think about AI. I mean, oh, you know, when we had the  you know, right before Memorial Day, everyone was like, huh, AI, every tech company involved is going to  from AI. Woo, let's watch the  go way up. And it did, but now it's coming back down to earth, like, okay, who can really leverage enterprise AI  What aspect of AIEveryone's hitched their wagon to the marketing idea of AI, but certain firms can pull it off better than others. You know, it's the same thinking, same in energy, same . Again, I appreciate the time. Very insightful. I'm looking forward to what happens next.

SoFi Is Digging A Wider Moat,"A common refrain I still hear from people who do not think SoFi  is a good investment is that there is significant competition and that SoFi does not have a moat. If a business doesn't have a moat, itWith the rare exception of heavy patent protection, a moat takes time to dig and fill with water. Moats aren't just bestowed by the investing gods, they are built through exceptional execution. What determines whether SoFi will be  just a bank  or the  winner take most in the fintech space  is their execution.This leads to one of the core tenants of my examination of a company's moat. While the size of the moat is very important, sometimes what is more important is whether the moat is expanding or contracting. Is the business executing in such a way that their competitive advantages are expanding relative to their peers  Are they carving out a defensible niche and creating differentiated products that lead to better outcomes  Is there an inherent network effect being created or a superior brand being built  Those are hard questions to answer directly, but the results invariably show up in the numbers.SoFi CEO Anthony Noto is fond of saying that when he joined in 2018 that everyone was talking about being an all-in-one financial app, but that SoFi is the only company who has actually done it. However, up to this point, SoFi's moat has been mostly theoretical. They say a one-stop shop should allow for a better experience and cross selling. They argue that it will increase user engagement and drive greater lifetime value from their members. Essentially, it should make SoFi's results differentiated from their competitors. The data are showing that to be the case. The moat is expanding.SoFi has a focus on getting new members to move their direct deposit to SoFi. That is because the bank where you send your direct deposit is almost always your primary bank, and your primary bank is where you keep most of your money. Here is what was said on the earnings call about deposit growthBig deal, SoFi is getting a lot of deposits because it's offering a high APY on their savings account  4.5  at the time of writing , right  Ally  currently gives 4.25 , LendingClub  clocks in at 4.5 , Discover  is at 4.3 . SoFi and LendingClub are equal now, but LendingClub actually had higher APY than SoFi for the entirety of 2Q23. If it all came down to APY, LendingClub should have been the biggest winner, and all the others should have also seen significant deposit growth. Credit to Vadim Kotlarov for this graphic.Every neobank has seen deposit growth over the past year as they've been taking customers away from incumbent banks by offering higher APYs than the likes of JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , and Citigroup . However, peak deposit growth for most neobanks was 4Q22 and they've all seen a steep drop in growth thereafter. There is one exception. SoFi's deposit growth has continued to accelerate. LendingClub even saw deposits shrink in the last quarter despite offering higher rates that SoFi the entire quarter.When I see a definitive trend reversal like that across an entire industry with one outlier who bucks that trend, I take note. Especially when on the face of it there is no reason for it. It isn't like SoFi gave higher APY or even higher signup bonuses during these last two quarters than before. They didn't increase marketing spend, as we'll see in a second, they just outperformed the competition because of something innate about the product. This is a testament to the fact that their product is differentiating itself in other, less obvious ways. This is what a moat looks like.SoFi is paying less in customer acquisition costs  CAC  than they have in well over a year while simultaneously adding more members than they ever have before. As CEO Anthony Noto's described it in the earnings callI love that he said that this trend is continuing into Q3 as well. One quarter of lower CAC and high member adds is not definitive proof that they truly have turned a corner. However, the increase in brand awareness they highlighted in the earnings call also provides data that supports this trend. If CAC can stay low as quarterly new members climb, it would be another piece of evidence that the moat is growing.Last November I wrote that  , the two other fintech companies who operate primarily in the fintech lending space. All three of them, at the moment, rely on personal loans as their main source of revenue and income. They all compete for borrowers and selling loans to the same debt investors. I'll provide a little more nuance into the different business models below, but I think the performance of these three companies since that article proves my analysis at the time was prescient. The differentiation of SoFi from its competitors is only getting more obvious over time.All three of these fintech businesses have to deal with a supply and demand issues on two fronts. On one front, they are offering to lend money to those who want a personal loan. These potential customers may be trying to refinance high variable rate credit card debt into lower fixed rate personal loans, renovating their house, financing solar panels, or any other reason. I'll refer to this as borrower demand, and it is extremely strong right now. People are looking at their credit card statements, feeling the pain, and seeking to refinance that variable rate debt into a lower fixed rate.On the other side of the equation are debt investors. These are banks and asset managers such as hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, etc. These are the entities that buy loans from companies like SoFi, LendingClub, and Upstart. All three of these companies sell loans to these debt investors, and depend on them for liquidity and, to an extent, their revenue and profits. I'll refer to this as investor demand, and right now it is weak. As a result of the banking crisis, most banks are actively looking to offload assets like personal loans to decrease their risk profiles and increase liquidity. Bank demand for personal loans is very low and in fact they are selling loans. This results in excess supply of assets at the moment. Asset managers are happy to step in, but the increase in supply means that they can be very picky about the pricing and the quality of the loans they are purchasing. The result is that investor demand is very weak right now.I like to give context for my analysis, so let's briefly review the similarities and differences between SoFi, LendingClub, and UpstartUpstart's target market is near prime and subprime candidates whom Upstart believes are higher quality borrowers than their FICO score would indicate. They do not disclose the average FICO score of the loans they fund or refer to their partners. Upstart, for the most part, tries not to hold loans on the balance sheet. They use their machine learning algorithm to determine credit worthiness and approve or deny the loan at a given APR. The majority of their revenue comes from fees they charge up front for finding and approving the loan. They let someone else hold the loan, collect interest, and take the default risk.Upstart has two cohorts of buyers of their loans, partner banks and the asset managers mentioned above. Partner banks can use Upstart as the de facto credit check service for their own customers and also can house loans that Upstart approves through its platform. They grew originations like crazy during the zero interest rate policy  ZIRP  days. However, Upstart immediately ran into issues as soon as rates started to increase. Origination growth was only positive 1Q22 because Upstart stepped in and used their balance sheet to fund loans. While they have continued to use their balance sheet, it hasn't been enough and demand to buy their loans has completely collapsed. Originations plummeted for 4 straight quarters before seeing a slight uptick in 2Q23.LendingClub targets near-prime, prime, and prime plus customers who are serial users of credit. For loans they hold on their own balance sheet, as of 4Q22, the average FICO score was 729 and the average income was  116,000. The entire servicing portfolio, which includes loans they've sold to others, had an average FICO of 717 and average income of  113,000 at that same time. They stopped disclosing those numbers in 2023.LendingClub also has two cohorts for the loans they originate. The first is themselves. LendingClub is a bank and takes a portion of their loans and puts them in their  Loans Held for Investment   HFI  portfolio. These are loans that LendingClub intends to hold on their books through maturity. The remaining loans are sold on what they refer to as their marketplace, which is comprised of the same type of debt investors referred to above. So they have a pretty steady rate at which they add loans to their own HFI portfolio as the existing loans are paid off, and then a variable amount of loans they sell on top of that. The amount of variable loans they sell fluctuates, but right now it is limited by investor demand from their marketplace.In their , LendingClub warned that the marketplace demand might soften as rates rise. CEO Scott Sanborn explained,  For certain investors, their funding costs will move based on the forward curve, meaning where the fed is expected to go. These investors are seeking more yield to cover their increased costs.  Investor costs move with where people  rates to go, so their costs went up faster than the actual funds rates. LendingClub's loan pricing, by their own admission, lags the Fed Funds rate hikes by at least a few months. Investors were getting squeezed with higher costs now but the loans they were buying did not yet have higher interest rates to offset those costs.This is exactly what happened. During 3Q22, marketplace originations dropped 15  from  2.82B to  2.39B, correspondingly dropping their revenue from those loans from  213.8M to  181.2M. This drop in marketplace originations has continued every quarter for the past year. Part of the reason for the marketplace drop is because they keep the highest quality prime and prime plus loans their HFI portfolio and sell the lower quality prime and near prime loans to investors.Now let's move on to SoFi. SoFi employs a slightly different model to Upstart and LendingClub. Rather than have two separate cohorts for their loans, SoFi holds all originated loans on their own balance sheet for a period of time before selling them on to debt investors. They previously guided for 6-7 months holding period, but right now they've been holding them much longer because of the weakness in investor demand. In this way, SoFi's balance sheet acts more like a shock absorber, giving them liquidity and optionality. SoFi can absorb or release loans as needed. As CEO Anthony Noto put it previouslyRight now, the opportunity lies in gobbling up market share of their core target demographic - high-earning, high-quality customers not well served by the current banking system. As Upstart and LendingClub are slowing originations, SoFi has continued to increase them. In 1Q22, SoFi was only originating less than 2 3 the volume of personal loans as LendingClub and less than half the volume of Upstart. Now they are originating a little under double LendingClub and more than triple Upstart.SoFi's borrowers are also the most affluent and highest quality of the three companies. Their personal loan borrowers have an average FICO of 745 and an average income of  164,000. Furthermore, SoFi has actually been front-running the fed's interest rate hikes. They raised the APR they charge their borrowers faster than the Fed hiked rates and faster than their competitors. They could do this because of the the strong demand caused by their network effects. Raising rates faster than competitors and simultaneously increasing originations is a differentiated result. Their key underwriting variable is cash flow, because they want to make sure that borrowers have excess monthly cash flow to cover their loan payment.All three of these companies have a ton of borrower demand at the moment, so that does not explain the discrepancy in originations. SoFi is proving their lending moat is expanding in three ways  superior availability of funding, choosing resilient customers, and better underwriting.LC underwent origination growth in 2021 and 2022 after receiving their bank charter in December 2020. However, their marketplace originations have tanked in 2022 and 2023 because of rising rates and tightening credit as described above. They do not leave room on the balance sheet to absorb any fluctuations in investor demand, so marketplace originations boom and bust in real time with fluctuations in investor demand.Upstart has virtually no control over their funding sources, so they are almost completely dependent on the whims of the economic environment. LC has been able to maintain some stability in originations because they hold a portion in the bank to maturity and can replace those as they hit their term. When demand from banks and asset managers for new loans dries up, Upstart gets hit the hardest. They have had to give preferential pricing and take on extra risk to supplement volumes in hard times. It is not a durable business through a full market cycle. Upstart the most cyclical of the three businesses.SoFi got their bank charter in 1Q22. They have had significantly more flexibility to add loans to their balance sheet throughout 2022 and 2023 because they are the funding source. It's part of the plan to be vertically integrated across the entire business and own the whole process.SoFi's business model to hold loans on the balance sheet for a variable amount of time and then selling them when the economics make sense appears to have given them the most flexibility to combat the economic turmoil caused by the rapidly rising rate environment. It even compares favorably to LC's business model even though both have bank charters. The timing of the bank charter was also fortuitous, no doubt about it, and has allowed them to continue scaling because they had plenty of room on the balance sheet to hold their own loans. However, I would argue that the business model is still superior because of the extra flexibility it gives them. Business model and execution are part of SoFi's expanding moat.SoFi's decision to only loan to affluent and high quality borrowers is a part of the business model that makes them resilient. SoFi could easily have loosened credit standards in the easy money ZIRP days. They did not. Instead, they deliberately built a robust business model that can grow through an entire cycle. LC and Upstart leaned into lending to lower quality borrowers during the ZIRP days to boost growth, but as investor demand pulled back, they have been forced to move up the value chain to higher quality borrowers.SoFi was already focused on a higher quality pool of borrowers and has not seen their potential clientele shrink in the same way. In fact, SoFi's all-in-one platform has attracted record members. This has allowed them to grow originations more than 6x from  614M in 4Q20 to  3.7B in the most recent quarter without compromising on credit quality.SoFi chose an antifragile business model and it has resulted in consistent and sustainable growth through the significant headwinds that all three businesses have faced in the last year and a half. That means they are now far and away the market share leader in the fintech personal lending space, and even more so in their credit box. This gives them an advantage to maintain that position moving forward. When the credit cycle turns and demand returns, they will be in position to ramp originations to maintain their place as the leader, selling loans as required at a profit to facilitate the increasing volumes.SoFi's credit outcomes are demonstrably better. The first reason for this dovetails with their resilient clientele. Higher quality borrowers hold up better in adverse economic conditions. Deliberately targeting that cohort of borrowers was a choice that is now paying dividends for the business.Upstart publishes what they refer to as their Upstart Macro Index or UMI. It gives a value that predicts how many of their borrowers will default on their loans relative to historical norms. If default rates are normal, UMI is 1. If loans are overperforming because of the macro environment  e.g. the government gave out a bunch of stimulus checks , UMI is less than 1. If loans are underperforming  e.g. stimulus stops and inflation is at 40 year highs , the UMI is above 1. UMI has literally never been higher than it is today. Upstart's borrowers are defaulting 70  more often than normal.SoFi outperforming Upstart is to be expected as affluent customers are more resilient. That does not explain how SoFi is seeing lower defaults than before the pandemic. LC's borrowers are ostensibly in the same credit box at SoFi, yet LC borrowers defaults crossed over prepandemic levels in 1Q23. SoFi just reiterated again in their 2Q23 earnings call that their credit outcomes are  better than they were before the pandemic. Not only that but their default rates actually  between 1Q23 and 2Q23.I do not know of a single lender of any type - bank, fintech, or otherwise - who can make that same claim. SoFi's underwriting is best in class and leads to better credit outcomes. This is what a moat looks like. When SoFi's balance sheet does eventually fill, it stands to reason that their superior credit outcomes and higher rates charged on their loans should allow them to find buyers for their loans easier than competitors. This is a claim that cannot yet be proven with data, but we can track in the coming quarters. LC did mention in their earnings call that the one bright spot for investor demand is for their seasoned prime personal loans. That just so happens to be exactly the type of loans SoFi has in abundance.Exceptional companies differentiate themselves in the hard times. The data supports the argument that SoFi really is building a business that is better than its peers. SoFi has a robust business model built on a more resilient client base. They utilize superior underwriting. They are continuing to accelerate deposit growth. Essentially, they offer an all-in-one platform that is taking market share for banking and lending. That has led to better outcomes in hard times. I think the evidence makes those statements undeniably true. When the headwinds slow, differentiated results will continue to separate them from competitors. The moat is getting deeper and wider every quarter.

Okeanis Eco Tankers: Riding The Upcoming Crude Tanker Bonanza,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome ZY Capital as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Okeanis Eco Tankers   OSLO OET  is a young crude tanker owner among more established, bellwether names such as Euronav  and Frontline . It owns the most attractive fleet and is appropriately leveraged to capture the multi-year upcycle in charter rates as suggested by the almost non-existent orderbook. With consistent outperformance against benchmark rates, a fantastic dividend policy and significant management ownership, I believe OET is poised to outperform in the upcoming crude tanker bonanza.Crude tanker owners, and this should hold true for most of shipping, are atAnd this is exactly the cyclicality of shipping - owners are flush with cash at the height of the boom, ordering more ships which lead to oversupply and poor rates, incentivising scrapping which tightens supply and causes rates to skyrocket.Crude tankers are used to carry crude oil and dirty petroleum products, and are classified by their sizes. VLCCs  2 million barrels  are the largest of them all, followed by Suezmaxes  1 million  barrels  and Aframaxes  600,000 barrels . Larger vessels usually have better unit economics while smaller vessels have the flexibility to enter any port  canal due to the small draft.Tankers are usually chartered out for some form of  day rate , of which there are two A simple analogy would be that a time charter is like renting a car, whereas a spot charter is like taking a cab. As you can probably guess, time charters are more stable and more accurately reflect long-term outlook rather than short-term sentiment.It is also important to note that different owners have different percentage of their fleet on time versus spot charters, which can skew accounting revenue comparisons as spot charter rates include voyage-related expenses. Therefore, it is common to see these companies publish their time charter equivalent  TCE  earnings, which is essentially gross charter revenues net of any voyage-related expenses incurred.The  governs the major routes and publishes the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index which can be used to gauge how average rates have moved daily. Some major routes are also scrutinized traders, such as the TD3C which is a VLCC route between the Middle East and China, but that is a topic mostly for traders and charterers.Okeanis Eco Tankers was listed back in 2018 with some vessels under construction that have all been delivered since.Today, the company owns 6 Suezmaxes and 8 VLCCs, all of which are eco-designed and scrubber-equipped. It has a market capitalization of about US 750 million with an equivalent amount of long-term debt.In , the company reported  70.8k fleetwide TCE and  74.4 million in EBITDA. EPS was  1.60 and the company announced its decision to pay out the  1.60 in its entirety as a dividend, equivalent to an annualized yield of 28 .Ask anyone and they will probably tell you about the extreme cyclicality in shipping, like I've mentioned in the industry overview section above. The shipping industry collectively is not known for making the best capital allocation decisions, often overordering and directly contributing to the next crash in rates. See the  immediately after the exceptional year they had in 2021 for a recent example.Therefore, the supply of vessels is something shipping investors scrutinize to identify any long-term opportunities in the industry. One very important indicator is the orderbook as a   of the existing fleet which is the new supply entering the market. As it stands, the , a level we have not seen for decades, and it is getting everyone riled up.Of course, owners with excess cash can still place orders for new ships - these are necessary capital expenditures to maintain and grow their fleets. However, ordering has slowed down significantly for the following reasons., due to the sharp increase in raw material and labour costs. A VLCC that cost  90 million in just 2018 now costs over  130 million in today's market for a 50  increase. Even the most irresponsible owners would run the numbers and find that the assumptions required to justify such a purchase to be challenging.Shipping is usually a leveraged business  to the tune of 60-70  LTVs  and the interest rate environment has made ordering unsavoury. Financing costs comprise a significant cost of operating a ship - higher interest rates would further jack up the breakeven costs when combined with the high purchase price., with some 2 3s of shipyards shuttered in the aftermath of the poor market in the early 2010s. Whatever capacity is left has been taken up by the orders of large and complex ships like LNG LPG carriers as well as containerships. There are  through to 2026 hence owners are less willing to build new ships but rather purchase existing ones to bolster fleet capacity.Environmental regulations pose great uncertainty in shipping. With talks of getting to , the shipping industry has been experimenting with alternative fuels like ammonia and LNG but . Ships are multi-decade investments and owners are hesitant to place orders for newbuilds that become uncompetitive before their lifetime.All these external conditions pose headwinds for new ordering, and it is reflected in the orderbook. I am personally more inclined to trust these reasons over self-imposed restrictions by shipowners who are a fickle bunch.Scrapping refers to the retirement of vessels for their steel value at scrapyards. This is typically done when the vessel approaches the end of their useful life or when prevailing rates make it uneconomic to continue operating such vessels. This is the other side of the tanker supply picture.Vessels lose value rapidly as they age, a function of the competitive market as well as regulations requiring expensive special surveys to verify their seaworthiness every few years.In a regular market, scrapping occurs happens at the 20-year mark. Steel prices have also risen in recent years, with  if they head to the breakers today.However, scrapping activity has been muted recently due to the strong rate environment. Older vessels have the unsavoury  but profitable  option of carrying sanctioned oil from countries like Iran and Russia, also known as the , giving owners an alternative to continue operating their vessels.This market has reduced scrapping and 32  of the current tanker fleet is aged 16 years or more. With such an old fleet in operation, it just takes a small nudge for owners to start selling their tankers for scrap should the shadow trade demand fade.While supply is the dominant force in the tanker trade, I think that demand for oil transportation should also hold up in the near-term. This comes in the form of ton-miles which means that both volumes and distances can drive up demand for tankers.The concept of peak oil is unavoidable when deciding to invest in owners of tankers. I do not profess to be a specialist in this area and choose to defer to official forecasts of oil demand. The IEA has  by another 2  to  102mmbd and we are on track to reach those forecasts. That said, I don't believe the tanker market is reliant on any significant demand side tailwinds for us to enter another boom.This year, OPEC  has  which puts pressure on volumes transported. With Brent oil trading safely in excess of  80 bbl, I think that this should push OPEC  towards restoring production - otherwise they'd have sacrificed their oil revenues to the benefit of other producers.Another reason to be optimistic is the overall realization that exploration   production activity has to continue. Shell, BP and other oil majors have reversed their stances on fossil fuels and have allocated significant capex in this area. Offshore exploration is making a comeback especially around the Atlantic where most incremental supply is expected to come from. This is overall bullish for crude tankers because Atlantic barrels have to travel further to additional refinery capacity in the Far East, .So why OET compared to the other tanker owners  I have repeated the fact that  are young, eco-designed and scrubber-fitted  i.e., the most environmentally friendly . I dislike it when product attributes are rattled off without further explanation, so let me show you why this fleet is desirable.Young vessels have an edge as they are typically more seaworthy and hence cost less to insure. The benchmark age is around 15 years old, after which it becomes significantly less competitive when competing for charters. Every charter is a miniature market where charterers get to select the most appropriate vessel to carry their cargo, and age is often an important criterion to minimize the risk of loss of cargo at sea.OET's fleet profile is shown in the chart above. Any vessels that fall on the right of the red line are less competitive and positioned for scrapping, while vessels between the yellow and red lines will reach the 15 year old mark in the next 3 years. As you can see, OET's vessels are very young and should remain very attractive to charterers in the near to medium term.Eco-designed refers to vessels that are built around the early 2010s, specifically designed to be hydrodynamic. Design variations can range from bow shape to the type of engine and can result in  10 tons of fuel savings daily. This means thousands in fuel savings everyday - nothing to scoff at when we consider entire fleets operating all year round. allow owners to burn cheaper   HSFO  compared to the more expensive   VLSFO  as mandated by IMO. Owners had to make the decision to retrofit their vessels for  2-3 million with scrubbers to benefit from fuel cost savings. While the VLSFO-HSFO spread has come down to  100 ton, this was historically a very profitable decision with spreads exceeding  200 ton. OET opted to retrofit its whole fleet with scrubbers a few years ago and that has more than paid off the investment. Therefore, this acts as an additional layer of optionality for OET to capture the spread going forward.As you can see, having a young and decked out fleet like OET gives it an edge when competing for charters. Fuel savings  in both cost and volume  should also translate to premiums above the benchmark rates.Besides, OET's management has proven to be shrewd owners capable of repositioning their vessels opportunistically to capture better spot rates for their vessels. Each route is a mini-market which can see over underperformance versus the benchmark BDTI and you want owners who have the foresight to capture this premium. OET has consistently reported TCEs higher than its peers in the crude tanker segment.OET's management is aligned with investors as the  in the company. It has also stated that with minimal capex requirements, unattractive newbuild economics, its goal is to return as much cash to investors in the form of dividends. I believe this as they recently paid out 100  EPS in Q1 2023 for an annualized yield of almost 28 . This is actual cash returned to you, as a shareholder, rather than questionable choices like investing in new ships at cycle-high prices.As OET has positioned its fleet to be 100  on spot, the biggest risk is a catastrophic event that reduces crude oil transportation demand, which would see spot rates crater. While the global economy continues to flirt with recessionary indicators, I believe that short of another pandemic  knock on wood , risks are skewed to the upside. The biggest recessions have seen just minor dips in oil demand, while vessel supply is set to tighten even more.While the OPEC  cuts act as a near-term headwind, I do not see this having an outsized impact. Oil prices have been trending higher, and they will soon have to turn on the taps again  otherwise what was the point of all those cuts . There is also the medium-term view that incremental supply in the Atlantic will replace OPEC  barrels and further drive ton-mile demand for tankers.Another concern is the potential easing of Russian sanctions, which was a major driver of 2022's outstanding charter rates. I believe that OET is not fundamentally reliant on Russian sanctions because Russian ports cannot accommodate the larger vessel classes in OET's fleet. Sanctions have lifted Aframax charter rates to near all-time highs and I would also steer clear of owners reliant on the sanction situation.I value each of OET's tankers using a DCF of their earnings and add net interest-bearing debt to find its valuation on a P NAV basis. Key assumptions in my DCF valuation are in the table belowI arrived at a NAV share of NOK 285 which means that OET is trading at roughly 0.85x NAV at today's share price of NOK 253.5. I believe this is a good entry point for investors who want exposure to the upcoming crude tanker market, with an attractive fleet as well as sensible management that is creating shareholder value.I have also estimated P NAVs for OET's peers in the crude tanker space - as you can see, the stock trades in line with the industry average and below the more prominent names like Frontline, Euronav and DHT Holdings . This valuation gap does not reflect the true quality of OET's business. Management is arguably comparable to the bigger names, while its fleet is unrivalled on any metric, and this translates to outperformance in the charter rates it can command.I fully expect P NAVs to rise across the board and for the valuation gap between OET and the US-listed names to close as more investors pay attention to the crude tanker segment. Therefore, I think that OET deserves to trade at 1.0x P NAV or about NOK 285 per share.I believe that the supply and demand set-up in the crude tanker space is the best we've seen in decades, and we are at the cusp of another great cycle. OET, hands down, owns the most attractive fleet for exposure to the crude tanker market. With young vessels trading on spot, minimal capital requirements and a friendly shareholder policy, this means that you can count on significant dividends and capital appreciation in the next 2-3 years.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This continues the Biden administration s pattern of imposing limits on US drilling.A factor likely to exacerbate US oil price moves is Biden administration sales of  barrels of oil of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a significant reduction.

In its 2Q23 investor call, SLB's chief financial officer, Stephane Biguet, said the company had committed to return  2 billion to shareholders in 2023 between dividends and buybacks. At the current dividend rate, this would be about  1.4 billion in dividends and  600 million in buybacks.Book value per share is  13.09, less than a quarter of the current market value per share.Mean analyst rating is a 2.1, or  buy,  from 37 analysts, with at least one analyst calling the stock fairly valued.However, the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA is 13.8, above the level of 10.0 or less that would suggest a bargain.SLB s 3Q23 earnings call will be October 20, 2023.SLB s major medium-term exposure is to changes in oil and natural gas prices and thus changes in worldwide drilling budgets.As an international operator, it has political risk in every country in which it operates, including the US.SLB s dividend yield alone, excluding share repurchases or stock price appreciation, is not competitive with rates near or above 5  for 2-year Treasuries.Although the company has a share buyback program as well as a modest dividend, it is not recommended to dividend investors. Other companies are more generous.The company has a very good governance score, but the stock is not a bargain near its 52-week high, a ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA of 13.8, and a forward price earnings ratio of 16.0-19.7.However, SLB s stock has seen good appreciation. It has steadily paid down debt. Its growth prospects are exciting, particularly as large capital expenditures shift from North America onshore to international offshore, SLB s forte.And now, given the growing recognition of the  importance of hydrocarbons in the energy mix, I recommend SLB to growth investors interested in globally diversified, large-scale oilfield services.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

EOG Resources: One Of The Best Oil Stocks To Outperform The Market,"This morning, I was just working my way through some articles and charts I had saved.One of them is last week's Wall Street Journal update with the title This article featured a chart that perfectly confirms what I've communicated for roughly three years  energy shareholders are in an increasingly good spot.Below, we're looking at the effect of oil companies deciding to focus on shareholder distributions instead of accelerating production growth.Related to this, another  mentioned that the oil sector's decisions on cash utilization in the coming years have far-reaching implications for U.S. drivers and energy investors.As the chart above shows, in the past year, oil executives prioritized boosting stock prices through shareholder rewards rather than investing in new drilling.However, as rising fuel costs contribute to significant inflation, President Biden has called on oil companies to increase capacity, leading some to redirect investments toward expansion.While oil production is rising, production is still below pre-pandemic levels.On top of that, U.S. shale is losing momentum. So far, the Permian is the only basin expected to boost production until it might see peak production in 4Q24 - as I discussed in this   among many others .According to  on August 14  emphasis addedThis brings me to , a stock I've been bullish on for a while. Almost three months ago, I wrote an  titled . Since then, EOG shares have increased 14.4 , beating the market by roughly 13 points.I believe that EOG is poised to reach new all-time highs soon, boosted by the oil bull case. The company also continues to confirm the bull case, as it has deep reserves, efficient production, a healthy balance sheet, and dedication to letting shareholders benefit from this through consistent dividend growth and special dividends.In this article, we'll discuss all of this and more.So, let's get to itIn light of oil price developments, I believe in buying high-quality oil companies with deep reserves and efficient operations.While buying distressed players is certainly an option, I am looking for well-established companies that do not have major M A risks in an environment of high Tier 1 depletion risks. It's why I own Canadian Natural Resources , which has more than 30 years' worth of inventory.It's also why I like EOG.EOG has more than 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. This year, the company is expected to produce 986 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Roughly half of this consists of oil. This gives the company roughly 11 years of high-quality reserves without any new discoveries. That's a solid number, setting it apart from a lot of peers.I also want companies with efficient operations, not companies that will become efficient eventually. Companies with efficient operations tend to be able to generate positive free cash flow even at subdued oil prices.At elevated prices, these companies turn into cash cows.Companies that have healthy balance sheets on top of everything else tend to let shareholders benefit by distributing almost all of their free cash flow, which is great for shareholders.While opinions differ, I prefer companies that use special dividends to get rid of cash. Special dividends keep companies flexible and allow investors to benefit from direct cash flows instead of indirect distributions through buybacks.Headquartered in Houston, Texas, EOG has major operations in the United States and Trinidad and Tobago.In the U.S., EOG is actively investing in five premium basins, a record number for the company. The investments are focused on high-return projects that contribute to lower breakeven costs and higher margins.In the second quarter earnings call, EOG explained that its assets in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo, and South Texas Dorado plays are all delivering positive results.Well productivity and cost performance across the portfolio are meeting or exceeding expectations.Furthermore, continuous investment, development, and innovation are driving consistent execution. Technology and innovation efforts are also lowering well costs and exploration and development costs, contributing to overall cost reduction and emissions reduction goals.For example, oil production saw a 3  year-on-year increase, and total production grew by 5 . Notably, despite the industry's inflation, per unit cash operating costs remained stable compared to the prior-year quarter.Over the past 12 months, the Return on Capital Employed was at an impressive 29 , considering an average WTI oil price of  81 and a Henry Hub natural gas price of approximately  5.Also, using the data below, we see that the company's ROCE is twice as high as it was back in 2014, using the same oil price  slightly higher natural gas prices . This shows that advanced operations have resulted in significant benefits.With regard to my oil comments in the introduction, EOG is as upbeat as I am.During its earnings call, the company made clear that it anticipates continued performance gains supported by strong market fundamentals.For North American natural gas, recent price increases are attributed to reduced drilling and increased demand from power generation and LNG exports.This trend is expected to lead to a balanced supply and demand environment toward the end of the year and into 2024.Hence, the company maintains a positive outlook on the long-term natural gas story, driven by LNG project approvals and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast.The company used the 2Q23 earnings call to announce its intention to return  3.1 billion  4  of its market cap  to shareholders in 2023, representing about 67  of the estimated 2023 cash flow, based on a  75 oil price.This commitment exceeded the target minimum return of 60 .EOG's regular dividend, the cornerstone of its value proposition, currently accounts for the majority of the  3.1 billion cash return to shareholders for the year.The company emphasized its sustainable and growing regular dividend, which has never been cut or suspended, as its first priority for returning cash. The current regular dividend yield is 2.5 .EOG also employed special dividends and share buybacks to provide additional returns to shareholders based on market conditions. These special dividends are visible in the chart below.In the first half of 2023, the company had already deployed over  600 million for opportunistic share repurchases during periods of increased market volatility.Bear in mind that repurchases are opportunistic. In other words, if EOG's shares were to reach highly unfavorable levels, management would likely use special dividends to distribute cash.The company has an A- credit rating, which is one of the best ratings in the industry.If oil prices remain elevated, I do not rule out high single-digit percentage dividend payments.Furthermore, thanks to its efficient operations, deep reserves, healthy balance sheet, and commitment to distributing more than 60  of its free cash flow, EOG shares are doing very well.Over the past three years, EOG shares have returned 251 , outperforming their exploration   production peers, the energy ETF , and the S P 500.Given my view on oil and gas, I expect EOG to keep outperforming its peers and the market.The only reason why I do not own EOG is that I already own multiple oil stocks that account for roughly 20  of my portfolio. If I were to diversify further, EOG would make the cut.In this article, I delved into the dynamic landscape of the energy sector, highlighting the strategic shift of oil companies towards prioritizing shareholder distributions over rapid production growth.EOG, with its extensive reserves, operational efficiency, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends, is one of the best ways to play the bullish oil case.The company's commitment to prioritizing shareholder value has yielded impressive returns, outperforming peers, energy ETFs, and the broader market.As oil dynamics evolve, EOG's prudent approach could likely sustain its outperformance, making it one of my top plays in the industry.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

U.S. Real Estate Sector Fall 2023 Report: Four Quadrant Perspectives,"The apartment sector is starting to feel the effects of both capital market and economic headwinds. Demand has wavered but remains largely positive. However, it has not been strong enough to offset record levels of new apartment deliveries. Capital and liquidity constraints are also negatively affecting both pricing and transaction activity within the sector.Although the apartment sector remains among the favored asset classes for commercial real estate investors, it has not been immune to capital market disruptions and a deceleration in space market fundamentals. Year-over-year, sales volumes have declined by 67  through August. Although the sector continues to benefit from liquidity through government sponsored enterprises  GSEs , potential apartment buyers are still deterred by the rising cost of leverage, particularly at a time when private valuations are challenged.Elevated levels of supply brought to the market over the past two years are beginning to put pressure on rent growth, as demand struggles to keep up with the wave of construction deliveries. Traditionally high-growth markets that have seen over-supply, most notably in the Sunbelt, have seen a significant slow-down in rental rate growth, with some markets turning negative year-over-year. More mature markets in the Midwest and Northeast are leading the country, with growth down only slightly over 2022.Upward pressure in cap rates, IRRs, and exit caps has continued to filter through apartment valuations in the back half of 2023. Data through the middle of 2023 shows that the sector has seen values written down by 8.9  relative to their peak in Q2 of 2022, according to the NCREIF National Property Index  NPI . Slower economic growth projections through the end of 2023 and into 2024 could challenge valuation further, particularly in a higher interest rate environment.The positive news for the sector is that higher required yields, higher cost of debt capital, and reduced availability of construction debt have begun to put downward pressure on supply pipelines. Permits for multifamily units a good indicator of future supply  have declined by 18  through August on a year-over-year basis. Once the current supply is absorbed over the coming years, landlords should have a period with significantly reduced deliveries and increased pricing power.Apartment loans remain mostly attractive to lenders today, given overall still healthy property market fundamentals, but pressure from increasing interest rates has strained valuations, debt service coverage ratios, and other underwriting metrics in recent months. Reduced investment sales activity resulting from capital markets challenges, a reduction in refinancing requests, and tighter underwriting jointly led to a -51  reduction in multifamily lending volume during the first two quarters of 2023 compared to the prior year according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Nonetheless, broad-based lender interest in apartments paired with competitive pricing and enhanced liquidity GSEs continue to make multifamily lending rates the lowest of all property sectors. Insurance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are routinely offering rates near 6  for 55  to 65  loan-to-value  LTV  senior apartment loans secured by average to above-average quality apartments.Apartment REITs have slightly outperformed the REIT index year-to-date in 2023, with coastal focused REITs leading the way. Increasing numbers of new deliveries and slowing cross-state migration have pressured Sunbelt-focused companies, with negative market rent growth reported in some recent updates.On the other hand, limited new supply, continued return to office recovery, and the lack of recession impacts  following higher profile layoffs in the technology sector  have supported the positive, albeit decelerated, fundamentals reported by the coastal REITs. These trends are expected to continue into 2024 and potentially beyond until elevated supply in the Sunbelt is better absorbed. Following modest year-to-date returns, apartment REITs continue to trade near a 15  discount to NAV, which is slightly larger than the average for other sectors.The GSEs continue to be a dominant lender in the multifamily space with  150 billion of approved lending capacity. Combined agency issuance has been constrained by low transaction volumes. While much smaller in scale, multifamily exposure in conduit and single-asset single-borrower  SASB  CMBS is significant at roughly  55 billion outstanding. Loan performance has remained very strong in fixed rate, as the conduit multifamily delinquency rate is at 1.0 , its lowest level in 15 years. Similarly, the agency delinquency rate is only 0.2 .Some weakness is emerging in floating rate SASB loans underwritten at tight debt yields when interest rates were extremely low. Rising rates have resulted in large increases in debt service burdens, cooling prospects for net operating income  NOI  growth, and valuation challenges that have resulted in the SASB multifamily delinquency rate rising to 3.0 . Overall, multifamily remains an in-favor sector within CMBS given historical NOI growth, slowing construction starts, poor single-family affordability, and consumeroriented credit exposure.The hotel sector remains in good shape following its recovery from the pandemic. Occupancy rates are within equilibrium ranges and RevPAR growth on a 12-month trailing basis has continued to show solid improvement. There are emerging signs, however, that the sector is beginning to show signs of slowing. The pace of demand and RevPAR improvements on a 3-month trailing basis have both begun to slow. Declines in both business travel and consumer sentiment will likely dim the outlook for income growth as economic uncertainty and a slower-thananticipated return to office will continue to provide headwinds for the sector.On a positive note, supply-side pressure remains in check and is expected to remain muted. High borrowing costs and a lack of ample funding will conspire to keep development pipelines in check. This should help the sector remain on an even keel despite the growing concern of a recession in the next 12months.Although RevPAR has grown in 2023, its rate of growth has decelerated while hotels face increasing prices for labor, insurance, and other expenses. Consequently, lender appetite for hotel loans has also waned in 2023, with the volume of hotel loans originating during the first half of 2023 down by 20  compared to the first half of 2022 based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Debt funds remain a primary source of capital for hotel financings.Lodging REITs underperformed other property sectors year-to-date due to weaker demand from leisure travelers, partially offset by an acceleration in business and urban hotel demand. Throughout the summer, luxury resorts and leisure destinations saw weaker demand as many travelers chose to vacation abroad, particularly in Europe. This led to lower nightly rates in markets that previously benefited from pentup demand throughout the pandemic. The recovery in corporate travel accelerated with urban hotels narrowing their underperformance relative to leisure properties, driven by increases in group demand. Corporate transient travel remains weaker than expected at this time due to still sluggish return-tooffice trends.Throughout earnings season, lodging REITs delivered underwhelming results as revenue per available room  RevPAR  was negatively impacted by decelerating leisure demand while higher operating expenses  particularly wages resulted in weaker-than-expected profitability. RevPAR in recent months has grown in the 1  to 3  range compared with 2022, which is a meaningful slowdown in growth since the start of the year, reflecting tougher RevPAR comparisons. Lodging REITs are trading at 15  to 20  discounts to NAV estimates, a larger magnitude than what is seen across most other REIT sectors, reflecting the uncertainty that a potential recession may have on both consumer and business travel demand.Despite a slowdown in demand from post-COVID highs, hotel operations have continued to show solid performance with loan performance following suit. The conduit hotel delinquency rate peaked near 20  in July of 2020 and now stands at 4.8 , just 1  higher than the overall conduit delinquency rate. Leisure travel initially spurred a strong recovery in vacation destination markets with business travel recovering in turn. Smith Travel Research reports that RevPAR for the 28 days ending September 15, 2023, is up 10  relative to the same pre-COVID period in 2019. Hotel operators have grown RevPAR by raising average daily rates, while occupancies are lower than four years ago which is especially prevalent in higher-end categories. RevPAR growth appears to be leveling out yearover-year as consumers have mostly burned through excess savings.CMBS issuances in 2020-2021 included very little hotel exposure due to underwriting challenges and investor skepticism. As fundamentals have improved, hotel loan contributions have grown and now stand at 10  of total conduit and over 26  of SASB collateral issued year-to-date, showing that capital is available for better-positioned properties. While the recent macro trends have been supportive, hotel performance is highly correlated to economic growth and would be negatively impacted by recession, warranting a conservative approach to underwriting and a forward-looking credit assessment.The industrial sector remains in good condition, but headwinds to both market fundamentals and investment performance continue to mount. Demand has slowed in 2023, reverting to its pre-pandemic norms, while high levels of new supply have already begun to push vacancy rates upward. Longer term, higher interest rates and more restrictive debt capital will slow the pace of new supply helping steady thesector.Industrial market fundamentals are beginning to moderate, with positive but slowing net absorption, which is more in line with pre-pandemic norms. Year-over-year rent growth is still healthy at 7.7  as of mid-year 2023 but has normalized from a peak of 11.5  a year ago. The national vacancy rate has risen for the fourth consecutive quarter, which will cause rent growth to moderate further into 2024.Industrial occupiers are exercising caution as fears that the current high-interest rate environment will trigger a recession. Weaker retail sales figures and reports of consumers trading down have also forced third-party logistics as well as e-commerce and brick and mortar retailers to rethink their near-term strategies. Consequently, they have pulled back on growing inventories that they had accumulated during 2021 and into 2022.Despite solid fundamentals and income growth, the industrial sector has not been immune to capital market headwinds. High interest rates and restrictive debt capital are putting further downward pressure on valuations, largely due to the still low nominal cap rates, discount rates, and exit cap rates prevalent within the sector. As a result, transaction volume has continued to decline, posting a total of  46.9 billion through the first eight months of 2023, down 53  from last year s pace.Lenders continue to view industrial along with multifamily as a preferred property sector, although the volume of available industrial loans has also suffered because of changing capital market conditions and lower investment sales activity. The volume of industrial loans made during the first half of 2023 declined by 65  versus the same period in 2022 according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Many lenders  relative under-exposure to the property sector, concerns regarding some other property types  particularly office , and reasonably robust industrial demand forecasts have fueled lender appetite for debt secured by core industrial properties. Lenders today frequently offer industrial loan interest rates very near the levels offered for prime multifamily properties, with LTVs commonly up to 60 . Lenders also require less structure  e.g., escrows and letters of credit  for potential future re-tenanting costs at industrial properties than for loans secured by most other property types.Industrial REITs have outperformed the broader REIT index year-to-date. Fundamentals for the sector remain generally healthy but conditions have normalized relative to recent years. Rent growth has moderated with REITs generally expecting 5  to 10  growth for the year in most markets. Southern California has been the most topical market in recent months, as conditions are decelerating faster than elsewhere, causing several REITs to slightly dial back overall rent growth expectations for the year. Key drivers include West Coast port issues and rent fatigue which have dampened demand, especially for larger formatwarehouses.Despite modestly lower rent growth, REITs have beaten earnings expectations and raised guidance for the full year, driven by stronger leasing spreads, lower credit loss, and acquisitions. The outlook for next year is also positive as the supply and demand picture improves thanks to the sharp drop-off in development starts since late 2022. Supported by sizeable, embedded mark-to-market opportunities, the industrial sector is well-positioned to deliver above-average earnings growth in the intermediate term. The industrial sector is trading at a mid-to-high single-digit discount to consensus NAV, which is in line with other REITs.Industrial loans currently carry the lowest delinquency rate within the CMBS universe and continue to be viewed positively, especially relative to office, retail, and hotel exposures. This view is supported by the current economic outlook, space market fundamentals, and availability of capital. The CMBS SASB market provided over  35 billion of floating rate debt to industrial owners from 2020-2022, offering an efficient source of financing for very large portfoliodeals.More recently, the significant increase in floating rates has made these financings relatively unattractive to borrowers, and the pace of SASB industrial issuance has fallen dramatically. One dynamic to watch is the potential for borrowers to refinance existing floating rate loans into new fixed rate loans, given the inverted yield curve and recent tightening in SASB creditspreads.In the conduit space, year-to-date industrial allocations within issuances have grown to three times the historical average, a positive for diversification. Conduit CMBS industrial loans are generally smaller than the large SASB deals and in some instances, exhibit exposure to tertiary locations, less functional layouts, and non-investment grade tenancy  often via sale and lease backs . Because of this, underwriting metrics for conduit industrial loans have typically been more conservative than SASB industrial loans. Overall, historically strong NOI growth, relatively durable cash flows, and positive investor sentiment should benefit the space.The office sector remains vexed by subpar workplace attendance and still weakening market fundamentals. Net absorption continues to decline, and the national vacancy rate is as high as it has been since the early 1990s, when the sector faced a supply overhang due to excess new development. Capital markets have ground to a halt, and lending is scant due to uncertainty in the sector and exposure risk on the part of banks and life companies.Office remains the most challenged property sector today. Headwinds are stemming from both capital and space markets. Fundamentals have eroded further throughout 2023, with nearly every market across the country experiencing negative net absorption and rising vacancy rates. The sector could face additional challenges from slower economic growth that would undermine office-using job growth, which up to this point has been unflagging.Despite stricter return to work policies, office attendance has been stubbornly flat. Physical office occupancy across the top 10 U.S. cities remains well below pre-COVID levels and has not increased materially since reaching a post-pandemic peak in January of approximately 50 , where it still stands as of mid-September. In-office attendance remains highest in sunbelt metros such as Austin and Houston, which are seeing attendance in the 60  range, while San Jose and San Francisco are in the low 40  range.Progress within capital markets remains negligible. Investors are continuing to require higher yields while debt capital remains difficult to find in the best of situations. In many cases, traditional bank and life company lenders are focused on addressing upcoming maturities within their current portfolios, severely limiting the availability of new office financing and forcing some sellers to provide financing to clear office trades. Consequently, transaction volume is down 68  in 2023 on a year-to-date basis through August.Few lenders are willing to finance office properties today, even on the most conservative basis, due to weak property market fundamentals and existing portfolio exposures. Some CMBS conduits will finance office properties that feature a combination of favorable tenancy, longer remaining weighted average lease terms, strong physical utilization of space, healthy rent collection experience, and conformance with emerging design preferences. However, even then capital is quite limited. Certain debt funds have expressed a willingness to provide loans for office properties, although their required yields are typically greater than the properties  existing economics willsupport.Most office financing today involves existing lenders refinancing their own debt or sellers  sometimes banks  providing seller financing in connection with a disposition. The volume of office loans made during the first half of 2023 was down 69  compared with the same period in the prior year, based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, with very few truly new office loans made.Office REITs have had a rollercoaster year but continue to underperform other REIT sectors. The group started the year strong on hopes of peaking interest rates, sold off sharply after the banking turmoil in March, and then rallied following a highprofile office sale in New York City  that featured attractive assumable financing  combined with growing market optimism for a soft landing. Stock market gyrations have been largely detached from fundamentals, which have remained weak throughout the year.Leasing continues to be well below historical levels and REITs have seen occupancy deteriorate steadily. While tenant demand remains muted, the biggest issue for the sector continues to be the availability and cost of debt funding. REITs have been able to refinance maturing debt, but rates are materially higher which has put significant pressure on earnings and has resulted in several dividend cuts. Office REITs trade at a 20  to 30  discount to consensus NAV, reflecting the challenging outlook.Office exposure is facing intense scrutiny as the sector continues to face secular headwinds. Conduit CMBS has historically averaged approximately 30  office exposure, however issuers have responded by limiting office exposure to approximately 20  in recently issued securitizations. Delinquency rates remained remarkably stable throughout the pandemic but have trended up this year from 1.9  to 3.4  for fixed rate conduit transactions. Long term leases, diversified rent rolls, and high underwritten debt service coverage ratios  DSCRs  help to significantly mitigate term default risk. However, refinance risk is elevated given NOI pressure, constrained capital markets, and higher interest rates.Floating rate SASB loans are much more exposed to near-term default risk given the significant increase in short rates and corresponding drop in DSCRs, which has led to several high-profile defaults and pushed the SASB office delinquency rate to 5.8 . Given the difficult refinance environment, CMBS servicers are working with borrowers by providing loan extensions in exchange for fresh equity contributions, cash flow sweeps, and other lender friendly requirements. This approach seeks to improve bondholder outcomes, although it does create timing uncertainty, which is adding to pricing concessions. Recently constructed class A office is performing quite well, exhibiting positive net absorption and significantly higher market rents. Importantly, nearly 50  of conduit CMBS office exposure is considered class A, a fact that is not reflected in highly elevated market risk premiums. Investors that can approach office exposure with a more discerning viewpoint are positioned to benefit from current pricing levels over the longer term.The retail sector, by most accounts, continues to outperform. Consumers have been resolute and market fundamentals are improving, unlike most other sectors at this stage in the real estate cycle. A strong job market and continued income growth have provided momentum, but there are signs that consumers may be starting to waver, which is a concern for larger shopping centers. Grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers will continue to outperform in the current environment but may come under some pressure with the specter of recession in the next 12 months.Retail market fundamentals have remained resilient thus far in 2023, with steady demand, limited store closures, and minimal new supply. The national vacancy rate has fallen to 4.2  and rent growth on a trailing 12-month basis is 3.2  year-to-date, according to CoStar. Fundamentals to date have been supported by strong hiring and wage growth, and a concomitant drawdown in pandemic stimulus-fueledspending.While retail has not been immune to capital market headwinds over the past 12 months, it has outperformed other property sectors on a relative basis according to the NFI-ODCE index. The strong relative outperformance reflects not only solid fundamentals but also the higher nominal valuation metrics coming into this period of repricing. Retail sales volume through August declined by 53  relative to the same period last year, which reflects decreased investor appetite for commercial real estate driven by higher interest rates, as well as a potential slowdown in consumer spending.Investor demand continues to favor well-located, grocery anchored neighborhood and community centers, reflecting strength of the operating fundamentals for that retail format and the perceived resilience of non-discretionary consumer spending in a weakening macroeconomic environment.The outlook for private equity retail remains murky. Despite strong operating fundamentals today, consumer resolve appears to be weakening. High inflation and retailer reports of consumers trading down suggest that spending trends are starting to moderate. This is a key area of concern, particularly across discretionary retail formats such as malls, power centers, and high street properties.Some traditional lenders have shown growing interest in neighborhood and community shopping centers with strong tenancy. Major grocers, creditworthy discounters, and creditworthy home improvement stores with significant remaining lease terms may find receptive lenders, although interest rates for even the highest quality retail properties remain perhaps 10 basis points greater than debt for similarly leveraged multifamily and industrial properties.Debt for high street properties, power centers, and lifestyle centers remains difficult to procure even at more modest leverage levels, and significant loan structure  e.g., escrows and amortization  is often required. Debt for regional malls remains unavailable for all but the very best assets with top operators. Lenders continue to focus heavily on tenant creditworthiness, tenant sales history, remaining weighted-average lease terms, and sponsor quality, with widely disparate loan terms offered.Shopping center REITs have underperformed the broader REIT sector year-to-date, while the performance of mall REITs has been roughly in line. Fundamentals for the retail sector remain healthy, with open-air shopping center REIT portfolios at record occupancy rates and improved pricing power. A modest pick-up in bankruptcy activity, particularly in the shopping center sector, has been worked through successfully. REITs have already made good progress backfilling vacancies, often at 10  to 30  higher rents, which compensates for the downtime and capex associated with re-leasing.The near-term outlook for the sector remains positive as retailer demand for space continues to be strong while there is limited supply on the horizon. However, the impact of a potential deterioration of retail sales due to a weaker economy, softer job market, depleted excess savings, and the resumption of student loan payments remains to be seen. This uncertainty is reflected in valuations with retail REITs trading at discounts of roughly 15  compared with consensus NAVs, a modestly wider discount than is available in other property types.Retail s image has recovered significantly from the pandemic era, fueled by a resilient consumer base, the spending drawdown in excess savings, and a robust jobs market. Store closures have slowed dramatically over the past two years, and the entertainmentoriented transformation of malls has gotten back on track post-COVID. In conjunction with conduit transaction office exposures falling in 2023, retail exposure has increased back towards historical averages at approximately 27 . Interestingly, once out-of-favor malls have grown to 13  of conduit issuance year-to-date relative to 3  in 2022, supported by generally positive sales trends along with conservative underwriting metrics of  2.0x DSCR and sub-50  LTV on average.Maturity stress from loans originated in 2012 and 2013 is still weighing on the conduit retail delinquency rate, which stands at 6.6 . CMBS servicers continue working with retail operators as loans approach maturity by providing loan extensions on performing properties, typically in exchange for fresh equity contributions. This approach seeks to maximize bondholder outcomes by keeping strong operators in place, while avoiding near-term foreclosure at a time when valuations are depressed. That said, note sales have recently been utilized by servicers as a more expeditious resolution strategy. Similar to the hotel sector, retail has benefited from the recent upside in economic activity. However, the health of the consumer and a potential pullback in spending need to be closely monitored for turning points.Homeownership is out of reach for an increasing number of Americans as mortgage rates reached 23-year highs in September and a lack of for-sale inventory persists. The combination of a strong labor market and tight for-sale inventories have bolstered home prices and will likely continue to do so in the coming quarters. Without significant relief in mortgage interest rates, the for-sale inventory is likely to stay low as locked-in owners are discouraged from listing. These factors should support future rent growth for single-family rentals as the gap between rent and ownership costs nears record levels.Consequently, tenant demand for scattered-site single-family rentals and build-for-rent remains strong, with fundamentals supported by demographics, limited supply, and challenged affordability, particularly in the for-purchase market. Capital markets have to-date been supported by growing institutional interest in the space, though upward pressure on cap rates remains evident in the singlefamily rental sector aswell.The decline in bank lending activity has had a large impact on the single-family rental debt market. Developers and institutional investors who own non-stabilized properties now often must seek debt fund capital for their financing needs, which greatly increases their cost of funds. For stabilized singlefamily rental properties, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain the dominant lenders in the market.The single-family rental sector meaningfully outperformed the REIT index thus far in 2023 as it continues to benefit from favorable affordability relative to the single-family-for-purchase market. Higher mortgage rates rising cost of homeownership, tight supply, and accelerating demographic growth are supporting single-family rental landlords  high occupancy, strong pricing power, and low turnover.Recent operational updates from the REITs have been positive and highlighted continued strength in fundamentals, particularly relative to multifamily. Additionally, prior concerns regarding property taxes and other expense items are viewed as manageable and are now better understood. Single-family rental REITs are trading at high-single-digit discounts to consensus NAV estimates, in line with the index.Demand within the sector remains white hot with the North American market experiencing a 32.9  increase in commissioned megawatt hours  MWH  on a year-over-year basis, according to datacenterHawk. Demand in Northern Virginia and Phoenix alone accounted for over half of all data center net absorption over the past 12 months, with the Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City markets also seeing year-over-year growth in excess of 25 . The largest demand drivers include the continuing growth of the cloud and the recent fervor around artificial intelligence , as users begin to deploy space for the training and use of the latest AI models.On the supply side of the market, concerns and uncertainty continue to cloud the outlook. The vacancy rate is now 3.34  and much of that space continues to be in small blocks under 5 MW, leaving little space for larger deployments, which tenants are looking for in the market today. Pricing and rental growth continue to remain strong, driven by the supply and demand fundamentals. Capital markets continue to be challenged by interest rate volatility.Private debt capital remains available for data center properties with long-term leases to investment grade tenants. The very large loan sizes associated with the property sector means that borrowers typically need to work with investment banks to arrange that financing. Funding terms and pricing are quite lenderfriendly today.Data center REITs have outperformed the broader index year-to-date, driven by an optimism that AI will provide significant tailwinds for the sector. Fundamentally, demand and supply in many key markets continue to look more favorable, which has provided an uplift to both rents and pricing. This is evidenced in REIT financial results for in-place portfolios as well as new leasing.Thematically, the stocks have particularly benefited from the positive market narrative around AI brought to the spotlight by impressive financial updates since May, and are further reinforced by positive channel checks indicating incremental data center capacity requirements. From a valuation perspective, data center REITs valuation multiples have been expanding year-to-date with the property type trading at premiums to NAVs and relative to other property types.Tenant demand is robust and leasing for the 20232024 school year outperformed expectations for both occupancy and rate. Tenant demand and rent increases may now be positioned to outperform traditional apartments over the near-term horizon.Despite strong fundamental performance, the student housing sector has not been immune to capital market headwinds. Higher interest rates and borrowing costs have forced many investors to the sidelines. Transaction volume through August totaled just  2.5 billion, representing a decline of 86  over the same period in 2022. We anticipate the same headwinds affecting other sectors to continue to affect capital flows toward the sector until investors have more clarity on the direction of interest rates.Life sciences has seen both capital market and space market fundamentals pull back in 2023. Venture capital funding, a key source of growth for life sciences companies, has become much scarcer during the year. As a result, tenant demand has moderated considerably for lab space, even in top life sciences markets like Boston and San Francisco.The lack of available debt capital has also impacted the sector s performance. Lender appetite for life science construction has especially slowed in 2023, putting many planned projects on hold due to economics that no longer pencil.Long term, fundamentals are likely to be most resilient in the education-centric key life sciences clusters of Boston-Cambridge, the Bay Area, the Raleigh-Durham Research Triangle, the Baltimore-D.C. corridor, and San Diego. We continue to believe that life sciences will remain a favorable sector with investors.Increased supply of life sciences space paired with slowing demand has reduced lender appetite for the sector over the past year. Certain insurance companies and CMBS lenders continue to pursue life sciences property financing on a conservative basis but are focusing heavily on weighted average remaining lease terms and business plans for the properties. Mortgage capital has clearly become scarcer for the property sector.Life sciences focused REITs underperformed broader index year-to-date, primarily due to supply concerns in many key markets. The amount of space under construction, in planning, or available in the sublease market has caused consternation, particularly as leasing activity and NOI growth have softened relative to last year.A slower demand environment appears at least partially impacted by incremental concerns surrounding the underlying tenant funding backdrop, as venture capital funds have been more sluggish in capital deployment and tenant IPO activity has also remained light. Additionally, as it relates to valuations, REITs with high life sciences exposure have seen meaningful contraction in valuation multiples and the respective stocks are trading at meaningful discountsto NAV.Life sciences properties represent a bright spot in the CMBS office landscape and have risen in prevalence, especially in the SASB market. Investors are currently requiring elevated risk premiums to compensate for anticipated office stress. While downside scenarios are concerning, risk-adjusted returns look attractive in select situations where market credit assumptions seem overly conservative.Investing involves risk, including possible loss of Principal.

Standard Lithium: A North American Lithium Play Still Far Out From First Revenues,"Investing in lithium has been on many investors' minds in the last few years as the necessity of it in the transition to renewables and EV vehicles is great. Lithium batteries have long been aBut there is a lack of revenues from the company as it is still in its early stages of operations. There has been solid progress on the back of the South West Arkansas lithium project commencing drilling programs. What has investors interested in SLI is the fact that they seem to have some ofThere is a notable and widespread effort to secure rare earth minerals supplies of China, particularly in Western countries. As industries increasingly shift towards renewable energy sources and the production of electric vehicles  EVs , the demand for various critical materials, including lithium, has surged. However, China still holds a dominant position in the lithium market, which poses a significant concern for Western countries due to the risk of overreliance on a single source.The transition towards renewable energy and EV has driven a substantial increase in the demand for lithium, a crucial component for battery production. With the EV growing at a rapid pace, the demand for lithium is expected to continue its upward trajectory, potentially leading to supply constraints and subsequent upswings in the commodity's price.In recent years, we have witnessed periodic fluctuations in the commodity price due to shifts in supply and demand dynamics. As the demand for EVs and renewable energy technologies continues to outpace initial expectations, the pressure on the lithium supply chain intensifies. This upward pressure on the commodity price may create challenges for industries reliant on lithium, as higher input costs could impact profitability and supply chain stability.Diversifying the sources of rare earth minerals, including lithium, has emerged as a strategic imperative for Western countries. Efforts to explore and develop sources of these critical materials are gaining momentum as a means to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly China. Furthermore, investing in recycling technologies and sustainable mining practices could play a pivotal role in mitigating supply constraints and alleviating the potential impact of future commodity price fluctuations.SLI has not yet disclosed the specific capital expenditure required for the construction of the commercial lithium plant or the resources allocated to support the Direct Lithium Extraction  DLE  technology. As such, there remains uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of this ambitious initiative. In light of this, it is reasonable to consider that the company might opt to raise additional capital through stock dilution to fund this critical project.Stock dilution, while a viable funding option, comes with its own set of considerations. It involves issuing new shares to raise capital, which in turn dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. As a result, the increased number of outstanding shares could potentially impact earnings per share and lead to a temporary downward pressure on the stock price.Where I think a lot of the priority for investors should be is the financial state of the business. Maintaining a strict capital allocation program is key here to properly execute the business plan and not risk having to significantly dilute shares to raise capital.The company has a broad set of projects that they manage and are developing. The total operating income for 2022 was a negative  30.5 million and the TTM has been improved to a negative  24 million instead. Looking at the cash position that SLI has right now it's sitting at  67 million as of the . This is creating a pretty scary situation I think as the operating income indicates that SLI has around 2 - 3 years left of funds only. So securing more capital from investors will be a key priority. A failure in doing so will likely send the stock price down.The hopes for SLI seem quite great given the market cap of  800 million without actually having generated any revenues yet. What I think is supporting the valuation is the fact that lithium prices are likely to grow substantially over the coming years and what SLI might be able to produce today will likely be far higher in 2030 for example. That is also creating a difficult situation for analysts as assessing the true value of SLI is very difficult. I tend to lean on a more risk-cautious side and don t want to overextend myself and make this company out to be a strong buy. Until we see profitability I wouldn't be an investor. It's an approach I bring with me to all investment opportunities and SLI is no different. But for the more risk-tolerant investor in 20 years SLI if they have successfully executed their plans will have likely produced a fantastic ROI.Investing into lithium has been a very hot topic and lithium battery makers have been getting a lot of hype as a result. Sometimes going with the more established companies is better or the miners produce the raw materials. Here investors are seeing SLI as such an opportunity.The market cap sits very high at  800 million without any revenue being generated yet. This is creating a pretty situation where investing based on fundamentals is impossible. SLI is a speculative investment I think and one that I would rather rate as a hold than buy for now.

Ciena: Path To Recovery But Undervalued By The Market,"Ciena Corporation  is a prominent global provider of networking solutions and services. Specializing in high-capacity network equipment, software, and services, CIEN plays a pivotal role in enabling high-speed data and communications networks for telecommunications providers, enterprises, data centers, and government agenciesCIEN's exceptional performance can be attributed to several pivotal factors. This includes the successful conversion of a substantial backlog stemming from supply constraints. Furthermore, CIEN's diverse revenue streams, spanning various sectors, underscored its broad market appeal.During recent discussions, CIEN emphasized the enduring demand for bandwidth fueled by transformative technologies, positioning the company to seize expanding market opportunities. Notably, CIEN's strong fundamentals stand out when compared to its peers, making it undervalued in comparison. Based on these considerations, I recommend a buy rating for CIEN.Since 2020, CIEN's revenue growth has been stagnant. The company encountered challenges mainly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted global supply chains and impacted customer demand. Furthermore, these supply chain disruptions affected the delivery of products. The competitive dynamics of the networking and telecommunications industry also played a role, with CIEN manoeuvring through this landscape. The company's 6-year revenue CAGR is approximately 4 . Regarding gross margins, CIEN has demonstrated stability, maintaining an average of approximately 44 . This consistency indicates that the company has been able to effectively manage its costs relative to its revenue over the period in question. Maintaining a consistent gross margin is a testament to CIEN's operational efficiency and effective cost management strategies.In its recent quarterly results, CIEN announced a robust revenue of  billion, reflecting a 23  year-over-year growth. This surge can be attributed to Ciena's substantial backlog from prior periods, a result of supply constraints. As the company converted this backlog into revenue, it also led to notable market share gains. The underlying demand drivers for their business continued to be strong, and there was a progressive alignment between supply and demand.Furthermore, CIEN's revenue streams, diversified across cloud providers, service providers, and non-telco entities, indicate a broad market appeal. The significant growth in direct cloud provider revenue of 39  and the diversification strategy reduce the company's dependency on any single segment, ensuring multiple avenues for growth. This adaptability and ability to tap into various market segments are crucial for navigating future market shifts and uncertainties.During the earnings call, CIEN emphasized the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth, driven by technological advancements such as 5G, cloud computing, and AI. This trend is not a fleeting one  it's expected to continue, positioning CIEN to further capitalize on this demand in the coming years. The ever-increasing need for bandwidth, combined with the broader technological trends, suggests a growing market for CIEN's solutions. As industries continue to digitize and rely more on cloud and AI solutions, this demand is set to rise, offering CIEN a vast landscape of opportunities.Strategically, CIEN's expansion with a major U.S. Tier 1 customer is poised to be a key driver of future revenue growth. Tier 1 customers are pivotal for businesses as they contribute substantial revenue, as evidenced by one that nearly reached the 10  threshold.This partnership, combined with the company's forward-thinking approach to sustainability, enhances its brand image and appeal. As the global emphasis on sustainability and environmental responsibility grows, CIEN's commitments in this area can serve as a significant advantage, ensuring compliance with future environmental regulations and appealing to eco-conscious partners and customers. Overall, CIEN s performance, combined with the insights from the earnings call, paints a promising picture of its outlook. The company seems well-positioned to capitalize on future market opportunities, driven by consistent bandwidth demand, strategic partnerships, and a diversified customer base.Based on my DCF model, I forecast CIEN's fair value to be  48.02. This valuation is underpinned by the company's impressive recent quarterly performance, which has benefited from the alleviation of supply constraints. Furthermore, the escalating demand for bandwidth, propelled by technological innovations, bodes well for future revenue growth, especially as industries increasingly transition to digital platforms and lean heavily on cloud and AI solutions. Additionally, CIEN's strategic partnership with a prominent Tier 1 service provider further solidifies its outlook for revenue expansion.Among the peers considered in this comparison are F5  and Extreme Networks . These peers exhibit a median forward P E multiple of 13.4x, along with a median expected revenue growth rate of approximately 10  for the next twelve months  NTM  and a Debt-to-Equity  D E  ratio of 119 .Now, shifting our focus to CIEN, its forward P E also stands at 13.4x. Furthermore, CIEN boasts an NTM revenue growth rate of   9  and maintains a D E ratio of 54 . While CIEN's NTM revenue growth rate aligns with the peer s median, it notably features a lower D E ratio. This leads me to believe that its forward P E multiple appears undervalued, and I expect its valuation to trend towards the peer s higher end of 14.6x. Using the 14.6x P E, the implied upside is 14 . Therefore, I recommend a buy rating for CIEN.One potential downside risk is that the current robust revenue growth, fueled by increasing demand and the alleviation of supply chain constraints, may prove to be short-lived and not indicative of a sustainable long-term competitive advantage, as CIEN believes. Another downside risk could be that the expansion with a major Tier 1 service provider may not yield as much market share or revenue as anticipated.In conclusion, CIEN's recent quarterly results reflect its strength in various aspects. The significant backlog resulting from supply constraints has contributed to its robust performance. Additionally, the consistent and growing demand for bandwidth, driven by technological advancements, positions CIEN well for the future. As industries increasingly embrace digitalization and rely on cloud and AI solutions, this demand is expected to continue rising.CIEN's diversified revenue streams reduce its reliance on any single segment, ensuring multiple growth opportunities. The strategic expansion with a major service provider not only strengthens its position for future revenue growth but further establishes its position to become a market leader.Moreover, the undervaluation of CIEN's valuation, which suggests an expected trend toward the peer s higher end, supports a buy rating for CIEN. These combined factors create a favourable outlook for the company's future prospects.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

TORM: The Company Has Strong Financials And Market Outlook For H2 2023,"Figure 1   TRMD s leverage conditionTo support the company s capability of higher growth and shareholder returns, it is worth noting that TORM has reached its highest free cash flow in recent years. The company s cash from operations surged to circa  820 million in TTM versus  502 million at the end of 2022, which aligned with  393 million of capital spending resulting in approximately  427 million of free cash flow. This improvement demonstrates the management s capability of generating stable distributions even in times of higher commodity prices  see Figure 2 . Moreover, TORM is going to pay a dividend payment of  1.5 per share, and based on their 82,500,000 outstanding shares, it will lead to approximately  124 million of distribution payment, which is easily self-funded by their free cash flow.Figure 2   TRMD s free cash flow  in millionsNotwithstanding a healthy financial position, the company expects to generate lower earnings at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter. In other words, by mid-August, they covered 74  of the third quarter at  30,534 per day, which shows lower rates than the second quarter  as a result of refinery maintenance, product stock draws and slightly lower demand for products.  However , we expect the markets to recover, and we expect a stronger fourth quarter.  The Figure 3 -After analyzing TORM s cash and leverage conditions, we realize that the company is in a healthy position to perform well even in periods of volatile commodity prices. Albeit the management declined their EBITDA generation  from  750-1,100 million for the end of 2023 due to the current fleet size, including published acquisitions and divestments of vessels, their stock valuation is still undervalued. As Figure 4 demonstrates, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. It is worth mentioning that during the last five years, the company s net debt level grew by 4.7  on average. However, as they have generated a good amount of free cash flow in the first half of 2023, their net debt level might decrease more if the management decided to direct the free cash flow to pay back its net debt.Figure 4   TRMD stock valuationIt is crucial to note that a high portion of TORM s revenue is from its product tanker fleet. As a result, even small volatility in supply and demand in this market and their impact on freight rates may significantly affect the company s cash flows and operations. Moreover, TRMD employs the majority of its vessels on spot voyage charters on short-term charters. As a result, it generates a significant portion of its revenues from the spot market. Therefore, the company needs to receive profitable spot charters, while the spot market is too volatile. Therefore, a sudden decrease in spot charter rates may adversely affect the company s profitability and ability to meet its obligations.OPEC  announcement regarding production cuts and its impact on higher commodity and refined products prices caused TORM stock price decline in the previous months. However, TORM s strong financial condition and stability protect the company from the volatility of commodity prices to a great extent. In addition, Europe s lower stockpile from their average levels and higher seasonality demand will bring upside to the product tanker market in the second half of 2023. Ultimately, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. When all is said and done, I believe that TORM stock is still a valuable investment decision.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Federal Reserve likely has more work to do, Dallas Fed's Lorie Logan says","The significantly lower inflation in recent months is encouraging. But lower inflation isn t necessarily low-enough inflation,  Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday in a speech..That means that Federal Reserve officials have to ask whether its current policy rateWhile the headline monthly inflation rate has been at  2.5  in the past couple of months, other measures that strip out volatile food and energy prices, show a higher level. The average core inflation rate over the past three months was 2.9  and the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation rate was 2.8  during that period.  These numbers indicate it is too soon to confidently say inflation will trend to 2  in a timely way,  Logan said.Similar to the moderating inflation, labor market conditions also show signs of a better balance in supply and demand. Still, the U.S. economy is adding, on average,  150K jobs per month, exceeding the number of workers entering the labor force.If stronger economic activity continues, it could lead to a resurgence in inflation,  Logan said. At the same time, she urged policymakers to proceed with caution.Tighter financial conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC. And there are risks to doing both too little and too much,  she said. Strong July economic data could be a blip.The Federal Open Market Committee skipped a rate increase in July,  and another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month.  But the Fed will be on watch to see if inflation resurges and use its tools as needed.The FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand, and we must not hesitate to use it as necessary. But we must also gather the necessary information to use our tools well,  she said.",57,2023-09-07T19:01:49.000-04:00
Microchip Technology: Business To Bite The Bullet For Weak H2 2024,"I am recommending a hold rating for Microchip Technology , as I expect the near-term  2H24  quarters to be very weak performing. The weak performance will certainly impact share price sentiment, especially if the downcycle impact isEmbedded control solutions, such as microcontrollers and memory products, are among MCHP's many specialties. After merging with Microsemi in 2018, MCHP was able to significantly increase its product offerings and market share. Because of this merger, MCHP's revenue jumped from around  3.4 billion before the merger to  8.4 billion in FY23, aMCHP saw a 17  increase in revenue in , totaling  2.29 billion. The company also reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 68.4  and non-GAAP EPS of  1.64. By division, MCHP's sales increased by 24  in the MCU sector to  1.31 billion, by 20  in the Analog sector to  695 million, and by -13  in the Others sector to  281 million.Based on my outlook on the business, I believe the business is at best fair valued in the near term. I am modeling a very generous assumption for FY24  flattish growth , giving MCHP the benefit that the bulk of normalization impact will come in 2H24. Suppose 2H24 negative decline nets off the positive 1H24 growth, I believe the stock is worth  75 at 13x forward PE. MCHP is currently trading at 13x forward PE, which I expect to remain at this level as the market should already be expecting a decline in the near term  management is effectively communicating to the investing community . However, I would note that the stock could see further downside if the normalization impact is a lot larger than what I expected  this is hard to quantify .MCHP is returning to a more typical supply and demand environment after several quarters of a robust backlog for microcontrollers, which served as a cushion during a period of slowing macroeconomic conditions. This means that deliveries will closely mirror consumer needs. Since shipments are currently adjusting to the lower demand in the market, I am pessimistic about the near future. In addition, many of MCHP's clients across different application sectors are sitting on unusually high stockpiles  refer to . As a result of all of these factors working together, I see MCHP in a situation where cyclical demand is low, customer inventory levels are high and is going to comp against an exceptionally successful period in the past few quarters. Also, with such strong and fast growth over the past few quarters, there is reason to believe that the downturn will be more severe than normal. If events play out as I expect, it could have a negative impact on investor sentiment in the second half of 2024.My belief above can be well inferred and seen in the 1Q24 results. In early June, management noticed a gradual decline in performance due to weaker-than-anticipated growth in China, the automotive and industrial sectors, and Europe. In line with their comments, management has provided forward guidance of a 1  sequential decline for 2Q24 and an even larger than seasonal sequential decline for 3Q24. Further confirmation of near-term weakness can be seen from the  that management attended. Note that the date of the conference is September 6, which means management already has 2 months' worth of data for 2Q24. At the conference, management restated their previous comments about the gloomy short-term demand outlook, pointing to the continuing slowdown in China and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. They also mentioned how customers still wanted to be pushed back, bookings were slow, and lead times were becoming more typical. Notably, management also reaffirmed that the December quarter is predicted to see a larger drop in revenue than is typical for the period. With this much information in the bag, I believe it is wise to avoid this incoming freight train and wait for a better time before investing.If you're one of the many investors betting on MCHP's ability to raise prices to compensate for a drop in volume, you might like to know that the company has been doing just that for the past few years. Management indicated at the tech conference that future prices may remain relatively unchanged. However, there are many knobs that management can turn, so I anticipate a smaller decline in earnings than revenue. Employee bonuses, which have been on an upward trend, were cited as a potential source of savings if the economic climate were to worsen.I think it is inevitable that revenue and earnings will fall from here. The potential upside risk is that the entire economy goes into a massive bull run for whatever reason, thereby driving up underlying demand. This would certainly push out the downcycle, leading to positive stock price momentum in the near term.In conclusion, I recommend a hold rating for MCHP due to my pessimistic outlook for its near-term performance in the second half of 2024. The company, which specializes in embedded control solutions, experienced a significant revenue increase after its merger with Microsemi in 2018 but is now facing challenges as it transitions to a more typical supply and demand environment. With lower demand in the market and many of MCHP's clients holding high levels of inventory, the company is likely to encounter a more severe downturn compared to typical cycles. Management's guidance and comments confirm this outlook.While there is a potential upside risk if the overall economy experiences a significant upturn, driving increased demand, I advise potential investors to stay on the sidelines for now and wait for more information on the depth of the downturn before considering investment.

"Pioneer Natural Resources: Gushing Cash, Selling Put Options Optimal","Pioneer Natural Resources  has been on a tear lately.Up more than 34  since mid-March, the mid-sized Oil   Gas production company has surged in price on the back of two impressive earnings reports, in addition to a resurgent underlying oil marketWhile we like the company and believe that management has done a good job steering the ship, the stock has gotten more expensive relative to itself historically, as well as against market peers.That's why, at the present moment, we think that selling put options on PXD stock is the most optimal way to trade this company.Selling puts allows investors to generate immediate income and have lower-volatility exposure to the stock, while retaining the opportunity to scoop up shares if they dip in price too precipitously.Today, we'll take a deeper look intoLet's dive in.As always, let's begin with the company's Financial Results.As we just mentioned, PXD recently reported a few solid quarters of earnings.Revenue fell earlier this year as 2022's hot oil market has cooled, but the company has continued to crank out estimate-beating EPS for the last several quartersIn Q1, PXD produced  5.21 in EPS vs. an estimate of  4.98.In Q2, they beat again, with reporting EPS of 4.49  25 cents above estimates.Interestingly, this performance came at a time of broader market uncertainty.In short, PXD outperformed in what was ostensibly a poor market for oil and its derivatives  here's what PXD management themselves about their end market opportunity for the first half of 2023While the company has outperformed expectations, which is a sign of solid management, cash conversion, and drilling efficiency, the company hasn't been immune to the slowdown.Zooming out, nominally, PXD's TTM revenue has fallen, and Q2 YoY revenue was down more than 33 . This dip has impacted cash flow, causing a noticeable dip in TTM FCF profitabilityWhile the outperformance is nice, there's only so many levers an oil company can pull when the market is fighting you.Time for some good news.Since PXD's last report, oil has picked back up in price, on the back of increased demand and continued supply snarls from the Ukraine Russia situation.Since the end of June, the liquid commodity has rallied more than 37Record demand and supply issues have led to , which bodes well for producers.Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration had the following to sayThis ongoing supply, demand, and inventory situation has led to a surge in oil stocks across the board, PXD included, as the outlook of  higher for longer  should lead to continued opportunities, especially for larger, competent drillersHowever, this has caused us some concern around the valuation.Nominally, many would call PXD 'cheap'. The company trades at 2.6x Revenue, 11x free cash flow, and sports net margins in the mid 20 'sHowever, as you can see from the graph above, PXD has gotten more expensive as of late. The company's sales multiple has expanded above the midpoint of the linear regression, and FCF is beginning to look uncompetitive with other oil peers, especially on the crucial FCF multipleTrading at 5.5x CF, the company is no longer a value gem  it's in the middle of the pack.This is something that Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system agrees with, as PXD is currently rated a 'D'Thus, when taken together, it's clear that PXD is a well-run company with significant opportunities ahead of it, as oil continues to rally and business conditions improve. However, the stock isn't a compelling value, and the dividend, at 2.06 , is quite low.What's the best way to trade itIn our view, the best way to take advantage of PXD is by using the stock as a solid underlying platform for selling put options.In case you're unaware, when you sell a put option, you're agreeing to buy the stock at a given price  the strike price , if the stock price finishes under the strike price.In return for the obligation of doing so, you earn a cash premium.Think of it like selling insurance on a stock - the stock goes up, you keep the cash. The stock goes sideways, you keep the cash. The stock goes down precipitously, you get to buy up shares at a significantly lower breakeven point vs. today's market.This solves our income dilemma, and our valuation dilemma, as a lower entry point would likely lead to a more attractive margin of safety.As a result, we like the December 15th,  215 strike put optionsThey're currently trading at  4.40, which represents a cash-on-cash return of 2.09 , or 9.6  annualized.With a 78  probability of worthlessness by option expiry, they seem like a great win-win way to play the stock.As always, there are some risks associated with a trade like this - chief among them the fact that the company is expected to report earnings on November 7th.This is before our option expires, and even if the stock does end up beating expectations, you never know how the market will  to those numbers.This risk profile is no different than simply owning the shares outright, but it's important to mention that put sellers, in some cases, may be forced to buy PXD stock above market depending on how the next 74 days go.All in all, we like the outlook for PXD, but we're not in love with the company's capital return policies or the mixed expensive valuation.Thus, we think selling put options is the best win-win to play the stock - either a solid cash premium earned, or a much better entry point into this medium term winner.If you enjoyed this article, be sure to share it with a friend who may also appreciate it.Cheers   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy Teladoc: AI Will Likely Spur Healthcare Deflation,"The first step in my investment process is to identify secular trends. One of the biggest secular trends on the planet is aging demographics.As populations get older, national healthcare expenses increase. The four largest economies, the United States, European Union, China and Japan areAnother secular trend, Artificial Intelligence, is the likely cure for rising healthcare costs. In testing AI diagnostic platforms, we are seeing AI significantly outperform doctors in diagnosis and prescribing treatment plans. Integrating AI with traditional medicine, will be the key to getting AI's full benefits. stands to be a leader in utilizing AI in bringing down healthcare costs. Its expansive data and reach, combined with AI, will make it aTeladoc shares are my top pick for best AI investment of the next year in general and in healthcare specifically. It is vital that Teladoc, and others, succeed in bringing deflation to the healthcare system. I think they will.There are three core problems in healthcare that are driving up prices.Healthcare inflation has outpaced the general consumer price index in the past four decades since the healthcare system was shifted away from non-profits in the 1980s.According to a  review of CPI data, Even if we had more non-profits, it still would not change the equation much. We need a solution that supersedes the more egregious supply and demand imbalances that are only getting worse. In addition, organizations need room to lower prices while roughly maintaining profits, i.e. higher margins.Implementation of AI could be a large part of the solutions. generative AI has the potential, and likelihood, of unleashing the next wave of productivity. I have described this to various professionals seeking input that the easiest way to think of AI is as a super assistant.Consider what it will be like in virtually any industry having ready answers and much of the grunt work done for you. Bankers can underwrite faster, writers can edit faster, doctors can diagnose faster and with greater accuracy.According to McKinsey, AI could reduce annual healthcare costs by a quarter trillion dollars per year imminently. I think over time that number becomes dramatically bigger with implementation and improvements to the process.Consider that the U.S. Federal Deficit sits at about  1.4 trillion right now. If AI can help reduce that, it will be incorporated over time.Here I will note that the train has already left the station. About two years ago, my then 93 year-old grandmother was rehabbing a broken hip. While still in the hospital, her rehabilitative nurse's  a traveling nurse  other core job was to incorporate AI into the processes at a large local hospital network.AI is coming to healthcare.Maybe the biggest benefit of AI for healthcare will be taking various data, such as symptoms, health history, genetics, diet, etc... and making the diagnosis and treatment plan process less time consuming. This will help with the labor shortage and potentially help hold the line on what is an out of control wage structure in nursing that has developed over the past decade.Here's an example, There are more uses of course from scheduling to information management to treatment coordination across different disciplines for folks treating multiple issues. This is exactly what medical systems and providers need to bring total spend down while maintaining margins high enough to support their profits.McKinsey goes on to suggest that the quarter trillion in imminent savings, with better adoption, could unlock nearly a trillion in savings per annum eventually. As Boomers retire and go on Medicare, not only will savings spurred by AI be helpful, it will be necessary to prevent the destruction of an already overburdened and too expensive system.There's no shortage of articles detailing the many ways that AI can assist in healthcare and help bring costs down dramatically. I invite you to search and read before being incredulous in the comments section that we can see healthcare deflation soon.Another angle that almost no one is considering for healthcare is the current litigation risk that doctors face.In today's society, litigation risk is so higher, that doctors are pushed to make the most minimalistic diagnosis and least intrusive treatment plan possible. So, it is not always that doctors don't have a good idea of what to do, but rather, they take the path least risky for themselves and their hospitals.If the use of AI becomes a standard in healthcare, it can be used to mitigate litigation risks. This is a massive upgrade to the efficiency of the healthcare system just on diagnosing and prescribing in fewer steps.Ultimately, the various ways that AI helps create deflation in healthcare will benefit both consumers and providers.Over the past decade, we have seen all of the major tech companies push into healthcare. It was big news when Amazon  then led by Jeff Bezos formed a coalition to find solutions for healthcare. Today, it is all of the big tech players.Teladoc and Microsoft Corporation  have been partners since Covid. They recently expanded their  even more. So much so, that I will make my first comment on the stock since the opening paragraphs. I think Teladoc is a potential takeover target for Microsoft if the government allows it. Either way, the integrations in their systems are very supportive for Teladoc.What McKinsey talked about above is the next step in Teladoc's use of Microsoft technology. The new collaboration will see Microsoft's Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services and the Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience integrated into Teladoc's systems.Teladoc expects a significant reduction in administrative work for doctors, nurses and systems. This is a margin expander for Teladoc. It is also an attraction for more hospitals, especially those not in large networks, to incorporate Teladoc.Already Teladoc does work for half of the Fortune 500, I can see their platform incorporating many more Russell 300 companies who look to manage their healthcare expenses.Consider what happens when Teladoc has doctors start using AI across the board versus just at a handful of top hospitals and nurses have such clear treatment plans that their work becomes more efficient. That's another driver for margins and sales.I think the most important financial numbers are the revenue and EBITDA jumps of the past yearThat's a big jump. Remember, Teladoc serves about half of the Fortune 500 companies, so they are no start up.While the company has had impressive growth, investors have been unhappy with profits. Well, that's been changing fast. Much like Zuckerberg's  year of efficiency  at  Meta Platforms, Inc. , Teladoc is improving margins, a shade over 70  in Q2. AI is a part of that and it's just getting started.I would also point to the international opportunity for Teladoc, which I think will be bigger than U.S. revenues at some point.That's 28  year-over-year international growth versus about 8  in the U.S. At that pace Teladoc would have a billion dollars in revenues internationally in a decade. Presuming U.S. growth slows somewhat, U.S. revenues will be about a billion in a decade as well. That's a spicey AI meatball at 70  or even 60  marginsThere will certainly be competition for Teladoc. The one that got the most attention recently was Amazon. At this point though, Amazon is far behind and deploying a system that is more direct to consumer.Amazon is not racing to get into hospitals right now. I am sure that will change at some point, but Teladoc has a significant head start.I also see Amazon as a bigger player in attracting small companies initially. In particular very small companies that use the Amazon platform for sales. That's where they have inroads already. In addition, I'm sure there's some type of  urgent care benefit  for Prime Members coming that might be tied into Amazon Pharmacy. Simply put, different animal than Teladoc.The cap on Teladoc's growth seems to be pretty far into the future at this point. We will see what the largest healthcare networks do. I suspect many will contract Teladoc and Microsoft for tech support while deploying private labeled systems as building from scratch is no easy chore when cost is considered. We'll see.I have shown simple charts in recent articles to get folks more comfortable with technical analysis. The easiest short cut is to use RSI over longer time frames to find oversold and overbought conditions to ramp up research and decision making  investors R D .Here's Teladoc on a monthly chartWhat you can see is that the stock has  round tripped  back to 5-year lows. You can also sort of see that monthly RSI is oversold. Here's a close upYou can see that recently RSI has just started to turn up from absolute oversold. if you believe in the fundamental story, then it is clearly in buy the dips territory.Let's switch over the weekly chart which measures at the end of each week instead of each month.The first thing that should jump out at you is the long basing period for TDOC. That's a sign of an impending rise if the business continues to do well.Next is that weekly RSI is on a pullback, which has to do with a generally weak market this month, but also the Amazon news, that I don't think really matters, but that retail chasers did.Next, look left. Way on the far left is the volume weighted interest. There is a lot of interest in this stock down at these price levels. Check your favorite 13F source and you'll see bigger buyers drifting in.Teladoc is set up for a big gain at some point. There's very little resistance for a price jump to climb well over  100 per share in the next few years. Big resistance first appears around  130 per share, again, look left.While there will be competition for AI applications in healthcare, Teladoc's first mover advantage and scale give it an edge. In addition, having Microsoft at its back, plus the ability to incorporate other technology as needed, I believe gives Teladoc a margin of safety from these price levels.Members are also selling cash-secured puts at different expiration dates and strike prices. By selling puts I am essentially setting limit prices below today's price and collecting premium. The premiums so far have been far above most dividend stocks.

Inflation Is Rapidly Receding - Except For Energy Prices,"The two major inflation indicators released last week were a bit  hotter  than expected, but that was mostly due to energy price increases. On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced that the Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 0.6  in August and 3.7  in the past 12 months, butVolatile food prices doubled August s 0.3  overall gains at 0.6 , but energy prices surged 5.6  and gasoline prices rose by double digits,  10.5 . The good news is that owners  equivalent rent rose only 0.3 , and 7.3  in the past 12 months, so it appears that shelter costs are finally moderating somewhat.Since higher energy prices are the major reason the CPI rose in August, I do not expect the Fed to raise rates at its forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  next week.On Thursday, the Labor Department announced that the Producer Price Index  PPI  rose 0.7  in August, substantially higher than the analysts  consensus estimate of 0.4 , but in the past 12 months, the PPI has risen just 1.6 , well below the Fed s 2  target rate.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI rose 0.2  in August and 2.2  in the past 12 months. Wholesale gasoline prices surged a whopping 20  in August, and overall wholesale energy prices rose by 10.5 . Meanwhile, wholesale food prices declined 0.5 .The other good news was that wholesale service costs only rose 0.2  in August, down from 0.5  in July.One other major report came out on Thursday, when the Commerce Department announced that Retail Sales rose 0.6  in August, which was much better than the economists  consensus estimate of a 0.1  increase.Excluding gas station sales, however, retail sales rose only 0.2 , so retail sales were also warped by rising energy prices. Also, July s strong retail sales gain was revised down to a 0.5  gain  from 0.7 .After the retail sales report and inflation indicators came out, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter GDP estimate to a  4.9  annual pace, down from its previous estimate of a  5.6  annual pace.The other big news last week was that the UAW agreed to strike last Friday, which could push the jobless rate above 4  for September. The UAW lowered its demand for a 40  pay increase over the next few years to 36 , but that remains too high for the Big 3.UAW President Shawn Fain repeated his mantra that  record profits mean record contracts.  The UAW has never gone on strike with all of the Big 3, so the real winner in this fight could be Mexico, which will now likely generate more vehicle production.In theory, a short strike   say two weeks or so   could help the Big 3 tighten their inventories and stop the excessive discounting of their massive inventories.At the end of August, Stellantis   Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep  had a 74-day inventory of vehicles, Ford  had a 64-day supply and GM  had a 50-day supply.  The industry average is 38 days.Meanwhile, the UAW is prepared to expand its strike locations, depending on how the bargaining progresses. UAW President Fain said,  This strategy will keep the companies guessing. It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining. And if we need to go all out, we will. Everything is on the table.  But any long strike would mostly help Mexico.On Friday, President Biden called on the Big 3 to share more of their profits with the UAW. Specifically, he said,  Auto companies have seen record profits, including in the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of UAW workers. Those record profits have not been shared fairly, in my view, with those workers.It will be interesting to see how the Big 3 respond, since they are not making money on their EVs, which the Biden Administration is mandating they make. Something has to give, so I suspect the Biden Administration just threw a big wrench into the UAW negotiations.s Editorial Board issued a scathing weekend opinion piece titled,  A UAW Strike Made in Washington,  subtitled   The underlying cause of the auto walkout is the Biden Administration s forced electric-vehicle transition.In addition to Mexico profiting from this strike, since it is making the Ford Mach-e and Chevrolet Equinox EVs, Tesla  is also a winner in the EV wars.The painful truth is that until the Big 3 can make money on EVs, the UAW is losing leverage. Since the Biden Administration is forcing the Big 3 to make unprofitable EVs, the UAW strike may be long and painful for all parties.Compounding the problem of the mandated EV production   becoming a massive glut   the had an interesting article entitled  The EV car crash is a warning for Europe s industrial transition.Essentially, this FT article discussed how the Munich Motor Show was dominated by Chinese brands, which offered double the EV models they offered in 2021.FT also discussed how China is selling quality EVs and is ahead of its European rivals, so as the EV transition continues, European manufacturers risk being left behind.There is no doubt that Chinese EVs have a big price advantage and will continue to capture market share, especially for low-priced EVs. I should also add that Tesla is exporting many of its Model 3 EVs, made in Shanghai with LFP batteries, to China to continue to capture market share.In the wake of the G20 meeting, there is also talk that Saudi Arabia wants to push crude oil prices up to  100 per barrel. Right now, global supply and demand are very fragile and any disruption, such as a Russian pipeline break or a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, could disrupt crude oil production and send crude oil prices up to  100. I should add that Arab light crude came close  100 per barrel last week.After Germany s August wind power auction only offered to develop 1.4 gigawatts of electricity, down from 1.6 gigawatts at its July auction, Britain failed to attract any bids on its latest offshore wind auction.Naturally, this is a massive setback for countries like Britain and Germany, which are striving to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Britain s Ed Miliband, commonly referred to ad Labor s  shadow climate secretary,  said that failing to secure any new offshore wind generating capacity is an  energy security disaster.The fact of the matter is that bidding on offshore wind projects remains weak, since the economics of wind energy are erratic, especially if there is a winter cold snap that damages wind turbines.It appears that the  green police  were not happy with the recent G20 meeting in India, since the  said that G20 leaders were  missing in action  on a timeline for ending fossil fuel use.The G20 nations account for about 80  of the world s greenhouse gas emissions. They did agree on a goal to triple renewable energy sources by 2030, but as Britain and Germany s wind auctions demonstrated, there is no reliable economic model to boost wind production, so the G20 may might not be able to meet such goals.Other technologies will certainly be feasible in future decades, such as satellites with massive solar sails that will be able to transmit solar energy from space, but we might also have to still use fossil fuels by then. Confused  We all are, since the planet, climate and space are all complex systems.China s industrial production rose 4.5  in August and was clearly boosted by higher vehicle production for export markets. The other surprising news from China was that retail sales rose 4.6  in August and were apparently aided by the summer travel season.Although some economic reports are not always reliable from China, economists were not questioning the data on industrial production and retail sales.The big news from the G20 was that Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, privately signaled that Italy is planning to exit the  Belt   Road  Initiative with China, which is a global infrastructure pact.Due to the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping missed the G20, there were plenty of rumblings that China is disengaging with the world. President Joe Biden said that China will not be invading Taiwan any time soon, since President Xi Jinping has to solve his domestic problems, like high youth unemployment.Inflation in the eurozone has dropped dramatically from a peak of 10.6  last year to 5.3  in August, but last Thursday, the European Central Bank  ECB  signaled that its continuing fight against inflation is more important than stimulating economic growth, since it raised its key interest rate 0.25  to 4 , the highest level in the 25-year history of the common European currency.Food and energy inflation in the eurozone are much more acute than in the U.S., but there is little their central banks can do to combat food and energy inflation, so I think the ECB may have made a mistake with its latest rate increase.The economies of Italy and Germany are based largely on exports, and due to China s recent economic woes, they are contracting this quarter and will likely drag the entire eurozone into a recession.This euro rate increase will make that outcome more likely, so Europe is sinking into a recession while China seems to be avoiding a recession, although you can never know how far Beijing can kick that can down the road..All content above represents the opinion of Louis Navellier of Navellier   Associates, Inc.

EMO: This CEF Has Strong Fundamentals And An Attractive Discount,"ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc.  is a closed-end fund that specializes in investing in various midstream corporations, master limited partnerships, and other energy infrastructure companies. This makes this fund one of the few ways to easily include master limitedThus, we can see that the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund compares reasonably well to its peers in terms of yield. This should prove to be at least satisfactory to most income-focused investors.As regular readers will likely recall, we last discussed this fund in mid-September, although that article was exclusive to subscribers and trial members. The  that I published on this fund publicly was released on May 17, 2023. That was well before energy prices started to tick up in mid-July, so there have obviously been quite a few changes to the market in which this fund primarily invests. We can actually see this by looking at the fund's performance, which has been substantially better than the broader S P 500 Index  since that article was publishedThe difference becomes even more stark when we consider the fact that this fund pays out a substantially higher yield than the S P 500 Index, which provides a boost to its overall investment return. When we consider this distribution, investors in the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund have made 12.26  over the past five months, compared to 3.60  for investors in the S P 500 Index. That is a pretty significant difference in results. Fortunately, there are some reasons to expect that this fund will continue to deliver very strong performance going forward, although perhaps not quite that strong.There have naturally been other changes to this fund beyond simply the improvements in the macroeconomic environment that we need to discuss in this article. Most importantly, the fund released an updated financial report that we can discuss. Therefore, let us investigate and see if this fund could still make sense for an income-focused portfolio today.According to the fund's , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a very high level of total return. This makes sense because this is a common equity fund, which is immediately apparent in the fact that 98.06  of the fund's assets are invested in common equityAs I have pointed out in numerous previous articles, common equity is by its very nature a total return vehicle. After all, investors typically purchase common equity because they want to receive an income in the form of dividends or distributions as well as benefit from capital gains as the issuing company grows and prospers with the passage of time.In the case of midstream companies and partnerships, a substantial portion of the investment return comes in the form of distributions and dividends. We can see this by looking at the price return against the total return of the Alerian MLP Index , which primarily tracks midstream partnerships. Here are the comparison figures for the past yearAs we can see, the shares of the index fund only appreciated by 11.93 , but investors in the fund actually realized a 21.31  gain on their investment. This implies that just under half of the total return that midstream partnerships provided to their shareholders during the past year was in the form of direct payments. In many years, the percentage of the total return provided by the distributions is higher than this. As such, we can assume that a substantial percentage of the total return of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund will be in the form of distributions from its assets as opposed to simple equity price appreciation.As regular readers are no doubt well aware, I have devoted a considerable amount of time and effort to discussing various midstream corporations and partnerships over the past several years. These reports were published both on my Investing Group and on the main Seeking Alpha site. As such, most readers should be familiar with the largest positions in the fund. Here they areI have discussed all of these companies except for Western Midstream Partners  and Plains GP Holdings  over the years. However, Plains GP Holdings is simply the general partner and manager of Plains All American Pipeline , which I have discussed quite often. As such, it should be quite familiar to most readers. Indeed, all of these companies should be reasonably familiar. That is nice because I should not have to point out that many of these are among the best companies in the industry.There is almost certainly one major change to this list that has occurred within the past few weeks, however. That is Magellan Midstream Partners, which recently completed a pending merger with ONEOK  and is no longer an independent company. As such, it is quite likely that ONEOK has probably replaced Magellan Midstream Partners since the end of August  the date that the fund last publicly updated its holdings . That is by no means certain, however, and it is possible that the fund sold off the ONEOK shares that it received in the merger in favor of something else. At the moment, we do not know exactly what the tenth company is among the fund's largest positions. This fund has an annual turnover of 60.00 , so it does a fair amount of trading, and it is certainly possible that it sold off the ONEOK shares.In a few recent articles, I have pointed out that there are signs that the American economy may be starting to slow down. For example, we are starting to see consumers beginning to get tired of their post-pandemic spending spree and cutting back. Citibank  that consumer spending on credit cards fell 11  in September, which represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop and the largest so far. When we consider that this period included the  back to school  season  typically a fairly large event for retail spending  was weaker than normal this year and prices have certainly not declined, this is a very clear sign that one of the last bastions of economic strength has crumbled. Fortunately, the companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are highly unlikely to be affected by economic weakness. This is due to the business model that these companies employ, which I discussed in a previous articleThis business model works so well to protect these companies against economic problems that even the COVID-19 lockdowns in the Spring of 2020 had no impact on most of their cash flows. While we did see several of these companies reduce their distributions in response to that event, that was simply because the capital markets did not want to touch anything related to the oil and gas industry. These companies simply cut their distributions in order to pay off their debt and become self-financing. As I have pointed out in many previous articles though, their cash flow was almost completely unaffected. It seems likely that the same would be the case in another economic downturn, such as what might be coming. As we will see in a moment, energy prices could increase going forward, which would put further pressure on consumers.As we already saw, the cash flows of the midstream companies in which the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund invests are not significantly impacted by energy prices. If they were, then these companies would not have handled the COVID-19 lockdowns as well as they did. However, their equity prices do still correlate with oil prices to a certain degree. It is not a perfect correlation, but we can still see one in this chartThis chart shows the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against the Alerian MLP Index in orange and the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund in blue over the past twelve months. We can see that crude oil prices are much more volatile, but for the most part increases in crude oil prices caused the price of both the fund and the index to increase and vice versa. Thus, the fundamentals of energy prices are still relevant to our discussion of this fund as an investment.Fortunately, the fundamentals of crude oil right now are very positive primarily because energy companies in aggregate have been underinvesting in productive capacity since 2015. There are several reasons for that, including various parties in the market refusing to provide energy prices, investor aversion towards fossil fuels, government incentives meant to promote renewable energy, and various other things. As a result of this underinvestment, crude oil production is not likely to be as high as it would have been had suitable amounts of capital been invested. This poses a problem because most sources right now expect that crude oil demand will not drop off nearly as rapidly as environmental activists and politicians believe. The truth is that renewable technology is nowhere near where we need it to be in order for it to work as a suitable replacement for hydrocarbons.As a result, the production of crude oil is likely to be lower than demand over the coming years. JPMorgan Chase recently predicted that the global demand for crude oil will be 1.1 million barrels above the production level by 2025 and 7.1 million barrels above the production level by 2030The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recently made similar statements. The organization's  stated that the energy industry needs to invest approximately  14 trillion into upstream, midstream, and downstream capacity by 2045 in order to avoid a catastrophic energy shortage. That is, to put it mildly, highly unlikely to happen considering that many politicians and activists are trying to curtail investment into productive capacity.There may be some readers who point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is simply talking up its own book with its statements about a mid-term shortage of oil. That is certainly possible, but private companies such as JPMorgan and Moody's are saying the exact same thing. Thus, it is something that we can probably take seriously.The laws of supply and demand imply that a shortage of crude oil would have the effect of raising crude oil prices. As we have already seen, there appears to be a correlation between the price performance of midstream companies, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund, and crude oil. Thus, there is reason to believe that this situation will have a positive effect on the share price of this fund over the mid-to-long term.As mentioned earlier in this article, the primary objective of the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is to provide its investors with a high level of total return. In order to accomplish this, the fund invests primarily in midstream companies and partnerships. These are companies that deliver a significant percentage of their total return in the form of direct payments to the shareholders. As a result, they tend to have high yields. For example, the Alerian MLP Index yields 8.13  at the current price. The ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund collects these distributions and pays them out to its own shareholders along with any capital gains that it manages to realize. As such, we can assume that this fund would have a fairly high distribution yield itself.That is certainly the case as the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund currently pays a quarterly distribution of  0.65 per share  2.60 per share annually , which gives it an 8.60  yield at the current price. This is a very reasonable yield for a fund like this and it is sufficiently high to appeal to any income-focused investor. Unfortunately, the fund has not been especially consistent with respect to its distribution over the years. As we can see here, it has had to make a few large cuts over its lifetime, although it has generally been boosting its distribution since 2020The fact that the fund has not obtained a perfect track record with its distribution could be something of a turn-off to investors who are seeking a safe and consistent source of income to use to pay their bills or finance their lifestyles. However, as I explained earlier in this article, several midstream companies cut their distributions in 2020 despite their cash flow remaining stable. In addition, companies in the industry saw their equity prices collapse. These two factors reduced the amount of money coming into the fund and forced it to take substantial unrealized losses. Thus, it makes sense that the fund had to cut in response to these events. Fortunately, we can see that it has been increasing its distribution now that the sector has largely recovered.Naturally, though, anyone who purchases the fund today will receive the current distribution at the current yield and will not be adversely affected by the distribution cuts that the fund was forced to impose in the past. As such, the biggest concern for investors today is how well the fund can sustain its current distribution. Let us investigate this.Fortunately, we do have a fairly recent document that we can consult for the purpose of our analysis. As of the time of writing, the fund's most recent  corresponds to the six-month period that ended on May 31, 2023. This is a newer report than the one that we had the last time that we discussed this fund, which is quite nice to see. After all, during the first half of this year, crude oil prices were generally much lower than they were in either 2022 or recently. This weighed somewhat on midstream stocks and likely made it much more difficult for the fund to earn capital gains than it experienced in 2022. This report will thus show us how the fund performed in such an environment, and seeing how a management team handles a challenging environment is a very important part of determining its overall skill. After all, anybody can make money in a raging bull market.During the six-month period, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund received  23,247,909 in dividends and distributions along with  178,049 from the money market funds storing its cash. The fund reported no interest during the period. One characteristic of midstream partnerships is that their distributions are not considered to be income to the fund, so the fund only had a total investment income of  4,936,584 during the period. This was not enough to cover the fund's expenses, and it ended up reporting a net investment loss of  5,316,691 over the course of six months. Obviously, that was nowhere near enough to pay any distribution, but the fund still handed out  13,682,401 to its shareholders. At first glance, this is almost certainly going to be very concerning.However, the fund does have other methods through which it can obtain the money that it needs to cover the distribution. For example, the fund received  18,787,159 in distributions from master limited partnerships during the period. That money was not considered to be income for tax purposes, but it still represents money coming into the fund. The fund also might have been able to get some capital gains that can be paid out. Unfortunately, it was not successful at this task as it only reported net realized gains of  8,290,562 but this was more than offset by  42,384,338 net unrealized losses. Overall, the fund's assets declined by  56,823,422 after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period. Thus, it failed to cover its distributions overall, which is worrying. However, the fund's net assets were still up over the trailing eighteen-month period. In short, the fund made enough money over the course of 2022 to cover all of its distributions for that year and make up the difference for the first half of 2023. Thus, the distribution is probably reasonably safe right now, especially considering that the past few months have given it the possibility of having more gains.As of October 6, 2023  the most recent date for which data is available as of the time of writing , the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund has a net asset value of  34.97 per share but the shares only trade for  31.17 each. As such, the fund's shares are currently trading at a 10.87  discount on net asset value. This is a very large discount, although it is nowhere near as attractive as the 12.91  discount that the shares have had on average over the past month. As such, it might be possible to obtain a better price by waiting a bit. However, realistically a double-digit discount is generally a reasonable price to pay for any fund, so the current price is probably acceptable if you want to own some shares.In conclusion, the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund is a reasonable way to play the midstream exposure without having to worry about the tax problems that can come along with owning master limited partnerships. This fund is structured as a corporation, so it handles all the tax issues on the fund level. The fund has delivered a respectable performance over the past several months, as it has beaten the S P 500 Index, and it seems likely that it will continue to do so due to the strong mid-term fundamentals for energy. The valuation is also reasonable right now. The biggest problem here is that the fund failed to cover its distribution during the first half of the year, but due to the very strong performance that it delivered in 2022, it is not straining to maintain the distribution. Overall, this fund might be worth considering for a portfolio today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

AGG And TLT: Real Yields Near ATH Reveal The Opportunity,"I believe there are numerous reasons to own long-term US Treasury bonds such as  and . While I will concentrate primarily on these three  Firstly, historical evidence is fairly plain and provides a straightforward perspective on whatThere are several crucial reasons why I chose the AGG and TLT for further analysis. As you can see in the table below, these are predominantly long-term bonds whose real yields have settled near their highest levels in the past 10 to 15 years, indicating my attraction to such a selection. AGG has a weighted average maturity of 8.52 years, an effective duration of 6.13 years, and a positive convexity of 0.65, according to .Due to the extremely long duration of TLT, every rate increase would be especially vulnerable. In spite of the fact that the weighted average yield to maturity is 25.21 years, the effective duration is 16.89 years and the convexity is positive at 3.8. Due to the positive convexity, a further increase in interest rates would be less painful than gains, providing the advantage to the long position based on a risk-reward approach.While I was once  on TLT  down -7  from the previous analysis, based on total return , I must confess that I was a little bit premature, despite being correct about inflation. However, the narrative of being long TLT was too speculative because I did not believe the Fed could raise as much as it did at the time. However, that is precisely what transpired, but we will investigate the most significant contributors to nominal yield to identify potential opportunities.You can see the contribution of nominal US30Y below, as well as the 30Y TIPS yield  real yield  and 30Y breakeven rates  market expectations for the annualized inflation rate for 30 years . As can be seen, real yields were the driving force in recent months, while inflation expectations remained relatively stable. Real yields are nearly at all-time highs, reflecting the greatest investment opportunity in years. Inflation expectations for 30 years are approximately 2.29 percent, which is above the long-term inflation target of about 2 percent.Considering 20-year and 10-year real yields, it appears that we are close to 2008 and 2009 levels. Currently, rates are pricing the  higher for longer  theme. Nevertheless, the Mr. market is always subject to change, as real yields have been extremely volatile. Despite the risks involved, I believe it presents a wonderful opportunity from this perspective.Taking into account the upcoming round of inflationary pressures, the Fed may decide to raise rates again. Here are the possible driversAlso as a result of these narratives, the  GDP model now predicts that the annualized GDP for the third quarter will increase by 5.8 .These factors are also responsible for the rapid growth of real yields. The latest   S P  from last week's Wednesday may indicate that the service sector is beginning to be less resilient than anticipated, along with the composite index as a whole. After the release of the data, real yields fell considerably across the curve, with 20-year real yields falling from a local high of 2.04  to 1.88 . Very impressive change in just a few days. However, the overall result differs from the ISM PMI, indicating a much more negative outlook.The charts below from JPMorgan illustrate the most evident behavior of US10Y before and after the Fed Pause. However, it is always an estimate as to when the last rate hike will occur, so we must take into account current market expectations. Although not always accurate and subject to drastic change, it is the most objective indicator of what Mr. Market believes. If not, we could perform our own projections. In the following chapter, we will also examine current market pricing and provide my insights on it.The graph below depicts the behavior of 10-year US yields following a  Fed pause  during non-recessionary tightening cycles. The majority of dates indicate that long-term yields tend to decline. The exception is cycle Dec 1966.When delving deeper, it can be somewhat different when examining the cycles that the recession followed. After a few days of the  Fed pause,  yields tended to decline in five of seven cases, but in the majority of cases, yields recovered. On the other hand, due to rising risks and instability, market behavior was fundamental and conventional. Currently, or let's say since 2008, the monetary  normal  is nowhere to be found due to QE and balance sheet expansion. Now, central banks are attempting normalization, but its success will be determined in the future. Assuming a soft landing, the risk-reward profile of owning long-term bonds supports the optimistic narrative.The  average  development of long-duration bonds since 1981 from JPMorgan  via  in the last seven cycles indicates that long-duration bonds are clearly advantageous, based on history and the event of the most recent fed hike. In my opinion, we may take one more hike and then be finished, or we may not even see that. According to J.P. Morgan's calculations, a bond with a duration of 15 years or more has an average move in the next 23 months following the last Fed rate increase accumulated a 36  gain. And even short-term bonds performed admirably. TLT and AGG are excellent matches for this.Perhaps you are wondering why I am so confident in my opinion. As FFR is higher than YoY Core Inflation, I believe the Fed has tightened enough. While FFR may be in place for some time, I am confident that it will be sufficient to tame inflation. Most of the time, when FFR exceeded Core inflation, it was sufficient to pacify it. However, it is crucial not to reduce interest rates as quickly as policymakers did in the 1970s.These assumptions simply lead me to believe that the Fed is likely finished with rate adjustments. On the other hand, there are risks associated with a robust economy and solid expenditure, or there are leading indicators indicating that services are becoming less resilient and manufacturing is continuing to decline. Inflation is below 0.2  m m for the second consecutive month, which is below the 10-year monthly average and annualized below 2 , thus below the Fed's inflation objective. Yes, as I mentioned, there are dangers to the upside, but a number of leading indicators point to a greater risk to the downside. Nevertheless, an indicator of economic activity and food suggest inflation could rebound.While there are upside inflation risks, which were extensively discussed at the most recent  meeting and Jackson Hole, I prefer to concentrate on market rate measurement by Fed Funds Futures. Simply stated, market participants anticipate rates in December 2023 to be close to 5.43 and in December 2024 to be close to 4.48, implying a probability that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points under 40 . The spread between specified futures reflects the market's expectation of a 100 basis point  bps  rate cuts from peak rates through the end of December 2024. Obviously, these expectations alter over time and in response to events, such as last week's Jackson Hole.Nonetheless, if this pattern of rate cuts materializes, it could be a strong positive driver for bonds with maturities of 7 years or more and reduce real yields. Assuming that the fight against inflation could be effective, real yields and inflation expectations could be positive drivers for lowering nominal and real yields. Fed Funds Futures rate expectations imply peak rates in December and November, giving us a slightly less than 40  chance of a 25 basis point rate increase at one of the next two meetings.While I have provided clear evidence of how the market behaved in analogous situations, there is no assurance of the market's future behavior. I see limited upside risks in real-yields rising by an additional 30-50 basis points or more  from local yield highs , which could be close to all-time highs. In my opinion, the likelihood of record-breaking real yields is extremely unlikely, though not entirely impossible. However, real yields premiums could spike if enormous fiscal debt issuance and almost out-of-control spending occurred, which could increase inflation expectations and exacerbate the supply-and-demand imbalance.If demand is insufficient, continued fiscal emissions could lead to an increase in nominal yields if they continue. As a result of the Fed's quantitative easing  QT , it may be more difficult for the market to curb such massive emissions. I believe mitigating factors exist. However, such yields are ideal for asset managers and also attractive for retail investors. Imagine the following long-term yields  4.24 percent for 10 years, 4.55 percent for 20 years, and 4.33 percent for 30 years. These are the levels that investors and many analysts believed would never be reached again. Levels last seen in 2009. Nonetheless, this threat persists. From a timing perspective I believe, there could be a little bit spark up by 10-20 bps from current yields, which could pull down the AGG and TLT down. This could be solid opportunity.Powell attempted to be as hawkish as possible, but the market was not surprised. Fed Chairman confessed that the Fed is  for additional tightening if necessary, until it is evident that the inflation target is being metThere is also a significant  that must be addressedPowell has just disclosed that the still-expanding and resilient economy, as indicated by the robust labor market and robust economic expansion, could threaten the efforts of central bankers. Primarily due to the constrained labor market, because, in my opinion, a tight labor market solely creates wage pressures, which drives the price of services. Powell is aware of this inflationary pressure, which is why the FOMC always seeks to soften the labor market, especially in times such as the present.However, the most recent data from this week - JOLTs Job Openings in the US economy  non-farm  - showed a significant decline, totalling 8.827 million compared to expectations totalling 9.465 million. Nonetheless, the trend remains considerably above pre-pandemic levels, confirming that the labor market remains tight. Nonetheless, it is softening rapidly.The Fed's decision to halt tightening could be precipitated by a labor market that is easing but remains tight, a manufacturing sector that is continuing to weaken, and a service sector that is starting to weaken. Thus, whether or not we see one more increase is less significant for this strategy than the emergence of global and downside risks.Regarding the economy's resilience in relation to higher bond yields, I have one suggestion. Despite the fact that the Atlanta Fed GDP model released a very strong piece of forward-looking GDP for Q3, I'm becoming more cautious as the most recent Flash PMI reveals weaker service numbers, following many months of resilience. The monetary policy delayed effect began to materialize.However, I believe that long-term bonds have an extremely favourable risk-reward ratio, which is influenced by duration and convexity. From a risk perspective, it is much more advantageous to initiate fairly severe DCA at this point. This also correlated with historical evidence, but even historical evidence is never a guarantee of future returns. Before investing, do your own due diligence. Feel free to review my  of the technology sector from July, which is ahead of September, the most negative month from a seasonality perspective, or my most recent ideas,  that are significantly undervalued with excellent growth prospects and with high margin of safety  from my point of view .

"Jackson Hole Symposium Takeaway: Further Rate Increases, If Appropriate","Ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium, the S P 500  rallied from around 4,333 last week. Markets not only wanted to buy the dip for the month but also were willing to gamble on a dovish Federal Reserve. A dovish FedSince the Bureau of Labor Statistics posted strong job data, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s conclusion pointed to that of hawkishness. Powell   We will need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We will keep at it until the job is done.Investors who saw their stock holdings lose value in 2022 will have last year s symposium fresh on their minds. Interest rates increased by 300 basis points sinceAssets soared in March when the Fed stepped in to prevent a bank crisis contagion with Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. Investors will notice a correlation between the asset increase and the stock markets continuing their uptrend.More recently, however, markets continued to trade higher through mid-July despite the Fed reducing its securities holding. Powell recognized that the impact of the asset reduction and rate hikes takes time to show up in the economy. The stock market s recent weakness, which began in late July, mirrors Powell s comment. Powell said,  the wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.Powell commented on the strong gross domestic product growth in Q2 2023. He said that the economy might not be cooling as expected, citing the housing sector showing renewed strength. Rising interest rates discourage mortgage holders on their existing properties from selling their homes. The elevated rates will limit home supplies and reduce real estate transaction volumes.Once the Fed pivots, it may encourage consumers to buy a home. This would support the Fed s case to raise rates again. In , Powell cited that high inflation starting before 2022 was  a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply.  It continues to unwind demand and supply distortions and implement monetary policy tightening to slow the said aggregate demand. Unfortunately, this is a long process. Despite the more favorable recent readings, the Fed will continue a rate-tightening bias.Rental costs remain high. Powell recognized that lease turnover is slow, so rent inflation measurements take time to show up. The Fed will watch the market rent data closely. It will look for signals of upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.Powell welcomed the lower monthly core inflation readings for June and July. Still, he saw that as only the beginning of what the Fed needs to have confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its goal.Powell is unsure that lower core PCE inflation will continue. The central bank will need to work down the elevated 12-month core inflation. Until then, the economy did not return to price stability.Tighter monetary policy and resolving supply and demand dislocations helped bring core goods inflation down. The Fed s actions worked especially well for durable goods, such as motor vehicles. During the pandemic, fiscal transfers and low interest rates boosted the demand for vehicles. After the pandemic ended, output and inventory increased and demand fell. Most importantly, interest rates increased the cost of vehicle financing. As a result, the Fed successfully achieved a sharp decline in motor vehicle inflation.In time, inflation should decline for other goods. This is nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. As a result, it will call for a restrictive monetary policy. Powell and the Fed will achieve sustained progress in lowering core goods inflation by keeping interest rates higher for longer than investors think.Non-housing services, which include health care, food services, transportation, and accommodations, accounted for more than half of the core PCE index. Although the 12-month inflation moved sideways, Powell is encouraged that its inflation in three and six-month measures declined. This category is less sensitive to interest rates. In addition, those services are labor intensive. It will take time for the Fed s restrictive monetary policy to resolve the inflationary pressure stemming from the imbalance between supply and demand.To achieve inflation rates at 2 , Powell expects a period of below-trend economic growth. Readers may track the tighter financial conditions by watching the 2-year treasury yield , which is up 250 basis points since last year s symposium. Tighter bank lending standards are also slowing loan growth. He cited evidence of below-trend growth from slower industry production. Additionally, spending on residential investments fell in each of the past five quarters.Powell again emphasized the economy may not be cooling as the Fed expected. GDP figures are above expectations as well as above its longer-run trend. Consumer spending is robust. Anyone invested in retail stocks like DICK S Sporting Goods , Macy s , Foot Locker , or Nike  might disagree. But when the consumer is shifting its spending, profits fall for some firms and rise for others.Powell said that wage growth across several measures showed a slowdown. Yet the Fed needs nominal wage growth slowing at a rate similar to that of its 2  inflation target.Readers should be cautioned that the slower wage growth may not last. UPS  workers . Full-time workers will get an average of  49 an hour. Hollywood writers are still on strike while United Airlines  pilots received up to 40.2  in .Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve s ultimate 2  inflation target. It will stay on its restrictive monetary policy until that time. Even though rates are firmly above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, rates will not fall. This should keep putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.The Fed does not have a certainty in the neutral rate of interest. It is a warning for investors that they should ignore mainstream opinions on the rate. Instead, look at the economic data every month.

Net Cash from operating activities was  in the second quarter of 2023 versus  5.85 billion last year.The Better-than-expected quarterly earnings were primarily due to improved renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total sales costs.

Gold Market Commentary: Q4 Turbulence Ahead,"The gold price oscillated between US 1,900 and US 1,950 for most of September until a sharp dip on the 27th took the price to US 1,871 finish and a 3.7  m m loss. A strong US dollar during the month led to more modest m m drops in EUR, JPY and GBP .Our gold model GRAM suggests that gold s downdraft was largely the result of higher opportunity costs, as the US 10-year yield gained almost 50bps during the month. US dollar strength, with a 2.5  rise in the DXY index also contributed. On a weekly frequency  not shown here , our GRAM model suggests that opportunity cost was insufficiently strong to explain the late-month price drop. In our view the following factors were at play  an overreaction to strong US Capital and Durable Goods data released on 27th September A large drop in the China domestic gold price premium. And we can t rule out technical triggering of limit orders as gold broke through US 1,900 and saw its 50-day moving average cross the 200-day moving average   sometimes viewed as a trend change signal .Global gold ETFs saw further outflows in September to the tune of US 3bn -59t , balanced between North American and European funds, while COMEX gold futures managed money net longs shed US 4bn 70t .Gold price and return in different periods across key currenciesYields, led by US Treasuries, are on the march. The US 10-year TIPS yield, historically closely linked to gold, has breached 2.3  for the first time in 15 years. This is territory that, combined with a rising US dollar, has previously proven to be challenging for gold .While August s run-up in yields was probably driven as much by supply and demand as fundamentals, monetary policy is likely back in the driving seat and has been steadfastly hawkish over the past few weeks  Figure 1 .But gold is not the only casualty of soaring bond yields. Higher yields are depressing the equity risk premium and with rosy earnings growth forecasts  it is a set-up reminiscent of late 2007. Yields are also further constricting financial conditions, which on some measures are also similar to 2007 . This in turn could exacerbate recession risk over the next 6-12 months.Higher yields are also likely reflective of inflation volatility. The inflation trend may be down, but is likely to be bumpy. In the US there are some things to watchHigh inflation is painful but so is . It is both an economic concern and, historically, troublesome for equities.Gold is likely to face some choppiness over the next few weeks as rising real yields, a firmer US dollar and a buoyant economy batter some sectors of investment demand. But longer-term concerns and continued central bank buying should, in our view, ensure that this turbulence doesn t establish a more material downtrend.As such, this could present potential gold buying opportunities for some investors. Historically, gold has tended to mean revert in instances when the market  futures positioning  becomes excessively short.Editor's Note  The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",26,2023-08-26T10:42:22.000-04:00

I'm going to lead off today with an overview of the macro environment, summarize our operating performance for the quarter, and provide an update and some color on our strategy for navigating through these uncertain economic times. Ross will cover the transaction markets and Glenn will close with our financial metrics and updated guidance.Despite the headwinds of high interest rates, some high profile tenant bankruptcies, shaky debt and equity markets, and the on-again, off-again predictions of an impending recession, underlying shopping center sector fundamentals remain robust. More importantly, our portfolio continues to produce strong operating results, as we have been able to nearly overcome, from an FFO perspective, over  0.06 of non-cash accounting related headwinds relative to last year.In an environment marked by virtually no new supply, strong demand from new, recurring, traditional, and non-traditional anchor and small shop tenants, along with the resilient consumer, we continue to produce strong operating results. Indeed, our third quarter results were stronger than anticipated, enabling us to raise our outlook for same site NOI, while raising the bottom end of our FFO guidance for the remainder of the year.A few more third quarter highlights. We signed 457 leases totaling 2.1 million square feet during the third quarter. Our small shop occupancy reached an all-time high of 91.1  as demand for our portfolio continues. Our strong positive leasing spread was 34.9  for new leases and 8.8  for renewal and options reflects the pricing power of our high quality portfolio. Of note, our combined spread of 13.4  is the highest in six years.As anticipated, our anchor occupancy dipped 50 basis points, quarter-over-quarter to 97.2  due to the recapture of the remaining Bed Bath   Beyond boxes. We released seen Bed Bath boxes this quarter at a positive spread of 54 . Our remaining 12 Bed Bath boxes are all in negotiation and continue to benefit from the favorable supply and demand dynamic for well-located retail. Our overall occupancy is off only 30 basis points to 95.5 , notwithstanding the headwinds described.We are encouraged by the continued push by tenants to secure the right real estate with the right landlord. This continued strong demand is perhaps best evidenced by our signed, but not open spread, which actually widened out this quarter to 320 basis points, representing about  52.2 million of rent that is not yet cash flowing. It is these operating dynamics in our own portfolio that continue to build our team's enthusiasm for the pending RPT transaction. While we remain excited about our portfolio, the headwinds I noted earlier cannot be ignored. As a result of the dramatic rise in the 10-year treasury due to persistent inflation in all likelihood, we will remain in a higher-per-longer interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.To mitigate balance sheet uncertainty and maintain a stance of de-risking our exposure to market forces, we do not  Technical Difficulty  continue to prioritize generating free cash flow. We are laser focused on expediting store openings and rent commencing dates, while reducing expenses that are not income producing. Free cash flow growth will allow us to be self-funding and help produce strong organic internal NOI growth as we move ahead.In summary, we continue to build a company, team, and portfolio that is resilient and able to drive growth in challenging times. We believe we are well positioned to execute and take advantage of the additional opportunities that will inevitably arise as we continue to work to optimize shareholder value. RossThank you, Conor, and good morning all. It was a busy quarter for Kimco on all fronts, including the transaction side of the business. While the macro backdrop continues to be volatile, the dislocation that has begun to emerge clearly benefits well-capitalized owners and operators. Those with the scale and liquidity to not only weather challenging times, but take advantage of them. With rates continuing to rise and financing more difficult to obtain, creativity and utilizing unique advantages is how to win in this environment.To that point in August, we capitalized on an opportunity to acquire a dominant grocery anchored lifestyle center in one of our top markets. Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center is a 500,000 square foot trophy asset in Washington DC Metro with all the attributes we look for in a property, starting with the best-in-class grocer, in this case Wegmans, with exceptional sales. The market also has excellent demographics with over 115,000 annual household incomes and over 110,000 people in a three mile radius that also pulls from a trade area that stretches upwards of 40 miles, due to the tenancy and regional location.The property will allow us to layer in our platform to create additional value and cash flow growth, both from upgrading specific tenants and rental levels over time. Additionally, the asset includes over 50 acres of land, providing us with the optionality to densify with mixed use in the future. Historically, this is an asset that every institutional owner would be chasing and would likely have a premium cap rate attached to it due to all the positive attributes.However, with financing tight and for a large deal size, Kimco stood out with its ability to close all cash on the  172.5 million purchase price, which allowed us to negotiate a cap rate north of 7  for our newest Signature Series asset.During the quarter, we also announced the merger with RPT Realty. This is another clear example of utilizing our platform to negotiate a highly favorable cap rate for a well-regarded portfolio of primarily grocery-anchored centers. Similar to the timing on the Weingarten transaction, we view this as another unique window during which the competition is limited and we can take advantage. As it relates to structured investments, there has been a noticeable uptick in discussions and potential opportunities in the past 30 days to 60 days.Admittedly, we expected these conversations to ramp up earlier in the year, but it seems to be happening at a more significant pace as of late. Conversations are taking place with operators facing debt maturities, groups looking for capital to transact on unique one-off opportunities, as well as institutional investors facing redemptions that are looking at recaps. We're being very selective in where we participate, so we expect this part of our business to grow as we move forward.All in all, we are excited about the activity during the quarter and our ability to utilize our position and sector-leading liquidity to remain active when others are sidelined. We will continue to be extremely judicious with our capital, but be ready to move opportunistically.And now off to Glenn for the financial highlights of the quarter.Thanks Ross and good morning. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our high quality operating portfolio, highlighted by robust leasing spreads and positive same-site NOI growth. Importantly, our strong liquidity position and leverage metrics position us to effectively handle the macroeconomic headwinds resulting from stubborn inflation and the higher interest rate environment.Now for some details on our third quarter results. FFO was  248.6 million, or  0.40 per diluted share, as compared to last year's third quarter results of  254.5 million, or  0.41 per diluted share. Our third quarter results produced an increase in pro rata NOI of  3.3 million. The key components of the increase were higher consolidated minimum rent of  12.6 million offset by lower LTA income and straight-line rent of  4.7 million.In addition, bad debt expense was higher by  2.8 million as the current period had a more normalized credit loss level, compared to last year, which benefited from  600,000 of credit loss income due to reversals of reserves. Overall, credit loss was at 71 basis points as a percent of revenues for the nine months at the favorable end of our 75 basis point to 125 basis point credit loss guidance assumption.Pro rata interest expense was also higher by  10 million comprised of  8 million from the consolidated portfolio and  2 million from our joint ventures. This was due to lower fair market value amortization resulting from the early repayment of Weingarten bonds in the third quarter of last year and higher interest rates on the floating rate debt in our joint ventures. Also included in FFO for the third quarter 2023 are  3.8 million of costs incurred in connection with the announced RPT merger and a net benefit of  4.8 million associated with the final liquidation of the Weingarten pension plan.Moving to the operating portfolio, leasing activity remained brisk throughout the quarter as Conor mentioned. Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.6  for the third quarter. And if we excluded the impact of prior period collections it would have increased to 3.1 . The primary drivers of the same-site NOI growth are higher minimum rents contributing 290 basis points and other rental revenues adding 40 basis points. These increases were offset by a more normalized level of credit loss impacting same-site NOI growth by 90 basis points. Overall, these results demonstrated the continued strength of our well-located portfolio and brings our year-to-date same-site NOI growth to 2 .Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with consolidated net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times. On a look through basis, including prorata JV debt and perpetual preferred stock outstanding, net debt to EBITDA was 5.9 times, the same as last quarter and 0.4 times better than a year ago. Our liquidity position remains very strong at over  2.4 billion at quarter end. This was comprised of more than  400 million in cash and full availability of our  2 billion revolving credit facility.In addition, we have our remaining Albertsons shares which have a value of over  320 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued a new  500 million long 10-year unsecured bond which is scheduled to mature in 2034 at a fixed coupon of 6.4 . As we are all aware, interest rates have risen dramatically over the past year and further rate increases are not off the table. As such, we felt it was prudent to address our upcoming 2024 unsecured bond maturities which come due in the first quarter of next year. Tending the maturity, we have invested the proceeds in high-quality instruments to mitigate a large portion of the dilution.Now for our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Conor noted earlier, we began the year facing a non-cash headwind of  0.06 per share totaling  36 million, compared to 2022, stemming from the anticipated lower fair market value amortization from the early repayment of the Weingarten bond and the normalization of credit loss. In addition, we reduced our 2023 lease termination income assumption by  10 million or  0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter.As a result of the strong performance from the operating portfolio, we have clawed most of this back. Our ability to overcome these headwinds speaks to the stability and strength of our operating portfolio. Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are again tightening our 2023 FFO per share guidance range to  1.56 to  1.57 from the previous range of  1.55 to  1.57. This includes improving our full-year credit loss assumption to a range of 75 basis points to 100 basis points from the previous range of 75 basis points to 125 basis points and increasing our same-site NOI assumption to 1.75  to 2.25  from the previous level of 1  to 2 .In addition, based on our full year expectations, our board has elected to increase the fourth quarter common dividend to  0.24 per share, representing an increase of 4.3 . As a reminder, we received a  194 million special dividend from Albertsons earlier this year, which is considered ordinary income for tax purposes, but not included in FFO. We continue to evaluate the amount of special dividend needed to satisfy our redistribution requirements.The Board is expected to declare the amount of special dividend in November and we expect to pay it by year-end. Looking ahead, we plan to provide our 2024 outlook when we report our fourth quarter results. We anticipate it will be inclusive of the RPT merger being completed early in the year.And with that, we are ready to take your questions.Before we begin Q A, one additional item of note, today's call will be focused on Kimco s third quarter earnings results and outlook as a standalone company. Today's discussion may also contain forward-looking statements about the company's pending merger with RPT, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of RPT shareholders. As such, our responses around this pending transaction are limited. The information that is already publicly available, including the transaction announcement, the S4 and the merger agreement, which can all be found in the investor relations section of our website.With that, now we can begin the Q A.We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator Instructions  The first question today comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You purchased an asset in the quarter, you sold assets in the quarter, you're presumably in the market for selling some of the RPT assets for when you acquire the company. Can you kind of provide an update of the transaction market with a particular emphasis on how things have changed since the 10-year rate increased  Thanks.Sure, happy to address that. So, yes, you're right, we had a very active quarter, as I mentioned. We were very excited about the acquisition of Stonebridge Center. It's going to be a long-term hold where we can create some significant value. The dispositions on the Kimco side were fairly limited. There's one transaction which I would note that we sold out of one of our joint ventures, a grocery anchored shopping center in Southern California at a very low cap rate and the low-5s, which I think showcases still the strength of the market and that there is significant capital, particularly for core grocery centers.That being said, we're being I think very cautious in this market in terms of the fourth quarter and our expectations. There's essentially nothing in the pipeline on the acquisition side between now and year-end and on the disposition they continue to be limited to a couple of select land parcels and a few smaller joint venture assets that we're exploring.So I would tell you that the market is still active, although transaction volumes are down plus or minus 70  year-to-date. There is still is capital that is being put to work. Just recently there were transactions that very aggressive sub-6 cap rates in Southern California aside from the one I mentioned that we sold as well as in Miami. We've seen grocery anchored-centers as well as power centers in Chicago and other parts of the Midwest that are trading in the 6s and the 7s and in some cases low-8s. The financing is still available albeit at higher rates than what we've seen in the last 12-months or so which is obvious given where the rate environment has gone, but LTVs can still be obtained from private owners or investors in the 50  to 60  range. So there's still activity out there. We're encouraged by what we see in the fundamentals of the business, as we've talked about. And we believe that we can selectively execute it at the appropriate time.The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Please go ahead.Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just hoping to pack up on the back of Michael's question with regards to targeted RPT dispositions, presumably that would be focused in the lower growth Midwest markets. Just how committed are you to trying to prune that part of the portfolio, if at all  And how should we think about cap rate spreads or differences between, kind of, typical primary gateway markets versus more secondary, maybe Midwest or rest Belt type marketsSure, we are going to save the specifics of the RPT strategy for once we close the merger. That being said, I would tell you that there is still activity out there, as I mentioned. We've seen transactions in the Midwest, as well as in the Sun Belt and other parts of the country. So investors are still looking at all parts of the country and all formats of retail. There's a significant amount of capital that is currently sidelined that is waiting for the appropriate opportunities and frankly for more supply to hit the market as it's been a pretty stable and static amount of supply that's been introduced.So we'll be very selective. We're going through the integration process, the pre-merger integration process right now. So we're formulating our strategy, but we're very encouraged by the direction of the RPT portfolio and what we're seeing. And as we get to the merger and beyond it, we'll be much more specific about the strategy and plan there.The next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Great. Good morning. I guess just to push on that a little bit, just given the year-to-date stock performance, the market is clearly not appreciating the opportunities or the market is too concerned over the risks on these opportunities and it sounds exciting you're seeing more opportunities to come. I guess is there anything else you can share today to alleviate maybe some of these concerns that, you know, Kimco is executing the right strategy to be opportunistic.Jeff I'm happy to take that one so I think when you see in our results and that the numbers speak for themselves clearly we are very focused on executing our strategy and having that result in strong operating results, strong FFO, we raised our dividend, we raised our guidance, we raised our same-site NOI guidance, the all-time high occupancy for small shops is reflected there, six-year high on leasing spreads. So we believe we're executing and we're showcasing it and letting the numbers speak for themselves.Clearly we're in an opportune time, you know, with the dislocation in the financing market, we try and be, you know, opportunistic. And I think that's what Kimco is known for. And so obviously it's a show me story and we believe we've executed in the past and we know we're only as good as our last deal and so we're going to make sure that we continue to put up the numbers that speak for themselves. And when you look -- and I know we've been very vocal about the health of our industry, but when you look at the supply and demand side of the shopping center sector, with the demand, the store openings of what we track over 6,900 new store openings for this year, the supply of 0.5  of existing stock of new construction, which is the lowest amongst all commercial real estate categories, and the vacancy levels for the whole entire open air sector.Depending if you look at Cushman and Wakefield or CBRE, it's the lowest sense of ever been tracking. So between 16-years at Cushman, 18 years at CBRE, this is the lowest vacancy rate the country has ever experienced. And so we're in a good spot. We see that opportunity. We think that the RPT transaction is exactly that. It's a high quality portfolio with all the wind at its back. So we can crystallize the GNA synergies very quickly. And what gets us most excited, obviously, is the OpEx margin that we can believe we can execute on quickly and bring it up to a Kimco level and block and tackle and showcase what the platform can do.Great. Thank you.The next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead.Hey, guys. Just maybe coming at things from another angle on RPT here. Just the 10-years up called 70 bps since you guys announced the transaction, you guys just did the debt deal at  6.4   ph , you have to refinance the under  80 million. Could you just talk about, given where rates are, where they could go, what the optimal mix of cash versus new debt could look like to take that debt out, and maybe how the accretion math has moved since the deal was announced just given the higher financing costs.Yes, hi, Craig, it's Glenn. Again, rates obviously have moved a little bit, but we do have a full mix and we have a fair amount of optionality. We have cash, obviously, that is on our balance sheet. We also have our Albertsons investment that we would expect to be able to monetize in the beginning part of the year. So between that, our access to capital, the revolver, we feel pretty comfortable with taking, you know, refinancing the debt at prices relatively close to where we targeted. Rates are up a little bit, but I think from a full standpoint, we still expect the transaction to be FFO-accretive in the first year.We have, again, the revolver is fully available. We're sitting with the significant amount of cash on the balance sheet, and Albertsons I think those give us the flexibility to take down what we need to do.The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.Hey there. Good morning. I will not ask a question on RPT, I wanted to ask about leasing spreads. My question for you is on leasing spreads, the Bed Bath spread in particular, which were stronger I think than many of us expected. So maybe can you shed some more color here  Are you perhaps offering a bit more TIs  Are you cutting up boxes  And maybe some color on how the conversations are going to backfill the remaining boxes and expectations for spreads on those  Thanks.Yes, appreciate the question. I think it sort of dovetails part of what Conor mentioned about the supply demand and the demand factors that are very much in our favor right now with no new development supply. It's really the existing inventory. And so, similar message to what we've communicated previously is a lot of these retailers are looking for opportunities to grow their store count. They have to hit their growth projections over the next several years and so they've always seen the Bed Bath inventory as one of those clear opportunities.So in terms of the commitment they've made, you have multiple players at the table looking for a similar space that actually helps you push rent northward, which helps drive the spread. When you look at the cost side, the costs have been pretty much in line. All of these have been single tenant backfills, so we aren't splitting boxes yet. When you look at the balance of the 12, we still have a handful of those that are going to be occupied most likely by single tenant users. There may be a couple in there that we anticipate splitting, but that was to be expected from the very beginning and we still see very healthy spread margins as well for those remaining boxes. So again, all looks fairly comparable right now.The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe a follow-up to the Bed Bath sort of comment earlier. I guess how much -- how should we think about the downtime with those boxes  I mean, I'm trying to figure out, you know, the downtime and how long it'll take to get kind of the rent back online with new tenants as we think about growth for next year, you know. So, you know, on the one side you have the headwinds from higher interest rates, net interest expense, but on the other side I'm just trying to understand how much of a sort of a pick-up from rents you'll get sort of as a tailwind for next year  Thanks.Yes, sure, absolutely. So we have 14 boxes that were executed three of which were assigned those 14 boxes are accounted for currently in our snow pipeline, which you spend a 320 basis points,  52 million in total. For some perspective on timing, we do actually have our first two Bed Bath boxes that were backfilled starting to flow this quarter, and so that was under a 12-month window. Obviously, timing will vary box-to-box on what needs to be done. The balance of that is baked into our snow pipeline, of which we anticipate seeing about 50  to 60  of that flow through the course of 2024.The nice part, too, about the releasing of the Bed Bath boxes is, again, there have been individual tenants taking the whole boxes, which usually compresses the buildout time and the rent commencement date. So that's what we're already starting to see some flow this year.The next question comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Thanks. Good morning. With respect to your push for higher annual escalators, are you finding there's any incremental pushback or would you expect to be able to continue to push upward to the near-termYes it's market driven obviously you know we'd say the Sun Belt markets have been you know areas of opportunity where we can push further north on the increases, but it's really a case-by-case conversation with all the retailers. Obviously, everything's in negotiation, so there's a lot of discussion on the table, but we felt we have been confident in our abilities to push it northward, and right now it seems to be holding pretty well. With the small shop occupancy at 91.1, obviously matching our all-time high, again, that supply-demand balance is still working very much in our favor.Okay, thanks.The next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, sticking with the lack of supply and strong tenant demand, I guess thinking about how you guys are having conversations and discussions with your acre tenants. So, traditionally, the acre tenants are able to drive leasing terms on deals. But now that the availability is dwindling. How is Kimco able to regain leverage in those discussions and maybe curtail some tenant-friendly termsSure. Yes, I mean, outside of the economics, you're looking at, you know, co-tenancy provisions, exclusive provisions, all of which you can start to rebalance, loosen up, create more flexibility for us. Obviously, repositioning and redeveloping our centers has been a core principle of ours, so having that flexibility to do so. I also think we continue to grow into a data-driven market where you have a better sense of the impacts and you see tendencies or understandings change. Former principles about the impact of fitness long ago was sort of dispelled by the reality that people go to the gym, and then they actually go and shop elsewhere afterwards. And so retailers have come to appreciate that.So I think today, more than ever, it's very much a partnership, looking to build the best community for the shopper and the customer. And our retailer partnerships are very, very strong. And they're willing to explore new opportunities that work for both sides.The only thing I would add is I think you're seeing retailers become more flexible with store footprint, which again opens up a lot more opportunities. The days of sort of having their prototype and that's it, it seemed to be in the past. And so that may not be a lease term specific item, but it is an optionality that creates more demand for spaces that might be more tweener sized. And that's what you're seeing with some of the Bed Bath opportunities.The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.Thanks, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. You know, I'm a little bit surprised that you know in some ways on the reaction from the market on your increasing scale at a time when the fundamentals of the shopping center industry are probably the best we've ever seen. But maybe if you could put into context some of the -- your historical occupancy and leverage ratios. And in particular maybe highlight also maybe if you can talk about what your shop occupancy is at record levels already, but are there big regional differences and how much more can you push thatMaybe comparing, for example, your New York or Long Island shop occupancy versus your national, obviously there are market differences here, but highlight to the market a little bit on what the upside potential, additional upside potential is here in terms of occupancy. And also, obviously, as that snow pipeline comes online, what that would do to your already, I believe, record low leverage ratiosSure. Happy to start, Floris, and we can pass the mic around, but you're spot-on. We're obviously encouraged by the supply and demand dynamic that we're experiencing in our portfolio. We're using a lot of data analytics to understand that there's virtually no new supply on the horizon and that we feel like our portfolio is well positioned for growth as the signed, but not open pipeline continues to build, as you saw expand further this quarter, which indicates future NOI growth.And we're trying to maintain a portfolio and strategy that allows us to grow regardless of the environment that we're facing. And so keeping leverage levels at all-time lows for us is important. You saw us be proactive and really sort of push out any near-term maturities with our recent bond offering. We continue to think that the small shop occupancy is going to be a bright spot for us as we've just reached all-time highs and we're continuing to think there's more to push there.The demand drivers are multiple, and they're more, as I mentioned earlier, there's traditional and there's non-traditional. And you continue to see the use cases for shopping centers evolve, because it's all about value and convenience. And almost everything you can think of benefits from value and convenience. And so that's why the shopping center continues to evolve to be, I think, the place of choice for whether it's a service use, whether it's a medical use, whether it's a pure retail use, you name it, it continues to evolve as the spot where people want to start businesses.And that's why I think it gives us a lot of encouragement, as well as the fact that we have all of this underutilized parking that we think has future outside in the long-term. So we always want to think long-term. We entitled over 800 units this quarter alone in the portfolio. We continue to think that the shopping center will evolve to include multiple uses, primarily multifamily for us. But we position the portfolio for long-term growth. We've been on a roller coaster of retail.As you know, there's been retail apocalypse. There's been the COVID pandemic. There's been all things we've faced in terms of challenges. And we feel right now we're in a really good spot, hopefully be the bright spot of commercial real estate, because Kimco is well positioned, I think, to be opportunistic and showcase that when times when people are nervous, if you have the capability to execute, you should be able to make generational deals. And we feel like that's what we're intending to do at Kimco going forward and into the future.The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.Hey, good morning. I'm just curious how you're thinking about spending on acquisitions versus redevelopments at this point, where you see the bigger opportunity  Given the size of and growing size of the portfolio, whether or not you expect to see some increase in the redevelopment opportunities or whether the accretion yields there due to the cost or whatever it might be are just not worth the squeezeSure, I'm happy to address that. Cost of capital is paramount in doing deals that are accretive to that cost of capital. It is something that we discuss and evaluate as a collective committee on a daily basis. To your point, acquisitions in this environment, at least one-off sort of third party acquisitions will be very challenging for us in the near-term as cap rates have not moved nearly at the same speed that interest rates and our cost of capital have moved.The bright spot is that redevelopments, particularly sort of the bread and butter retail redevelopments within our portfolio, continue at very high clips, double-digits on average. So that is an investment opportunity that we will continue to pursue and activate across our portfolio. And to your point, as the portfolio continues to grow, those opportunities grow alongside it. So we do believe that leasing and redevelopment -- retail redevelopment will continue to exceed our cost of capital and be where we put a significant amount of our available cash flow. And then we'll be opportunistic with the structured investment program, which also has double-digit returns requirements for us to proceed. And we'll prioritize each and every opportunity with that thought process in mind.The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. I got a question on where do share repurchase has been into the capital allocation, I guess the matrix  I think you have about  224 million left in your authorization. How are these -- how does that compare to a structured investments and other opportunities you haveI think it's a similar conversation. I think every investment opportunity that we look at is judged based upon our cost of capital and what is accreted to that. I think that we talked a little bit about our leverage being at the lowest levels historically that it's ever been, which gives us a lot more optionality to consider anything that's on the table. So we'll look at every single investment opportunity, acquisition, leasing, redevelopment, structure investment, stock buybacks, whatever the case may be, and prioritize it based upon, you know, through that lens. So that's where we sit and that's how we consider it.The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning everyone. Conor, you talked about small shop occupancy as a bright spot. Could you talk about what types of tenants you're seeing that interest from, like local versus national, what industry  And also the timing, I feel like we hear that macro uncertainty is lengthening the time it takes to sign leases and other property types. So I'm wondering if you're seeing that at all in your property typeSure, from a small shop perspective, I think it's definitely a bright spot. When you look at the uses, you know, restaurants, specialty foods, like those types of users still dominate sort of the percentages of new leases that we signed this quarter. And then when you go past that, it's really sort of the health and wellness and beauty category. That continues to evolve. You used to be dominated by sort of the old bus of the world. Now we're seeing Sephora and a number of others continue to evolve to have open air shopping centers as a key component to their growth strategies.You know, when you look at the services category, that continues to evolve. We always have had hair and nail salons as a key component of the shopping center sector. But when you add in all the medical uses that continue to evolve and want to be closer to the consumer and come out of the hospital, I think that continues to evolve as well. And then you're seeing sort of these franchise-driven concepts that continue to be the growth driver.The mom-and-pop retailer today very different than it was even five years ago. And a lot of what's being -- what's going on is they're buying these franchises with a proven business model, and that's how they're starting the business. And I think when you look at the franchises that we're doing deals with, you can actually improve the credit profile there, again, the corporate guarantee on it.And so as we evolve our leasing strategy, and we talked about the increases that we're getting on small shops, continuing to improve the growth of the portfolio, all these things are adding up, obviously, to an enhanced growth profile.The next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird. Please go ahead.Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. I kind of wanted to dig into the structured investment conversation. You guys have mentioned that the conversations around those have been picking up lately. Can you guys provide us some more details about the return criteria on those and what we can expect that book to grow toSure. Yes, the conversations are picking up and we do anticipate there's going to be more optionality with that program as we enter 2024, continuing with the theme of cost of capital. As our hurdle rates increase, the quotes that we're providing to potential borrowers of our capital have increased as well. So what was previously 8  to 9  with some back-end participation potentially is now double-digit as a starting point.So the blended average of our structure right now in terms of the rates that we're obtaining in the current position are in the mid to high-9s. And we expect that anything going forward will certainly start in the double-digits. But we think that will ramp up. We have just under  200 million outstanding on the book right now within the program. So we'll continue to be mindful of that, but we think that there's room to run there.The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Hi. You reduced your credit loss outlook as you're trending at the low-end. Given the record low supply environment you're operating in and your improved portfolio quality in terms of better credit tenants, do you think it's premature to say credit loss will be a step function lower in the coming yearsAgain, we're happy with the improvement that we've seen. I think you've seen credit loss coming back to more normalized level similar to what we saw pre-pandemic. It's a little early to put it into the guidance for next year. But as a run rate, if we're in that 75, 100 basis point range, I think you're back to pretty normalized levels.The next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Yes, hi. Going back to the structured investment opportunities, are they all tied to real estate  Or are you evaluating some operator opportunities as wellYes. I mean the core program is looking at operating real estate in our core markets with strong demographics, the tenancy that we're looking for, high-quality sponsors, and as we've talked about in the past, having that right of first offer, a right of first refusal is a critical component of that program.Now that being said, we do have our Plus business that has been active historically. And as there are retailers that are real estate rich that have capital needs, we believe that we're typically 1 of their, if not their first phone call. So those conversations will continue and where we can be opportunistic and helpful with retailers that have a significant amount of owned real estate, we'll always look at those opportunities as well.The next question comes from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please go ahead.Good morning. Price of interest rates, of course, has been unprecedented and introduces the question of how will retail our balance sheet and look after a company starts facing that maturity. So when you think about the future, how do you feel about potential tenant fallout  Do you think it will be -- or that it's reasonable perhaps to think about above average tenant failure given everything that is happening with interest ratesIt's a good question, Paulina. I think when you look at the rate environment and how it impacts all industries, really the retailers that have near-term debt maturities are going to be facing higher interest expense and the refinancing, just like other industry. I would say that  Technical Difficulty  for Kimco has never been smaller when you look at the retailers that we continue to track from a credit perspective.And when you think about the supply and demand dynamics that I talked about earlier, we feel very comfortable with the credit loss reserve that we have today. Obviously, we just improved that this quarter and continue to be proactive on showcasing spaces that are not available today, but may be available in a year or two or even five years  time. And that's what we're doing right now is we're showcasing not our current vacancies. We're showcasing what may be available in the near-term or in the long-term to line up the best-in-class tenants.Because of the lack of supply, retailers are engaged in that knowing that it's going to be hard to fill their promised pipelines of net new store openings in the current environment. So they have to align with folks like Kimco to try and fill that and see where they can add where they wanted to fix to build their needs.The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead.Thanks. Good morning. To follow-up on that last question. Just given the rise in the cost of capital for your tenants, do you see that eventually weighing on their expansion plans  And second question, your active mixed-use developments, the yields went up pretty noticeably. Just curious what drove that.Yes. Kevin, great for questions. So with the first one, we maintain a very close dialogue with our big retail partners, and they're looking through, I think, the short term impacts and continuing to try to grab market share where they can appreciate in that, that inventory is limited. And if they don't get it today, there might not be new inventory available tomorrow.That said, every retailer has a different capital strategy, and that probably evolves most likely as ours evolves as well. So something that we stay very, very close to them. But as I can say right now, it doesn't seem to be slowing the pace of growth the majority of those retailers. And as it relates to the mixed-use pipeline, yes, I appreciate the question. So what you see there is you see four projects, three of which are ground leases and the fourth one being Colter which is the 1 that we identified as our preferred equity structure. That was the first of its kind that we're doing.So this quarter, we felt it was appropriate to actually show what the real returns are related to the Kimco invested capital and the preferred returns related to those projects. Obviously, that yields a higher or accretive growth profile than if you're just to invest all the capital yourself. So that's what it's reflecting, that's the change.The only thing I would add on the retailer demand side, in, and what we're seeing is because of the rate environment because of the construction costs a lot of these tenants that used to do ground-up development and then sell those assets as sale leasebacks are now looking for second generation space versus the ground-up development side. And so they're looking at how do they absorb existing inventory versus net new development, because of that lack of financing availability. And so that should drive more demand to the existing spaces, as well as that first-generation ground up development has really dried up.Thank you.The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks for the second shot here. Just a couple of questions. One, just on -- going back to the RPT merger where we started. So what are you guys assuming in terms of the debt that needs to be refinanced. So that's part one. And then part two, if you could just give us an update on the Rite Aid exposure and what you're seeing or expecting there for the space that they've deemed that they're going to get back in one form or another.So in terms of the debt to be refinanced for RPT, if you look at the balance sheet at 9 30, they're sitting with bank debt, both revolver debt and term loan debt of about  350 million and then they have about  511 million of private placement notes. So that's the magnitude of what we're looking at and then obviously, there'll be merger plus that go into that. So it's around  900 million in total. And as I mentioned, we have a variety of options about how to fund that from our Albertsons investment, cash on the balance sheet, aligned, obviously, access to the capital markets and other things.Yes. And as it relates to the Rite Aid exposure, right now, we know that three of our leases have been rejected in day one. That's about 5 basis points of occupancy right now. So a de minimis impact, there are another two that we expect to close this quarter. So in total, that's about 8 basis points of total occupancy on the impact. And right now, we have good activity in terms of hitting our retailer list and box size is appropriate for a lot of the mid-box users, and so the larger, sort of, small shop operators as well. So we're very encouraged by the activity. We have one that has drive-through locations. So again, there's good attributes, good components here that we feel pretty confident we can backfill those quickly.Thank you very much.The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. Again I had originally tied to just sneak in a second one, but then we didn't get to it. So here I am. And maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ki Bin's question. But so we hear that macro uncertainty is lengthening the time it takes to sign leases in like office and industrial, so I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing this at all, like how have your tenant sense of urgency on signing leases evolved over the course of the year  And like have they changed  Or have you, I guess, avoided thatYes. It really -- it hasn't changed. Not anything related to the macro environment. We're tied for negotiating certain deal points that may add some time, but that's normal course of business. If anything, people are looking to get leases signed quickly so they can get open sooner and they can start booking that growth within their portfolio. So there's been no real material change in terms of time of execution.Okay, thanks.Next question comes from Libby Bakken with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hi. This is Libby Bakken. Yes, just a follow-up. So -- do you think you could clarify the bridge or the walk from 3Q FFO to 4Q just based on the guide, it looks like it implies like a  0.01 to  0.02 step down into the fourth quarter. So just curious on what's driving that.Yes. Again, we have a couple of onetime things that are in the third quarter. As we mentioned, there's some of this impact from the Wingard pension plan that was liquidated during the quarter. And there's a few other onetime things. But again, we feel very comfortable with the guidance range and we're at the upper end of the range that we set out for the year. Again, coming back, we made up a lot of headwind that we had going into the year, driving towards that high end of the range today. So that's really the driver.There was a big one-time item as Glenn mentioned, the pension income we recognized was about  8.7 million. That's what's in that other income line. You back that out, you're back to a more normalized level.Got it. Thanks.The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I saw the lease summary that landlord worked first square foot went up to close to  8 in the quarter. I'm assuming that's related to the Bed-Bath Beyond lease, but I wanted to confirm that and maybe talk about TIs and landing work trends going forwardYes, sure. So there's a couple of components. Let's start with the first and new leases side. So the new lease side, is slightly higher, driven by primarily three deals. If you left those deals out, the total work for TI and landlord work would go from 51 down to 40 which is at the lower end of a more normalized rate. The returns on the deals were in excess of 20-plus percent. So very accretive and the mark-to-market on those is between 80  and 116 .So very, very accretive deals. But again, back those out, you get down to the  40 range. In terms of the overall, where you include new leases, renewals and options, it is elevated because of the weight of the number of new leases executed and we'd also did  24 anchor deals that quarter -- this last quarter. First, the number of renewals and options, if you see those are a little bit lighter.So obviously, when you blend it together, the weighted component of the new deals grow that number up a little bit. But from a cost standpoint, as you can see, the renewals and options are pretty much in line as well. So that's just the nuance difference between this quarter and prior quarters.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.We just appreciate everybody that participated on the call. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you so much.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",1,2023-10-05T12:54:44.000-04:00
NexGen Energy: Moderately Optimistic Scenario Already Playing Out,"I like Uranium and the nuclear industry as an investment. I believe it's the only way the world can have its cake and eat it too  Increase the standard of living while sticking to emissions targets . In my first The price of the Uranium remains unchanged or even drops to US 30 -  40 lb. for several years. At a low production cost of less than US  20 lb., the company was still going to outperform other companies' operational mines. This would make the investment long-term as the stock price slowly ticks push the price of Uranium. Since the price of Uranium stocks is closely correlated to the price of Uranium, we start seeing NXE tick higher much before production. There is also a possibility that bigger rivals find the valuation attractive enough to make an acquisition offer that would greatly benefit existing shareholders.An extension of the moderately optimistic case. Driven by supply and demand, the price of the Uranium can get speculative, which may provide a massive boost to underlying Uranium mining stocks. Commodity stocks have undergone speculative frenzies before. Since NexGen has the largest development stage deposit in the world, it may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a speculative environment.Presently, we are already seeing the  play out before our eyes and this write-up will serve as an update to our thesis.The stock is up 46  since the original thesis was published towards the end of last year. The industry as a whole has been on quite a tear this year. What could be remarkable though is the fact that the stock has outperformed both the ETF  that has Uranium miners as holdings and the financial entity dedicated to the acquisition of physical uranium Probably, this would come as no surprise if you  that NexGen is in possession of the world's highest-grade Uranium deposits. The region of their deposits  Saskatchewan  is also recognized as Canada's top-rated mining jurisdiction along with an international ranking as the third most attractive mining investment and policy jurisdictions.Presently, the company estimates that its Rook I Project is the largest development stage uranium project with the lowest capital intensity compared to peers. The large low-cost and low-capex project mean that the market recognizes how far this company can go when its mines are fully operational and how well the Uranium prices can propel the company.It is interesting to see how much prices have moved up since our first coverage. The spot price was approximately  45 lb. and is close to  60 lb. now, an increase of 30 - 35 . This is still significantly less than the time we saw Uranium prices in the last bull cycle. Spot price  a high of  136 in 2007 and prices have fallen far since then. But the market recognizes that if this rally were to sustain as the company ramps into production, we could be looking at a cash cow by the end of this decade. Earlier still, this company could become an attractive prospect for an acquisition.The company estimates at  75 lb.  average contracting price during last contracting cycle  average annual EBITDA during the first five years of annual production would be  2.5B and at the highest point of  150 lb. average annual EBITDA would be at  5.18B. This is when our scenario would move from a Moderately optimistic case to a Highly optimistic one. It could seem that it is too far-fetched to expect this move at this point in time. But the setup looks to have a really good foundation. Below is a short list of  unexpected  news that we have seen recently that makes the case for demand shooting up and supply coming up short.1. Finland has  regular electricity output at Europe s largest nuclear reactor. Finland's commitment to nuclear energy, alongside hydro and wind power, is a crucial component of the country's journey toward carbon neutrality. This strategy has not only supported Finland's resilience to potential energy supply disruptions but also contributed to its environmental goals.2. Despite  anti-nuclear sentiment following the Fukushima disaster, Japan is gradually restarting its nuclear reactors. Currently, one-third of Japan's operable reactors have resumed operations, and approvals are in progress for an additional 16 reactors, with one set to restart this month.3. Demand is not only expected to grow through the bulk of new reactors coming mainly from China and India but also by  the operating lifetimes of existing plants. Canada, France, Russia, etc. are allowing existing plants to operate for up to 60 years, and in the USA, for 80 years. The latest report from WNA has said that demand for uranium in nuclear reactors is expected to climb by 28  by 2030.4. Utilities  on track to sign contracts for more uranium in 2023 than in any year since 20121. A  in Niger, which generates about 4  of the world s uranium, has added to the upward pressure on Uranium prices.2. Cameco, the second largest Uranium miner announced lower full-year forecasts for production due to challenges at its Cigar Lake mine and Key Lake mill in Canada. The company has said it might buy uranium from the market if needed to help meet obligations to customers3. War in Russia has blocked off critical export routes for the supply mined in Kazakhstan which is the world's largest supplier of Uranium. One of Cameco's main sources of outside supply is Kazakhstan and delays have hindered the alternative route for exports.It has to be stressed that this company is development stage pre-revenue and as such the play is on the movement in Uranium prices. Any correction or drop in the prices of Uranium would accordingly be reflected or even be magnified in the price of the stock.The fallback or the base case scenario is even if the short-term to medium-term thesis fails on the Uranium prices, the long-term case for the company becoming one of the biggest Uranium commodity players in the world should still hold  But an investor would have to wait until the end of this decade for this to play out fullyFor faster realization of profits, it would be prudent to trim the position as we go further into the Uranium price rally. Most commodities undergo a period of boom and bust and this time would be no different. It seems that we are on the cusp of the boom of another cycle, the catalysts for both supply and demand seem to be supported for now. This may continue to be supported till we see prices high enough to be able to aid the miners' plans to source additional supply.For now, I am holding on to my full investment and may even add to my existing position till I reach my maximum threshold for a single position. I will post another update to this thesis when I decide to cut down on my position and take profits.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

UGL: A Strong Buy Signal In Gold Deserves Some Leverage,"Our buy signal in gold last  is still in force. The mild price correction over the last 30 days seems to be ending and we expect a strong uptrend to begin. In fact, it may have already started.WeThe best indicators to forecast gold are not economic or those that forecast physical supply and demand, but those based on the buying and selling activity of certain investors, plus surveys that measure investor expectations for gold.To begin, let's first look at the two indicators that measure buying activity of gold and gold EFTs, and the one indicator that measuresThen we'll look at buying activity in UGL itself, which is the gold ETF we're recommending, to see if it confirms this bullish outlook.This indicator, which goes back to 2006, is unique to the Sentiment King. It's made by combining the investment activity of two trader types - gold asset managers and gold producers. The information comes from the  Commitment of Traders  data.The green arrow on the right points to the strong buy signal that occurred last year, and it's the main reason was remain bullish long term. We'll probably remain positive on the long-term upward trend of gold until this curve moves into the red zone.One of the reasons we continue to recommend GLD and now, with this article, UGL for those aggressive investors who want to use leverage on an expected move in gold, is the high  puts to calls  ratio in GLD.Options traders are notoriously wrong with their investment activity and a high puts to calls ratio is the classic indicator that reflects this. The  puts to calls  ratio is not only useful in determining the direction of the stock market, but other investments as well.The chart above shows the puts to calls ratio for GLD and we've indicated high ratios of the past with dashed arrows. You can see the correlation.Last month had the highest ratio in the last four and a half years. To us this is very bullish for gold and is one major reason we recommend UGL for those aggressive gold investors who want leverage.The third chart is the Sentiment King ranking of the Hulbert gold survey, which calculates the ratio of bullish to bearish opinions of gold newsletter writers.It's important to notice the black arrow on the right, which points to last year's green zone price low. It occurred when our ranking of bearish sentiment by newsletter writers was also in the green zone, which represents a buy signal. This was strong additional confirmation of the buy signal from our commitment of trader data shown in the previous chart.As you can see, our current ranking of the survey is just above the zero line at -2.3. We're not worried about a top in gold until both indicators move into their respective red zones, and neither is close to that at this time. This gives us confidence that higher gold prices lie ahead. We recommend buying now and on any dips in price over the next few weeks.The chart below graphs the net asset value of the ProShares 2X gold ETF - UGL. This is the leverage gold ETF we recommend. It attempts to achieve a return equal to 2X the return of the Bloomberg Gold Subindex. The NAV is charted using a semi log scale to show the relative size of the various price moves.We expect a significant move in gold that will push the price of UGL to a minimum price target of  83 or a high target of  98. This is a low end gain of 41  to a high gain of 66 . Investor buying activity in UGL, shown below, supports this overall positive outlook.This chart plots average daily buying in UGL as a percentage of assets. The scale is inverted, which means low levels of buying at the top of the chart, and high levels of buying at the lower end.History shows that investors in UGL are not good at predicting the direction of gold. They buy more UGL when gold is high and ready to decline, and less UGL when gold is at a low, ready to move higher.We've drawn five arrows that point to low buying levels in UGL. It's easy to see that all five occurred at price lows, right before higher prices in UGL.The last arrow on the right indicates the current low level of buying. This is added confirmation to us that gold prices, and the price of UGL, are going to move higher.As with all leveraged investments, there are added risks and expenses. These risks and expenses both limit the returns and make it hard for managers to achieve their investment objectives. This is true of UGL.In our opinion the largest expense factor at this time are high, short term rates, which raise margin costs and increase time premiums on futures and options. Because of this we don't believe UGL is a good investment longer than six to nine months. As a gold investment, it should only be used when indicators favor a strong price increase like we think they do now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Camtek: A Cyclical Play At A Great Price Point,"Revenues and margins for Camtek Ltd.  have improved immensely over the last few years and 2022 become a very busy year for the company as the top line landed at  321 million. CAMT seems to remain on aThese cyclical investments are often associated with trying to timeAs we know, CAMT in the semiconductor industry as a developer and manufacturer of inspection and metrology equipment for advanced interconnect packaging and memory and image sensors among other niche segments in the broader semiconductor industry. The company has some systems called Eagle-i system that primarily focus on delivering 2D inspection and metrology capability for companies in the sector.The company has experienced strong demand following the surge of semiconductors and the introduction of more advanced AI programs. Now almost any company you come across seems to be looking into how to introduce some of the capabilities of the semiconductor industry into their own or how AI could further enhance operational performance.With a leading position in the market, I think that CAMT offers one of the best opportunities to gain strong exposure to the industry, without perhaps the same amount of cyclicality and volatility added. Many companies in the industry are expected to post a significant YoY decline in 2023, whilst CAMT seems to be holding up rather well. That speaks volumes about the type of business you are getting into right here in my opinion.Looking at the last from CAMT, it seems that they managed to come out ahead of their expectations as revenues landed at  73 million in total. As for the coming quarter, the projections are that revenues will post a slight quarterly growth and come in at  77 - 79 million. A beat here I think would further solidify the higher valuation that CAMT is receiving right now. The p s, for example, is at 6.7 right now but as demand rebounds I think that it will be more justified, as we know, the market is forward-looking.The CEO Rafi Amit made some comments on the stronger demand the company is experiencing and this is especially reassuring to see as the stronger flow of orders is a good indicator of better times ahead. Expectations are also that 2024 will be a record year for the company, both in terms of revenues and earnings. As for what the market is expecting of CAMT, it seems that an EPS of  2.17 is expected. My opinion on the projections heavily relies on demand continuing strongly for the second half of 2023, and CAMT being able to build a strong backlog of orders going into 2024. I think a failure in doing so could perhaps result in earnings coming in just in line with projections  but a major beat would send the share price up even higher, in my view.The semiconductor market finds itself amidst a substantial correction cycle, driven by a marked decline in demand across a spectrum of devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics. This pronounced downturn in demand has sent reverberations through the industry, prompting a recalibration of strategies and expectations. The market has shown itself to be a cyclical one driven by companies wanting to stock up inventory levels and capitalize on coming . That usually means that demand for semiconductors could be a good indicator for customers to companies like CAMT projecting they will have a surge in demand.Notably, the high-end memory has borne the brunt of this correction, with prices experiencing a pronounced descent of nearly 50  over the past year. This swift and substantial price adjustment reflects the intricate balance between supply and demand dynamics that govern this intricate market. These price adjustments are something that needs to be watched by companies like CAMT. If the company can display a strong resilience in margins, then potentially a higher valuation may be suitable, which seems to be the case for CAMT right now.An equally significant facet of this recalibration revolves around the supply chain intricacies associated with key components, particularly for the production of phones, personal computers, and data center chips. The ebbs and flows in demand have led to a renewed equilibrium in lead times within the supply chain, marking a return to more conventional and manageable production timelines. Since the COVID pandemic, however, the supply chain issues have eased up significantly and high shipping costs seem to be a thing of the past. I don t think this will play out to be a challenge for CAMT in the medium term.CAMT has proven itself very capable of growing quickly in the semiconductor industry and building out a broader customer base. The company has maintained margins very well and even if 2023 doesn't offer a YoY growth that maybe a lot of investors would have wanted, the fact that CAMT is barely posting a decrease when many other companies and peers are doing significantly lower revenues and earnings speaks a lot about what you get with an investment in CAMT.I like the price point right now even after the run-up it has had and paying a slight premium to the sector is often necessary when you want to get into a company. In the long run, I believe CAMT will be a winner and I want to be along for the ride. Rating CAMT a buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Taylor Wimpey: Analysis Of The U.K. Housing Market,"Our current investment thesis isTaylor Wimpey  is a UK-based residential property developer and homebuilder. With a rich history dating back to 1880, theTW's share price has lost value in the decade, primarily due to the decline since 2021, with strong distributions offsetting this. TW's dividend payments are a reflection of its cash-earning potential and business model.Presented above is TW's financial performance in the last decade.TW has achieved healthy revenue growth in the last 10 years, with a CAGR of 6  despite the recent decline. During this period, TW has consistently achieved good growth YoY, reflecting the quality of its business model.TW's business model revolves around the acquisition of land, planning, and development of residential properties. The company sells these properties to homebuyers, both private and affordable housing. TW's revenue is primarily generated through the sale of completed residential units.For this reason, the identification and acquisition of land for residential development is critical. This involves assessing potential sites, obtaining planning permissions, and managing the legal and regulatory aspects of land acquisition. Within the UK, there are strict planning rules in place to protect heritage sites, areas of nature, and other culturally important locations. Overarchingly, however, the dynamics of the UK housing market  which we will discuss later  means the UK Government is highly encouraging of Homebuilding.TW designs and constructs a wide range of homes, including apartments, townhouses, and detached houses. This allows the business to reach a broad range of consumers, maximizing its selling potential and reducing exposure to any single segment.TW has a long-standing presence in the UK property market, which gives it brand recognition and customer trust. Based on its size, it is only rivaled by a small number of other firms, most of whom have a similar reputation.TW emphasizes high-quality construction and energy-efficient features to meet modern living standards. The company , although lags behind some of its similarly sized peers. There has been an undertone of criticism for UK builders, primarily because they have been unable to match the quality of those pre-70s. A quick google search will have you convinced a property built in 1900 is superior in quality today than a new build  and they are likely correct . This said, new builds are improving following this criticism, and offer consumers convenience, a smooth buying process, a long warranty, and are ready to live in.The company operates across various regions in the UK, strategically selecting locations with high demand and growth potential for residential properties. This approach supports a reduction in exposure to any single region, allowing reducing the risk of a decline in demand or inability to sell homes. Unlike many of its peers, however, the business also builds in Spain  Tourist hotspots for Brits , marginally softening its reliance on the UK.The company aims to secure a significant portion of its sales before construction is completed, which provides more predictable revenue streams and reduces financial risks. For this reason, the business is somewhat  hedged  against downturns, as its costs are already covered by past earnings.The UK, similar to most of the Western world, has seen a rapid increase in inflation during 2021-2022, followed by a steady increase in interest rates to combat this. While the US has brought inflation down to below 5 , the UK and much of Europe have been less successful, primarily due to a greater reliance on importing Energy and Food.Our expectation is for the current trend to continue, with inflation slowly declining MoM, but requiring further rate hikes to ensure this decline is sustainable. We are now expecting rates to peak at 5.5-6  in 2024, before beginning a decline quicker decline from there.The impact on the housing market is substantial and we are already seeing the effects. UK house prices have declined at the .Tighter lending conditions during periods of high interest rates will limit the availability of mortgages for potential buyers. Further, high inflation and interest rates are reducing consumers' purchasing power, making it more challenging for potential homebuyers to be in a position to afford an acquisition.This is a major issue for TW, with projects currently under construction facing a softening of demand. This will encourage greater negotiation by those seeking to purchase, forcing TW to accept a reduced amount.As the following illustrates, UK housing affordability has declined over time  increase in affordability ratio , with a significant bump during the GFC, and likely another which we are currently experiencing. This will act to price more consumers out of the housing market and into the rental industry.This begs the question of what the wider impact will be in the coming years. Consumers are facing an unprecedented deterioration of their finances, with no clear route to reprieve. Many individuals will see a permanent decline in financial standing, essentially pricing them out of a new build purchase and setting them back years. UK Consumer Confidence illustrates this, currently at pandemic low levels.During times of high inflation, the costs of raw materials, labor, and other inputs for construction can increase significantly. TW faces challenges in managing rising construction costs in the medium term, likely impacting profit margins unless the increased costs can be passed on to buyers through higher property prices. This is usually what occurs during periods of inflation, however, the degree to which consumers are struggling means prices are unlikely to offset this.The UK housing industry is unique in that it has performed modesty well for centuries. Most recently, the industry bounced back well from the GFC, especially impressive given the rapid rise it experienced  fueled by foreign money . Countries like Italy and Spain are still struggling with house prices over a decade later.This inherent strength in the housing market is a reflection of two key factors. Firstly, and most simply, the UK is an incredibly attractive place to invest. Foreigners have been buying up properties, businesses, and anything they can get their hands on, with the promise of healthy returns and economic legal safety. With Brexit, this has certainly softened but remains the case.Secondly, the UK has a demand and supply imbalance. The UK is smaller than New Zealand in size  km2  while having a population of over 67 million  NZ has 5m . This naturally means the demand for housing is high, exacerbated by an aspirational culture of home ownership.Given these two factors, we believe the housing industry is inherently safe. The current conditions are highly concerning, and will likely take an extended period to correct. This said, we are not bearish on the UK housing industry as the fundamentals are not going away.TW faces competition from other UK-based residential property developers  which are listed later in this report . This somewhat restricts the earnings potential of the cohort, as they compete for land and development opportunities.TW'S margins have been incredibly consistent over the historical period, and impressively so in the LTM, owing to the factor mentioned previously. TW will only invest in locations that are neutral or accretive for the wider business and competition means it is unlikely to materially outperform this  and thus see margin appreciation over time .There is scope for technological development making the build process significantly quicker and cheaper, but it remains unclear when this will be possible at a mass market level.We expect margins to contract in the near term, as inflationary cost pressures and a lack of demand force the business to conceding in negotiations.The key takeaways from the H1 results areThese results are in line with our expectations. We forecast the business to end the year down  20 - 27 , owing to the likelihood of a larger decline in H2 following further rate hikes in the UK.TW's balance sheet remains robust, with a ND EBITDA ratio of  0.8 x and a sufficiently large cash position to fund operations in the coming year assuming no sales.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 5 years.Analysts are forecasting a  24  decline in FY23, followed by a 10  growth rate into FY27F. Margins are expected to materially decline, with a permanently lower level subsequently.We broadly agree with these forecasts, although we believe MSD growth into FY27 is more reasonable.Presented above is a comparison of TW to a cohort of its directly comparable peers, namely Persimmon , Barratt Developments , Bellway , Vistry , Berkeley , and Redrow .Margins are relatively standardized across the peer group, with no material difference between the group. The movement in FCF is volatile, reflecting differing approaches to current conditions  TW has continued to invest in inventory .Forecast growth suggests a strong weakness with TW, owing to its significant scale and core demographic. Declining earnings is the biggest obstacle currently, and TW is overly exposed.TW is currently trading at 5x LTM EBITDA and 7x NTM EBITDA.On an LTM basis, TW looks incredibly attractive. The stock is trading at a discount while being positioned well relative to the group and has a good portfolio of land.This view changes on a NTM basis. Given the decline the company is facing, the risk is that it quickly becomes overvalued. At a 4  discount to its peer group, but more importantly, facing a large decline in sales with an uncertain impact on margins, it is difficult to suggest there is upside at the current share price.The UK housing market is a modest investment choice in our view, particularly over an extended period of time. TW, among a cohort of a few leading developers, provides investors the ability to gain exposure to this industry.We expect a difficult period in the coming 12-18 months and TW is highly exposed. We see sales declining further and margins tightening.The performance beyond this should be good, however, to invest today feels premature.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Nike: Leading The Athletic Market With A Resilient DTC Strategy,"NIKE, Inc.  is the global leader in the athletic market, boasting diversification across product categories, geographical regions, and distribution channels. The company stands out with a compelling direct-to-consumer  DTC  strategy in the branded industry. A key aspect of this strategy is aNKE's  for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024To rebalance supply and demand, NKE is carefully managing sales into the retail channel and restricting inventory access to ensure a healthy marketplace. Notably, end-channel sales remain above NKE's expectations for a slightly increased revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Regarding the direct-to-consumer market in North America, the liquidation activity from the previous year, especially in the apparel segment, is now being compared, resulting in a net positive impact on merchandise margins. Sales growth, however, is under pressure as lower-quality transactions are avoided. While debates around the bull and bear case may persist until there is greater clarity on wholesale recovery and macroeconomic conditions. Nike continues to maintain a dominant position as a footwear brand, both in North America and globally, and its inventory has been adjusted to align with faster-growing sales, while the wholesale destocking is expected to conclude by the end of the year.In the upcoming second quarter, Nike foresees a slight increase in reported revenues. The company projects a gross profit margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to strategic pricing, better handling of markdowns, and reduced ocean freight costs. However, this gain will be partially offset by higher product input costs and around 50 basis points of adverse foreign exchange effects. The management also expects selling, general, and administrative expenses to rise in the mid-to-high single digits.Looking at the full year, Nike has reiterated its outlook, anticipating revenues to increase in the mid-single digits. The management projects a gross profit margin increase of 140-160 basis points, which includes roughly 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. SG A expenses are expected to slightly outpace revenues, particularly at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range. It's worth noting that the company anticipates only a  modest  improvement in markdowns for the rest of the year, suggesting there may be room for better-than-expected performance in this area.With 15  of its sales coming from China, Nike is in a good position to benefit from a rollback in COVID-19 restrictions in the region. The reopening may help growth continue to accelerate into 2024. The sales in China appear poised to keep surging as the country benefits from consumers returning to normal activities, going outside, and playing sports again. Currency-neutral revenue in China jumped 25  in fiscal 4Q ended May 31, but could accelerate significantly in the near term as demand ramps up and Nike launches hyper-local products, such as its Chinese New Year and Year of the Rabbit packs. Faster revenue growth may also benefit overall margins in my view, since China typically boasts the highest profitability, while inventories are relatively manageable. Nike has the  footwear market share in China and is No. 2 in apparel. In 4Q, 15  of Nike Brand sales came from China.Moreover, the contribution of China's sports industry to GDP could rise this year as more residents resume outdoor activities after the end of Beijing's Covid Zero policy. This would come after the contribution to GDP dipped to  in 2020 from 2019's 1.14  and remained at 1.07  in 2021. Covid disrupted many sports-related businesses and activities, which resulted in an 8  fall in the manufacturing of athletic goods. Widespread virus outbreaks across mainland China likely also limited the rise in purchases of sporting goods last year. This might have offset sports-related sales gains driven by the Beijing Winter Olympics.I believe Nike's dominance in sports can continue to foster brand success, given its sponsorship of some highest-ranked teams and players at key sporting events. During NCAA basketball's  March Madness  this year, Nike and its Jordan label sponsored 40 out of 68 . The brand also outfitted 13 of the 32 teams in the 2022 Men's World Cup soccer tournament, with two of them making it to the final four. Nike also has 13 of the 32 teams in the 2023 Women's World Cup, with seven of those ranked in the top 10, continuing to keep the brand in the spotlight. Nike also sponsors tennis players Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, ranked No. 2 in women's, and No.1- ranked men's player Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, which helps the brand's status for key tennis events like the just-completed Wimbledon and the upcoming US Open.Nike is actively working to reduce its inventories, which may lead to continued margin pressure due to increased discounts. Nike has already managed to bring down its previously high inventory levels, with growth remaining flat at the end of fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Nike has integrated personalized product recommendations into its e-commerce app to boost the sell-through of available inventory. Nike is trading at 26x forward PE, which is in line with the company's historical three-year average but represents a premium compared to global peers, which typically have lower P E ratios ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. The premium reflects the high-quality nature of Nike's business, its leading position in the appealing athletic category, margin-enhancing strategies  despite recent margin challenges , and a robust balance sheet. I believe that Nike continues to be a top-tier company with strong market positioning in both apparel and footwear, further bolstered by its strong digital capabilities. Moreover, Nike's deep connection with customers sets it apart from competitors, especially as consumers increasingly prefer brands that offer a unique experience in both physical stores and online. Hence, I remain bullish on the stock and assign a buy rating to the company.I see the biggest risk to a NKE recovery to be the weakening macro backdrop and potential for recession. Even in such a backdrop, I continue to see NKE as a relative brand and market share winner. While NKE would not be immune to a weaker demand backdrop, I believe a strong balance sheet, highly sought after products driving brand equity, and company-specific operational initiatives could still drive margin expansion from current levels. Moreover, competition has risen due to the industry's shift toward performance-oriented products, which has lowered barriers for new entrants, which may threaten the company's market share.Nike, Inc. is an established player in the global athletic market and is well-positioned for growth. The reopening in China is expected to drive continued sales growth as consumers return to normal activities, engage in outdoor sports, and drive demand for Nike products. Additionally, Nike's sponsorship of top teams and players in key sporting events further enhances its brand's success and visibility in the sports world. The company's direct-to-consumer strategy in the branded industry is particularly impressive. This strategy places a strong emphasis on the DTC channel, primarily through Nike Direct and strategic partnerships with marketplaces. The loyal customer base acquired during the pandemic is expected to make a positive impact on the company's profitability. Hence, I am bullish on the company and assign a buy rating to the stock.

Generac: 5 Key Takeaways From Analyst Day,"held its  conference on September 27th, and shares rose 5  on the affirmation of 2023 guidance and long-term targets that were higher than initially estimated and appear reasonable as inventories normalize and supplyManagement remains confident in long-term secular megatrends accelerating the value homeowners place on energy security. GNRC continues growing its portfolio of backup power and home energy control products.Generac presents a compelling investment proposition against the backdrop of a global shift towards energy resilience and self-sufficiency. The escalating adoption of solar plus storage solutions and the heightened interest in backup power, especially amidst a spate of weather-induced disruptions and grid instabilities, align well with the company's strategic direction. Generac's robust distribution network and strong brand recognition further solidify its potential for sustained growth and value addition in the coming years.During the conference, management reiterated its FY 2023 guidance and expects revenue of  4.02B to  4.11B and adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.5  to 16.5 , translating to an EBITDA of  623M to  678M. The Commercial   Industrial  C I  segment is expected to grow in the mid-teens, while the residential segment is expected to decline in the mid-twenties.This past year has posed significant challenges for GNRC as the imbalance between supply and demand drew investors' apprehension. The concerns largely stemmed from supply-side bottlenecks exacerbated by climate-induced severe weather, inadequate infrastructure investments, and regulatory penalties for carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the demand for Generac's solutions remains fueled by broader electrification trends, next-generation infrastructure initiatives, and the growing concept of home as a sanctuary.Management reasserting 2023 guidance is a subtle positive, alleviating investor fears over potential guidance downgrades. Amidst a backdrop of supply-side obstacles, this reiteration underscores Generac's strategic positioning to leverage the ongoing demand drivers, shedding a promising light on its ability to navigate the current market adversities. As Generac continues to adapt to the evolving market dynamics, its investment narrative encompasses a blend of challenges and opportunities lying ahead.GNRC expects to grow total revenues by 12  to 14  annually through 2026 and targets margins returning to its long-term average of 37.5  to 38.5  gross margin and 21.5  to 22.5  EBITDA margins in 2026, relative to 34  to 34.5  and 15.5  to 16.5  in 2023 guidance. The implied FY26 EBITDA doubling over FY23 guidance is predominately attributed to improving product mix, operating leverage, positive price dynamics, and less dilution from the energy technology segment.While GNRC looks for growth to tilt towards 2025-2026, expectations of a weaker consumer in 2024 are offset through  300mm of channel under-shipment during 2023, which should benefit residential growth regardless of end-demand next year.However, amidst the positive outlook across various segments, a pivotal assumption underpinning the 2026 targets is the increase in the energy technology mix to 21  from 12  in FY23. This ambitious stride may cause investor skepticism once more clarity is achieved regarding the recent execution challenges within that business segment.The current market penetration of 6  in residential Home Standby  HSB  underscores a significant growth opportunity. GNRC estimates the penetration will reach 7.8  by 2026, with each additional percentage point of penetration equating to a  3bn end-market revenue opportunity. This represents a unique opportunity to drive growth in a category with secular tailwinds by harnessing the power of full-funnel marketing and distribution development.In-home consultations are up four times from 2019 levels, close rates have rebounded off 1Q22 lows, and awareness data pointing to record Generac brand recognition underpins management's confidence in medium-term double-digit HSB growth.A notable demographic insight is that 65  of Generac's existing customer base comprises individuals over 60. This demographic implies a significant underrepresentation among new home buyers in millennials. It also indicates a potential growth tailwind as a new, energy-conscious generation transitions into homeownership.GNRC's energy technology segment has yet to meet external and internal expectations. The segment has refocused on a quality first product portfolio rebuild. Over the past year, management has focused on building a capable team, adding engineers, and increasing product testing standards to avoid product underperformance before being sold.While 2024 targets include executing 2023's groundwork, a return to strong growth and profitability is not expected until 2025 and 2026. Investor sentiment toward this business must be tampered and understand that 2023 is a reset year, with a meaningful step-up in 2024.The long-term outlook for this segment remains encouraging, with Generac aiming for a revenue of  700 million next year and breakeven profitability by 2026. The enhanced product slate encompasses residential offerings like an EV charger, solar inverter, and a next-gen storage system home energy controller. Meanwhile, the C I segment focuses on stationary and mobile storage beyond standby generators, connectivity, and grid services.The C I segment continues to experience secular tailwinds, prompting GNRC to build a 4th US facility in Beaver Dam, WI, with completion expected in early 2025. Within the US, C I customers seek more complex, full-service solutions to support grid-services opportunities, pushing demand for GNRC's beyond standby offerings.Telecommunications providers and data center operators emerge as pivotal customers underpinning growth plans, given their extensive capacity buildouts through the end of the decade and high energy reliability standards.The international outlook within the C I segment remains strong as accelerating Electric Vehicle  EV  penetration and a growing renewables mix forcing grid intermittency challenges and grid services incentives all buoy demand expectations. Notably, the C I segment constituted nearly 75  of GNRC's international product mix in 2022, attesting to its global significance.GNRC is currently trading at the lower end of its 52-week range, offering a potentially attractive valuation relative to its 2024-2025 earnings. The upbeat sentiment following investor day adds an appeal of a return to normalcy. However, a hold is recommended until tangible improvements in operational and financial efficiencies manifest, affirming the ambitious goal of doubling EBITDA by 2026 is more than just a lofty projection. The trajectory of the Residential, C I, and Energy Technology segments, both in the US and internationally, will be instrumental in translating Generac's strategic blueprints into tangible financial milestones, warranting close investor scrutiny.

BlackRock Is The Next Compounder You Should Own,"In the vast universe of equity markets, there's a unique type of stock that stands above all the others  Compounders. These rare entities are characterized by their ability to consistently compound returns at higher-than-average rates, providing investors with attractive long-term appreciation.One such opportunity presenting itself right now is BlackRock . This powerhouse has demonstrated the resilience and growth characteristics that all compounders share, backed by impressive supply and demand dynamics for its shares.Today, we'll take a look at what makes a compounder in our view, why BlackRock fits squarely into this category of companies, and why now is a great time to get involved in the stock.So, what exactly defines a compounder  As we just alluded to, compounders are companies that have unique characteristics that make them potentially great long-term investments.In our view, at its core, a compounder is a company that consistently increases its revenue and free cash flow while simultaneously reducing its share count. This potent combination creates a wealth-building engine for investors.Remember, for capital appreciation to occur, buyers and sellers in the market to agree that an asset's value has increased vs. the year before - this doesn't happen automatically.Instead, demand for shares needs to be stimulated, and the supply of shares needs to be shrinking.What drives demand for shares  More profits and an increasing scope of the business.What drives shrinking supply  Companies buying back shares.Take UnitedHealth Group , for instance. Over the past decade, UnitedHealth has displayed the quintessential traits of a compounder.Its TTM revenue has consistently grown, from  147 billion in 2015 to an astounding  348 billion in 2023, a testament to its strong market position and business strategy. In parallel, its free cash flow has increased from  8 billion to nearly  38 billion during the same periodMeanwhile, UNH's outstanding share count has steadily decreased due to its share buyback program, from 991 million shares in 2015 to around 940 million in 2023. This isn't as aggressive as some other buyback programs, but share count has still dropped by 5  in that time nonetheless.As a result, the company has seen a dramatic increase in share price, with a total return over that time of nearly 400Companies with the inverse characteristics  no demand growth and an increasing supply, struggle to hold onto gains. Verizon , a company like this, has seen essentially zero total returns over the same period of timeShifting our lens to BlackRock, the compounder qualities are readily apparent. Over the past seven years, BlackRock's TTM revenue has steadily grown from  11.4 billion to an impressive  18 billion, reflecting a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of  7Simultaneously, its TTM net income has soared from  3.1 billion to  5.1 billion, reflecting a compound growth rate of more than 7It's true that net income is been a bit 'lumpier' due to a transaction in 2018, but remove that and the overall trend is unmistakable.This is doubly as impressive given the ability for the company to keep its net margins stable around 29   again, remove the transaction in 2018That said, the magic of compounders lies not only in expanding financial results  and an increasing demand for shares , but also in a shrinking share count.During the same period as discussed above, BlackRock has diligently bought back shares, reducing the outstanding count from 168 million to 150 millionWhile this reduction only adds up to a  10  decrease in outstanding shares, this action, coupled with strong financial growth, enhances the value of remaining shares, thus benefiting long-term investors.Plus, the consistency of the reduction in supply is heartening.All of this seems well and good, but with a clear understanding of Company X's compounder characteristics, the question arises  Why nowIn short, because the current valuation presents an attractive looking entry point, and management is forecasting continued growth.At the moment, the stock currently trades at a 27x multiple of free cash flow, a bit lower than its five-year average of  30x. Similarly, its price-to-revenue ratio sits at an attractive 5.7x, compared to its historical range as pictured belowWhile some may view these multiples as elevated for a financial company  as Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating System does , we believe that a better comparison would be a company like Visa . Visa has similarly stellar operations, and trades within a similar range.Additionally, buyers at this point are getting the stock below the 5-year linear regression, within the lower band of standard deviation. Sure, buying BlackRock at 20x FCF would be ideal, but the opportunity may not present itself.In addition to the decent price, results have also begun to swing back around in favor of the bulls.While the company has done well in almost all market environments, late 2021 into 2022 was a rough spot for the company. Revenue was reduced somewhat, and net income dropped for the first time, organically, in a long timeThankfully, results are beginning to turn around, and management has begun to strike a more bullish tone. On the most recent earnings call, CFO Martin Small had the following to sayCEO Larry fink continuedThis growth in assets looks like its translating to a bottom in financial results, and potentially a bottom in the stock price.It's hard to pick out many risks for BlackRock, given the scale of its offerings and the ingrained nature of its business into the world economy.There are two potential ways we think the narrative around BlackRock could change meaningfully.First, if burdensome financial regulations come out that constrain BlackRock in some way, that could negatively impact the stock. We see an incredibly powerful moat around BlackRock's business, and thus one of the only entities capable of piercing it would be the U.S. Federal Government.Additionally, the company is making a big bet on its  Aladdin  software. Aladdin runs a considerable amount of the company's processes, and a cyber-attack could present a serious risk to BlackRock and its reputation going forward. If clients begin to perceive weakness in security of info or funds, we expect the stock will behave poorly.Overall though, BlackRock is a company with an incredibly small number of risk vectors.In conclusion, the investment thesis for BlackRock is compelling and straightforward.As a proven compounder, it has consistently demonstrated robust financial growth and efficient capital allocation. Its track record of increasing revenue and net income, coupled with a consistently decreasing share count, underscores its commitment to delivering shareholder value.Despite the recent bumps, BlackRock's strong fundamentals remain intact.Now, more than ever, represents an opportune moment for savvy investors to tap into this undervalued gem, poised to continue along its trajectory.

"Klabin: Q3 Earnings, Resilience In The Face Of Industry Challenges","The Brazilian pulp and paper giant Klabin  recently published its third-quarter results. Although these results were not outstanding, they indicate a positive sequential improvement.As I  in my initial article about the company, Klabin has recentlyDespite reporting a weak net profit, Klabin's third quarter showed promising results in its paper unit, with a recovery in packaging sales. Moreover, there are expectations of improved pulp prices in the future, although this business division had a weak performance in the current quarter.The lack of more significant revenue growth for Klabin should not necessarilyTherefore, I believe that, despite not reporting an outstanding quarter, Klabin has maintained stable numbers without a significant decline, which is a positive outcome. Furthermore, the company remains well-positioned to continue distributing substantial dividends over the coming years.Klabin  its third-quarter figures, reporting an EBITDA of R 1.352 billion. This represents a modest quarterly increase of 0.6  but a year-over-year decline of 41 . Adverse exchange rate variations impacted the financial results as the reduction in biological assets resulted in a net profit of R 258 million, marking a quarterly drop of 73.4  and an annual drop of 87.4 .On the other hand, the company's revenues showed marginal growth, reported at R 4.4 billion, a 2.5  increase quarter-over-quarter, although still 19.8  below the same period last year.The positive surprise came from the pulp business, where increased volumes  up 27.4  compared to the previous quarter  and lower costs  down 3.6  compared to the last quarter  were observed.An additional significant point to note is the increase in net debt, which rose to R 20.9 billion, compared to R 19.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This led to a higher leverage ratio of 3.2 times the net debt EBITDA, compared to 2.6 times in the second quarter of 2023. This represents a reversal of the company's recent deleveraging efforts following the completion of the Puma II project. However, it's worth noting that the Puma II project is expected to enhance the company's profitability over the next few years.Klabin's consolidated return, measured by the return on invested capital  ROIC  metric, was 13.8  in June 2023, marking a 5.5 percentage point decline compared to last year. Klabin attributes this retraction to the reduced operating cash flow and the capital increase employed.Breaking down the company's results by segment, here are the following key highlightsPulp volumes saw a strong performance, with a reported volume of 425k. Sales of Short Fiber reached 315kt, marking a 29.0  increase quarter-on-quarter and a 6.6  rise year-on-year. Long Fiber   Fluff also reached 111kt, recording a further 23  increase quarter-on-quarter but a slight 4.2  decline year-on-year.According to the company, the increase in volume was mainly attributed to improved demand in Asia and greater efficiency at the Puma I unit following scheduled maintenance stoppages.Despite the weak dynamics in Kraftliner, the third-quarter volume reached 102kt, reflecting a 4.4  increase in the quarter but a substantial 27.7  year-on-year decline. This suggests a short-term sequential improvement, primarily driven by the ramp-up of MP28. MP28 is commencing containerboard production, with plans for a small conversion of cardboard boxes soon.However, in the face of a more challenging international environment, the price situation for Kraftliner is expected to remain relatively weak. The increase in US exports disrupts the international supply and demand balance, resulting in realized product prices of R 3,400 t. This represents a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 14.8  and a year-on-year decline of 35.2 .Paperboard experienced a lower volume primarily due to the 11-day scheduled maintenance stoppage at Monte Alegre. However, this decline was partially offset by the commencement of the MP28 ramp-up, resulting in a sales volume of 165kt. This reflects a modest drop of 2.5  in the quarter and a decrease of 9.2  over the year.Corrugated boards, on the other hand, entered a more favorable seasonal period but still faced challenges in passing on price increases. There was an uptick in volume in the year's second half in preparation for the holiday season. Corrugated sales reached 226kt, marking a 4.6  quarterly increase. Given the frequent corrections in prices due to inflation and Brazilian GDP growth, corrugated paper prices retracted to R 5,850 t. This represents a 1.1  decrease quarter-on-quarter and a 1.8  increase year-over-year.I remain skeptical that the third quarter marked a turning point for Klabin, indicating a return to significant operational growth.While the overall results in 3Q23 were not as dire as they could have been, I anticipate that Q4 could still present challenges, particularly for the paper and packaging division. However, there are prospects for improvement in the pulp segment. Additionally, higher pulp prices in China offset ongoing cost inflation and the marginal recovery of pulp and kraftliner prices in Europe. Hence, the potential for a full-scale recovery seems limited due to the persistent oversupply resulting from recent capacity expansions in pulp, kraftliner, and paperboard.Although pulp prices have  some recent recovery, with two price increases implemented for the Chinese market, the current price level is likely unsustainable. I do not foresee a sustained upward trend in the commodity's price. It's worth noting that if selling prices increase, the company can maintain or even enhance its profit margins, benefiting shareholders.Klabin has announced the approval of the distribution of interest on shareholders' equity  JCP  in the total amount of R 319 million to shareholders, equivalent to  0.11 per share.This practice, specific to the Brazilian tax system and corporate finance, involves companies paying interest to their shareholders on the equity invested in the company. It has distinct tax implications in Brazil. Unlike dividends, JCP is accounted for as an  expense  for companies, reducing taxable net income.Considering that one analyst estimates Klabin's EPS for 2023 at  1.66, this represents a 56  increase. To achieve this, the company must report a net profit of  1,316.4 million in 2023, which I believe is still feasible. Therefore, considering Klabin's expected payout for 2023 of 54.1 , this would result in a dividend per share of  0.13. Since the company pays quarterly dividends, Klabin's dividend yield would be approximately 5.8 , with an annual payout of  0.52.Assuming a more conservative return on investment  ROI  of 5 , with Klabin's current share price at  8.90, this would indicate a fair value of  13.60, representing an upside of 52.8  in my assessment. This is close to the levels seen in 2021 and early 2022, during a solid upside in the kraft pulp cycle.While some investors may find Klabin's quarter uneventful and lacking revenue and profit growth surprises, I view it differently. Given the persistently challenging sector conditions characterized by low pulp prices, the results were not disappointing and can be considered positive.The key highlights include the paper and packaging volume growth despite scheduled paperboard maintenance. Additionally, the substantial volume of pulp sales is noteworthy, driven by operational improvements following the stoppage at Puma I in the previous quarter.However, there are less favorable aspects to consider. Kraftliner continues to face pricing challenges due to international factors. EBITDA did not exhibit significant quarterly growth, with paper sales declining while pulp sales increased. Furthermore, the bottom line was weak, partly due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations impacting the financial result.Nevertheless, the company is expected to continue distributing substantial dividends in the upcoming quarters, and we will likely see a yield of between 5  and 6 . Considering the current valuation is heavily discounted, I reaffirm my bullish outlook on Klabin following the Q3 earnings release.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Alpha Metallurgical Resources: Set To Double If Met Coal Prices Remain Stable,"In my opinion, Alpha Metallurgical Resources  presents a buy opportunity, particularly for investors interested in a complex yet potentially lucrative play in the commodities arena. The company is well-positioned in the metallurgical coal sector, which is poisedAlpha Metallurgical Resources is a mining company specializing in the production and sale of met and thermal coal, primarily operating in Virginia and West Virginia. What a lot of investors fail to realise is that over 95  of AMR's shipments consist of metallurgical coal, meaning that the company is not subject to the secular downtrend which is seen in the demand for thermal coal.In my opinion, the investment case for metallurgical coal is often misunderstood, overshadowed by the broader narrative surrounding the decline of coal as an energy source. While it's true that thermal coal faces challenges from renewable energy and environmental regulations, metallurgical coal operates in a different market with unique dynamics. It commands a higher price due to its specialized role in steel production, a sector that sees increased demand as countries develop and modernize their infrastructure. This price premium can offer potentially higher returns for investors. Additionally, the global push for infrastructure growth further boosts the demand for metallurgical coal, making it a potentially lucrative investment. Unlike thermal coal, which is increasingly being replaced by renewable energy sources, there are fewer substitutes for metallurgical coal in steel production. This lends it a level of market stability that thermal coal lacks. I believe that when these factors are considered collectively, metallurgical coal emerges as a more attractive and misunderstood investment opportunity compared to thermal coal.In my opinion, the future outlook for metallurgical coal is promising, particularly when considering global steel demand trends. According to forecasts, global steel demand is expected to grow at a rate of  through 2024. Even more compelling is the projection for India, where steel demand is anticipated to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate  CAGR  of 4.4  up to 2050. These figures indicate not only a sustained but also a growing need for steel, and by extension, metallurgical coal. Such growth trajectories in steel demand, especially in emerging markets like India, bolster the investment case for metallurgical coal.While the future demand prospects on met coal are positive, I believe investors must remember that the cyclical nature of metallurgical coal demand makes it particularly susceptible to economic downturns and sector-specific crises, such as China's housing troubles. Given that China is one of the world's largest consumers of steel, a housing crisis there would likely result in a significant reduction in construction activities. This, in turn, would diminish the demand for steel and, consequently, met coal. Similarly, a global recession would generally lead to a decrease in manufacturing and construction, further affecting met coal demand. If a macroeconomic downturn was to occur, this would almost certainly lower the average met coal selling price, therefore causing significant pressure on AMR's margins and free cash flow.In my opinion, Alpha Metallurgical Resources is strategically positioned as the USA's largest and most diverse supplier of metallurgical coal, a fact underscored by its commanding 21  share of the nation's total metallurgical coal production as of 2022. This dominant stance is further amplified by AMR's well-thought-out shipment mix, which is balanced between 30  domestic and 70  international markets. India, a burgeoning market for steel, has been a cornerstone in AMR's export strategy, accounting for about 33  of its export sales over the past five years. This aligns exceptionally well with India's projected growth in steel demand. Beyond India, AMR has wisely diversified its customer base by supplying to other international markets, thereby reducing its dependency on any single market. I believe this diversified approach significantly bolsters AMR's resilience and growth prospects in the metallurgical coal sector.In my view, Alpha Metallurgical Resources is well-positioned to capitalize on operational leverage, especially given its leading role in the U.S. metallurgical coal market. The company's scale allows it to optimize operations and minimize per-unit costs effectively. This advantage is evident in AMR's 2023 guidance, where the average selling price per ton for its met coal segment is projected to be  178.42. In contrast, the production cost per ton is expected to be around  109.00, based on the midpoint of their 2023 guidance. This significant margin between selling price and production cost exemplifies how operational leverage can amplify profitability. As long as the average selling price for met coal remain close to current level, the company is poised to produce significant free cash flow.In my opinion, one of the most compelling aspects of Alpha Metallurgical Resources is its ability to manage operating expenses effectively while scaling revenues. In 2018, the company reported revenues of  with operating expenses at  139.34 million. Fast forward to 2022, and AMR's revenue more than doubled to  4,092.99 million. Total operating expenses only saw a modest increase to  218.98 million. This demonstrates that as revenues have grown, AMR has been able to keep its operating expenses relatively stable, thereby leveraging operational efficiencies to boost profitability. This is a strong indicator of effective cost management and operational excellence.As with any commodity, the price action is driven by the fundamental principles of supply and demand, and metallurgical coal is no exception to this rule. We have already discussed the demand side of met coal as it relates to steel demand. However, on the supply side, in general met coal producers have decreased growth capital expenditure, therefore constraining supply of met coal, thus enabling and in my opinion sustaining higher than normal met coal prices. I believe this supply side constraint to be driven by stricter environmental regulations and a tougher borrowing environment that have made it less favourable for met coal businesses to reinvest back into their own business for growth, hence restricting supply of met coal. We can see that despite AMR's significant free cash flow generation over the past year, the management team has opted to keep capital expenditures relatively in line with prior years which should aid in keeping met coal selling prices well above the production costs.As of the most recent quarter, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of . The company's total debt stands at  2.87 million, a modest amount that reflects the managements conservative approach to leverage. We can see that AMR's management team are proactive in paying down debt as seen below. We can see that since 2020, AMR's debt was reduced from  551.70 million down to effectively zero as of today. This approach to handling debt significantly reduces risk and protects the business should it enter some sort of major economic downturn.Since Q1 2022, Alpha Metallurgical Resources has been actively engaged in share buybacks, reducing its shares outstanding from 19.17 million to 16.25 million as of Q2 2023 based on the average annual shares outstanding. This represents a significant decrease of approximately 15.2 . As of July 31, 2023, the number of common stock shares outstanding was approximately 13.7 million. Furthermore, the company still has  350 million left on its current share repurchase program, indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. Interestingly, AMR has announced that its dividend program will cease at the end of 2023. While this may initially seem counterintuitive, it actually signals that the management team views the business as undervalued by the market. By reallocating capital that would have been used for dividends towards additional share buybacks, the company aims to capitalize on this perceived undervaluation. The management team has expressed intentions to continue allocating capital to buybacks until the market recognizes the real value of AMR. In my opinion, this strategy reflects a proactive approach to capital allocation and demonstrates confidence in the company's intrinsic value. Based on a 2.5  annual shipment growth over the next 3 years and an annual decrease in average selling price per ton of 5  per year, the 2025 expected gross profit is  1,125 million. Once accounting for other expenses as seen below, it is expected that in this scenario that free cash flow will be  594 million,  569 million and  542 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. If the free cash flow is then used to repurchase shares, the 2025 share count should be around 8.5 million. When implementing the current price to free cash flow of 5 on 2025 free cash flow, this gives an end of 2025 share price of  340.86 and a CAGR of 26 .It should be noted that valuing a business that relies on commodity pricing is inherently challenging and the above valuation assumes that the average price of met coal stays around current levels over the next few years. Should we enter a recession in the next 12 months, it is likely that met coal prices will fall dramatically, hence likely so will AMR's share price.I believe that Alpha Metallurgical Resources offers a nuanced but compelling investment opportunity. The company stands to benefit from promising long-term demand prospects in the metallurgical coal market, which aligns well with global infrastructure growth. However, it's crucial to consider that AMR is not immune to economic downturns, given the cyclical nature of met coal. Operationally, I think AMR's effective use of leverage is a key strength, generating significant free cash flow. This is further supported by a constrained supply environment that could sustain high met coal prices. The company's aggressive share buyback strategy also speaks volumes about management's confidence in its undervalued stock. If met coal prices maintain their current levels, I believe AMR stock has the potential to double by the end of 2025, offering a lucrative opportunity for investors.

TC Energy: Growth Business Strategy And Attractive 7.5% Dividend Yield Make Stock Appealing,"TC Energy  is a prominent energy infrastructure company operating in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. TC Energy's main financial drivers are related to its extensive infrastructure assets and commercial agreements. The company has comprehensive operations in natural gas andAfter the downturn of 2020 and other supply constraints like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, everyone realized that all forms of energy are required to make countries capable of meeting energy demand. As I explained in my previous , TC Energy's separated assets and infrastructures in a wide range of energy platforms make it prominent. In minutiae, the company has facilities for transporting natural gas fromIt is worth noting that an unforeseen incident in the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline caused the management to drop their operations at reduced pressure in late July.  The cause of the failure is currently unknown, but based on initial observations of the failed pipe, environmental cracking is the suspected cause.  Based on the  report. Although the company returned to service the adjacent parts of the pipeline system that were not impacted by the incident directly, we may see this impact on the company's third-quarter operation results. The reduced pressure at the Columbia Gas Transmission caused TRP stock price to drop by 13  however, it is not a concern as the infrastructure and operations will be fixed soon.As you may all know, after global events last year and the energy constraints, the management  to separate into two businesses to keep the strength of each balance sheet and take advantage of tax incentives for higher growth opportunities. Through this spin-off, TC Energy moved toward a more regulated business model related to renewables. For instance, approximately 75  of TRP's comparable EBITDA will be from nuclear and firming resources by the end of 2030, which are highly regulated.The spin-off brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96  of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and long-term contracts, which will diminish its risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent. As a result, the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7  comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026. On the other hand, the management plans to sustain their capital spending at a minimum range and thus expects ample free cash flow in the coming years. With the mentioned free cash flow, their shareholder returns and leverage conditions are expected to improve.As Figure 1 demonstrates, TRP's operating cash flow increased by 17  to approximately  5.5 billion in TTM versus  4.7 billion at the end of 2022. Although the high amount of capital expenditures of  5.5 billion in TTM led to  476 million of free cash outflow, the company is expected to generate more cash flow from operations due to their spin-off, thereby generating higher free cash flow in the future. In the second quarter of 2023, TC Energy paid CAD 0.96 dividend cash, which based on their 1,029,000,000 outstanding shares, accounts for CAD 987.8 million or approximately  1.28 billion of dividend payment. The company's cash from operation was enough to cover their dividend payment. It is worth noting that capital spending usually is paid by debt and equity financing in the companies in this industry.Figure 1 - TRP's cash structure  in millionsTC Energy provides a 7.45  dividend yield, which is an attractive element of the company. Also, as Figure 2 illustrates, their yield has been on a growing path during the last ten years. In addition, as the management asserted, their liquids business expects to grow its dividend by 2-3  yearly by 2026. Furthermore, TRP's PE ratio of 49x shows a considerable plunge year-to-date, which is another sign that the stock is cheap now and is likely to recover. As a result, currently, TC Energy's financials offer both capital appreciation and increasing dividend yield, while the stock is lower than its historical records.Figure 2Analyzing the company's capital structure indicates that TC Energy could improve its cash balance to the same level as before the 2020 outbreak and reach more than  1.2 billion of cash generation in TTM. In addition, their net debt level increased to over  45 billion in TTM, which shows the company's higher-than-expected costs from projects like the Coastal GasLink pipeline.Regarding the company's deleveraging, it is good to hear that the management has made deleveraging a priority and thus took their first step of selling 40  of interest in their Columbia Pipelines to GIP in the recent quarter. With this transaction, the management targets to improve their leverage condition considerably and reach a leverage ratio of 4.75x. As they mentionedIt is worth mentioning that the management made more efforts for deleveraging, including filing the sale of its stake in its Nova Gas Transmission System  NGTL  in Western Canada in .  The NGTL system connects the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which produces most of the natural gas in western Canada, to domestic and export markets.  This selling would assist them in declining their debt levels and incline their capability of providing shareholder returns.Figure 3 - TRP's capital structure  in millionsDespite TC Energy's solid financials and sustainable dividend yield, the company is not secure from risks related to temperatures and the impact of climate change on both their services demand and their infrastructures. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the company is pursuing a highly regulated business model, as a result, Governments policies and regulations related to decarbonization and energy transition may affect energy supply and demand and TRP's operations and cash flows. Moreover, TC Energy is growing its investments and increasing its capital spending on several projects. If the management cannot pursue their deleveraging process, they may face hardship in generating revenue and shareholder distributions.TC Energy has a prominent position to meet energy demand in the future. TRP is a leading midstream company that has the largest natural gas networks in the North America. Furthermore, the spin-off brings the opportunity for the company to generate circa 96  of its adjusted EBITDA from regulated rates and long-term contracts, which will diminish their risk of reliance on commodity prices to a great extent. Also, the management expects to grow their 2022 comparable EBITDA at a 7  comparable annual growth rate by the end of 2026, which brings 3-5  annual growth for their dividend. When all was said and done, the company's year-to-date PE ratio is very low, which shows that the stock price is very cheap now and will recover. Looking ahead, I believe that the management's growth business strategy coupled with attractive 7.5  dividend yield make the stock still appealing for investment.As always, thank you for reading, and I appreciate your comments.

PubMatic: Small Company In A Highly Competitive Market,"PubMatic  is a company that went public in 2020, capitalizing on the strong appetite for risk in the market at the time. However, since its IPO, the share price has declined by 50 , primarily due to the overvaluation atDespite operating in a market poised for  in the coming years and achieving solid returns with Net Income margins of 12 , I believe the company faces a challenging task in maintaining or gaining market share. This is especially true given that some of its key competitors include industry giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta.In this article, we will delve into the composition of the digital advertising ecosystem, provide a valuation of PubMatic, and outlinePubMatic is a company that operates in the digital advertising technology industry. It provides a platform that enables publishers to automate and optimize the management of their digital advertising inventory. This includes tools for programmatic advertising, real-time bidding, and other solutions to help publishers maximize their advertising revenue.At the heart of Digital Marketing are , which serve as the bridge between supply and demand, acting as the meeting point for  and . For instance, when brands like Coca-Cola or Nike  the Advertisers  want to conduct digital advertising - that is, to occupy digital spaces with images and videos of their products - they must purchase ad space from Publishers. In our example, this Publisher would be a digital newspaper like The Wall Street Journal. These ad spaces in the newspapers are obtained through the aforementioned Ad Exchanges. However, it's important to note that Ad Exchanges don't directly sell ad spaces to Advertisers  rather, they auction them. As a result, if Advertisers want to secure ad placements in these newspapers, they must compete with each other to place the highest bid.These  charge a commission for each closed exchange operation, and some examples include Google's AdX, OpenX, and Xandr. Essentially, this is the technology where the auction and sale of impressions, also known as 'inventory,' take place. This inventory can come in various formats, including display, video, ads in apps like Facebook and Instagram, and other types of digital advertising that we are all familiar with.The ad spaces offered by the  contain valuable information for the , such as the type of device where they will appear, the time of day, the location of the ad, the geographical location of the user, website information, and more. Now, while Advertisers could manually evaluate each auction one by one, as you can imagine, this would be very labor-intensive and resource-intensive. This is why there are tools called s  Demand-Side Platforms  that automate the process of evaluating the conditions proposed by the Publishers. They use algorithms to search and aggregate rates from different networks into a single platform and determine the optimal price to offer in the auction. Some well-known DSPs include The Trade Desk, Meta DSP, or Amazon DSP.Just as Advertisers use DSPs to evaluate multiple rates offered in Ad Exchanges like Google Ads and OpenX, Publishers like The Wall Street Journal have tools called s  Supply-Side Platforms  to connect with multiple Ad Exchanges instead of offering their inventory on just one platform. This strategy allows them to generate greater competition for their ad space, potentially leading to higher selling prices. SSPs help Publishers manage and optimize their ad inventory by providing tools to control and analyze the performance of their digital advertising. And . However, it's worth noting that there are enormous competitors in this space, such as Google, Amazon, and even Verizon, as can be seen in this  of SSPs used by US publishers.This complicates the task of gaining market share, given that Google and Amazon have almost complete vertical integration within the ecosystem. They function as DSPs, SSPs, Ad Exchanges, and even Publishers when digital ads are intended for platforms like Google Search or Amazon. Consequently, it may be more straightforward for clients to collaborate with these industry giants, renowned for their excellent reputation, rather than taking the risk of trying PubMatic's services.In the last 5 years, the company's revenues have experienced extraordinary annual growth of 28 , while maintaining high profitability, with the FCF margin averaging around 15 . However, in FY2022, it reached 20 .One positive aspect contributing to the company's cost control is its ownership of its own servers. Several years ago, the management team recognized that, to become a serious player in the industry, they should build their own servers rather than opting for the traditional approach taken by many technology companies, which is to outsource to Amazon AWS. This strategic decision has allowed them to maintain a relatively stable cost base and has been a key driver of operating leverage.In addition, the company has consistently maintained returns on its capital employed at around 15 . This suggests that a significant portion of profits can be reinvested into the company, as each investment generates a more than satisfactory return. The fact that the company is achieving substantial returns on its investments is particularly significant, given that it is allocating a significant amount of CapEx to the continued construction of its own data centers, as we will explore later.Since 2020, at least 10  of revenues has been allocated to CapEx, as mentioned earlier. This investment is primarily directed toward constructing their own data centers and gaining better control over their costs. As the company continues to scale and establish more data centers, it is likely that this CapEx spending will decrease, potentially impacting the Free Cash Flow Margin as it expands.Something I consider negative is that PubMatic faces the typical silent killer of technology companies  Stock-Based Compensation  SBC . In recent years, SBC has accounted for more than 20  of Free Cash Flow. This is a substantial amount, and I would prefer to deduct it from Free Cash Flow since it doesn't represent an actual cash inflow. SBC primarily serves as a means to attract talent without the need for cash payments.If PubMatic were to cease issuing shares as part of employee compensation, it could result in either the loss of employees or the necessity to pay them with cash. Neither of these scenarios seems positive, so it's common for SBC levels to be maintained in the medium and long term. By subtracting SBC from Free Cash Flow, the margin would be around 12 , which is quite a distance from the 20  seen in FY2022.For the valuation, I will perform a Reverse DCF analysis to determine the implied growth rate in the current share price based on FY2022 data. Here are the relevant figuresUsing this data and the stated assumptions, achieving a 15  compound annual growth rate on the current share price would require Free Cash Flow to grow by 15  annually. This growth rate appears quite realistic and could be realized through a combination of revenue growth and an expansion in the FCF margin, as discussed in the Key Ratios section.  The digital advertising technology space is highly competitive, featuring numerous established players and startups. As we've observed, Google, Amazon, and Meta are dominant figures across a significant portion of the ecosystem. Consequently, this intense competition can result in pricing pressures and diminished profit margins. Furthermore, the industry has been witnessing a trend toward consolidation, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones. PubMatic may face the risk of being acquired by a larger competitor or ceding market share to companies with greater resources. Rapid advancements in technology, including changes in ad formats, tracking regulations  such as GDPR and CCPA , and shifts in consumer behavior like the use of ad-blockers, can impact PubMatic's ability to provide effective advertising solutions. For instance, the Apple IDFA and Cookies issue emerged unexpectedly and temporarily disrupted the digital advertising industry. This is a highly dynamic industry that, as history has shown  with traditional advertising , can render businesses obsolete in a matter of just a few years. Economic downturns can result in reduced advertising budgets, directly impacting PubMatic's revenues as advertisers scale back their spending. In fact, we have already observed this trend over the last few quarters, with YoY growth slowing to less than 1  since Q4 2022.While PubMatic's role within the digital advertising ecosystem appears attractive, I find it challenging for PubMatic to emerge as the 'winning horse' when competing against giants like Google and Amazon. The fact that it ranked as the fourth most used SSP in 2021 is a positive sign. Additionally, the digital advertising market is expected to grow by around 13  in the coming years, which should provide tailwinds for the company. However, I remain uncertain about how PubMatic will sustain relevance in an industry where differentiation relies on easily replicable technology, especially when it is not even the largest competitor.Therefore, despite the current valuation not being unfavorable, I have chosen to assign it a  rating. I believe that there are better options available in the current market, some of which may be equally or even more affordable, particularly outside of the United States.

The 10-Year Treasury Rate May Be Heading Over 5%,"The 10-Year Treasury rate has exploded higher in recent weeks and may still have much further to climb. The yield moved above its October highs on Aug. 21, rising to 4.34 , its highest in a decade, and could reach 5  over the next severalSeveral factors are currently driving higher rates at the long end of the curve. One is the massive debt that the US government plans to issue. Another reason is that rates in Japan are rising after the Bank of Japan decided to increase the ceiling on its 10-year note to 1  from 50 bps. Japan's accommodative monetary policy has acted as an anchor helping to keep rates globally planted lower. Finally, growth in the US has been much more robust than expected, despite all of the rate hikes, and that could be a sign that the economy is just running atIf you look at the 10-year rate from a purely technical standpoint, it could be heading to around 5.05  on a conservative basis or 5.65  when viewing it more aggressively. The pattern formed over the last several months appears to be a bull flag, a continuation pattern of the previous move higher.But also from a fundamental perspective, since 1961, the US 10-year typically trades above the core PCE y y inflation rate. There have only been a few occasions the 10-year rate fell below the core PCE rate in 1974 and 1975. The other time was a fractional move below in 2011 and 2012, and 2016. The current period since 2020 has not only seen the 10-year rate trade below core PCE by the most significant amount but the most extended length of time. How high the 10-year rate needs to rise from here will primarily depend on the path of core inflation and how quickly it continues to come down.Additionally, over 10-year Treasury rates tend to trade with the velocity of money, just a simple ratio of nominal GDP divided by the money supply. In this case, the broadest measure of the velocity of money, or the velocity of MZM, has tended to have the strongest relationship with the 10-year Treasury rate. Now, MZM is no longer calculated as of the end of 2020. But since the year 2000, the velocity of M2, for the most part, followed the path of the velocity of MZM, and what the velocity of M2 shows us is the pace at which money passes through the economy is rising, something it hasn't done in many years.In its simplest form, the supply of M2 is shrinking while nominal GDP growth is rising, which tells us that the velocity of M2 or money, in general, is increasing  therefore, rates are rising. As long as we remain in a period where the velocity of M2 is pushing higher, it seems likely that momentum in Treasury rates will continue to go higher.One reason the M2 money supply is falling is that Bank deposits are falling  M2 money supply bank deposits track each other closely over time, suggesting that the recent turn higher in the M2 money supply isn't likely to last and may flatten out or turn lower from here again. As long as the economy remains solid and nominal growth continues to outpace growth in M2, then it seems probable that the velocity of M2 will increase again in the third quarter. The bond market may be anticipating that velocity increase, so rates are rising to accommodate that.While, in this case, the velocity of money doesn't tell us exactly where rates should be, it tells us that the dollars are circulating through the economy quickly, and there's great demand for goods and services. But with the money supply shrinking at the moment, it's creating a scenario of rising prices, which suggests that inflation will likely be sticking around until the money supply and economic growth come back into balance.The Fed is trying to deal with the demand side of the equation by raising rates and slowing economic growth. But given the size of nominal GDP growth, the US economy may require the creation of more money supply at this point to bring supply and demand back into balance.The recent 10-year rise may have to do with more structural changes to the economy and may reflect a market accepting that rates may be permanently higher for longer due to higher economic growth rates and slower growth in the money supply. This is likely to have broad impacts on valuations across many asset classes, including lower valuation for stocks, unless earnings growth rates can compensate for the higher risk-free rate of return. helps readers cut through all the noise delivering stock ideas and market updates, and looking for opportunities.We use a repeated and detailed process of watching the fundamental trends, technical charts, and options trading data.

URA ETF: A Gateway To The Uranium Industry,"Global X Uranium  is an ETF that tracks uranium equities. Here I describe the reasons to be bullish on uranium, the key element in the generation of nuclear energy.My analysis focuses onOn this occasion, I haven't focused my discussion on the supply-demand balance question facing uranium, but you can see this neatly described below in graphic form.Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear reactors, and utilities require uranium to meet the  that is expected to build into the middle of this decade, highlighted above.Without furtherI believe that nuclear energy has a crucial role to play in complementing green energy sources as we transition towards a more sustainable future. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are undoubtedly vital, they do have limitations, such as intermittency and energy storage challenges. Nuclear power offers a compelling solution by providing a steady, low-carbon source of electricity.I'll repeat this for emphasis. Nuclear power can replace our use of fossil fuels because it has four criteria.If you notice in the above 4 criteria, I could have said the same thing about fossil fuels. But nuclear energy brings one more important characteristic to the table, it's a low-carbon source. This makes nuclear power an essential ally in our battle against climate change. By integrating nuclear energy into the energy supply sources, we can make substantial strides in reducing our carbon footprint while ensuring a consistent power supply.Furthermore, nuclear power provides base load electricity generation, contributing to grid stability. While renewables rely on weather conditions, nuclear reactors can operate continuously, delivering a reliable source of electricity day and night. This reliability is crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring a consistent power supply, even when renewable sources face fluctuations in generation.What's more, above we see Siemens Energy's  share price, one of the biggest manufacturers of wind turbines.Wind turbines, despite their potential for generating renewable energy, often face economic challenges that hinder their viability for a complete energy transition. Yes, I've singled out Siemens, but you may read around, that the impact is broad across both onshore and offshore wind turbines. On top of that, putting aside the high upfront costs, maintaining wind turbines can be prohibitively high.However, I believe one of the biggest problems facing both solar and wind turbines is its struggle with electrical grid integration. This is something that I believe is missing from the discussion at a high level.Everyone is focusing on renewable energy's lack of reliability to consistently produce energy, but too few are considering the substantial amount of energy storage solutions required to make the system viable.Also, nuclear energy enhances energy security by . What I'm describing here is incorporating nuclear power into our energy mix, can bolster our energy resilience, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.Global X Uranium is an ETF that provides investors with exposure to companies involved in the uranium mining industry. By investing in this ETF, investors can gain exposure to the uranium industry without directly owning the underlying stocks of individual companies. The upside here is obvious, it's a case of diversification that helps spread the risk while offering the potential growth of the nuclear energy sector.As you can see above, nearly a quarter of this ETF is made up of Cameco . Consequently, if Cameco continues to perform strongly, this ETF will also perform strongly.It depends on one's view of uranium. Recall, that many of the companies in the EFT, outside Cameco and Kazatomprom  the world's biggest uranium producer  are not in production at this point. This means they have no revenues  or profits . Investors are buying into the future prospects of uranium.I've alluded to this above. Now to make it more explicit. Cameco is a great business. But they hedge their production to uranium prices, see below.There are some ladders built into Cameco's long-term contracts, but for the most part, Personally, I've sought to invest in Uranium Energy Corporation , as that business is fully unhedged. But as you know, that implies substantial volatility. Something you will not get with URA.I'm bullish on Global X Uranium  URA . The rationale behind my optimism centers on nuclear energy's pivotal role as a complementary source of green energy. While renewables like solar and wind are crucial, they face limitations like intermittency and storage challenges.Investing in Global X Uranium allows exposure to the uranium mining industry without directly owning individual company stocks. This ETF's diversification spreads risk while capitalizing on the potential growth of the nuclear energy sector. It's important to note that a significant portion of this ETF is tied to Cameco, which can positively impact URA's performance if Cameco continues to perform well. However, one drawback of investing in Global X Uranium is that it may not benefit significantly from surging uranium prices due to its hedging. For those seeking less hedged exposure, businesses like Uranium Energy Corporation  UEC  might be worth considering, although they will come with greater volatility than URA. It very much depends on one's risk appetite and tolerance.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

"Heartland Express Looks Undervalued, But The Trucking Cycle Has Struggled To Find A Bottom In 2023","One of the challenges of investing in cyclical companies is that no two cycles are ever the same and that creates a lot of modeling challenges. In the truckload  or TL  part of the trucking industry, for instance, capacity has been slower toThis makes sense - smaller carriers went into this downturn with more cash in the bank after the boom, so could withstand lower rates for longer, and inventories were inflated by companies needing to keep higher inventories on hand to offset supply chain risk   but it has nevertheless complicated modeling and led to a lot of disappointment this year. In particular, both shipping volumes and pricing have been weaker than I expected and what looked like a 2H 23 recovery is nowSince ,  shares have lost a little less than 10  of their value. That s not too bad relative to other TL carriers   is down 13 ,   is down over 10 , and   is down 15 , while   is down about 2 , but I wasn t recommending Heartland as an early-stage trucking recovery play on the basis of smaller losses  though the stock did work modestly for about four months . At this point I do think Heartland remains undervalued and I think the trucking cycle is bottoming out, but thus far lights at the end of the tunnel have been additional oncoming trains, so I understand investors wanting to stay away until there s real evidence of an upturn.Every trucking cycle is different and every trucking cycle is the same.What I mean by that is that boom times drive strong increases in rates and small capacity providers push into the market to get their piece of the pie. Eventually the economy freight demand cools, that balance of capacity supply and demand shifts to excess and prices start falling. Those falling prices pinch established carriers like Heartland and Knight-Swift, but they re even more damaging to small carriers and eventually that capacity is forced out of the market. Then the economy freight demand recovers, there s insufficient capacity to meet that new demand and we do it all over again.This cycle has followed that basic pattern, but with some important twists. The pandemic hammered capacity, with reduced demand idling drivers and many older owner operators deciding to leave the business. At the same time, the post-pandemic period saw a surge in business activity and shipping demand, leading to a big swing in rates and demand for capacity  which, in turn, drove demand for truck brokerage services from companies like  , Knight-Swift,  , et al .The net effect of all of this is that shipping demand was far higher than normal, capacity came in to meet it, and rates were quite healthy. That generated substantial cash for smaller operators, and that cash is part of the reason why this downturn has been stretched out. Dry van spot rates are down about 16  year-over-year as of early October, and while the rate declines seen in 2023 would normally be enough to push a lot of capacity out of the market  rates have been below cash operating costs for small operators for some time , those operators have been able to rely upon and draw down that cash built up during the boom.The bottom line for Heartland is pretty simple. Freight demand has fallen off considerably in 2023, due in part to a significant inventory destocking cycle, and with too much capacity in the market  and larger carriers reluctant to let go of drivers , prices and profitability have crumbled.There have been some signs of a bottom here of late. The big inventory correction cycle seems to be petering out, and there is some evidence that this year s peak season may be stronger as demand still hasn t fallen off too bad. Capacity has started to leave the market  but is still too high  and prices seem to be bumping along at low levels.A big part of the Heartland story for 2023-2025 was  and still is  the synergy opportunities from integrating the large Smith and CFI acquisitions  both of which closed in 2022 . Neither of these carriers operate as efficiently as Heartland, and driving costs out of these businesses and bringing them in line with core Heartland efficiency  management has targeted low-80 s for operating ratios  was going to be a meaningful earnings driver.That story can still work, but it s very much on hold for now. With revenue  excluding fuel  basically flat on an organic basis in the second quarter, there just isn t enough volume and price leverage to drive those efficiencies. Not only is Heartland not operating its fleet at maximum efficiency  more deadhead miles, fewer overall shipments, et al , operating costs are higher with inflation in wages, parts, and so on. That s driven the overall operating ratio back into the mid-90 s  adjusted , with Smith and CFI both in the high-90 s in the last quarter.Heartland is also reaping less benefit from gains on sale. Heartland maintains a very modern fleet, typically selling tractors after around two years of use. Keeping the fleet age low reduces operating and maintenance costs and keeps drivers happier, but Heartland generally relies on smaller carriers to buy their used equipment. With capacity exiting the market, though, that demand has dried up and gains on sale have shrunk this year  in response management has also cut back on its net capex, leading to modest creep in average tractor age  2.1 years versus 1.9 in the last quarter .I don t see any reason to expect that third quarter earnings will be strong. Around six months ago the Street was expecting  0.25 in EPS for the third quarter, and even 90 days ago the estimate was still  0.19. Now the expectation is  0.08 and I wouldn t be shocked if the company misses due to a higher operating ratio. Likewise, I think the Street very much wants to hear that not only has the market bottomed, but there are already signs of improving demand, including a stronger peak season. I do think that may be too much to hope for, and I see a risk of a lackluster peak season and an extended  bumping along the bottom , as I don t expect a big inventory rebuild cycle, nor a strong retail season.Heartland really doesn t do spot-rate business, but spot rates do inform contract rates, and I see a risk that large carriers like Heartland will be in a poor bargaining position for the next round of rate negotiations. There just isn t a lot of demand now and even though carriers like Heartland will argue that they need rate support to offset operating costs, customers likely won t see a compelling need to pay up. The risk, then, is that while the market does recover in 2024 from a volume standpoint, price could still be a headwind and that the real recovery gets pushed into 2025.I m still looking for long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4  to 5 , but a lot of that comes from the bump this year from the Smith and CFI deals. Long term, I expect core growth to be more on the order of 2 . Further consolidation could offer some upside, but time will tell. On the margin side, I do expect a significant decline in free cash flow margins in FY 23 and FY 24 as the company absorbs higher operating costs and resumes capex in FY 24. Longer term, I still think low-to-mid-teens FCF margins are attainable, driving mid-single-digit normalized FCF growth.While Heartland does look undervalued on a discounted cash flow approach, the intense cyclicality of the business makes it very difficult to rely on long-term modeling. Turning to multiple-based approaches like EV EBITDA and P E is not much easier, given the challenges in selecting the right multiples and earnings numbers   2022, 2023, and 2024 results aren t really representative of normal operating conditions.I can use  1 in EPS for 2025 and a 17x long-term cycle average PE to generate a  17 target, but it s worth noting that that 2025 number has come down sharply in six months. Likewise, I can argue for a 6.5x multiple on 2023 EBITDA  which gives me an  18 target , but at some point you have to be wary of picking numbers that give you the result you want   to that point, if I look at prior P Es on trough earnings, it would seem that 30x my 2023 EPS estimate of  0.42 would be appropriate, and that only gets me to  12.60 for a fair value.I do think that Heartland shares are undervalued and that the trucking cycle has bottomed out, but I also thought that six months ago and that was clearly the wrong call. I think investors can do okay from here with these shares, but I can t guarantee that there won t be another round of guidance expectation cuts as this correction drags on into 2024. If you can take the risk of being early, this is a name to consider but it s definitely not for those investors who struggle to cope with uncertainty.

And welcome to the Prologis Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Operator InstructionsAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jill Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin.Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.I d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management s beliefs and assumptions.Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer toAdditionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.I d likeWith that, I will hand the call over to Tim.Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely, growing supply translating to increased market vacancy, continued moderation of demand, and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time.We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What s incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it s had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand.In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth.We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values.In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of  1.33 per share. This result includes approximately  0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q A.Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5 , aided by retention of 77 . Net effective rent change was a record 84  at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200 , Toronto at 187  and Southern California at 165 . Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3  and 9.5 , respectively, driven predominantly by rent change.We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62  as of September.We raised approximately  1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2 , comprised principally of  760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record  6.9 billion of liquidity.Finally, it s noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA.Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points.At the macro level, our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters. Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low.Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters.In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it s clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what s also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment.In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter.Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2  as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed.From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3  while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn t too surprising as the Fed s language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the burn  ph  at just 50 basis points.We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5 , while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5 , a write-down that we don t believe has fully run its course.Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately  180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of  115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of  1.6 billion to approximately  700 million or roughly 2  of third-party AUMs.In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing  1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank.Also notable is the acquisition of  118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over  40 billion.We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity.Moving to guidance. We are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25  and 97.5 . As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9  to 9.25  on a net effective basis and 9.75  to 10  on a cash basis.We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of  520 million to  530 million and adjusting G A guidance to range between  390 million and  395 million.Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of  3 billion to  3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have  500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of  1.7 billion to  2.3 billion.In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of  3.30 per share to  3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of  5.58 per share to  5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between  5.08 per share and  5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5 .I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I d like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio.In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that s been central to our strategy and management as a company.I d like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release.And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks  You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there s -- you are calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and that s before the lower development starts hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024  Thanks.Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the  Technical DifficultyAnd the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Hey, guys. Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me, because I am having trouble hearing you. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts  And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center salesLadies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We are just having a little technical difficulty here. Thank you. Please remain on the line.I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can t really explain it.Hello.Can you guys hear me  You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn t great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that s why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations.The reason occupancy is higher, it s unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before.I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here.But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high-quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets.And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it s going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it s lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that.Now, strategically, this is important to understand. We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions.You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That s where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it s more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data centerWell, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can t be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward.What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin.And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter, I think, you have got something like  1.9 billion of planned starts, given that you have done about  1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial  And if so, kind of what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume  Thanks.Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion s share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it s about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now.As we talk about market development starts now at 65  -- I guess down 65  from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume.Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit.Correct.And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Thanks. Question, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That s down from 2.5  last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframeHey, Todd. It s Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation.And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Hi, everyone. Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it s not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly. You did the  3 billion acquisition mid-year. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today  Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from, maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should beSure. It s a dynamic market and I think that s the essence of your question. It s really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here s a model for thinking about it.First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn t want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don t expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100  whole portfolios.Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5 , 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5 s, low 6  IRRs. Let s stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6 .So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9  on leveraged IRR and that s if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there s going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those.I don t think there s going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9  handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5  depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to addThe only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it s value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it s really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns.And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I am wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that  And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023.Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It s hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question  Oh, occupancy trade-off.Occupancy.It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20  of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80  of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change  And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65  and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60  or 70  of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there s no sense really going cheap, it s just. But I would say 20  of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy.And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.Oh  Thanks. Just a two-porter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire, if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity. And then, secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolioWell, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40  of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues.It s too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that s going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows.About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California.I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anythingYeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer.And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. First, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis  And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there s little that could change your core outlook from here, but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end. What could change your views more positively or negatively  Thank you.Hey, Camille. It s Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2  decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don t expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don t think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance.And the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Hey. Just a quick two-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually  Is it  200 million, is it  500 million, like how big can this get is the follow-up number one. And then number two on sort of the rent growth, appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers, but as you are sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one, potentially being sort of a headwind  Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year  Thanks.Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that s what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date.And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second partYeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that s going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth.As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it s probably fair to point to Tim s comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it s Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that s what I would look to.And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. I guess one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7  to 9 . I don t know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forwardSo, hey, the view is 7  in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I d like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information.And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks. How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023  Now, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there s going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023. I mean, is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bitHi. Thanks for the question. Again, it s Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider.And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline s going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it s really timing as it relates to that gap.Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out.But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days.And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. I just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across SoCal -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think, you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion  And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, six months to monthsSo the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn t conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that s been flat all year.In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there s that dispersion.And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Hi. I know you have used land in the past for higher and better uses, but do you think you would be looking at these development, the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren t seeing a normalizing of a traditional industrial demandAbsolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum.And by the way, let s not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years.So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it s been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can t get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand.And the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I am wondering if you are seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9  ROE returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer waltz or how do you get that if we don t see distress among current holders or owners  Thanks.So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85  plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don t think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle.And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions.We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn t move around that much.Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it s one consideration, so are all these other factors.And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit, but guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and one-time items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don t expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the  0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There s about  0.02 there I would call that, that s permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter.So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that  0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let s call it  1.30 million to  1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what s implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We are going to add -- probably add  0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter.And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6 . Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate.We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That s at 3 . So in the short-term, that s a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development s ramp.And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that picked down a little bit this quarter, I was wondering if you can provide any more color around that. And second, if you look at the larger development landscape and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks probably increases as we move forward. I am not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forwardHey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it s our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline.Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today s retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels.Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended.So actually, I think, what s going to happen is that they can t really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this.So don t be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it s -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65  decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market.So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that s why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20  all this time. This is when we put it to work.And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. I have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20  of your markets you are managing for occupancy not pushing rent. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power todaySure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland.And China.And China and I think I d offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix.And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.I just wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring team that we are hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon as they have put a lot of capital into the coast and across the country. I am just wondering sort of when you marry those two things together, is there sort of greater investment moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets  Is that an opportunity for PLD going forwardSo, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there s a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It s not all in China and it had been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to western China and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia.But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It s just not going to be all from China. But the container doesn t care whether it s coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports.Secondly, demand in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship. So the warehouse is a truck or a ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn t generate a lot of demand.When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that s when the demand is generated for deconsolidation. Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country, because that s where the consumption is and those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets.So we don t think the dynamic of on-shoring to the extent that it exists is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of on-shoring has been actually near-shoring and it s been in northern Mexico.Northern Mexico markets are 100  occupied and there s insatiable demand for product in those markets and most of that is for distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes. So that s where we have seen the material demand.If there s more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., A, we haven t really seen it and if we do see it, we will be the beneficiary of it because we are well positioned in those central markets as well.And our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Great. Thanks. Hamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you are thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability and maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at allYeah. I think the effect is going to be indirect, because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we are not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk and all of a sudden we have some drop off in demand, because that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to  200 a barrel. I mean, the bets are off.But boy, if we see that scenario, I can t think of a better business to want to be in and I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually on a relative basis, it should be good for our business, because it will mean that people will, first of all, inventory becomes really important and it means that -- it s yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we have seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case.So I hate to say it would be good because it s an awful situation that s going there and before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed and I don t want to see this happen. But I don t think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible. I am honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict.I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. Really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day and I promise it will be really good. So take care.This concludes today s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",3,2023-10-17T16:10:18.000-04:00
"As Yields March Higher, JAVA's Value Proposition Remains Unconvincing","I started covering the JPMorgan Active Value ETF  in , with a Hold rating. There are two main reasons why I am presenting an update today. First, the portfolio of this exchange-traded fund has seen a few changes, small wonderJAVA was launched in October 2021 and has amassed an AUM of about  606.5 million since then.The JPMorgan  says the fund has an  actively managed investment strategy that seeks to deliver a style pure U.S. large cap value equity portfolio  as it  employs a fundamental, bottom-up approach to identify quality companies at attractive valuations.As an actively managed vehicle, JAVA has the luxury of boosting exposure to stocks it considers capable of contributing to better performance compared to the Russell 1000 Value index, its , and, by the same token, to sell names that no longer have target characteristics without being constrained by an underlying index's rebalancing reconstitution rules, which is the case with its passively managed counterparts.Analyzing the JAVA portfolio as of October 17, I have found out that 15 companies were removed  in the August version, their combined weight was about 3.6 . The 3 most notable deletions were Qorvo , a semiconductor industry player, US Foods Holding , a food distributor, and KeyCorp , a Cleveland-based diversified bank.At the same time, 9 companies were added, with Royal Caribbean Cruises , Globe Life , and Silgan Holdings  having the largest weights.In all, in the current iteration, there are 150 stocks and REITs in the basket, compared to 156 previously. As of the August article, JAVA's  stood at 56  since then, it has risen to 80 .Interestingly, JAVA's sector mix has changed only slightly, principally driven by capital appreciation depreciation of the holdings, with healthcare and energy gaining 1.9  and 1.5 , and financials and IT losing 1.87  and 1.57 , respectively.Despite JAVA falling by almost 7 , its factor mix has not changed much, as the table below demonstrates.Since my article was published on August 7, JAVA has declined by almost 7 .But what were the major culprits  To answer that question, I have analyzed the performance of 141 stocks that were present in both the August 4 and October 17 versions of the portfolio  I have not taken into account newcomers and removed stocks since I was not tracking the portfolio between these dates, and I have no data on when exactly these positions were added or deleted.As it can be seen on the chart above, a few holdings did deliver a positive price return over that period, including Eli Lilly and Company  LLY's stock price surged by  35.1  amid the GLP-1 drug hype. But those that were in the red dominated nonetheless. More specifically, while 39 companies delivered gains, 102 saw their stock prices go down, with negative returns ranging from just a few bps to almost 31  in the case of Dollar General . The top 5 detractors, including DG, are compiled in the following table  the tables below are based on metrics calculated using data from Seeking Alpha and JAVA, unless otherwise noted .All the energy holdings in the group that I analyzed, which are predominantly represented by supermajors and E P companies, delivered gains ranging from 4.6  in the case of EOG to 14.4  in the case of FANG. The primary reason is obvious  the supply and demand concerns in the oil market have pushed the price of the commodity higher.At the same time, all the materials companies were in the red.Overall, for a better context, below are the median returns for each sector. The data show materials, utilities, and consumer staples were the essential detrators.Also, it is worth providing an update on annualized returns and other relevant performance parameters. Compared to the previous article, data for August and September were added. The period in focus now is November 2021-September 2023.The good news is that while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF , which is a passively managed fund tracking JAVA's benchmark, and the iShares Core S P 500 ETF  now have negative annualized returns over the period concerned compared to the low-single-digit CAGRs they had as of end-July, JAVA is still in the green, and its standard deviation is still the lowest.However, since the beginning of the year, JAVA has outperformed IWD by just 18 bps.Actively managed JAVA puts emphasis on value and quality factors in creating its large-cap-heavy portfolio. However, the issue is that, though its quality exposure is significant, I am not that optimistic regarding value. That is to say, I believe its value proposition remains unconvincing in the current environment, with interest rates  the central concern. I see no meaningful reason for an upgrade.

"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce: Better, But Still Bad","Canada can be a myopic place. There, I wrote it. In some ways, this is understandable. If your next door neighbour was very loud, very friendly, blasted movies and music at you 24 7, and occasionally fired off a few hundred bazooka rounds in their big backyard with theWith all that out of the way, it s time to venture down the rabbit hole of writing about yet another beloved Canadian bank. This time, I m going to review the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , known from this time forward in my article as  CIBC.  I m also going to try to address some of the responses to my Royal Bank article in this one. I m going to start my discussion of this bank with a few more points about residential real estate in Canada. I ll also include portions of an email exchange I had with a member of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions  OSFI , Canada s banking regulator.I know that my writing can be, uh,  a bit much , and for that reason I post a thesis statement paragraph very near the beginning of each of my articles. This gives investors the chance to review my thinking and then get out before they re exposed to too many bad jokes, and too much proper spelling. I think it behooves investors to seek the best risk adjusted returns, and I think the risk here is too great. The financial snapshot is not particularly inspiring in my view, and the exposure to Canadian residential real estate is troubling in my view. The mortgage book has grown dramatically over the past few years, so this problem has gotten worse not better. Additionally, those who think the regulators are going to  cut the banks some slack  in the parlance of our times, are in for a rude shock. Before getting into CIBC specific financials, though, I continue to dismantle the bullish case for Canadian residential real estate that I started when I wrote about Royal Bank of Canada yesterday.In this first section I want to make a few more arguments for why I think residential real estate in Canada is a ridiculous investment. For more, please review my article on Royal Bank. In my view, the fortunes of Canadian banks are inexorably tied to residential real estate for two reasons. First, and most directly, much of the growth the  big five  have enjoyed over the past several years has come from mortgages, and I think this growth will inevitably slow. Second, Canadian banks, particularly Royal and CIBC,  go as the Canadian economy goes.  The Canadian economy goes as Canadian residential real estate goes, and thus, a drop in residential real estate prices will have a knock on negative wealth effect for Canadians, which will harm loan growth. This will harm bank profits, obviously.The people who are aware of the coming population crisis in the developed world will tell you that the problem will be solved with immigration.This isn t just a Canadian phenomenon, because I ve heard the same solutions offered by Europeans, and Australians. When the subject of the demographic timebomb comes up in conversation, nearly every person I ve talked to says some variation of  immigrants will solve the problem.  Well, that s great in theory, and I ll admit that Canada has been very welcoming to immigrants since about 1970, but immigrants are increasingly being wooed by a number of places that aren t unbelievably cold.Even with a welcoming immigration culture, though, population growth has been anemic for decades. For instance, in 1970, the population of the country was about 21.4 million people. Today, the population is about 39 million people, so it s grown at a CAGR of about 1.12  over the past 53 years. This is because people also emigrate, and they also die. Further, the United Nations is projecting that Canadian population growth rate will actually slow to a CAGR of about 0.58  over the next 30 .Add to that the fact that prices are  dramatically, and the  immigrants to the rescue  thesis seems even more absurd in my view. To sum up so far, in order to be bullish on residential real estate in Canada, you need to believe that the country will buck a 53 year trend and will start to grow more rapidly, in spite of what the United Nations is suggesting. Additionally, immigrants are going to want to flock to the place, in spite of the fact that Canada has some of the most expensive housing stock on Earth. What would be the marketing pitch to immigrants   Come for the sometimes deadly cold, stay for the unaffordability of our housingIt s time to write about supply. I would strongly agree with the notion that there s a housing supply  in Canada. In my view, people misinterpret this, though. They take from this shortage of supply that prices will remain elevated. In my view, this justification of current house prices ignores a key element of the supply-demand relationship  demand. Demand for housing may be very inelastic, but the population is, as the kids say,  tapped out , so they cannot afford continuously elevated prices, and thus price has nowhere to go but down. This is exactly what happened to Canadian residential real estate in the months after the above article from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation  was published. Prices have fallen in spite of the housing supply shortage mentioned by CMHC.I admit that I forget the class at which I learned this, but I remember being tied to the oar of the MBA slave ship and hearing something about  supply and demand are not constants.  Translated, this means that sometimes supply is the pre-eminent determinant of price, and sometimes demand. I think falling prices in the teeth of a housing shortage convinces me that demand is key here.I think the stress test, elevated interest rates, sclerotic population growth, the fact that Canadians, especially younger households, are some of the most  people on Earth. Younger households are particularly important to real estate demand for pretty obvious reasons. In my view, all of this conspires to make residential real estate a risky bet in Canada, shortage or no shortage.Because a larger proportion of my audience for this article is likely Canadian, and I ve just uttered some blasphemies, I ll make the point by analogy. Let s pretend that the year s 1636 and a smaller and smaller percentage of the Dutch population can afford those beautiful Semper Augustus tulips that everyone s always going on about. At some point, the price will have to fall, no matter how beautiful the resulting flowers.That quick little analogy to tulipmania reminds me of a chart I included in yesterday s article about Royal Bank. It s relevant here, too, so, once again, feast your eyes on the relationship between income and house prices. Pay particular attention to that little spike of American house prices above affordability in 2008. Doesn t it look kind of quaint when compared to the Canadian  leviathan bubbleSo, if you re buying CIBC based on the assumption that the past growth in the mortgage book will be repeated, I would suggest that you reconsider that notion. In my view, residential real estate is increasingly unaffordable in Canada, and this will impact mortgage loan growth. It may also impact the bank in unprecedented ways. The  ways  are unprecedented because we have no historical record of anything like this.I think when talking about Canadian banks, it would be a good idea to have an interaction with the one institution that they all seem to be terrified of  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions  OSFI , so I reached out to those good people via electronic mail, or  e-mail  as the young people call it.A few real estate bulls I ve talked to over the past while have suggested that people who took on huge mortgages to buy overpriced real estate will be fine, because the banks are just going to extend their amortization schedules to keep things nice and affordable. I reached out to OSFI to clarify this point. Below I ve reproduced my question, and the response from the official.So, we can dispense with the idea that people will be fine because they can simply extend.Before we leave our discussion of OSFI, it seems that they re imposing new capital requirements on lenders. To  them directlyTo beat the proverbial dead horse as is my wont, if the  Value  in  loan-to-value  declines as I think it will, this will impose greater capital requirements on the banks, which is not a wonderful development from their perspective.Returning to the discussion on CIBC, when reviewing the financial performance here over the past several years, a few elements pop off the virtual page at me. First, the most recent six months has been less profitable than the previous year, in spite of an uptick in revenue. Rising sales and falling profits is never a great sign in my view. Additionally, we can t blame this on an unfortunate comparison period, given that net income over the past two quarters was about 17  lower than it was during the same period in 2019. I think a fair point could be made to suggest that the company hasn t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability.At the same time, the capital structure has deteriorated somewhat in my view, with total liabilities up from the previous year by about  33 million, or 3.9 .Most worrying of all, from my point of view, is the fact that the mortgage book is today about 30  greater than it was in 2019, and now sits around  271.4 billion. For reference, shareholder equity currently sits at about  51.51 billion. Using the arithmetic skills not so lovingly beaten into me by the good sisters at Holy Spirit School many decades ago, I ve managed to work out that equity represents about 19  of the current mortgage book.All of this suggests to me that I d need to be compensated for taking on the risks associated with this business. I d be compensated for that with a higher than usual dividend yield, or a cheaper than usual stock.As my regulars know, I look for stocks that are trading at a discount to both their own history and the overall market. This is because I think cheap stocks represent that perfect combination of lower risk and higher return potential. They re lower risk because much of the bad news has already been  baked in  to the price, so new bad news won t drive things much lower. They offer great potential returns because any moderately good news drives the shares higher. Incidentally, this  keep expectations limited  has been the primary strategy I ve used in my dating life, and it s worked out pretty well, for me at least.Anyway, I measure cheapness in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like sales, earnings, free cash flow, and the like. I d note that CIBC shares are cheaper than the overall market at the moment, but are hardly cheap when judged against their own history. This is troubling in my view, because the level of risk here has risen materially. The one thing the stock has going for it, though, is the fact that the shares are sporting a positive risk premium at the moment.Source  YChartsSource  YChartsThe question for most investors is whether this dividend yield is worth the risk here  Specifically, in the Great White , you re picking up an extra 124 basis points over the risk free rate, while in the land of the free and the home of the brave, you re picking up only 72 basis  of extra yield over risk free government instruments. I like the fact that the dividend yield is at least positive, but I think the premia remains light, given the risks here. For that reason, I would recommend eschewing shares of CIBC and putting new capital to work in investments with a superior combination of risk and return.

Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,"The U.S. economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasn't been witnessed since 1949  a shrinking money supply. M2 has declined by a whopping  700 billion since the hiking cycle began. This phenomenon is In this article, we will explore why the U.S. money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscape.The recent contraction in the U.S. money supply is not solely due to a single, isolated cause. Rather, it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, financial innovations, and shifts in market dynamics.We will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening. The Fed has been reducing its massive  8 trillion balance sheet  so far to the tune of  800 billion , which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as they reach maturity, it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money. Additionally, rising interest rates - which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets - have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in low-yield savings and checking accounts, leading to a decline in deposits Moreover, the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions, while the years of ultra-low interest rates, the growing digitization of financial markets, and the rise of user-friendly commission-free trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits. Yes, interest rates have risen recently, but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings account.These three major factors have led to a staggering  2.4 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022.So what does the shrinking U.S. money supply mean for SPY  The reality is quite nuanced.One of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates, though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex. Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income assets more attractive relative to stocks. As investors seek higher yields in bonds, there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY, thereby hurting its performance. We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPY's performanceConversely, when interest rates are very low, investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks, driving their prices higher due to increased demand. This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that - when market interest rates rise - it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects, leading to higher interest payments and lower profits. In some cases, projects may become unfeasible. Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a company's future earnings. Conversely, when interest rates fall, companies can borrow more easily, boosting profits and economic growth. A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners , where management just  its target growth rate in half due to a soaring cost of capital.Moreover, Goldman Sachs  that interest rates are one of the more reliable indicators for estimating the impact of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on the economy, which in turn can assist us with predicting SPY performance. In fact, one of the more prominent S P 500 valuation models in use today is known as the That said, while interest rates certainly do  in the behavior of stock markets, they are also influenced by a myriad of other factors, including investor sentiment, economic conditions, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events. While changes in the money supply can play a role in shaping economic conditions, they are just one piece of the broader puzzle. As a result, historical data reveals that relying solely on monetary aggregates for predicting market performance can be unreliable.Fortunately for SPY, its  are in cash-rich technology mega-cap stocks like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Nvidia , Alphabet , , Tesla , and Meta  as well as one of the strongest conglomerates in the world in Berkshire Hathaway , This should make it more resistant to higher for longer interest rates than some other financial instruments out there. That said, there are still reasons to be concerned. First of all, SPY is quite overvalued based on several leading valuation models such as the Buffett Indicator, the Price Earnings Model, the S P 500 Mean Reversion Model, and the Yield Curve Model.Moreover, as a  pointed outWhen a contraction in the money supply is coupled with inflation, such as we are seeing now, there is an elevated threat of the market and broader economy experiencing a deflationary crash. This would undoubtedly have a terrible impact on SPY. Similar circumstances occurred in the post-World War I era and the Spanish Flu pandemic, resulting in 11  deflation and high unemployment. A mere -2  contraction in the money supply in 1921 triggered this deflationary depression, and currently, in 2023, we are already at a -2  contraction. This suggests that the economy's resilience and the current inflation may not be as robust as believed.While the money supply in 2023 is substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, history indicates that depressions and deflation do not require a linear decrease in the money supply but can result from even a slight contraction of 2-4  year-on-year. Many expect the current inflation to persist indefinitely, akin to the 1970s, but the key difference is that the Federal Reserve is engaged in Quantitative Tightening right now, causing the money supply to contract. As a result, economic history seems to indicate that a deflationary depression in the near future is a possibility unless the Federal Reserve changes course away from QT.The currently shrinking U.S. money supply is a historically rare and complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, and financial innovation. While there are reasons to believe that it could bode poorly for SPY - particularly given that rising interest rates often follow and are mechanically bad for equity valuations, SPY appears to be overvalued based on numerous models, and a shrinking money supply dramatically increases the chances of depression - it is also important to keep in mind that the relationship between the money supply and stock market performance is not straightforward.As a result, while this analysis does lead us to be bearish on SPY and rate it a Sell, we do not think that long-term investors should overreact, sell everything, and  head for the hills  in a panic. However, it does emphasize the importance of proper diversification and having a financial plan that does not depend on liquidating SPY shares for several years to come.

Buy MGIC: This Time Mortgage Credit Really Is Different,"First, I know I write incessantly about private mortgage insurers. I can t help it. I just think they are generally ignored and frequently misunderstood when not ignored. Most importantly, I am confident they remain quite cheap to their likely outcomesSecond, a shout-out to me. Yes, pretty obnoxious. But my last piece on MGIC  was a compare-and-contrast piece versus Redfin , a related company in the housing space. Seeking Alpha published my article  on July 12, barely four weeks ago. Since then, MGIC is up 10  and Redfin is down 34 . Hopefully this fact will get you to read further down in this article.43 years  So the current state of mortgage credit  pretty different from what we have experienced during our investing lives.  It is different this time for this combination of reasonsMortgage defaults rise when some combination of three events occurI ll address the home price decline risk first. The law of supply and demand says that prices of any product fall when there is an excess of supply. In housing, a supply excess is indicated by a high vacancy rate. You judge from this chart whether single-family housing has excess supplyThe exact opposite of excess supply. Housing vacancies haven t been this low in our investing lifetime  It would take many years of overbuilding to create excess housing. So the risk of a sharp decline in home prices seems remote. Even the dramatic rise in mortgage rates from 3  to 7  over the past 1½ years barely dented home prices.Again I rely on the supply demand law. A sharp fall in demand for labor always creates the risk of rising unemployment. But we also need to keep on eye on growth in the supply of labor. So let s do that. This chart shows changes in the U.S. rate of change in the labor force, measured as 5-year rolling averages to smooth out temporary blips. I then added the unemployment rate, against using a 5-year averageThe chart clearly shows that labor force growth has slowed a lot over the past four decades, helping the unemployment rate trend lower. In fact, unfilled jobs currently total nearly 10 million, about double the average over the last few decades.So yes, a rise in unemployment due to a sharp decline in demand will be a risk for mortgage insurers. But that risk is lower than average now because of a material labor shortage.Perhaps the most important risk of rising mortgage defaults is caused by weak mortgage lending standards. And this is the best news yet.The mortgage industry and the MI s in particular have generated outstanding quality home loans for well over a decade. For proof, I turn first to more MBA data, this time a historical index of mortgage lending standardsMore evidence of conservative lending standards is supplied by looking at the share of mortgage debt outstanding underwritten by the private sector, not the government   Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA VA. You might expect that government programs would be looser than private business loans, but that was not the case during the early  00 s housing bubble  the risky subprime and other whacky loans were very largely private sector products. Private sector credit was 33  of total home loans in  09. That percentage is now below 20MGIC s shift to more conservative lending has been radical, as shown by this history of paid claims on mortgage defaultsThis chart is stunning. Claims payments this year will be the lowest since at least 1995, as far back as currently available data. And compare the  45 million or so of claims payments this year to 2005, the peak of the early  00 s housing bubble. Default payments in  05 were  612 million. times largerAnd if the economy takes a big hit  86  of MGIC s risk is covered by reinsurance that pays in the event of a material recession.Again, home loan quality different this time.MGIC s operating EPS was  0.60, after my adjustment for loss reserve accounting, which added  0.08 to MGIC s reported operating EPS. That compares to  0.53  my estimate  a year ago. The results were good enough to cause Wall Street analysts to raise their average  23 EPS estimate to  2.31 from  2.15.Claims paid were a mere  12 million on a  292 billion insurance book. That is a tiny 1.6 bp loss rate. But nearly 70  of the claims MGIC paid were from loans originated prior to 2009  That means the insurance MGIC wrote since 2009 had a Q2 loss rate of a miniscule 0.7 bp. This time is different.Two more pieces of good news from Q2MGIC will generate about  700 million of cash flow this year, or about  2.50 per share. That is a 14  return on the stock price. And basically all of that cash flow can be paid to shareholders. That s because MGIC has  1.3 billion of excess capital above its regulatory capital requirement plus a 40  capital cushion.In fact, during the first half of this year MGIC paid shareholders  59 million in dividends and  150 million in share repurchases, for an 8  annualized return to shareholders. I expect it to return more to shareholders.MGIC can very comfortably use  350 million of cash flow per year to buy back stock. At the current price, that means a 7  decline to shares outstanding, and a therefore a 7  annual increase in cash flow per share without any increase in dollar earnings. Not bad for a stock with a 14  current cash flow yield.I believe that  25 is a conservative valuation for MGIC. Its cash return would then be 10 , with a 5-7  growth rate for the foreseeable future. That s a 40  upside.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

Mid-America Apartment Communities: 4% Yielder Positioned For A Solid Performance,"Mid-America Apartment Communities  is a pure-play U.S. apartment REIT and is one of the few REITs included in the S P 500. As of June 30, 2023, MAA had over 101,000 apartment homes in its portfolio spread across 16 states and the DistrictMost of the apartment buildings are of a high quality, where 92  of all buildings are classified as B  or higher.The existing tenant base is also greatly diversified with no major exposures towards a particular segment of economy.All in all, MAA can be considered a rather defensive REIT with an exposure towards specific REIT sector, which enjoys secular tailwinds and if properly managed can deliver stable and predictable returns going forward.Typically, apartment REITs have the optionality to grow organically via directing part of the total CapEx spend towards improving or redeveloping the existing asset stock. Acquisitions, which are based on higher cap rates than the cost of capital also play an important role, but usually are more procyclical depending on the prevailing spread  cap rates - WACC  and company's ability to attract sound financing.We can see that in MAA's case the net acquisitions for 2023 are projected to land at  400 million, which accounts for roughly 2.5  of the total market cap. This is conservative.The chart above reflecting MAA's dividend history is a clear testament of the Company's conservatism and stability, which have supported 117 consecutive dividend payments with some growth component attach almost each year.At the same time, MAA has managed to register more solid dividend hikes in the past two years by capitalizing on the prevailing sector-specific tailwinds  i.e., favourable supply and demand dynamics, which put an upward pressure on the rent levels  and its fortress balance sheet.In my humble opinion, MAA is positioned to deliver superior returns relative to the broader REIT market over the foreseeable future, where there is an increased probability of distress and 'higher-for-longer' interest rate scenario.It is a combination of two factors, which differentiate MAA from its peers and equips the Company to benefit from the volatility in the real estate market.MAA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire REIT space and is only one of eight publicly traded REITs, which carry an upper investment grade credit rating.Compared to 15 direct peers operating in the REIT  Apartments  segment, MAA has the second strongest balance sheet in terms of debt to EBITDA and debt ratio. On an absolute basis a net debt to EBTIDAre of 3.5x is considered very safe providing ample debt capacity to fund accretive transactions and   or redevelopment activities.An additional major aspect in the context of MAA's debt capacity and financing structure, which has to be factored in is the relatively extended debt maturity profile in conjunction with 100  fixed rate financing.This means that MAA is protected from materially higher financing costs imposing a significant and concentrated effect on the FFO generation. , provided that MAA does not assume incremental external financing in a major fashion, only  9  of the total debt is set to reprice towards market level interest rates on an annual basis. Given MAA's ability to deliver a positive like-for-like growth in NOI and fund new projects through internal cash generation, these gradual effects from higher interest rates should be easily offset with improved cash flows.Lastly, MAA possesses a great degree of flexibility to cover notable investments or obtain an optimal financing source to refinance the maturing borrowing. As of Q2, 2023, MAA had over  1.25 billion available under the existing credit facility, which is more than enough to refinance all of the incoming debt maturities until 2026.As elaborated above, the sector in which MAA operates is robust and with favourable growth prospects. Historically, MAA has managed to capitalize on these dynamics by registering relatively stronger FFO growth results compared to the peers.In fact, MAA has avoided negative rate of change movement in its annual FFO during 2020 and 2021, while the sector, on average, suffered from higher vacancy rates and temporarily reduced rents due to the COVID-19 shock.A major driver of the resilient performance has been both internal and external growth opportunities funded by primarily internal cash generation.On average MAA retains 40  of the generated FFO. This allows the Management to cover CapEx and   or accretive M A deals without a heavy reliance on external leverage. In the context of prevailing financing costs, this strategy clearly bears fruit allowing MAA to act opportunistically, while there is an increasing pressure for more indebted competitors to optimize their balance sheets via  among other  divestitures.In my opinion, MAA is great real estate investment for investors, who seek stability and protection amid the looming recessionary risks and potential consequences from higher-for-longer scenario in the real estate market.Currently, MAA yields 4 , which is not that attractive, but considering the growth potential and the resiliency of underlying business operations, the investment case looks attractive.The investment case of MAA should play out when the market becomes more depressed causing the property cap rates to go up materially. Under such conditions, MAA should be able to utilize its balance sheet capacity and internal cash generation to accommodate profitable deals in a sizeable fashion.

Centrus Energy: The Most Distinct Energy Company At Great Price,"Centrus Energy  is one of the most distinct companies in the uranium industry. They are the only producer of low-enriched uranium in the USA. Their balance sheet is alarming at first glance because itUranium offers an exceptional asymmetric investment opportunity. Its growing deficit caused by stagnating supply and increasing demand heralds the new bull market. Unlike commodities such as copper and oil, uranium is not dependent on the economic cycle. Geopolitics drives its price more and applies with even greater force today. The coup in Niger, the country that supplies 7  of the world's annual production, affirms that fact. Europe relies heavilyI'll summarize in a few points why we're at the beginning of an epic bull market in uranium. Lack of investment in discoveries and new mines, combined with political-economic fragmentation, significantly impacts supply. Even without direct sanctions, many countries have begun to supply uranium from other sources, but Russia.On the other hand, we observe rising demand due to nuclear power revival. The latter has become widely accepted as an alternative to fossil fuels, making it an essential element of the transition to zero carbon emissions. And it is not only that, the population of India and much of Africa is growing exponentially. Increasing capacity is the only way to meet the rising people's energy needs. In addition, India is climbing up the S curve of GDP, in which fewer people live in desperate poverty, and more are entering the . It is projected that the Indian middle class will grow by 65   by 2030. The chart below illustrates the Indian income pyramid.That means they will demand more stuff, and its production needs ever-increasing energy. The answer to the rising demand is nuclear power. Another crucial point is energy independence. World fragmentation is the driver behind it. An increasing number of countries plan to  for all the reasons listed - the Green Deal, demographics, and energy independence.A potential accelerator - sanctions against Russian uranium. The imbalance between supply and demand is a fact. It will slowly and steadily impact uranium prices. If sanctions are imposed on Russian uranium, the process described above will accelerate multifold, and the uranium shortage will reach epic proportions.That is not healthy for any market. The commodity CAPEX cycle creates imbalances between demand and supply, which are cured by the market dynamics. Epic deficits caused by exogenous shocks negatively impact the industry long-term, even if we, as investors, can cash significant returns. We can profit handsomely in a normal CAPEX cycle without systematic shocks, and the uranium market is such an opportunity.Centrus business is, at least to say, obscure. To make my thesis more comprehensive, I will briefly present the fuel nuclear cycle.In nature, uranium occurs in the form of 6 isotopes. The two primary ones are U235 and U238. In nuclear energy and for defense purposes, U235 is of leading importance. U238 produces plutonium for nuclear triad  intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, and nuclear submarines .Uranium 238  U238  makes up over 99  of the uranium found in nature. The remaining less than one percent includes all other isotopes. Among these is Uranium 235  U235 , which has the most comprehensive application in energy.

Centrus Energy: The Most Distinct Energy Company At Great Price,"Centrus Energy  is one of the most distinct companies in the uranium industry. They are the only producer of low-enriched uranium in the USA. Their balance sheet is alarming at first glance because itUranium offers an exceptional asymmetric investment opportunity. Its growing deficit caused by stagnating supply and increasing demand heralds the new bull market. Unlike commodities such as copper and oil, uranium is not dependent on the economic cycle. Geopolitics drives its price more and applies with even greater force today. The coup in Niger, the country that supplies 7  of the world's annual production, affirms that fact. Europe relies heavilyI'll summarize in a few points why we're at the beginning of an epic bull market in uranium. Lack of investment in discoveries and new mines, combined with political-economic fragmentation, significantly impacts supply. Even without direct sanctions, many countries have begun to supply uranium from other sources, but Russia.On the other hand, we observe rising demand due to nuclear power revival. The latter has become widely accepted as an alternative to fossil fuels, making it an essential element of the transition to zero carbon emissions. And it is not only that, the population of India and much of Africa is growing exponentially. Increasing capacity is the only way to meet the rising people's energy needs. In addition, India is climbing up the S curve of GDP, in which fewer people live in desperate poverty, and more are entering the . It is projected that the Indian middle class will grow by 65   by 2030. The chart below illustrates the Indian income pyramid.That means they will demand more stuff, and its production needs ever-increasing energy. The answer to the rising demand is nuclear power. Another crucial point is energy independence. World fragmentation is the driver behind it. An increasing number of countries plan to  for all the reasons listed - the Green Deal, demographics, and energy independence.A potential accelerator - sanctions against Russian uranium. The imbalance between supply and demand is a fact. It will slowly and steadily impact uranium prices. If sanctions are imposed on Russian uranium, the process described above will accelerate multifold, and the uranium shortage will reach epic proportions.That is not healthy for any market. The commodity CAPEX cycle creates imbalances between demand and supply, which are cured by the market dynamics. Epic deficits caused by exogenous shocks negatively impact the industry long-term, even if we, as investors, can cash significant returns. We can profit handsomely in a normal CAPEX cycle without systematic shocks, and the uranium market is such an opportunity.Centrus business is, at least to say, obscure. To make my thesis more comprehensive, I will briefly present the fuel nuclear cycle.In nature, uranium occurs in the form of 6 isotopes. The two primary ones are U235 and U238. In nuclear energy and for defense purposes, U235 is of leading importance. U238 produces plutonium for nuclear triad  intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, and nuclear submarines .Uranium 238  U238  makes up over 99  of the uranium found in nature. The remaining less than one percent includes all other isotopes. Among these is Uranium 235  U235 , which has the most comprehensive application in energy.

The Bullish Case For Oil Is Still Compelling,"Not since November of last year have we seen oil prices where they are today. We are close, by far, to the highest pricing that crude has traded at all year. As of this writing, WTI crude, for instance, is at  91.18 per barrel. Not surprisingly, Brent crude isThe last article that I published that covered the oil market generally came out in early April of this year. At that time, I was talking about the new OPEC  production cut and how that represented a  massive gift  to the oil sector. Normally when I talk about investing, I like to identify individual companies that should rise or fall materially. But when it comes to the oil patch, there are many different types of companies to choose from, with each one having a significantly different risk vs. reward payoff compared to the others. For some investors, it just makes it easier to buy into an ETF that appreciates if oil prices rise or drops if they fall.Back then, the ETF I chose as the primary emphasis for my article was  . But there are plenty of others to choose from, each one with its own positives and negatives. Examples include  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . To be clear, investors would be wise to evaluate each of these ETFs individually to see which one best fits their own investment preferences and risk appetite. But in general, one thing that these all should have in common is that, as oil prices rise, they should appreciate. This should be true at least in the short term.Regardless of the vehicle that each individual investor chooses to play in the oil market, a case could be made by some that prices are too high and should drop from here. There's certainly data to support that view. Take data provided by the EIA, for instance. In its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, which was published earlier this month, the agency calculated that, for 2023, global oil supply would come in at about 101.18 million barrels per day. This would be about 0.21 million barrels per day higher than the 100.97 million in consumption that would be experienced. This disparity might not seem like much to some investors. But it could have a major impact on global oil markets if true. The total excess supply, spread over a single year, would be 76.65 million barrels.Now, it's important to point out that just because inventories are rising that this shouldn't necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on oil. It all depends on how much crude already is out there. Generally, the range that should be considered healthy for the environment would be between 55 and 60 days' worth of supply of crude in OECD nations. Whenever this number starts ticking above 60, we start to drift into bearish territory. Based on the STEO report issued, by the end of this year, we should be at roughly 60.57 days' worth of supply for OECD nations. That would translate to excess crude amongst developed nations of 26 million barrels. To make matters worse, the 2024 calendar year should see global demand of 102.88 million barrels per day. That's 0.55 million barrels per day higher than the 102.33 million barrels per day of consumption that has been forecasted. That would translate to 200.75 million barrels of additional crude throughout the year, with OECD inventories climbing to 2.84 billion barrels, or 62.14 days.Looking at the most recently available weekly , we see that domestic crude inventories for the US, excluding what's in the SPR  Strategic Petroleum Reserve , are about 1.27 billion barrels. That's an increase over the 1.23 billion barrels of crude seen one year earlier. However, if we include the SPR into the picture, domestic inventories would have declined from 1.65 billion barrels to 1.62 billion. This is because, in order to combat high oil prices, the US has drained a lot of the oil in the SPR, taking inventories from 422.6 million barrels last year to 351 million this year.So to summarize, what we have on the bearish side of the equation is the EIA forecasting continued growth in production that exceeds consumption. We have evidence in the form of existing inventories of the picture looking worse than it did last year if we ignore the SPR. Although not mentioned previously, oil production also is the highest that it has been in more than two years, with output averaging 12.90 million barrels per day here at home. And you also have high pricing that, in theory, should attract more drillers that would, in turn, cause even more supply to come onto the market.All of this is fine, but there are some issues with the data from what I can see. For starters, while this is not necessarily an issue, the timing for oil prices to climb looks right. Even though the EIA has forecasted excess supply on a global scale for this year in its entirety, the current quarter that we are in, which is the third quarter, should actually see demand outpace supply to the tune of 0.58 million barrels per day. And in the fourth quarter, we should see demand outpace supply by 0.23 million barrels per day. All combined, this should cause global inventories to drop by 74.5 million barrels between the start of the third quarter and the end of this year.But when you dig into the actual data provided by the EIA, you end up with issues as well. For starters, the agency has Russia producing 10.57 million barrels of crude per day in the second quarter and 10.48 million barrels per day in the third quarter. For 2023 as a whole, the estimate is 10.64 million barrels per day. However, Russia has significantly reduced its own output. S P, for instance, recently estimated that, through 2024, the country should only be producing between 9.4 million and 9.5 million barrels of crude each day. OPEC, however, sees Russia dropping production from 10.85 million barrels per day in the second quarter of this year to only 10.22 million barrels per day in the third quarter. This year as a whole, we're looking at about 10.45 million barrels per day, which would be about 69.4 million barrels of crude, in the aggregate, lower than what the EIA data suggests.There are some other minor differences on the supply side. But the bigger differences involve demand. As an example, OPEC believes that global oil demand this year will average about 102.06 million barrels per day. That's 1.09 million barrels per day higher than what the EIA forecasted. For the third quarter of this year, OPEC believes that its own production would need to be roughly 29.23 million barrels per day in order to match demand. But if we take data provided by the group for the first two months of the third quarter, we're looking at an average of 27.39 million barrels per day. That translates to a deficit of 2.04 million barrels per day. That deficit is likely to grow to 3.32 million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year if OPEC production averages the same amount during that time. And with Saudi Arabia having just reaffirmed its target of keeping production lower by 1 million barrels per day through the rest of this year, that deficit is looking likely.If these estimates turn out to be accurate and if the historical data reported by OPEC for the first and second quarters of this year are correct, then we would be looking at an aggregate deficit of oil this year of 476.1 million barrels. While nobody knows what the future holds, the organization does think that global demand in 2024 will average 104.31 million barrels per day. And even with non-OPEC output slated to rise by 1.45 million barrels per day from 2023 to 2024, the group would need to put out 30.02 million barrels per day next year in order to avoid further shortfalls.As I mentioned earlier in this article, US production is higher than it has been in years. That trend also is looking set to continue. However, it could take quite a while before US output rises enough to bring prices down. For starters, as of August of this year, which is the most recent month for which we have  available, there were only 4,749 DUC wells across the major basins. This is actually down from the 5,191 reported one year earlier. To put this in perspective, in August of 2019, which was right before the COVID-19 pandemic, DUC wells numbered 8,156. The count of wells is often seen as the count of spots from which oil companies can realistically extract crude in a fairly short window of time. That's because a sizable portion of the cost of extracting oil comes from the drilling process. So when drilling is already done, but the entire well is not completed, it can be viewed as a mechanism to quickly ramp up output. But to see the DUC well count fall so low indicates that this potential is limited. In fact, the most recent Drilling Productivity Report issued by the EIA even indicated that production across the major basins should fall, collectively, by 40,000 barrels per day from September to October.At this point in time, I would say that investors probably have more reasons to be bullish on crude than they have reasons to be bearish. Yes, there are certain economic uncertainties and those could play a big role in what happens to pricing from this point on. But absent a major downturn in the economy, the existing balance between supply and demand in crude will have a much larger role in determining what happens with prices. Even though data provided by the EIA is showing a rather bearish situation, the OPEC data indicates otherwise and the market, from a pricing perspective, clearly is on its side. While some may argue that OPEC is not the most reliable source out there, my experience and looking at its data is that it tends to be quite accurate. And when you combine that with a lower DUC count, lower production moving forward in major basins, higher pricing in the market, and lower domestic inventories if we include the SPR, I would argue that the bullish case moving forward is definitely more compelling.Crude Value Insights is a service geared toward investors who are interested in keeping track of oil and gas E P firms.

Exxon Mobil: Likely Higher For Longer,"The only time I    was on December 22, 2023, when the stock was trading at  107.9 and many investment banks began to revise their forecasts for the stock's future growth potential.

Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, weaker refining margins, and increased capital spending contributed to the decline. The firm's revenue decreased by 27  to  80.795 billion  the income from equity affiliates and other income are excluded , so it also missed the market's expectations.In April 2022, the company restructured, forming Exxon Mobil Product Solutions and centralizing certain groups. It now reports results in 4 segments  Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products.The Upstream segment's profit fell to  4.577 billion due to lower commodity prices and reduced oil-equivalent production. U.S. Upstream profit dropped to  920 million, while non-U.S. Upstream earnings declined to  3.657 billion. The Energy Products segment's profit decreased to  2.310 billion, primarily due to lower refining margins. Chemical Products reported a profit of  828 million, reflecting weaker industry conditions. In Specialty Products, profit improved to  671 million, driven by higher pricing.Capital and exploration expenses rose to  6.166 billion  Exxon Mobil aims to invest in promising projects, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain a sustainable dividend, with an expected 2023 CAPEX between  23- 25 billion.Oil prices got a boost as Saudi Arabia and Russia  voluntary production cuts until year-end, tightening the market. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in their recent note  September 20, 2023 - proprietary source , that Brent Crude exceeding  100 per barrel seems stretched, despite strong signals of market tightness, such as rising prices, robust demand, and falling inventories. The market is currently undersupplied by about 1 million barrels per day, mainly due to OPEC's 1 mb d cut, led by Saudi Arabia. The analysts expect that Saudi Arabia will maintain its cuts well into FY2024, keeping the market tight until at least early 2024. However, significant price increases are unlikely, with Brent expected to range between  85 to  95 per barrel by the end of 2024.So, based on the tight market situation until early 2024, XOM has an excellent background for its operational activities, which should become even more efficient in the foreseeable future.As another group of Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote a few days ago  proprietary source , the company aims to triple its earnings by FY2027 compared to FY2019, mainly thanks to strategic projects. XOM sets records for oil production in the Permian and achieved record production rates in Guyana. They also completed a significant chemical expansion project in the Gulf Coast. Exxon Mobil anticipates bringing on 2 new projects in the second half of the year, Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further enhancing earnings potential.After opportunistically rationalizing and divesting lower-margin refineries over the past few years, Exxon Mobil's Energy Products portfolio is now 85  integrated with its chemical facilities. In the long term, Exxon Mobil has positioned itself well to take advantage of opportunities in product reconfiguration, particularly in the biofuels, lubricants, and chemicals sectors as the energy transition continues to evolve.At the same time, we see that the valuation of the company currently looks quite modest  The market sees EV EBITDA for next year at the  6.7x level, although the EBITDA margin  TTM by quarter  is currently 21.5 , which is 57 basis points higher than last year for the same period. From a historical perspective in terms of EV EBITDA multiples, XOM is valued at the low end of the norm but has a very strong FCF that is likely to be even higher due to higher oil prices and is currently over 10  of market cap, indicating serious undervaluation.In recent weeks, refining margins have improved due to low clean product inventories, strong demand, facility outages, and geopolitical uncertainties, such as reduced Russian exports. Exxon Mobil, with its global refining capacity of about 4.5 million barrels per day, is expected to benefit significantly from these higher margins. Based on current price expectations, there is a  7  potential upside to Energy Products  downstream  consensus earnings in the second half of 2023 and a  15  upside to 2024 previous estimates, Morgan Stanley analysts added.Let's do the math together  If the above forecasts come true, or if actual earnings are close to these levels, then at 7.5x of EV EBITDA we should get a market cap of  533 billion after adjusting for net debt. Then the upside potential from the current price would be 14.38 , excluding   FWD . The expected total return exceeds 15 , so I reiterate my previous buy recommendation.I should mention that Exxon faces several significant risk factors in its operations, so everyone should be cautious when buying its stock.First, the company operates in a commodity-driven industry, where it has limited control over the prices of its products. This vulnerability to fluctuating commodity prices can impact its profitability and financial performance, as was the case throughout its entire history.Second, Exxon is engaged in major capital projects, and cost overruns on these projects can pose financial challenges. These overruns can strain the company's financial resources and potentially affect its ability to meet its investment goals and deliver expected returns to shareholders.Additionally, geopolitical risks are a concern for Exxon. Operating in countries with a history of corruption and political instability can expose the company to uncertainties that may impact production volumes and returns. However, Exxon's global presence helps mitigate some of these risks by diversifying its operations across different regions.Despite many obvious risks, Exxon Mobil stock is a  Buy  today even at the high end of its multi-week price range becausea  the oil market is still tight,b  refining margins are improving,c  management is taking some strategically sound steps to improve the company's operational efficiency  andd  the stock is quite cheap given the strong FCF levels,As a result, I expect XOM to be higher for longer - at least until something fundamentally changes.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Mid-America Apartment Communities: Advantages Being Ignored Amid Supply Glut," is the largest and arguably strongest Sunbelt apartment REIT with about 102,000 units in the portfolio. This portfolio is well diversified across various types of multifamily communities, including highly amenitized and luxurious apartments appealing to higherIt also boasts the best-positioned balance sheet in its peer group with investment grade credit ratings of A3 A-, net debt to EBITDA of 3.4x, a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , and a weighted average debt maturity of 7.5 years.Beyond discernible traits of quality in the portfolio and balance sheet, there's often a certain  about high-quality companies that's difficult to pinpoint. You just know it when you see it, assuming you have an adequately trained eye.If I hadThe current CEO Eric Bolton has led the company for over two decades and has been at MAA for nearly three decades. During his tenure, MAA's total return performance has absolutely crushed that of its peersAnd yet, the market is pricing MAA at only a slight premium to its two closest Sunbelt multifamily REIT peers and a  to its high-quality coastal multifamily cousins.I'll show below that MAA's balance sheet remains in pristine shape, and the market has little to worry about on that front. It appears that the market has become concerned about the oncoming wave of supply scheduled to come online in MAA's select cities over the next year or two.I would argue, however, that this wave of supply will only be a temporary headwind, and that the current stock price decline represents a phenomenal buying opportunity for this best-in-class landlord.MAA owns a Sunbelt-concentrated yet meaningfully diversified portfolio of apartment complexes stretching from Las Vegas, Nevada to Norfolk, Virginia.In addition to a heavy presence in major Sunbelt cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Tampa, and Orlando, MAA also has significant exposure to fast-growing secondary markets like Jacksonville, Greenville, and Charleston.These Sunbelt markets have enjoyed population and job growth well above the national average over the past several years but also over the decade preceding COVID-19.The factors that drive these domestic migratory trends have not changed. Housing costs remain higher in many non-Sunbelt states, while lower taxes across the Sunbelt have attracted many businesses and jobs. Moreover, crime rates and rampant homelessness have fueled a population outflow from many coastal cities.MAA's median resident age is 34 years old, and the average rent-to-income ratio  sits at 22 .As I explained in a recent  titled  'Higher For Longer' Is Totally Unsustainable  Buy Defensive Dividend Stocks,  homebuying affordability has reached a nearly  as both home prices  mortgage rates keep rising. The practical result of this will be that many would-be homebuyers will have to remain renters until homeownership becomes more affordable. This is great news for multifamily landlords like MAA, because a rent-to-income ratio of 22  is far more affordable than the alternative of buying a home right now.Another competitive advantage for MAA is its robust development and redevelopment platform, which was significantly bolstered by its  of Post Properties in 2016. Post had expertise in property development that has clearly been beneficial to MAA over the years since the acquisition. Today, most of MAA's portfolio growth comes from internal development projects.This development arm, in addition to MAA's redevelopment platform that constantly upgrades a portion of its apartments with the latest technologies and interior designs, keeps the portfolio fresh and in tune with renter preferences.What's more, MAA is able to deliver internally developed properties at stabilized yields of 6-7  or higher. For development projects currently in the lease-up phase, MAA expects to generate a stabilized NOI yield of 7.2 . This is a massive strength at a time when multifamily cap rates are in the 4-5  territory.The above investment approach has worked extraordinarily well for MAA over the last few decades. We see it in the numbers. Compare, for example, MAA's Q2 core FFO per share and same-store NOI growth to that of its peersUses AFFO instead of core FFOUses NFFO instead of core FFOGranted, this is only one quarter. But if you zoom out further, you'll find more evidence of MAA's outperformance over its peers.Quality isn't always easy to describe, but it does tend to be quantifiable in performance numbers. That is certainly the case for MAA.The market seems to think that Sunbelt multifamily REITs' time in the sun has come to an end. The period of very low-interest rates from the second half of 2020 through early 2022 spurred a surge in new development starts in the multifamily space, focused on the areas where people were moving during the pandemic. This includes the suburban areas of coastal cities and pretty much everywhere across the Sunbelt.Notice in the chart below how multifamily construction starts averaged about 500,000 in 2022, compared to an average of under 400,000 during the 2010s.A large share of these new apartments are going to be delivered in MAA's Sunbelt markets.The market seems to think these new units will compete directly with MAA's existing portfolio, which is not necessarily the case. MAA enjoys at least two competitive advantages amid this wave of new supplyYou can see both competitive advantages displayed in the illustration below.First, in many of MAA's markets, the submarkets where the REIT's properties are located are expected to receive only a fraction of the total supply coming to those cities. MAA's communities often enjoy superior locations that offer greater convenience in terms of proximity to highways, shopping centers, and workplaces.Second, MAA's existing portfolio is able to offer rent rates significantly below the asking rents of these newly delivered apartments. Everyone knows that construction costs have gone up a lot in the last few years. Plus, developers typically have high-interest rate construction loans in place. That, in addition to the desire to sell the stabilized property for top dollar, requires them to seek out the highest possible rent rates.Thus, the primary competitors of newly delivered apartments tend not to be existing apartments but rather . These new apartment communities will likely have to offer concessions such as one or a few months of free rent in order to get leases signed at these higher rent rates. But in most cases, it is unlikely that they will drop rents low enough to compete with MAA's existing apartment stock.Plus, notice in the chart above that both construction starts and building permits for multifamily properties have dropped significantly below their 2022 levels. High-interest rates have caused starts to plummet. This means that the wave of new supply will be severely curtailed starting sometime in 2025.The supply headwind is temporary.In the long run, I would worry more about the supply pressures urban apartment landlords in coastal cities will face from office-to-multifamily conversions. Cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago with lots of old, half-empty office buildings and local governments that are desperate to revitalize their downtown areas  and therefore likely to subsidize conversion projects  are more likely to face a secular trend of apartment supply growth than the Sunbelt.According to a recent  put out by researchers at New York University and Columbia Business School, the top five metro areas with the most potential office-to-multifamily conversions were  you guessed itDue to greater office utilization and less public transportation, the Sunbelt is at a much lower risk of apartment supply growth from office conversions in the long run.MAA has among the strongest balance sheets, if not  strongest, in its multifamily REIT peer group. It is not the only multifamily REIT with credit ratings of A- A3......but it is the only REIT with 100  fixed-rate debt and net debt to EBITDA as low as 3.4x.But net debt to EBITDA is only one metric to measure balance sheet strength. There are others, and they all show MAA well-positioned compared to peers.MAA stacks up well against its peer group average in terms of debt to assets, unencumbered assets, debt service coverage, and weighted average debt maturity.Notice the small highlighted section showing that the  peer group  constituents include AVB, CPT, EQR, Essex Property Trust , and UDR Inc. . In other words, MAA is only comparing itself to the largest and strongest multifamily REITs, not any of the smaller ones with weaker balance sheets.The REIT does have a steady slate of debt maturities to refinance in the coming years. That is perhaps the weakest aspect of the balance sheet. Even if the bond market is favorable to MAA, the REIT will likely have to roll over these loans at new interest rates at least 200 basis points above the weighted average interest rate of 3.4 , based on the current average effective bond yield for corporates with an  A  rating.The good news is that MAA has plenty of liquidity as well as significant retained cash from its low payout ratio. This should help it blunt the blow of refinancing at higher rates.Certainly, up until now, MAA has managed to avoid rising interest expenses. Just the opposite has been the case. MAA's interest expense has  since 2019  i.e. the trailing twelve-month period ending at the beginning of 2020 .Perhaps the only reason why EQR's interest expense has fallen more than MAA's is that EQR has been a net seller of assets in order to deleverage. Notice in the chart below that while MAA's total assets have crept up since the beginning of 2020, EQR's total assets have declined by about 5 .EQR sold properties in order to reduce its debt load, while MAA has  needed to sell properties to reduce its debt.As more supply comes online and developers get desperate to offload properties amid high-interest rates, MAA's management believes that they will soon be able to utilize their significant dry powder  1.25 billion capacity on the credit facility plus  150 million in cash  to scoop up attractively valued acquisitions.MAA is best-in-class in the multifamily REIT space because of itsThis explains why it is my largest multifamily REIT holding and why I view it as a phenomenal buying opportunity right now.There will be mild to moderate headwinds in the short term from supply deliveries and debt refinancing, but MAA will be able to navigate these slight headwinds far easier than the market seems to think.What the market seems to ignore is  the Sunbelt is growing, and would-be homebuyers are largely stuck in the rental market for the foreseeable future.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

GLTR Dulls: Time To Buy,"In a June 27 article on , I wroteThe   was trading at  87.22 on June 22. On October 2, it was 5.6  lower at the  82.34 per share level. GLTR has lost its glitter over the past months, which could be a golden opportunity, no pun intended, for the future. It is virtually impossible to pick tops or bottoms in any market as they tend to extend past reasonable, logical, and rational price levels during bullish or bearish trends.Gold prices declined 3.28  in Q3 2023, while silver fell 1.58 . Over the first nine months of 2023, gold was 2.18  higher, while silver dropped 6.61 .December COMEX gold futures settled at  1,866.10 on September 29, with COMEX silver for December delivery at  22.45 per ounce.The chart shows that December gold was trending lower in early October.December silver was also in a bearish trend on October 3, over  1 lower than the Q3 closing price.While gold and silver posted losses in Q3, platinum and palladium prices increased. Platinum closed at  915.90 per ounce, 1.26  higher for the third quarter. Palladium, at  1,256 per ounce on September 29, was 2.78  higher than the closing price at the end of June 2023.

The long bond is steaming toward critical long-term technical support at the June 2007 104-41 low.Rising interest rates increase the cost of carrying commodity inventories, and precious metals are no exception. The trajectory of rate increases attracts capital from stocks and other assets to fixed-income products as yields rise.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have caused the US Dollar Index  to recover.After probing below the 100 level in July 2023, the U.S. dollar index that measures the U.S. currency against other reserve foreign exchange instruments recovered to near the 107 level. A rising dollar tends to be bearish for precious metals and commodity prices.Gold is a unique asset, a hybrid between a currency and a commodity. Gold is a metal and a hard asset held by central banks, monetary authorities, and governments worldwide as a foreign exchange reserve asset. Central banks have been net buyers of gold over the past years, increasing their holdings and validating gold s role in the global financial system.While gold prices have declined, the following factors favor gold at the current price levelMeanwhile, silver, platinum, and palladium could go along for the bullish ride if gold prices resume the upward trajectoryEach year, investment demand is the critical supply and demand fundamental factor for the four precious metals. Limited liquidity in platinum and palladium can cause significant price moves when trends change. A sudden herd of buying could send prices significantly higher as low liquidity exacerbates price variance, causing moves to extreme levels.The top holdings of the Aberdeen Physical Precious Metals Basket shares ETF includeAt  81.93 per share on October 3, GLTR had around  904 million in assets under management.

Plains GP Holdings: Healthy Financials Coupled With Upside Growth Potentials,"Plains GP Holdings  is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership  since the end of , the company's cash flow has been completely derived from an indirect investment in Plain All American Pipeline Plains All American has a prominent position and infrastructure in the Permian Basin, which is the most important basin in North America. As theFigure 1As mentioned earlier, a solid balance sheet and capital structure is one of the strong elements of Plains. The company was successful in increasing its cash generation during the last year. It reached a cash balance of  983 million in  versus only  327 million in 2Q 2022. Higher cash generation improved their balance sheet by declining their net debt to  7.2 billion in 2Q 2023 year over year compared with  8.6 million in the same time in 2022. Thankfully, their equity level of  14.8 billion is far higher than the net debt, which offsets the risks of future debt and equity financing  see Figure 2 .Figure 2 - PAGP's capital structure  in millionsFurthermore, the solid cash structure of Plains is another element that makes the company prominent. After a deep drop in their operating cash flow from  941 million in 3Q 2022 to  334 million at the end of 2022, they increased their cash flow from operations and reached  887 million at the end of 2Q 2023. Thankfully, their capital spending remained at a reasonable level of  159 million, thereby leading to an ample amount of  728 million of free cash flow at the end of the recent quarter. Except for 3Q 2022, their generated free cash flow hit the highest amount in the previous quarters. In the recent quarter, the management declared a  0.2675 dividend per share, which accounts for approximately  52.5 million of dividend payments based on 196,000,000 outstanding shares. According to their large amount of FCF, there is room for both deleveraging and higher shareholder distributions in the future  see Figure 3 .Figure 3 - PAGP's cash structure  in millionsThe management predicted to keep their leverage level at lower than 3.5x by the end of 2023. After analyzing their healthy cash and capital structures in the previous quarters, it goes with no surprise to see that their guidance is easily reachable. The wake of the COVID-19 outbreak and the downturn of 2020 caused leverage ratios of Plains to surge over 7x  however, the company enhanced its leverage condition considerably through successful deleveraging in the last couple of years. Ultimately, Plains' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2.8x in TTM, and its net debt-to-CFO ratio is 2.5x in TTM  see Figure 4 .Improved financial flexibility paves the way for higher cash returns to investors and allows the management to consider a new capital allocation framework. The management  to increase its cash distribution by  0.15 per share per year, and this increase will continue until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 . Their guidance for their unit distribution coverage ratio by the end of 2023 is 215 , which shows that the company has plenty of room to grow, and its unit price, therefore, has an upside potential to rise.Figure 4 - PAGP's leverage conditionIt is worth noting that the company's healthy liquidity condition, coupled with strong coverage conditions, eliminates risks of probable economic recessions to a great extent. During the recent quarters, the company improved its liquidity condition across the board of current and cash ratios. The company's current assets are well enough to pay back its short-term obligations, with a current ratio of 1.0x. In addition, their cash ratio became twofold to 0.2x in 2Q 2023 versus 0.1x at the end of the first quarter, which indicates the company is capable of paying circa 20  of its obligations only with its generated cash, which is attractive  see Figure 5 .Figure 5 - PAGP's liquidity conditionThe first and foremost risk associated with Plains operations and profitability is related to any major or minor changes in supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas, NLG, and other services that PAA provides. Shortages in supply and demand, which can be caused by a variety of factors that are not under the management's control, may adversely affect their operations and financial condition. Also, the management's prediction for 2023 WTI crude oil is  82.5 bbl on average. If oil prices drop more, other projections and operations may adversely become affected. It is important to mention that Plains distributes all of its available cash  thus, its growth process may be slower than businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand their operations.Plains is a stable and well-performing business in the oil and gas industry  it is one of the most prominent midstream companies in North America. The company's operation and financial results have been on the same path as the management's guidance, which shows their stability for more growth in the future. The management plans to increase its cash distribution by  0.15 per share yearly until its unit distribution coverage ratio reaches approximately 160 . Based on this year's 215 , we can say that the company has plenty of room to grow, and its unit price thereby has a good potential to rise. Furthermore, the healthy cash and capital structures of Plains resulted in strong leverage and liquidity conditions that eliminate risks of further financial and economic constraints in the future.

Public Storage Short Thesis: Supply Glut Coincides With Declining Demand,"Public Storage  is trading at a high multiple of 20.7X AFFO at a time when self-storage is oversupplied. Occupancy and rates are already dropping substantially with significantly more developments in the pipeline. Self-storage inventory was built up to meet event-driven demand of the post-pandemic surge which will result in significant competition and price cuts as demand drops back down.Factors unique to the self-storage sector make way for a harder landing than would be possible in more traditional real estate.Allow me to begin with acknowledging that I was too early in this thesis. Back in 2017 I wrote an article about PSA being . While PSA has underperformed the S P since then, it is still a positive return which makes a short position unsuccessful.While I was clearly far too early, I think the fundamentals remain in place that make PSA a dangerous investment.If one observes the last few decades, self-storage has been an amazingly strong sector. It has enjoyed consistently strong organic growth with only brief dips in recessions. PSA, as the largest player in the space, has captured its fair share of the upside.Most of the time, when trends go on for decades there is some sort of underlying stability. However, I don't think that is the case with self-storage. While the demand function of most real estate sectors is well-bounded within clear macroeconomic guardrails, the demand function of self-storage is completely unbounded.Allow me to elaborate as to what I mean by this. Housing, for example, has clear guardrails. The number of households will be related to population and GDP. As population and GDP rise the number of households rises, but because GDP and population stay within a fairly tight band the demand for housing stays within a tight band.Industrial also had guardrails in that demand for warehouses and manufacturing facilities was related to overall retail sales. As retail sales increased demand for industrial real estate increased but it was at a slow and measured pace. The birth of e-commerce broke through the upper guardrail in that it functioned as a multiplier on the ratio of industrial space needed per sale. E-commerce is the new guardrail and I think it is quite firmly here to stay which keeps industrial in a new steady state.Self-storage is more lawless. There is no natural economic factor to which demand is tied. The overall demand for self-storage space is contingent on the percentage of U.S. households that utilize self-storage.According to the Wall Street Journal, which used data from EXRThat is a very nebulous number.Why did it go from 2.7  to 10.6What is stopping it from going back down to 2.7I think the self-storage market has been lulled into a false sense of security by their baseline demand factor going up 4X  from 2.7 to 10.6  in the last 40 years.That is not normal. In fact, it is extraordinarily atypical and exists only in a small pocket of the world for a small portion of modern times.There was a period of time in REITs known as the retail apocalypse in which over the course of a few quarters the market collectively realized that the U.S. was over retailed. Retail REIT stocks collapsed as it became broadly known that the United States had somewhere between 150 -300  the retail square footage per capita of other developed nations depending on whom you compared us to.That is tiny compared to the magnitude of self-storage in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world.According to Converting to feet that is 118 million square feet in Europe. The U.S. has over 1.7 billion square feet of self-storage.According to a 2018 Statista survey, 90 percent of worldwide self-storage inventory is in the U.S.This is a strictly American phenomenon based on our propensity to buy lots of stuff. That extreme level of consumerism is required to maintain the 10.6  of households that pay for self-storage.Maybe that can be maintained, but it is far from certain. I think the natural level of demand is much lower.So what happens if that 10.6  of households paying for self-storage drifts back down to the former 2.7  level, a level which is still high compared to most of history and compared to the rest of the worldSelf-storage is among the easiest property types to develop. As demand has grown, the number of units has grown to meet that demand. That is how most real estate works, but most real estate has guardrails.Apartments and Industrial had the same wave of supply in the 2022-2023 timeframe but that will merely take occupancy rates down to about 93  and 94 , respectively. The demand in those sectors is permanent as long as the population of the U.S. is permanent and the internet is capable of creating e-commerce orders.In self-storage, the supply has been built up to match a lofty and unsustainable level of demand. The displacement of the pandemic resulted in a surge of demand. Rather than the sector just enjoying the good times, it built supply as if that demand was permanent.39.9 million square feet were developed in 2022 with another 52.5 million square feet on the way in 2023. to above dataOver the last 5 years, 254 million square feet of self-storage was developed in the U.S. That is more than twice the entire self-storage industry in all of Europe.All of this supply is predicated on a notion that the 10.6  level of utilization is sustainable. It is a blind extrapolation of historical growth. It relies on a level of utilization that has only been made possible by extreme goods-based consumerism.Humans will always spend money on the stuff that makes them happy. Perhaps they should. I'm not here to judge anyone.But what happens when the things that make people happy changeInstead of physical goods maybe people start preferring vacations. Or perhaps they start preferring digital goods like a library of music on Spotify over their former CD collection.I'm not suggesting that I can know where utilization rates will go, but I do think it is dangerous to build up supply as if the all-time record demand level will last forever.Back when utilization rates were at 2.7  the number of self-storage units in the U.S. was just a fraction of what it is today. On today's level of supply, that 2.7  level represents roughly 80  vacancy rates.As there is no other clear use for self-storage facilities, the value would drop to the value of the land. Those which are well-located could be redeveloped for other purposes but most would suffer.There are preliminary bits of evidence that utilization is in fact dropping.At a national level vacancy is starting to creep back up toward the historical 10 .As the pandemic gets further away people are returning to more stable lives and pulling their stuff back out of storage units.The result is that rental rates are collapsing, albeit from the surge highs.20  lost rental rates on top of declining occupancy is likely to make for a rough remainder of 2023.Apartments and industrial are absorbing their 2023 supply surge as demand remains strong. Thus, the new units are mostly absorbed by new demand and only partially hurting occupancy.In self-storage, demand growth appears to be negative in 2023 from the aforementioned return to post-pandemic normalcy. Thus, vacancy is rising both from the new units and from negative absorption.Construction is concentrated in a handful of submarkets with the top 10 as followsUnfortunately for PSA, these are most of their top markets by NOI.Highlighted in yellow are the markets in common with the 10 highest new construction markets.Where utilization rates go is completely unknown. If it stays at 10.6  this will be a normal cyclical recession for the space. If it dips it could be disastrous.The challenge for PSA's stock is that even if utilization stays at historically high levels it appears significantly overvalued.The self-storage sector as a whole is expensive with a 17.3X P AFFO. That strikes me as too high given the rental rate contraction data that is already available.Other REIT sectors trade at significantly cheaper multiples with positive growth outlooks.Within the sector, PSA trades at the highest multiple of 20.7X 2023 AFFO.At a property level, I think valuations have peaked because cap rates are sitting at a level below prevailing interest rates.Given where the Fed Funds rate is, I would anticipate cap rates climbing to about 8  and since it looks like NOI is going down, that change would likely come from price declines.Even as data has come out showing higher vacancy rates and significant rental rate declines, PSA's stock has not responded.This suggests that the upcoming weakness has not been priced in at all.Fair value consists of a composite of various plausible scenarios weighted by the chance of occurrence. The scenario in which vacancy skyrockets due to self-storage utilization falling back into the 2s is the downside scenario. My base case is that utilization remains roughly where it is with merely the pandemic surge getting undone.This suggests negative AFFO share growth in the short to medium term followed by more normal growth. In general, this sort of trajectory would warrant an AFFO multiple closer to 10X, but PSA does have some strong attributes which could justify a higher multiple.Given these positive attributes, I see fair value at around 14X AFFO which represents about 33  downside from today's price.Shorting in general is riskier than going long because the downside of a short is theoretically infinite. That said, there are a few aspects which make a PSA short a bit more approachable.1  it is a large company with low volatility which suggests the chance of going parabolic is reduced.2  As the most expensive and largest in its sector there is no company that could reasonably buy out PSA accretively.3  PSA has minimal existing short interest which largely prevents a short squeeze.Availability of shares to short will depend on one's custodian. Given the magnitude of float and lack of existing short interest, PSA should be available at most custodians without a  hard to borrow  fee.Right now there are abnormally great investment opportunities.

KNOT Offshore Partners: Main Concerns Regarding Leverage And Liquidity,"KNOT Offshore Partners LP  is operating and acquiring vessels to pursue its business in the shuttle tanker segment. In other words, a shuttle tanker is a floating pipeline that operates under a period charter and is based onOne of my main concerns about the Partnership was related to their upcoming debt maturities during 2023, which totaled around  372 million because this amount was much higher than their operating cash flow. Thankfully, during the recent quarter, the management  that they fixed credit approval for the  320 millionGoing forward through 2023, KNOP's debt refinancing will remain on my watch list. For instance, they will announce the result of a discussion with their lenders regarding the two  25 million unsecured revolving credit facilities with maturity dates of August and November 2023. Moreover, their new contracts developments regarding new three-year time charter contracts for the Fortaleza Knutsen and the Recife Knutsen with Transpetro lower their risk of losing their total assets.Notwithstanding the boom in oil prices during 2022, it seems that KNOP Partnership could not take appropriate advantage of high energy prices to improve its financial results. In other words, my main concern about the Partnership is associated with their debt levels, which is of great importance to be cared for. Albeit their net debt level declined slightly to circa  986 million by the end of  versus  1.011 billion at the end of 2022, their net debt level is still higher than the equity amount. During the last year, the Partner's equity levels were almost constant, finally sitting at  648 million by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, KNOP could increase its cash generation slightly to  52 million in 1Q 2023 versus  47.6 million and  41 million at the end of 4Q 2022 and 1Q 2022, respectively  see Figure 1 .Analyzing their cash structure indicates that during the first quarter of 2023, the Partnership's cash from operations reached over  29 million versus  21 million and  18 million at the end of 4Q and 1Q 2022, respectively. Meanwhile, despite favorable energy prices during the last year, and the end of the downturn of 2020, the Partnership's charter contracts ended in tandem with several vessels dry docking. Being dry docked for vessels is the same as auto repairing for vehicles on the land. Thus, routinely maintaining and repairing their vessels increased their costs. As a result, the Partnership's capital expenditures surged to  1.4 million at the end of the recent quarter versus only  0.5 million at the end of 2022 and  0.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. When all was said and done, approximately  28 million is left as a free cash flow for the Partnership to finance its distributions. Moreover, KNOP Partnership  a  0.026 dividend payment per share for the second quarter of 2023, which was paid a few days ago on August 10th, 2023, which was the same as the fourth quarter of 2022 after the management decided to cut their quarterly dividends by 95 . Consequently, their cash inflows should outpace their cash outflows because the number of their common number of outstanding shares was 34,900,000. Their dividend payment, thereby, was less than  1 million for the second quarter of 2023  see Figure 2 .Investigating the Partnership's leverage condition across the board of net debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-CFO indicates the importance of declining debt levels. As it is indicated in Figure 3, Although KNOP's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from over 26x at the end of 2022 to 22x in 1Q 2023, it is still very high. Moreover, their net debt-to-operating cash flow is even worse at 33x, while it was at 49x year over year compared with 1Q 2022. Their leverage condition is particularly concerning, and hopefully, the management reduce net debt levels, and thus, their leverage should be at a decent pace.Besides leverage ratios, you can see that the Partnership's liquidity condition is at high risk. After analyzing the Partnership's cash and capital structures, it is not too surprising to receive warnings from their current and cash ratios of 0.22x and 0.13x, respectively, at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Notwithstanding not changing considerably from the fourth quarter of 2022, both liquidity ratios dropped considerably year over year as versus 1Q 2022. The partnership's current ratio was 0.56x, and its cash ratio was 0.38x in the first quarter of 2022  see Figure 4 .Looking ahead, as the supply constraints have mostly been solved, it is  to see a strong period for crude tankers during the coming winter months, and it is expected to be continued over the next few years. In other words, the supply and demand balance outlook is positive, with oil consumption in 2023 expected to exceed its 2019 levels for the first time after the COVID-19 outbreak and even grow more during 2024. In minutiae, it is  that the supply in the crude tanker segment to grow by 1.1  and 0.5  by the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively. Also, on the demand side, the demand for crude tanker volumes will improve by 1-2  in 2023 and 2024.Additionally, based on  report, global oil inventories will decline and thus put upward pressure on crude oil prices in the second half of 2023. This upward trend is mainly due to the extended voluntary cuts of Saudi Arabia's crude oil production and increasing global demand. Meanwhile, rising global crude oil production in 2024 will put moderate downward pressure on crude prices in the second quarter of 2024.Analyzing KNOT Offshore Partners LP's financials and market outlook indicate that there is a particular concern associated with the Partnership's leverage and liquidity conditions. They cut their dividend payments by 95  in the first and second quarter of 2023, thus this distribution cut may provide an opportunity for their free cash inflow exceeds free cash outflow. However, it may take years for the Partnership to deleverage and thus be able to increase its dividend payments. Moreover, thankfully the management signed new three-year charter contracts and could successfully refinance some debt maturities. As a result, I prefer to keep an eye on the Partnership's leverage and liquidity conditions, and thus I believe that a hold rating is appropriate for KNOP units.As always, thank you for your reading, and I welcome your comments.

Goehring & Rozencwajg Q2 2023 Natural Resource Market Commentary,"Picture it, if you will  December of 2029. In a dimly lit private dining room, the sound of cutlery clinking blends with spirited conversation. Gathered at this stately round table is a diverse group of investors. Some wear the hard-fought wrinkles of significant gains, while others wear the furrowed brows of regrettable losses. What stratagems, one wonders, divided the winners from the less fortunateTo call the 2020s volatile might be akin to calling the sun slightly warm. Consider 2020, with the globe in the clutches of COVID-19. Then there was the inflationary flare of 2022, a fire stoked by Russia s move on Ukraine. Central banks, as reactive as ever, escalated rates in a dramatic fashion, prompting many to toast to the Federal Reserve s apparent mid-2023 success. Alas, as the hypothetical scene suggests, the party might have been premature.The prevailing wisdom of 2023 still held that oil demand had seen its heyday in late 2019. How baffling, then, that by the end of the decade, demand kept reaching new unexpected highs, largely propelled by emerging markets like India. A trust in the boundless potential of the US oil shales was dashed, as production waned midway through our tumultuous decade. The American solution, releasing a sizable portion of its strategic reserves, was a mere temporary salve, and oil s price ascended to dizzying heights. In a few short years, oil had gone from universally accepted as  uninvestable  to the  must-own  asset class.A brief upturn in food prices post the Russian-Ukraine conflict turned out to be just the opening act. The main event  A succession of agricultural calamities, the most severe being a midwest US drought, eerily reminiscent of the 1930s Dust Bowl.Renewable energy, hailed as the savior of both wallet and environment, took a rather ironic turn. With heavy government backing, these  clean  energies seemed to generate only escalated electricity costs and persistent power shortages, plaguing the very Western economies that championed them.The mighty dollar began the decade without peer. Yet, halfway through the 2020s, the musical chairs of global monetary order began, with nations gravitating towards their own currencies and the golden touch of precious metals to square off their imbalances.With the dollar s retreat, the inflationary inferno pushed commodity demand significantly higher. Bonds were not spared, resulting in the central banks  predictable rescue operation as governments had trouble rolling over their short-term obligations.Equity markets too grappled with inflation s weight and the diminishing lure of bonds. A stark illustration  The Dow Jones Industrial Average s  relationship with gold. From a once formidable 20 1 ratio at the decade s onset, a historical crossroads loomed  ten years later, they looked set to cross   a rare event that had occurred only three times in 140 years  1896, 1932-4 and 1980 .Retrospect at our 2029 table illuminated the follies and triumphs of a decade. Those that had bought the  must own  assets of the early 2020s  i.e., fixed income and growth stocks  were rewarded with the worst inflation-adjusted returns. Conversely, the assets most universally hated at the start of the 2020s  i.e., hard assets  produced the best returns by far. Leading that hard asset class would be the quintessential  hard  asset  gold.Those far-sighted souls who, a decade earlier, had the wisdom to acquire gold found themselves comfortably ensconced in the cozy realm of foresight. While much of the market grappled, rather inelegantly, with the unforeseen maladies of the decade   resulting in discernible, tangible losses in what were once deemed  safe  portfolios   these astute speculators sat on the very asset that the generalist hordes suddenly found irresistible. Come the twilight of the 2020s, they stood not just as benefactors of their own prudence but as the envy of many, having firmly secured the reins of their financial future.Peering into fog of the future, one is invariably met with a degree of uncertainty, a kind of myopia if you will. Yet, it might amuse our diligent readership that the unforeseen turns and tempests in today s financial landscape were none other than the subjects dissected at our Fall 2022 Investor Day.Marko Papic candidly expounded on our trajectory  veering away from the quiet sanctity of a unipolar world to the cacophonous theaters of multipolarity. The aspiring occupant of the Oval Office, Vivek Ramaswamy, elucidated on the curious ways ESG pressures have begun to distort corporate investment, particularly when one treads the rugged terrains of natural resources.Leigh Goehring sounded the clarion call on a looming metamorphosis   our gas fields, both global and our own continental, teetering on the brink of a structural deficit. As for agriculture  Shaun Hackett painted a frosty panorama, hinting at the dawning of a global cooling epoch, replete with its tantrums of volatile weather and crop yields that greatly disapointed. Adam Rozencwajg warned of the faux allure of renewables, focusing on the paradoxical energy crisis it might birth, thanks to the nettlesome issue of their efficiency. Edward Chancellor, always the astute historian, regaled us with tales of investment cycles, drawing our gaze to the grand pendulum swings in energy and metals   a narrative of liquidation, but promising prosperity in its aftermath.Now, it s true that at Goehring   Rozencwajg, our crystal ball isn t infallible. Yet, it s in our DNA to speculate, prognosticate, and occasionally, pontificate. An interesting tapestry woven by our speakers was a shared spirit of contrarianism, a thirst to not just see the future but to envision it with a tint different from the many.The golden thread for our attendees  A bullish outlook for several commodities. But ah  One precious element was not discussed  gold. The gilded metal, we assert, stands on the precipice of a roaring bull run, perhaps echoing its luminous days of the  70s and the 2000s. Despite its sluggish dance since the commodity rally began in May 2020, with gold s mere 15  advance looking rather pale against the Rogers International Commodity Index s 160  and the Goldman Sachs Spot Commodity Index s 125  leap, we sense an imminent turn of the tides. Investors, it seems, might be getting one last golden ticket.Those with long memories might remember how gold became the  must-own  asset of the 1970s. We believe the same thing is happening today. Gold demand will come from speculators seeking a short-term profit and generalist investors seeking protection from financial turmoil and mounting inflationary pressures. Gold and silver were radically undervalued in 1971. Over the next decade, they were the best-performing asset class. Between 1970 and the peak in January 1980, gold and silver surged 2,000  and 2,800 , respectively.After peaking in 1980, gold spent the next 20 years drifting lower. By 1999, it had become as cheap as ever on many metrics. Between 1999 and today, gold advanced more than eight-fold, significantly outperforming stocks and bonds. Despite its strong appreciation, we believe gold remains exceptionally cheap based on our framework. In the following essay, we will describe our valuation techniques and show that gold still has a considerable upside, irrespective of what occurs in global financial markets.The question remains  Come 2029, on which side of the table do you envision yourselfGold is no different than any other asset class  it becomes popular, rises in price, is overvalued, and ultimately represents a poor investment. Other times, it undergoes periods of investor disinterest, suffers sustained price declines, becomes undervalued, and ultimately represents an excellent investment.We are not gold bugs. Over the long term, gold protects monetary debasement  however, unlike equities, gold will provide little real return. If an investor can identify periods when gold becomes extremely undervalued, it can offer exceptional excess returns, often uncorrelated with other financial assets.The key is figuring out when gold is undervalued and overvalued.In this essay, we will describe the various valuation frameworks we have used over many years to estimate gold price targets and determine when to add or reduce our gold exposure.In May 2000, I was  and discussed gold s radical undervaluation. I predicted gold would reach  2,500 per ounce before the bull market ended. When the article was published, gold was  275 per ounce, and continuous central bank selling had left investors wildly bearish towards the so-called  barbarous relic.  Our valuation framework pointed instead to substantial potential returns. Although gold never hit our  2,500 target, it reached  1,900 in 2011 and was the best-performing asset class of the 2000s.Gold has been in a bull market for nearly a generation, leaving many questioning if it still represents an attractive investment as in the late 1960s or 1990s.After bottoming at  251 per ounce in August 1999, gold surged to  1,900 in August 2011, pulled back to  1,050 by December 2015, and resumed its advance, making an all-time high triple-tops of  2,050 in August 2020, March 2022 and May 2023. However, gold is now as undervalued as in 1999 on several metrics.Potential gold investors must ask three questions. First, is gold undervalued today  Second, if gold is undervalued, to what degree  And finally, how high could it go were it to swing from undervalued to overvalued   something that has happened twice in 100 yearsTo help answer the first question, we compare the value of gold to both the money supply and the value of financial assets. We also find it helpful to consider the historical relationship between gold and other commodities.Below are three charts that highlight these relationships over the last 100 years. The first chart shows the relationship between the size of the US Treasury s gold holdings and the Federal Reserve s balance sheet. Although somewhat controversial, we believe the size of the Fed s balance is related to the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings over the long term. According to this chart, there have been two distinct periods over the past 100 years during which gold was highly overvalued and three periods during which gold was significantly undervalued.In the late 1930s, President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 65 , raising the gold price to  35 per ounce. At the same time, clouds of war were gathering across Europe. The combination of a higher gold price in the US and growing hostilities in Europe led to a massive volume of gold inflows in America. At the peak, the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings exceeded the size of the Fed s balance sheet by an incredible 1.7 times. The gold flows into the US were so great that the Treasury could have exchanged every dollar bill in circulation for gold and retained half of its gold stock.The gold s second period of overvaluation occurred in January 1980. Gold spiked in a parabolic blow-off to  850 per ounce in January 1980, following two decades of accelerating inflation. At the peak, the Treasury s gold holdings  vastly diminished from the late-1930s levels  were once again valued at 1.7 times the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.Gold turned out to be a terrible investment after both periods of radical overvaluation. Between 1937 and 1971, gold was flat while the stock market advanced tenfold. Between 1980 and 2000, gold fell 70  while the stock market ran thirteen-fold.On the other hand, gold was radically undervalued three times. The first period occurred in the late 1960s. With gold fixed at  35 under the Bretton Wood s Gold Exchange Standard and inflationary pressures mounting in the US, gold flowed out of the Treasury. By 1971, the Fed s monetary base exceeded the Treasury s gold holdings by seven times. The three-decade reversal was impressive  between 1938 and 1971, the Treasury s gold holdings went from covering the Fed s monetary base by 1.7 times to less than 15 .The second period of undervaluation occurred during the late 1990s. Following twenty years of falling gold prices and a rapid expansion of the Fed s balance sheet, the size of the Fed s monetary base exceeded the Treasury s gold holdings by nine times. In other words, the dollar s unofficial  and unconvertible  gold coverage reached an all-time low of 11 .As we saw, the periods of overvaluation  the 1930s and 1980  were great opportunities to sell gold. Conversely, the periods of undervaluation  1969 and 1999  were excellent buying opportunities. Gold was the best-performing asset class in the decade following each period of maximum undervaluation.Gold, relative to the size of the Fed s balance sheet, is more undervalued today than in the late 1960s or 1990s. The reason  even though gold advanced over seven-fold over the last twenty-three years, the Federal Reserve s balance sheet has grown even faster. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, global central banks have undertaken radical monetary policies.Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has undertaken four massive rounds of quantitative easing, resulting in a monetary base nine times larger than in 1999. The Fed printed money faster than gold appreciated over the last twenty-three years. The Fed s monetary base currently stands at over nine times the Treasury s gold holdings, compared with six times in 1969 and nine times in 1999   the other two excellent buying opportunities. According to our analysis, gold is 30  more undervalued than in 1969 and on par with 1999.Valuing gold against financial assets tells a similar story. Chart 2 shows the relationship between gold and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over the last 100 years, there have been three periods during which gold was radically undervalued relative to financial assets.The first period occurred in the late 1920s. In response to a decade of rapid monetary growth in the US  related to Britain s failed attempt to peg the pound to gold at the pre-World War I rate , the US stock market surged, driven mainly by speculation funded by borrowed money. From the 1921 lows, the Dow appreciated six-fold, hitting 380 in August 1929.With gold fixed at  20.65 per ounce, the Dow, by the fall of 1929, was equivalent to approximately eighteen ounces. In retrospect, the stock market was radically overvalued. Over the next four years, the Dow fell 90 , bottoming at 42. At the lows, the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold   an extreme reading that would not be repeated for fifty years.In January 1934, Roosevelt raised the gold price to  35 per ounce. The Dow and gold nearly reached parity in 1932  however, they missed each other by  7 per ounce and eighteen months. Between 1929 and 1934, the Dow fell 80  while gold rose 70 . From 1929 to 1935 gold radically outperformed global equity markets.The next time financial assets were radically overvalued relative to gold occurred in the late 1960s. The Dow first broke 1,000 in 1966 and then again in 1969 and 1971. With gold still fixed at  35 per ounce, the Dow was equivalent to twenty-eight ounces  a new record. The 1960s experienced long periods of excess money and credit creation, resulting in a speculative bull market again funded by debt. In retrospect, financial assets were overvalued. Between the late 1960s and 1980, the Dow fell by 25  while gold advanced twenty-four-fold. Finally, by 1980, the Dow and gold both hit 850.Gold entered a grinding bear market following its record overvaluation in 1980. On the other hand, financial assets spent the next two decades rallying. Following the 1929 episode, gold took fifty years to work off its overvaluation. Following the 1980 peak, gold only took twenty years to become cheap relative to financial assets. Between 1980 and 1999, gold fell by 68  from  850 to  253 per ounce, while the Dow advanced thirteen-fold from 850 to 11,000. A prudent investor ought to have been out of the gold market entirely.In 1999 the Dow surpassed 11,000 while gold had fallen to  253 per ounce. The Dow was equivalent to forty-three ounces of gold at those levels   an all-time record. Given these extreme levels, an investor ought to have expected a booming bull market in gold to develop. Indeed, that is what I expected when I made my investments and gave my interview to Forbes in 2000.We were handsomely rewarded. Between 1999 and 2011, gold surged seven-fold, becomingthe best-performing asset class of the decade. Global equities suffered two massive bear markets, ending the period where it started.Over the last decade, the stock market has again entered another huge bull market, leaving the Dow equivalent to 20 ounces of gold. The question is whether this represents under- or overvaluation. Financial bulls  i.e., gold bears  might highlight how the Dow has been equivalent to thirty ounces of gold in the late 1960s and forty ounces in the late 1990s. In this context, 20 1 does not appear radically undervalued. Perhaps the equity bull market will continue. Unfortunately, for equity markets, we firmly believe otherwise.Chart 3 gives us great confidence that today s 20 1 ratio will end up being the cycle peak and that over the next several years, the Dow will be equivalent to fewer than five ounces of gold, the level reached at gold's peak in 2011. The Dow and gold may again cross, similar to what happened in 1980 and almost happened in 1932-4.Each peak in the Dow-gold ratio  1929, 1969, and 1999  coincided with periods of commodity undervaluation. As each commodity bull market started, the Dow-gold ratio contracted massively. In 1929, commodities bottomed relative to financial assets exactly as the Dow reached a high of twenty ounces of gold equivalent. Four short years later, commodities were overvalued relative to financial assets, and the Dow was equivalent to only two ounces of gold after having rallied 70 .In 1968  the year President Johnson removed the US dollar s required 25  gold backing , commodities were the cheapest in history relative to financial assets. At that moment, the Dow peaked at twenty-eight ounces of gold. Over the next twelve years, commodities entered a massive bull market and, by 1980, had become radically overvalued. Gold led the bull market and soared twenty-four-fold from  35 to  800 per ounce. Like in 1929, the Dow-gold ratio peaked in 1968 at precisely the same time commodities bottomed. By January 1980, the Dow was equivalent to one ounce of gold   the lowest reading since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was established in 1896.In 1999, commodities were almost as radically undervalued as in the late 1960s. The Dow-gold ratio reached an all-time high of forty-two just as commodities bottomed. As commodity prices rose, the Dow-gold ratio contracted, reaching eight in 2011.Were commodities overvalued today, we would agree that the boom in financial assets  and bear market in gold  still had years left to run. Under these circumstances, the Dow-gold ratio would continue to move significantly higher. Instead, commodities are as undervalued as they have ever been relative to financial assets. According to our historical framework, a commodity bull market has likely started. As such, we believe the Dow, equivalent to twenty ounces of gold, probably represents a cycle-high and will fall throughout the decade, similar to 1929, 1969, and 1999.How high could prices go if we enter a new gold bull marketIn past gold bull markets, the value of the Treasury s gold holdings has surpassed the monetary base by over 1.5 times   including in 1980 after the US dollar was no longer backed by gold.Given the Fed s balance sheet explosion since 2009, a projected target price for gold seems outlandish. The Fed s monetary base today stands at  5.6 tr. For the Treasury s gold holdings to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times, gold would have to reach  32,000 per ounce. Critics might argue the monetary base is distorted by excess reserves left on balance at the Fed. At present, excess reserves foot to  3.2 tr, and the Fed has talked of someday draining them out of the system. If that were to happen, the Fed s monetary base would fall to  2.4 trillion. Even under this conservative scenario, gold would have to reach  14,000 for the Treasury s gold position to cover the monetary base by 1.5 times. Although these numbers sound outlandish, they represent relationships that have emerged twice in the past 100 years. The first time  the late 1930s  was during massive deflation, while the second  1970  was during inflation. In both scenarios, gold had become the  must own  asset class that all investors clamored for, and the valuation of gold was pushed to the extreme.Could the dollar value of the Treasury s gold holdings reach 1.5 times the monetary base-- as it has twice in the last 100 years  We believe it s highly probable. As financial turmoil surges this decade, investors will aggressively buy gold as an asset class that provides both wealth protection and the opportunity for huge speculative profit. In such a scenario, gold s valuation could very well be pushed to extremes just like it was in the late 1930s and 1980. What about looking at the Dow-Gold relationshipIn the 1930s, the Fed aggressively shrunk its balance sheet by half, producing a deflation implosion that turned into the Great Depression. At the worst point in the crisis, the Dow traded at half its  80 book value. By 1934, gold  now at  35 per ounce  nearly reached parity with the Dow. Currently, the Dow s book value is 8,000. Were the Fed to undertake equally draconian hawkish measures as in the 1930s  something we believe to be unlikely , the Dow could conceivably trade for half its book value, or 4,000. Were gold to trade at parity to the Dow, like it nearly did in 1934, it would more than double. In other words, in the most extreme deflationary scenario, the Dow would fall almost 90  while gold would double   similar to between 1929 and 1934. Investors, with a substantial gold allocation, would do very well.In the late 1970s, the Fed ultimately raised interest rates to record levels in a final successful attempt to break the inflationary forces of the past twenty years. Record real rates put severe downward pressure on global equities. By 1980, the Dow traded at its book value of 850. Gold reached parity with the Dow in January 1980.If we repeat the 1970s and the Fed raised interest rates significantly because of persistent acceleration in inflation, we should see a huge bear market in the Dow with a downside target of its 8000 book value. If history were to repeat the 1970s experience, the Dow toenter a huge bear market and potentially trade down 75  to its book value, and gold prices would rise four  fold Again, investors with significant gold allocations would be the winners.Finally, let us consider a third scenario that has never occurred in 230 years of US financial history. What might happen if the US directly monetized its debtGiven the massive amount of sovereign debt held by governments worldwide and the inherent refinancing risks that it creates, countries  including the US  may attempt to directly monetize their debt in response to a potential failure of a government debt auction. Were this to happen, inflationary pressures would surge, and hyperinflation may ensue. Our hunch is that equities markets may rise, but gold would enter a massive bull market as investors sought assets to protect against currency debasement and the resulting inflation. In such a scenario, gold could easily surpass  35,000 per ounce   1.5 times today s  5.6 tr monetary base. Once again, the winners would be gold investors.In our view, gold will emerge as the asset class with the most potential this decade, no matter the financial or geopolitical backdrop. Under the most extreme scenarios  a repeat of the deflationary implosion that produced the Great Depression or a period of inflation that verges on hyperinflation , gold will be the winning asset class.Commodities and related natural resource markets were broadly weak in the second quarter. Investors remained concerned about a global recession driven by rising interest rates and persistent central bank hawkishness. Adding to the overall gloom was a perceived disappointment in Chinese economic activity. Caused by problems in the real estate sector, disappointing exports, and weaker-than-expected aggregate economic data, investors were decidedly  risk-off   when it came to China, and commodity markets were not spared.With its heavy energy focus, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index fell almost 6 , while the Rogers International Commodity Index, emphasizing metals and agricultural commodities, fell by 2.5 .Natural resource-related equities were weak as well. The S P North American Natural Resource Stock Index  heavily energy weighted  fell 1  during the quarter, while the S P Global Natural Resources Index , more metal and agricultural exposure  fell almost 6 . By comparison, global equity markets were strong during the second quarter  the S P 500 rose 8  while the MSCI All Country World index advanced almost 6 .Metals were among the weakest performers in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about China. Copper prices pulled back 9 , despite easily mobilized copper inventories approaching all-time lows during the quarter. Nickel fared even worse, falling by 14 . Aluminum, meanwhile, fell by 11 , while zinc plummeted by 21 . Cold-rolled steel fell almost 25  in the ferrous metal sector, while iron ore fell 10 . Mining equities were also weak. The  ETF  which tracks copper equities  fell by almost 3 , while the S P Global Base Metals Index fell by 4 .Weak LNG and Chinese worries drove coal prices lower. Australian and South African thermal coal pulled back 30  and 22 , respectively. In the US, coal with access to seaborne markets  notably Central Appalachian and Illinois Basin  fell 28  and 32 , respectively, after surging last year.The oil market was also weak during the second quarter. West Texas Intermediate  WTI  fell almost 7  during the quarter, while Brent fell 5 . Energy-related equities were mixed. The  ETF  mega-cap international energy weighted  fell 2 . However, the S P Oil   Gas E P index and the  oil service stock ETF were strong, rising by 1  and 4 , respectively.Global energy demand continues to surprise to the upside, and even the IEA has raised its estimates. For example, at the end of 2022, the IEA estimated global oil demand would average 101.6 mm barrels per day -- a significant 1.7 mm increase over 2022. In their June  Oil Market Report,  the IEA raised their 2023 demand estimate by an additional 700,000 b d, with the bulk of their underestimation again coming from China. Since the end of 2022, the IEA has raised its Chinese oil demand estimates by 400,000 b d.Responding to global recession worries, the IEA reduced global oil demand by 200,000 b d in its July 2023 OMR. However, we believe the IEA is still radically underestimating global oil demand and that further upward revisions must be made. For example, the IEA has 1.3 mm b d of missing barrels in its first quarter 2023 balances. Our readers know that missing barrels represent the excess of supply less demand that are missing literally-- they can t be found in global inventories. Historically the IEA has made missing barrels disappear by revising global demand upwards, and we believe this time will be no different. We believe the weakness in oil prices in the second quarter can t be explained by faltering demand.We believe the primary weakness in global oil prices in the second quarter is unexpected supply issues. In the final week of March, the US government began selling an additional 26 mm barrels of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil under previously legislated Congressional mandates. All 26 mm barrels had been sold by the last week of June. Over the next four years, the DOE, under Congressional mandate, was scheduled to sell an additional 155 mm barrels of oil out of the SPR 42.5 mm barrels in 2024 and 2025 and 35 mm barrels in 2026 and 2027, and these sales would represent almost 50  of the remaining SPR reserve.In July, however, the DOE announced the cancellation of these sales as part of the attempt to begin  refilling  the SPR. Over the last 18 months, 330 mm barrels have been released by US, European, and Japanese SPR and have been 100  responsible for the slight build we ve seen in commercial inventories. Given July s DOE announcement, SPR sales will be zero over the next four years, which we believe has already begun impacting oil prices. We think it s no coincidence that oil prices rebounded almost 18  since the last week in June just as US SPR releases wound down.SPR sale cancellations, combined with rapidly slowing production growth from the Permian basin and unexpected production cuts from Saudi Arabia, mean that commercial inventories will experience rapid drawdowns in the second half of 2023.Natural gas staged a massive rebound in the second quarter, advancing 26 . European gas, still influenced by swollen inventories related to last winter s record warmth, fell by 26 . Asian gas also continued its retreat falling 5 .With the restart of the Freeport LNG export facility, US inventories have begun to decline versus historical averages, even in the face of highly cool weather at the beginning of the 2023 air conditioning season. Adjusted for population, cooling degree days were 33  below average for May and June. US natural gas inventories peaked relative to ten-year averages in mid-March, just before the Freeport facility returned to service, and now sit only 6  above ten-year averages.We remain incredibly bullish on natural gas prices. The Natural Gas section of the letter discusses the rollover in Marcellus natural gas production and how the 40  plunge in the Haynesville rig count over the last six months will severely impact its output in the next six months. In the next eighteen months, we will add close to 6 bcf per day in LNG export capacity, and our modeling continues to suggest that US natural gas supply will begin a prolonged contraction starting now. Convergence of US natural gas prices-presently at  2.50 per MMBtu with international prices presently at  12mmbtu is practically unavoidable given our modeling of both US natural gas demand and supply. Much of the turmoil in global gas markets, weather-related over the last twelve months, has given investors another extremely opportunistic chance to invest in North American natural gas markets.Uranium rose 10  from  50 to  55 per pound in the second quarter. In the Uranium section of the letter, we discuss our updated supply and demand models for uranium and their implications. Since 2011 post-Fukushima the global uranium market has been in massive surplus as Japan s 50 reactors came offline and global uranium supply surged primarily from Kazakhstan. Between 2011 and 2018, we calculate global uranium inventories built by over 265 m lbs, resulting in substantial downward price pressure uranium prices bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2018 at  18 per lb.However, as our models suggest, the uranium market has now slipped firmly back into deficit. Also, the Yellow Cake and Sprott Uranium Trust closed-end physical uranium investment vehicles have removed over 80 mm lbs of uranium over the last five years. Since 2020 we calculate that uranium has shifted back to deficit and that commercial inventories have been drawn down by 180 mm tonnes. We calculate excess commercial uranium inventories related to the Fukushima-related shutdowns have now been 50  worked down and stand at approximately 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months.Depending on how much physical uranium the two closed-end vehicle buy in 2023 and 2024, we calculate that 100  of the excess Fukushima-related inventory will have been consumed by the end of 2024. Given the deficit between power generation demand and mine supply, and given that almost all easily mobilized Fukishima-related inventory has been removed from the market, we believe uranium prices could move chaotically to the upside.Global agricultural markets fell in the second quarter. Corn fell 16 , wheat fell 8 , and soybeans rose 3.5 .Fertilizers also sold off. Urea  the solid form of nitrogen  fell 10 , phosphate fell 27 , and potash fell 3 . We believe the correction has run its course, and markets have now set up for another crisis. Dry weather continues to plague the corn belt. In their latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate report  WASDE , the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  significantly reduced their US corn yield estimate from 181.5 to 177.5 bushels per acre.Food nationalism has also reemerged. Once again, India banned rice exports as adverse growing conditions lowered the expected harvest. India is the largest rice exporter, representing almost 50  of the seaborne trade. Finally, Russia suspended its agreement allowing Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea. Also, the Russian military has now started to systematically target Ukrainian grain infrastructure over the last month, including Ukraine s grain export facilities on the Danube River.Ukrainian wheat and corn exports were already halved compared with their peak two years ago. After the recent destruction, a further reduction in export volumes is a distinct possibility. In 2021, we predicted a coming agricultural crisis. Our same models now call for a new crisis to develop as we progress through the rest of the year and into 2024. The recent pullback presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Precious metals were weak in the second quarter. Gold fell 2.5 , while silver fell 5 . Platinum and palladium fell 10  and 17 , respectively.Gold and silver equities were also weak. The  and  ETFs  which track gold and silver equities  fell by 7  and 15 , respectively.Earlier in this letter, we outlined the fundamental underpinnings of the upcoming gold bull market and provided a framework for how high gold prices might go.Since the summer of 2020, precious metals have been in a corrective phase. We believe things are about to turn much more bullish.On a short-term basis, one headwind remains. Western investors have again started to liquidate their precious metals holdings.We track the behavior of 18 gold ETFs. For the twelve months ending March 2023, the ETFs liquidated 450 tonnes of gold. Beginning in April, the ETFs stopped shedding. For a moment, it appeared they were starting a period of accumulation. The same ETFs added 60 tonnes of gold holdings from March to May. Unfortunately, western investors returned to shedding over the last two months, this time by 100 tonnes.The ETFs indicate Western interest in gold remains bearish. Western investors, we believe, will drive the upcoming bull market. Thus far, they remain uninterested.On a more positive note, central banks continue to buy gold. In the first six months of 2023, central banks purchased 387 tonnes of gold   a record first-half result, according to the World Gold Council. China accumulated 103 tonnes in the first six months of 2023 and has continuously purchased gold over the last nine months.Since the start of the corrective phase in mid-2020, the ETFs have shed over 600 tonnes of gold.Over the same period, open interest in the COMEX gold futures contract contracted by over 300,000 contracts   or 900 tonnes of  paper gold,  the majority of which were likely matched with physical gold. In total, we estimated western speculators have shed 1,500 tonnes. Central banks, meanwhile, have more than offset this liquidation. Between 2020 and mid-2023, central banks accumulated 2,200 tonnes of physical gold. It stands to reason that prices are now re-testing the mid-2020 highs. Even though western investors have been gold sellers, all selling has been met with central bank buying. We believe western investors will turn into aggressive buyers once central banks turn dovish. When that happens, western demand will collide with central bank buying and gold prices will move dramatically higher. As outlined in our introductory essay, gold prices are heading much higher than anyoneenvisions today. We recommend all investors have significant positions in various precious metal investments, both physical and equities.Why has uranium rallied while every other energy commodity has collapsed  Over the past twelve months, spot uranium advanced 12  while oil, natural gas, and coal all fell anywhere from 30-70 . Our models suggest uranium s strong performance has just started. Uranium has likely reached a pivotal inflection point that could force the price higher by as much as three- to four-fold over the next several years. For the first time in history, uranium has slipped into a persistent and widening deficit. We believe the results will be dramatic. Uranium is much less transparent than other commodity markets  in this essay, we will help shed light on the forces driving uranium over the course of the decade.From the start of the nuclear age in 1945 until 2019, the uranium industry has gone through four distinct periods. Each period has been unique in terms of supply and demand, leading to wild price swings that lasted decades. The market has now definitively entered its fifth major period, likely defined by persistent severe deficits.The first period took place between the mid-1940s and the late 1960s. Governmental stockpiling, for both weapons programs and nuclear power advancement, drove demand. Following the Trinity test in Los Alamos and the subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, attention quickly turned to nuclear s commercial applications. The USSR and England inaugurated the first two nuclear power stations in 1954 and 1956, with England s being the first truly commercial reactor. Despite these early reactors, commercial demand remained extremely low. Throughout the Manhattan Project, a persistent shortage of uranium  along with enrichment bottlenecks , presented ongoing challenges. Protection of supply remained a pivotal point of national security after the war as first the US and then the USSR built up their atomic arsenals. Between 1945 and 1969, Nuclear Engineering International estimates global uranium mine supply totaled 900 mm lbs of triuranium octoxide  U3O8 . Roughly half of this material was purchased by the US Atomic Energy Commission , while 40 mm lbs was purchased by the nascent commercial nuclear energy industry. Although the remaining 226 mm lbs was officially unaccounted for, it likely made its way to a combination of American, British, French, and Soviet government stockpiles.The uranium market began to change in the early 1970s as commercial nuclear power gained adoption. Private sector utility buying became a dominant source of demand. Total installed capacity grew from 1 GWe in 1960 to 10 GWe by 1970 and 100 GWe by 1980. The arrival in earnest of the nuclear age also stoked a speculative boom in uranium mining. Production in the US peaked in 1980 at nearly 45 mm lbs of U3O8 per year. Despite the widespread adoption of nuclear power, mine supply actually grew faster than reactor demand throughout the decade. The 1970s were a period of rolling energy crises and insecurity. As a result, commercial buyers were more than happy to build up excess uranium inventories. From 1970 to 1983, mine supply exceeded reactor demand by 450 mm lbs of U3O8, all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Adding to the glut, the AEC reclassified approximately 100 mm lbs of its stockpiles from  governmental  to  commercial,  making it available to the nuclear power industry. By 1983, commercial inventories were 550 mm lbs   enough to cover reactor demand for nearly eight years. Prices peaked in 1982 at nearly  40 per pound and started a decades-long collapse.Uranium mine supply peaked in 1982 and fell modestly during the decade. Reactor demand meanwhile grew robustly and finally exceeded mine supply in 1991. For the first time since the days of the Manhattan Project, uranium entered into a primary deficit. The deficit would persist for the next twenty-seven years, until the Fukushima incident. Unlike during the Manhattan Project, however, secondary sources of uranium filled the shortfall. Between 1983 and 2010, Nuclear Engineering International estimates reactor demand exceeded mine supply by an incredible 1.1 bn lbs of U3O8. Mine supply fell by nearly half from 170 mm lbs in 1982 to a plateau of 75 mm lbs by 1995. Reactor demand was nearly the mirror image, growing from 65 to 175 mm lbs over the 27-year period. Secondary supply made up the shortfall.In 1993, Russia and the US entered into the so-called  Megatons for Megawatts  program, through which Russia pledged to decommission 20,000 nuclear warheads and convert the highly enriched uranium into 15,000 tonnes of low-enriched uranium suitable for manufacturing into reactor fuel. Russia also sold additional material outside of the program to provide much-needed funding following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Fuel recycling became widespread in the UK and France during this period as well, as did enrichment-tailing reprocessing. Secondary sources supplied a combined 630 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent between 1983 and 2010. Commercial inventory destocking contributed another 500 mm lbs. The Department of Energy  the successor to the AEC , reclassified another 75 mm lbs of U3O8 from governmental to commercial, adding more material to the commercial market. All of this secondary supply put extreme downward pressure on uranium. Prices bottomed at  7.10 per pound in 2000.By the mid-2000s, commercial inventories had fallen dramatically. The Russian disarmament program was due to expire in 2013, threatening to reduce secondary supplies materially. Uranium began to firm in 2003  by 2005 the price had tripled from  7 to  21 per pound. By the late 2000s, commercial inventories had fallen nearly 70  and stood at only 200 mm lbs. Commercial inventory coverage went from eight years in 1983 to less than two years by 2007. Utility buyers scrambled and speculators swooped in.Spot prices reached a high of  136 per pound in June 2007, with long-term contracts settling at  95 per pound  an increase of between twelve- and eighteen-fold in seven years. Uranium collapsed during the Global Financial Crisis, but resumed its rally in 2010. By February 2011, uranium was once again over  70 per pound and commercial inventories stood at a mere 150 mm lbs.On March 11 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami led to a partial meltdown of Japan s Fukushima Daishi reactor. Japan shut down all its nuclear reactors over the next several years. European demand, led by German decommissioning, fell by 25 . Global reactor demand fell sharply from 182 mm to 150 mm lbs between 2010 and 2012 before beginning a slow recovery. Meanwhile, responding  with a lag  to the prior uranium boom, primary supply grew for the first time in decades. In-situ leach production in Kazakhstan grew by nearly 50 , or 20 mm lbs, between 2010 and 2016. Primary production nearly satisfied reactor demand in 2015   a first in over twenty-five years.Secondary supplies weighed on the market as well. Although the Russian disarmament program ended in 2013, tailings reenrichment, DOE surplus sales, recycling and underfeeding continued to contribute as much as 40 mm lbs of U3O8-equivalent by 2016.Between 2011 and 2018, the uranium market was in surplus by 265 mm lbs., all of which ended up in commercial inventories. Commercial stockpiles, which started the period at a record-low 150 mm lbs., reached 415 mm lbs. by 2018, covering reactor demand for three years.We became interested in uranium producers this cycle in late 2017, when Cameco announced they would curtail production at its flagship MacArthur River Mine. Kazatomprom followed suit, announcing it would curtail production. Our models told us these cuts would push reactor demand firmly above total supply, including secondary sources. In retrospect, we were correct. Commercial inventories peaked in 2018 and declined slightly in 2019 and 2020. The era of persistent deficits had started.The uranium price meanwhile remained depressed, averaging less than  25 per pound between 2016 and 2020.Uranium s structural deficit has accelerated dramatically since 2021. Reactor demand bottomed in 2020 at 161 mm lbs of U3O8 and is expected to reach 188 mm lbs this year. After spending a decade decommissioning its nuclear reactors, Europe and the US appear to have finally reversed course. We have long argued that wind and solar simply cannot provide efficient base-load carbon-free electricity. We warned that grid instability and energy insecurity would soon follow. Russia s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 put Europe s natural gas supply at risk, bringing renewables  shortcomings to the fore. Primary uranium production remained depressed through 2022 at 120 mm lbs   a multi-decade low. Secondary supply averaged only 22 mm lbs. leaving a deficit of nearly 30 mm lbs in 2021 and 2022.A new source of demand burst onto the scene in 2021 as well  the financial buyer. Led by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, financial vehicles have acquired between 25 and 30 mm lbs each year in 2021 and 2022. Unlike open-ended funds such as the GLD, the financial uranium vehicles are closed-ended, meaning the material cannot readily flow back into the commercial market. Once material is purchased it is permanently locked up.As a result, the uranium market experienced a deficit of nearly 180 mm lbs between 2020 and 2023. The deficit was met by materially depleting the commercial inventories that had accumulated following Fukushima. By the end of this year, we expect commercial inventories will be back to 250 mm lbs, covering reactor demand by less than 18 months. The last time commercial inventories reached these levels in the mid-2000s, prices spiked to their all-time highs of  145 per pound. We expect the same now.Looking to the end of the decade, global uranium markets are set to tighten to unprecedented levels. Looking only at nuclear power plants that are currently under construction, reactor demand is set to grow from 188 to 240 mm lbs by 2030. If every uranium-producing country gets back to its maximum output  a big if  , primary production will only grow from 140 to 174 mm pounds by 2030. Assuming secondary supply stays flat at 20 mm lbs per year, the annual uranium market deficit will grow from 27 to 45 mm lbs by the end of the decade, before factoring in further financial buying. The cumulative deficit between 2023 and 2030 will likely exceed 250 mm lbs, completely depleting all commercial stockpiles.These figures are likely too conservative. There are presently fifty-nine reactors under construction with a total capacity of 66 GWe. Every new reactor requires three years of uranium fuel for its initial core loading. We believe this will consume an additional 60 mm lbs of U3O8 between now and 2030. Over the past twenty years, new reactors have been mostly offset by retirements. When a reactor is decommissioned, it is able to harvest its final core loading without requiring a replacement. Therefore, new reactor loadings have been offset by retiring old reactors. This will not be possible going forward.Furthermore, financial accumulation is likely to accelerate once speculators realize the small size of the market and the precarious commercial inventory situation. How large financial buying can get is an open question, however adding another 100 mm lbs of U3O8 would only cost  6 bn and would dramatically tighten balances even further.Utilities remain dramatically under-contracted post-2025. Fuel buyers have been very complacent in recent years, due to the persistent commercial inventory overhang following Fukushima. Simply put, it has paid to wait to secure supplies. That dynamic is quickly changing as fuel buyers feel insecure and under-covered for the first time in nearly fifteen years.Although it is an opaque market, all signs point to uranium entering into a sustained and frenetic bull market. Prices have rallied from a 2018 low of  18 to nearly  60 per pound already. However, even at these prices, it is unlikely many new greenfield uranium deposits can be economically developed.The uranium industry has been dramatically starved of capital for many years. In our view, the persistent bear market   in many ways present since the 1980s with only a single reprieve   is over. Investors should act accordingly.We believe oil is on the verge of a sharp rally. As we write this, West Texas Intermediate and Brent trade for  84 and  87 per barrel, respectively. We believe it will not be long before both are well above  100. Since the COVID bottom in March 2020, energy equities have been the best-performing sector of the S P 500, while spot crude has been the best-performing asset class. However, for the twelve months ending June 2023, spot crude fell by 33 . The question has been whether the recent selloff was a consolidation amidst a broader rally or the start of a new bear market.We are adamant in our belief that this bull market has only begun and prices will increase. All of the bullish elements we have discussed remain firmly in place  the industry is still highly capital-starved, oil demand is strong, and the US shales are depleting.The recent selloff resulted from massive liquidations from various strategic petroleum reserves. For 2022, the US released 220 mm from its SPR, amounting to 607,000 b d. Other countries liquidated 40 m b or 100,000 b d. The US continued liquidating its SPR into 2023 as well. Although concerns surrounding Russia s invasion of Ukraine may have prompted SPR liquidations last spring, this year s sales were part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which mandated the US to sell oil from the SPR to fund spending bills. During the second quarter, the US released 25 mm bbl from the SPR or 260,000 b d.Our last letter explained the tight relationship between price and seasonally-adjusted inventory levels. Oil is fairly valued at  75 per barrel based only on commercial inventories. Including the now-depleted SPRs, oil should be trading at  120. Therefore, we estimate the impact of the SPR releases at anywhere between  30-40 per barrel. It is no coincidence that as soon as the US stopped liquidating its SPR at the end of June, oil bottomed and has since rallied 20 .The Bipartisan Budget Act SPR sales automatically  phased out  if reserves reached 350 mm barrels. When Congress passed the Act, the SPR held 650 mm barrels, and it is likely few policymakers ever expected to use the  phase out  provision. However, with the SPR now at just 347 mm barrels, the Act no longer allows further liquidation. Just last week, the administration announced it would cancel all additional planned sales from the SPR. With the US no longer selling several hundred thousand barrels per day from its strategic reserves, commercial inventories are set to fall sharply throughout the rest of the year, pushing prices higher.Even with the unprecedented SPR liquidation, commercial inventories remained subdued. Inventories peaked at 280 mm barrels above and bottomed at 60 mm below the five-year average in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Presently, inventories are in line with the five-year average. Including the SPR, inventories are 300 mm barrels below five-year averages   a record deficit.Global inventories are just as tight. OECD commercial inventories went from 300 mm bbl above to 300 mm bbl below five-year averages between 2020 and 2022 and currently stand at 95 mm bbl below average. Including government stockpiles, inventories remain 400 mm bbl below average   another record.Based upon our supply and demand estimates, inventories could draw by 360 mm bbl between now and yearend, leaving commercial and total inventories at dangerously-low levels.Despite headlines to the contrary, the oil market remained extremely tight over the past twelve months. Governments effectively hindered the bullish price signal by liquidating vast quantities from their strategic reserves. This is unlikely to continue, clearing the way for prices to increase.Most analysts attribute the selloff to recession fears and weak demand, but our data tells us consumption remains robust. For nearly fifteen years, headlines have called for the  end of oil demand.  As recently as 2020, many agencies, including the International Energy Agency  IEA , predicted that 2019 was the peak in global oil demand. Hardly four years later, consumption set a new record and shows no signs of slowing. Any worries about long-term structural oil demand are entirely misguided for at least the next decade.The oil market will be driven higher by lackluster supply caused by years of underinvestment. Demand, meanwhile, will enjoy a persistent tailwind and continue to consistently surprise to the upside. In our following letter, we will write extensively on global commodity demand  today, we offer a preview.Energy consumers fall into two categories  those in the developed world and those in emerging markets. The former comprises 17  of the world s population and consumes 170 GJ per person of primary energy. The latter makes up 83  of the population  or seven billion people  and annually consumes less than 60 GJ per person. Each year, millions begin their move from emerging-market to lower-middle-income energy consumers.As they prosper, their primary energy consumption triples from 60 to 170 GJ annually. This phenomenon will be the primary growth driver over the next twenty years. Analysts pontificate on EV penetration, but even the most aggressive scenarios cannot overcome this dramatic increase in primary energy demand per capita. Others worry about energy efficiency. Again, the move from emerging markets to lower middle-income energy consumers will eclipse any improvement in energy efficiency.For example, over the last fifteen years, OECD per capita energy demand fell by 11 , primarily due to improved energy efficiency. However, non-OECD per capita demand surged by 25 , pushing global per capita demand higher by 5  the so-called  S-Curve  at work. While it is true that, in theory, making something more energy efficient should reduce demand, in practice, the trend has been towards more demand, not less. More people are in the energy-intensive period of their development, moving from 60 GJ to 170 GJ of primary energy demand. According to Jevons  Paradox, efficiency may lead to faster growth. In 1865, Jevons postulated that improved energy efficiency would lower costs and ultimately increase demand. While his Paradox is controversial, we believe there is evidence of this phenomenon in emerging market economies.Amazingly, in their latest long-term forecast, the IEA projects global per capita primary energy demand will fall between now and 2035. Simply put, this cannot happen. The IEA  and others  will chronically miss the mark until they realize this.The IEA has also warned about near-term oil demand  we believe these worries are similarly unfounded. In their latest Oil Market Report, the IEA revised down 2Q23, 3Q23, and 4Q23 demand estimates by 250,000 b d. In their summary  which is released to the press ahead of the full report , they warned that  persistent macroeconomic headwinds, apparent in a deepening manufacturing slump, have led us to revise our 2023 growth estimate lower for the first time this year, by 220 kb d.The IEA neglects to mention how they quietly revised historical demand higher for 2020, 2021, and 2022. They also revised 2024 estimates higher as well. Furthermore, the 1Q23 balancing item ran at a near-record 1.4 m b d, suggesting global demand likely reached 101.9 m b d   a record level for any quarter and a full 2.5 m b d above 1Q22. In their long term Oil 2023 report, the IEA expects oil consumption to grow by 6  between now and 2030, or by 900,000 b d, not materially lower than the fifteen years between 2005 and 2019 despite all the talk of EVs and efficiency. In 2020, the IEA predicted 2019 marked peak oil demand. Only a few years later, the IEA pushed its prediction to 2030. We have no doubt this revised out further as well.While investors remain fixated on demand, they seem to neglect problems in the global oil supply. In our last letter, we wrote about depletion problems in the Permian basin. Over the past 15 years, the US shales were the only material source of non-OPEC  growth. In turn, the Permian has represented most of all shale growth over the past five years. We warned that emerging depletion in the Permian would have a massive impact on global oil markets.Since we last wrote, Permian depletion has accelerated. Last year marked the first time Permian productivity per lateral foot decreased year-over-year, falling by 7 . For the first three months of 2023, productivity per foot fell by a further 4  compared with 2022. According to the Energy Information Agency , by August, the Permian will be growing by only 360,000 b d year-on-year, compared with nearly 700,000 b d as recently as February. Our models suggest that year-on-year Permian growth will be less than 100,000 b d by year-end and turn negative in early 2024. Although the next few months may be bumpy, we believe the Permian will definitively roll over sometime in 2024 as companies run out of their best drilling prospects. Despite high prices, producers dropped fourteen rigs in the Permian over the past three months, potentially signally inventory exhaustion. The other US shales are not faring any better. Shale production outside the Permian has not grown in nearly three years, despite oil rallying from  20 to  75 per barrel. The only material source of non-OPEC  growth over the past fifteen years is about to peak.The IEA meanwhile predicts non-OPEC  production ex-US to grow by 400,000 b d this year. However, we believe this is too optimistic. Since first releasing their projections last summer, the IEA has systematically revised non-OPEC  ex-US production lower by 300,000 b d and we believe this trend will continue.As non-OPEC  production falters, OPEC  will gain market share and pricing power. In early August, Saudi Arabia announced they would extend their production cuts by at least another month. Saudi produced less than 10 m b d in May and June   a thirteen year low. Some analysts view the cuts as an admission of weak global demand. Based on our demand analysis, we disagree. We and other analysts believe the cuts are necessary to rest aging fields, including Ghawar. Still, others argue the Saudis are merely offsetting government SPR liquidations. Whatever the case, several years ago, the Saudis would have been far too worried about losing market share to the growing shales to cut production. That concern is now gone.According to the IEA, demand will average 103.2 m b d in the second half of 2023. Global supply  including OPEC NGLs, processing gains, and biofuels  will only reach 101.5 m b d, leaving the market undersupplied by a massive 1.7 m b d. We think this understates the problem. The balancing item ran at 1.3 m b d in the first quarter, suggesting demand was understated. Adjusting demand higher by 1 m b d for the rest of the year implies a 2.7 m b d deficit that would take inventories down by over 400 mm bbl by December 31st. At that point, commercial inventories would reach a record 500 mm bbl deficit while total inventories would reach a record 820 mm bbl deficit   the lowest levels since our data begins.We are amazed at the level of investor apathy and disinterest. Despite three years of market-leading performance, funds continue to flow out of significant energy ETFs, including the XOP and XLE.The past six months saw the lowest level of energy IPOs and secondary offerings in nearly 25 years. Capital spending trends remain depressed and corporate valuations are at record lows. Energy remains less than 4  of the S P 500, nearly two-thirds below its long-term average. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Buffett has steadily added to his Chevron and Occidental Petroleum positions. Berkshire Hathaway added to his Occidental Petroleum position in the second quarter and now owns 25  of the company. Investors have radically undercapitalized the energy industry over the past ten years, and the results are becoming apparent. The only way to attract capital back to the space will be through solid returns. We believe that by the end of this bull market, everyone will argue that energy is again the  must-own  sector. Still, for the time being, contrarian value investors are being offered an excellent opportunity with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations. Investors will not be able to remain apathetic for much longer.In our view, natural gas prices are reaching a turning point. Gas spiked to decade highs last spring following Russia s invasion of Ukraine, only to fall back on milder-than-normal winter weather. Instead of running out of gas, traders worried about running out of storage as prices collapsed to near-all-time lows.During market panic or euphoria, investors make the mistake of linearly extrapolating current trends. As a result, they fail to see the ground shifting underneath them and miss out on excellent opportunities. Natural gas represents a classic buying opportunity, and we believe investors are again focused on all the wrong issues.Only several weeks ago, we heard many analysts openly question whether the US would run out of natural gas storage before the end of the injection season. Such an event would create the dreaded  gas on gas competition,  potentially driving prices to zero  or below . With the injection season half complete, these concerns were unfounded. Inventories started the year in line with seasonal averages. Extremely mild weather resulted in nearly 5  fewer heating degree days between January and April, significantly reducing heating demand. Inventories grew to 382 bcf above seasonal averages by April. Mild winter weather was followed by a mild start to summer. Cooling degree days in April, May, and June were nearly 30  below the five-year average, reducing air conditioning demand. Despite the milder-than-normal start to summer, US inventories did not grow relative to seasonal averages.Bymid-June, inventories remained 385 bcf above average. As the weather turned warmer in July, inventories have started to come down and currently stand at 320 bcf above average, the lowest level since February. Notably, July was 3  milder than average, suggesting the market would be in an even more significant deficit had temperatures been average. Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  exports help explain why US inventories declined relative to seasonal averages despite mild weather. LNG demand reached a record of 12.5 bcf d in May as Freeport returned online after a damaging fire left it inoperable for over a year. Based upon our analysis, the likelihood of full storage by the end of the injection season in the fall is very low  gas prices will likely rally from here.Over the next two years, an additional six billion cubic feet of LNG exports will come online at Golden Pass, Plaquemines, and Corpus Christi. Another 1.6 bcf d is due to come online at Port Arthur in 2027. Where will these facilities source their gasIn our last letter, we explained how the same depletion issues plaguing the oil shales are also at work in the gas shales. The Marcellus represents 25  of all US dry gas supply and has not grown in nearly two years. Production peaked in late 2021 at 26.5 bcf d   almost one bcf d higher than current levels. The Permian produces natural gas alongside oil, but declining productivity across the basin suggests sustained growth will be difficult.The Haynesville surged to nearly eight bcf d by 2011 before declining by half through 2017. Renewed interest led to a second period of growth, until by late 2022, production peaked at 14.3 bcf d. Unfortunately, production has now been flat for eight months. The Haynesville is deep and highly over pressured, resulting in elevated drilling and completion costs. Companies raced to lay down rigs as prices fell from  7.00 per mcf in December 2022 to  2.00 by February 2023.After peaking at seventy-two rigs in December, there are now only forty-four rigs operating in the play, with most of the decline occurring in June. Production often follows drilling with a several-month lag. If seventy-two rigs cannot produce much growth in the first few months of 2023, then production will likely fall from here. High prices would likely incentivize increased drilling in Haynesville, similar to what happened in 2017. However, the field had only produced 20  of its reserves back then compared with nearly 50  presently. It will likely be more challenging if not impossible-- to boost production this time once basin-level declines take hold, considering it is a much more mature play.Our models tell us we have overbuilt our LNG export capacity without adequately considering where the upstream feedstock will come from. US natural gas remains by far the cheapest unit of energy globally by as much as 75 . Once demand, driven by LNG expansion, exceeds domestic supply, our expectation is that this discount will evaporate, sending US gas prices up several-fold, as US prices converge with international prices.Turning to Europe, hot summer weather was not enough to offset their record mild winter  air conditioning in Europe remains less prevalent than in North America . European gas storage is now 88  full compared with an average of 74  for this time of year   a surplus of 14 percentage points. While still high, this is much lower than the record set after the winter on March 26th when inventories reached 56  full, a 22  surplus compared with seasonal averages.In March, the German energy minister Klaus Mueller warned that Germany would run out of natural gas by January 2024 on colder than average weather. Considering inventories at the time were running further ahead of seasonal averages than they are today, we would expect his concerns have not lessened.Both US and global natural gas markets rest on a knife s edge. After last year s incredibly mild winter, inventories are no longer at dangerously low levels. However, the longer-term supply and demand trends point to extreme tightening, particularly in the US. Investors are extrapolating current trends but missing the significant shifts taking place. They should take heed.Driven by concerns of an impending global recession, copper sentiment remained bearish during the second quarter. On the other hand, copper s short-term fundamentals became increasingly bullish. Mine supply disappointed again in the first four months of 2023, according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics  WBMS . Chilean production continues to be particularly problematic.For the first four months of the year, Chilean mine supply fell by nearly 2  compared to last year. Codelco warned that production could hit the lowest level in twenty-five years. In June, André Sougarret abruptly resigned as Codelco s Chief Executive Officer after only one year on the job. Mr. Sougarret cited the numerous  complexities  facing the Chilean copper mines.Chile supplies almost one-quarter of all copper production and, in past letters, we have discussed the issues plaguing their copper industry  in particular, declining ore grades, water shortages, labor issues, and uncertain fiscal regimes all negatively impacted production. Unfortunately, we do not expect any of these issues to improve going forward. Global copper mine supply contracted by 0.2  in the first four months of 2023 compared to last year, driven by disappointments in Chile.Meanwhile, global copper demand remained robust in both OECD and non-OECD countries. For the first four months of 2023, OECD copper demand increased by a robust 3.7 . Despite countless bearish articles in the financial press, Chinese copper demand continues to surge, with refined demand rising by 8  year-on-year.While China always dominates the headlines, we believe the pivotal element of Asian copper demand is India. We first wrote in 2018 that Indian copper demand was set to surge, very similar to China in 1999-2000. Even though few analysts have paid any attention, India s copper consumption grew by almost 30  during the first four months of 2023 compared to last year. Global consumption in aggregate has surged 6  so far this year. Strong demand and weak mine supply continue to drive inventories to near all-time lows.Exchange inventories on the Shanghai, London Metal Exchange  LME  and COMEX fell from a high of 900,000 tonnes reached in 2018 to only 170,000 tonnes today. Although inventories are twice as high as the all-time low of 75,000 tonnes reached in 2005, production has grown by nearly 60  over that time. As a result, when measured in days of consumption, exchange inventories are almost as low as in 2005.Given the low exchange inventories and the bullish supply demand trends, we believe speculators will soon panic much as they did back at the end of 2005 into 2006. Low inventories, combined with massive short covering, spiked copper prices higher by almost 200  in just six months. We are now potentially set up for a recurrence of that 2005-2006 copper price spike.Although we remain concerned about the universally bullish outlook adopted by the global metal analytic and investment community a topic discussed in last quarter s letter we believe the rapidly tightening underlying fundamentals will push copper prices significantly higher in the next six to twelve months. For those investors that have exited their copper investments on global recessionary fears, we believe the copper s weakness in the second quarter has given investors another excellent opportunity to increase their exposure.

StealthGas: Flying Under The Radar,"In the intricate mosaic of the global shipping industry, certain players, while being fundamental, often remain unnoticed. StealthGas Inc.  is one such entity, maneuvering silently within the LPG sector and crafting a unique success story. As the worldStealthGas serves as a global conduit for transporting liquefied petroleum gas and other related gas products. These products, which are liquefied derivatives of natural gas and crude oil, encompass substances like propane, butane, butadiene, isoprene, propylene, vinyl chloride monomer, and other similar liquefied gases. The company boasts one of the most expansive independent LPG carrier fleets in the world, ranging from 3,000 to 8,000 cubic meters, with additional vessels capable of holding up to 40,000 cbm. These vessels transport goods all over the world but due to high rates they mostly trade west of the Suez in the EU  Mediterranean Sea area. Overall the LPG segment has benefited from increased rates due to the Russia-Ukraine War and the associated EU regulations concerning Russian energy. EU countries have sought energy elsewhere and LPG ships have helped fill the energy gap, which has benefited worldwide fleet rates.Historically GASS, like many in the sector, has been highly leveraged with a majority of cash flows being used to pay debt obligations and acquire new vessels. The changing market dynamic recently has led GASS to be in a much better situation. They have paid off a large amount of their debt and their profitability is at all time high.Similar to the  we see structural supply and demand differences in the market. We see LPG rates continue to climb as LPG ships get older and reach the end of their operational lives. We see the limited growth of worldwide fleets benefiting the whole LPG space but especially GASS due to their low leverage.StealthGas showcased a record performance in the first half of 2023, marking its highest profitability for any H1 at  10.5 million. The company leveraged the rising asset prices to actively sell vessels, with four vessels already sold and two smaller LPGs, Eco Dream and Eco Green, set to be sold for around  35 million. Despite operating with four fewer vessels, the company noted a slight increase in net voyage revenues to  67.2 million. In chartering, StealthGas secured employment for 80  of 2023's remaining days, translating to  90 million in revenues for future periods. Unlike others in the industry GASS has no vessels operating in the spot market which limits their ability to make more from higher rates but also limits their downside as the ships are lock in on profitable contracts.In Q2, StealthGas observed a 5  decline in adjusted net income. However, during the six-month span, there was an impressive growth in profits, moving from  20 million to  28 million  40  YoY . A notable accomplishment for the company was the significant reduction of its debt, decreasing from  316.6 million in June 2022 to a mere  166.7 million by June 2023. This substantial reduction resulted from a mix of robust earnings and vessel sales. With the current margin rates, GASS's total debt equates to 15.8 quarters of net income. Moreover, with its long-term debt  due within the upcoming year  at  16.6 million, and a healthy cash reserve of  48.1 million, GASS is financially solid. This allows the company to prioritize investor returns and fleet expansion over the need of debt repayment. The net debt standing at  83.9 million further bolsters the potential for investor returns in the foreseeable future. The strong financial positioning allows GASS to fund expansion with debt instead of equity dilution and has allowed them to secure  30 million for a new vessel.StealthGas's liquidity, inclusive of restricted cash and short-term investments, was recorded at  55.1 million at the quarter's end. This was a drop from the previous year's  95.7 million, mainly attributed to the strategic debt repayment. The company's investments in joint ventures dropped to  38 million, following a hefty  19.2 million dividend received post the sale of a vessel. StealthGas also achieved a non-cash gain of  2.9 million from the sale of two vessels, while simultaneously recognizing a non-cash impairment of  2.8 million on the agreed sale of two vessels set for delivery in January 2024. Interest and finance costs were slightly diminished for the quarter, despite a threefold rate increase in the comparative periods. This was a result of StealthGas's aggressive debt repayment strategy, aiming to mitigate interest costs.Operationally, in Q2 2023 GASS saw a 12  reduction in calendar days, while net revenues for the quarter stood firm at  33.1 million. Over a six-month period, there was a slight 1  increase in costs compared to the prior year, even with a reduced fleet size. The quarterly operating expenses climbed to  13.4 million, mainly due to inflationary factors that were especially noticeable in the first quarter. Contracted days remain high for 2023, with projections showing  90 million in revenues up to 2026. All vessels for 2023 drydocking have been serviced which shows they are ready for a productive next couple of quarters. The drydocking costs, which were at  1.5 million for Q2 and  2.6 million over the previous six months. This significant increment was due to the drydocking of three of the four Handysize vessels in the fleet. These larger vessels naturally incur higher expenses when dry docked which occurs every five years.GASS has been selling their older ships, reinvesting the proceeds and utilizing their better capital structure to secure financing for purchases of new ships through a collection of Joint Ventures and financed purchases. GASS has been selling their smaller vessels and moving in to larger, more modern and more efficient vessels. These vessels will be coming online over the next couple of quarters and should lead to an increase in not only GASS's capabilities but also their revenue and profit generation.These large vessels known as VLGCs command higher rates and in June of this year commanded  rate. The move in to more modern vessels not only expands their top line revenue but also protects them from upcoming regulations that will affect a variety of global vessels.The age old question of investing   When can I see a return  Due to GASS's historically high leverage they have not been in a position to return cash to investors through dividends or stock buybacks. During the recent earnings call when asked about capital return Harry Vafias responded with the followingWhen examining a company for capital returns we like to take a look at a modified version of total shareholder yield. We take the combination of Dividends and Stock Buybacks relative to trailing twelve month Net Income. GASS over the last 12 months has spent  0 on dividends and has the ability  not obligation  to purchase roughly  10 million worth of stock. Against a TTM net income of  41.7 million. Showing a modified shareholder yield of  24 . This to us shows what percentage of net income is being used to bolster investors vs bolstering the company.Currently trading at  184 million, GASS approval of  10 million in stock buyback translates to a possible 5  reduction in total outstanding shares for GASS while only needing roughly 1 4 of net income. We believe that this fact alone is what makes GASS a buy at current prices. Add in the FWD valuations of EV EBITDA of 3.66 and Price-to-book of .34 we believe that GASS offers significant upside from current prices. If elevated rates and high profitability continue we expect to see similar percentages of net income going to stock buybacks.While risks are evident in the volatile and capital intensive shipping market we believe that the low leverage, prudent management, new fleet, and market dynamics are in GASS favor. We believe that the lack of a dividend, low market cap and existence in the Oil and Gas Sector have led to underinvestment and under coverage in GASS from many market investors. Despite the recent performance of the stock, up 83  YTD, believe that there is more upside in the stock. Due to the low float and high upside potential from earnings beats and ship deliveries on the horizon we see GASS as a strong buy up to  7. At  7 we see P E come more in line with industry peers.We believe that at current prices the stock presents little downside risk and see little reason to hedge below current prices. We believe any further drop in price will incentivize management to begin their repurchase program which will buoy the stock. In addition to this the lack of dividends is also a bonus of r along position at this point. Catalysts that may cause downslide slippage would be weaknesses in the LPG market which could be caused by Supply Demand miss matches or through a warm winter requiring less energy than expected. From a trading perspective we see much greater chances of upside, with the stock trading at low valuations and relatively low Implied Volatility we are going to be initiating a synthetic long here. In this specific example we will be selling  5 Mar. 2024 Cash Covered Puts and then using the proceeds to purchase  5 and  7.50 Calls Mar. 2024. This strategy will provide us with limited downside protection and offer unlimited upside on a stock that we believe is chronically undervalued   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Bull Market No One Is Talking About...,"The best bull markets are those that move higher on very little fanfare. It seems uranium is now firmly in that camp.On the back of ever-growing demand  the long-term bull case  and increasingly tight supply  the short-term bull case , theI am  uranium and continue to believe the market offers an excellent risk reward setup over the medium term.The big elephant in the room for the sector is the ever closing discount to NAV of the Sprott physical fund . Remember, when this entity trades at a premium to NAV  which has historically occurred when speculation has run rampant , the fund can issue additional shares and use theOf course, the fund has been trading at a discount to NAV for most of the past 24 months and has not reported any physical purchases since April. But, should utilities begin to feel the pinch of dwindling supply and speculators return to the market, there remains the risk of much higher uranium prices on the horizon, of which a financial buyer such as Sprott would only exaccerbate.Oh, and Cameco  cutting its 2023 production estimates isn t going to help this supply and demand imbalance one bit.The fact the uranium miners ETF  recently broke out of its two-year symmetrical wedge pattern and is testing 52-week highs only acts to reaffirm the outlook for uranium prices. Clearly, this is a sector to keep an eye on.Another sector where price action continues to unfold in a positive fashion is the oil market. I have been  oil and energy stocks for a few months now, and it seems the technical picture looks to be confirming the bullish fundamentals. If you look closely, oil looks to be breaking out to 2023 highs, suggesting the downtrend in oil prices is all but over.Speaking of oil market fundamentals, the term structure remains firmly in backwadation and thus continues to suggest the oil market is tight.While the inventory picture seemingly confirms this point. Not only are inventory levels well below their seasonal averages, but we are seeing some of the largest inventory draws since 2021.These inventory drawdowns and term structure backwardation continue to reaffirm the notion that supply is tight and the market is in a deficit. Whether this continues into next year remains to be seen  I must admit I am somewhat sceptical that we see  100  oil just yet , but for now, things are looking good for oil bulls.This near-term outlook is only further reinforced when we consider these dynamics in the context of what is historically a very favourable period for oil prices through September and October.And although we have seen somewhat of an unwind of the recent multi-year low in speculative positioning, positioning and sentiment overall are far from any levels representative of irrational exuberance.Until we see a change in the fundamentals, any pullback in oil and energy stocks should be viewed as a buying opportunity for the time being.The ISM Manufacturing report for August was released this past week, with my overall takeaway being the overall PMI and its subcomponents continue to support the  that many of the primary leading indicators of the business cycle have bottomed.The ISM Manufacturing PMI - which I view as the most timely indicator of the business cycle, and tends to lead the primary hard economic data points such as industrial production, consumption and employment by around 3-6 months - increased by 1.2  from 46.4 to 47.6. Although it is still in contractionary territory  sub-50 , it looks to be forming a bottom.In relation to the subcomponents of the ISM report, the New Orders index also ticked higher while Inventories ticked lower  with the spread between the two generally leading the composite PMI itself by around three months . We also saw the Prices Paid index tick higher, also confirming my  that goods disinflation may be over.Although the Employment index ticked higher in August  4.1 , the overall trend remains to the downside  albeit slightly . This was largely in-line with the BLS s August payrolls report, which was stronger than expected  reinforcing the theme of a resilient economy and that we are likely not yet in recession , but the continued downward revisions confirms underlying weakness  as suggested by the ISM Manufacturing Employment  and that continued deterioration in the labour market lies ahead.Remember, when analysing economic data, it is important to remember the leads and the lags. Employment is lagging, which the ISM subcomponents are leading, and no single indicator can be relied upon in isolation to guide one's investment strategy.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Super Micro Computer Q4 Earnings Review: Strong Demand Hampered By Supply Shortages,"Super Micro Computer, Inc.  has been one of the hottest AI stocks of 2023. I initiated coverage of SMCI with a Strong Buy rating in late May, stating that I had been building a positionLast quarter, SMCI missed on EPS estimates and barely beat on revenue. Throughout fiscal Q3, the company was grappling with unforeseen component shortages, and yet the stock  following earnings. SMCI CEO Charles Liang had this to say about fiscal Q3In this article, I'll review again why SMCI is such a hot stock and review the recent earnings call.Despite an overwhelmingly pessimistic attitude in markets throughout 2022, SMCI prevailed as one of the top performers. This rampage has continued throughout 2023 with SMCI benefitting from the AI-stock bull run. As with most bull runs, price behavior is somewhat estranged from business fundamentals which become overshadowed by growth expectations. This is commonly known as a multiple expansion, with common metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio growing significantly. The trend in the multiple gives insight into investors' expectations of future growth. Stocks with higher growth expectations will trade at higher multiples. Traditionally, SMCI was a very low multiple company. They were plagued by reputational issues throughout the 2010s, with a  from Bloomberg causing years of underperformance. The dust has settled here and years of investigations have yielded no major incriminating evidence against SMCI products.Now with AI reshaping the modern world, attention on SMCI has exploded and the future looks promising. SMCI builds supercomputers and sells them to companies for far cheaper TCO than if those companies attempted to build their own supercomputer. Chip innovations typically feature either more computing power or energy efficiency improvements. SMCI touts some of the most energy-efficient server solutions on the market, which will be a huge tailwind in the era of drastic increases in computing power.This quarter, my sentiment remains bullish for SMCI. Despite a major beat in sales  2.18B vs  1.90B estimated  and EPS  3.51 vs  2.57 estimated , shares are getting pummeled and closed down almost 15  after hours following the earnings release. Gross margin has decreased a few ticks, from 17.6  last quarter to 17.0  now. The drawdown in the stock is being caused by lower future guidance than the market had hoped forThe story is still overwhelmingly positive though in my view. The company has a strong balance sheet, with growing assets and shrinking liabilitiesWith a strong balance sheet aided by improvements in average days in inventory  mentioned on the earnings call , which was down 50  days this quarter. In other words, cash is growing, debt shrinking, and inventory is turning over faster. Further, management mentioned multiple times on the earnings call that top-line growth was kept contained by a shortage of supply, not demand. While this is not ideal, it's better than the opposite.Despite the recent dramatic price drop, the industry-agnostic rush to incorporate generative AI into business operations will continue to provide a strong secular tailwind for SMCI. I don't see any major reason for concern and believe this price behavior is short-term. In that light, I added a few shares to my total position in after-hours trading, which now brings my average cost to just over  175 per share.Of course, investment is not without risk. An investment below the  100 range was a safe bet, but the valuation is much more extreme today. With under  1B in annual profit, paying  15B represents a P E of over 20. SMCI will need to continue rapidly growing amidst an increasingly competitive environment, which is a tall task regardless of tailwinds.Further, management exhaustively noted that there are component shortages. They are dependent on key  unnamed  vendors and are not being entirely transparent on specifics. Transparency is a huge benefit to companies, so the lack thereof could cause concern. It's most likely that the shortages are being caused by chip suppliers ramping up production of AI-optimized chips, which are still relatively new to market. There could be quality and yield issues, but these should resolve themselves over time as suppliers build manufacturing capacity and expertise.There's another risk that SMCI's servers become outright unnecessary in the market. Some companies with sufficient financial resources have built their own computers using proprietary chip design, cutting out suppliers like Nvidia for design and SMCI for plug-and-play supercomputers. A recent example is Tesla  and its supercomputer built on the Dojo architecture. This strategy reflects what Apple did with its M1 chip line, namely to internally design a chip and build a supercomputer on that chip. Dojo chips feature an architecture colloquially known as 'system-on-a-chip', meaning instead of a typical computer that connects separate physical components, the Dojo architecture has packed all necessary components onto a single chip. This significantly increases the efficiency of the system overall and will be used for Tesla to train its FSD  full-self driving  AI model.Few companies have the technical and financial wherewithal to complete such a feat, though. Herein lies SMCI's core market.Despite the risks, I do believe SMCI is a buy. Using a discounted cashflow model, I estimate SMCI to be worth around  245- 265, up from my previous estimate of  230- 250, based on a net income of about  640m. In that light, I believe SMCI is very slightly overvalued at the time of writing, with the stock trading in the  270- 280 range. I do believe the stock is still a Buy, motivating my Buy rating, because I use a very conservative terminal P E of 5 in my valuation. With the current multiple exceeding 20, I've built in a lot of room for multiple contraction. Further, I use far more conservative growth estimates  10  for 2023-2025, 7  for 2026-2028, and 5  for 2029-2032  than management is guiding, and use an aggressive discount rate of 15 , far above the current 10-year treasury yield.Considering the risks, I believe my model paints an accurate picture of SMCI's intrinsic value, and believe that buying at the current price is a wise decision for long-term investors. I do expect more volatility, however 5 years from now I expect this stock to be much more richly valued than it is now.The management team discussed a number of key points for the 2024 fiscal year on the call. With AI establishing its roots throughout the modern world, a key secular trend will be the increase in demand for high-powered computing. Fabless chip companies, many of whom SMCI has close working relationships with, are rapidly innovating chip designs to increase computing power. Alongside this, hardware companies like SMCI are grappling with the challenge of keeping servers and supercomputers from overheating.  is a somewhat nascent but promising product in this space, though the majority of sales are still attributable to air-cooled serversWhile innovation is a net benefit for data centers, it's increasing the complexity of the required infrastructure and is making it more burdensome for cloud-service providers.  allows SMCI customers to enjoy industry-leading time-to-market, energy efficiency, and total cost of ownership.Management expects sustained growth in the TAM  total addressable market  driven by AI adoption, as such they opened a new manufacturing facility today and have plans for another new facility in 2024. However, it was noted multiple times that supply constraints are keeping total sales contained. As with the demand for more computing power, there will be a continuously growing demand for data storage. Management noted they are not only focusing on building AI supercomputers but also high-capacity storage solutions.Rounding out SMCI's offerings and the smallest business line by revenue is 5G IoT Edge computing solutions. Although somewhat immaterial now at 2  of total revenue, this business line should grow well into the future. In summary, SMCIs three current major product offerings are for 1  Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning High-Performance Computing 2  Storage, and 3  5G Internet of Things Edge computing. All three of these markets show promise for long-term growth. CEO Charles Liang is very optimistic, stating on the earnings call that he expects  20B in annual sales  within a few years .Despite a 400  run-up in price and what some believe to be a bubble in AI stocks, I am still rating SMCI stock a Buy. I am fundamentally bullish on the company and believe it will continue to grow into the future.As Warren Buffett often says, it's better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

Navios Maritime Partners: Strong Quarter Results Amid Challenging Logistical Market,"I am invested in various value stocks and one on my radar is Monaco-based shipping company, Navios Maritime Partners L.P. . It has a decent dividend yield of 1.18  with an annual payout rate of  0.20. DespiteNavios Maritime expects net fleet growth in 2023 and 2024 despite geopolitical concerns that have disrupted supply and demand across the globe. The maritime giant is bolstering its fleet of tankers with two Japanese MR2 productNavios Maritime's gross fleet value as of Q2 2023 stood at  4.4 billion with a net fleet equity of  2.2 billion. The company boasts of a contracted revenue of  3.3 billion on its modern fleet with an average age of at least 9.8 years. Despite having a higher market cap of  1.41 billion Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.  total revenues for Q2 2023  61.8   YoY  to  1.31 billion as the company sought to overhaul its fleet profile and instead advance its ESG goals.On its part, Navios Maritime, increased its profitability in Q2 2023 boosted by capital gains from the sale of ships especially container ships and tanker ships that recorded stronger earnings. The company had spent  80 million as of Q4 2022 on the acquisition of two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels. The company was optimistic that it would attain  52.5 million as the aggregate EBITDA for the 2 MR2 vessels after five years with a 13  annual yield. Aside from that Navios is looking at an aggregate charter revenue of  84.5 million with a 20  residual value after the charter contract.The delivery of the two new builds is expected by the end of H1 2026 and H1 2027. Navios managed to negotiate a similar interest rate on both consignments meaning that they will each cost about  40.2 million each.Already, Navios has  270.1 million in cash as of Q2 2023 representing an increase of 26.6   QoQ . Each of the two MR2 vessels will be chartered out during the 5 years at a net rate of  22,959. This gain is significant since the company has at least 175 ships in water as well as under construction. The new acquisition will put Navios' total fleet at 177 ships comprising 81 bulk  ship  carriers, 47 containers, and 49 tankers. Under construction are about a dozen boxships, 6 MR2s, and 6 Aframax LR2s. I have known Navios to not shy away from making big purchases as long as there is a perceived value at stake. In Q2 2023, the company agreed to buy the 2019 Navios Horizon 1 for  28 million  built and chartered . I also expect the 81,692 dwt ship to be delivered by Q3 2023.Despite experiencing an almost 50   YoY  drop in the charter market in Q2 2023, Danaos Corporation  recorded  241 million in operating revenue and even secured about  500 million in new charter contracts in the quarter. By the end of the quarter, DAC's total charter backlog  to  2.5 backlog with the contracted charter coverage 99  for 2023 and 86  for 2024.For Navios, Q2 2023 contracted revenue stood at  46.8 million identified as long-term revenue from 3 contracted MR2 vessels. These vessels are responsible for an average daily net pay range of  21,831 for at least 2 years.As noted earlier, fleet proceeds  YTD  from the gross sale of 13 vessels in the quarter yielded about  242.2 million. In Q1 2023, Navios generated  160.3 million, in Q2 2023 it generated  59.6 million and in Q3 2023 it is expected to generate the remaining  22.3 million. From the total of  242.2 million, Navios intends to spend about  108.4 million in acquiring 2 new building MR2 vessels to be delivered by 2027 and an additional 3 new building capsize vessels for delivery within 2023.The newbuilding development by Navios has used up almost 95  of its available financing. In Q2 2023, the company arranged a total of  350.2 million in new financing which I think came in at an opportune moment since its total debt stands at  2.22 billion. In its Q2 2023 transcript, Navios explained that it organized its  first export credit agency backed facilities in China and South Korea.  Of the  350.2 million attained,  287.8 million is expected to refinance 36 vessels- which are already existing facilities with an average margin of 2.4  running for about 3 to 5 years. The remaining  62.4 million will be used to finance the two Japanese newbuilding MR2 vessels  at an implied interest rate of 7.0 0 for a 10-year term .In the containership section, Navios acquired 12 vessels for  860 million hedged on a long-term credit line, and expected to generate about  1.1 billion in contracted revenue in about 6.5 years. Then there is also the LR2  Aframax tanker subsector where the company ordered 6 vessels for  380 million. In the dry bulk newbuilding section, Navios is looking at 81 vessels with an average age of 10.4 years and a carrying capacity of 9.9 mdwt. The contracted revenue from the dry bulk fleet is the lowest at  308 million against  2.1 billion from container ships.Navios expects the global GDP to grow by 3  in both 2023 and 2024 bolstered by the rising demand for world oil. Reports  that in the first 7 months of 2023, crude oil imports into China grew 12.4  clocking 122.4 million tons. It is expected the Chinese economic growth in 2024 may be delayed if the Russian-Ukraine war persists. I am also looking at slower industrial production and the constant overhang of inventory as possible inhibitors of the recovery of the shipping industry.Analysts expect dry bulk cargo volume to rise 1.5  and 2.5  in 2023 and a range of 1  to 2  in 2024. Sanctions on Russian coal are also expected to motivate a 0.5  and 1.5  increase in average haul in 2023. This trend will also positively affect the shipment of iron ore and grain shipments in Brazil. With the abandonment of the Black Sea grain export deal by Russia due to the ongoing war, Navios expects to reap additional grain volume transportation from Brazil, Europe, and Russia. Overall, seaborne grain trade is expected to grow by 2.5  in 2023 alone.Navios' price-to-earnings ratio  TTM  stands at 1.14 against the industry average of 19.66. This mark leaves off a difference of -94.22 . The enterprise value against EBITDA  TTM  also stands at 4.11 against the industry average of 12.03  indicating a difference of -65.86 . It is not uncommon for high-value shipping stocks to have low PE ratios. GSL's PE ratio stands at 2.18 against the industry average of 19.66  a difference of -88.91 . I think NMM is slightly undervalued and has a strong upside potential, especially when the 2 new MR2 Japanese vessels come online.The persistent uncertainty over grain and fertilizer supplies from Ukraine due to the ongoing war may affect global shipping into 2024. Wheat futures have also been plummeting in 2023 lower than  5.8 per bushel. Global consumption of the commodity may also be revised lower with forecasts down 3.4 million tons to 796.1 million.Navios also indicated in its transcript that seaborne coal trade is expected to decrease by 2.7  in H2 2023 due to the shifting patterns caused by the Russian-Ukraine war.I also feel that the LR2 Aframax subsector tankers ordered by Navios for  380 million will not generate enough money to cover the expenses  not unless I am missing something from the statistics . The company ordered 6 vessels to be chartered out at an average net daily rate of  26,580 per day for 5 years. These vessels are expected to generate roughly  290 million, meaning that the company will incur a loss of about  90 million exclusive of any maintenance charges.Navios Maritime Partners has increased its profitability over time, bolstered by capital gains from ship sales and accretive acquisitions in the industry. Q2 2023 has seen the company register strong earnings, especially from container ships and tankers within its diversified fleet portfolio. I am looking forward to the delivery of its new build tanker fleet from Japan and the recovery of the global logistical economy as the key drivers to the company's growth into 2024. For these reasons, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

AGCO: Cultivating Success In Deere's Backyard,"It's time to talk about a company that makes me mildly nervous. That company is the Georgia-based . Its much larger peer, Deere   Company , is one of myWhile I stick to everything I've ever written in my Deere articles, it needs to be said that AGCO is turning into an increasingly strong competitor that deserves recognition.Over the past five years, AGCO stock has returned 140 . Deere has returned close to 200 . While I continue to believe that Deere is the way to go, itIn this article, we'll talk about the company's increasingly impressive growth strategy, agriculture fundamentals, and some of the company's comments during the most recent Morgan Stanley Annual Laguna Conference on September 12.So, let's get to itIn general, I would make the case that there's no reason why anyone absolutely needs to invest in agriculture.Personally, I am investing in agriculture for two reasons. The secondary reason is that it's my passion. I'm fascinated by agriculture and the importance of the agriculture supply chain.The primary reason does not come with a bias. Companies selling top-tier agriculture equipment  the ones with a wide moat  tend to be terrific tools for outperforming capital gains - especially during times of elevated inflation when farmers see rising farm income.Since the year 2000, both Deere and AGCO have outperformed the S P 500 by a wide margin, unfortunately with  expected  elevated volatility.Most people are familiar with Deere. I have heard countless country songs about the company. It's also by far the biggest tractor company in the world, with a market cap more than 10x larger than AGCO's  9 billion market cap.AGCO, although smaller, is still a significant player in the industry. The company is the owner of Fendt, Massey Ferguson, Valtra, and Challenger.Additionally, AGCO also owns smaller brands like Gleaner and companies such as GSI that specialize in building crop storage solutions, among other things.While these companies are large in their home markets  Massey is British, Fendt is German , the company is launching a full-scale attack on North and South American markets.With that said, like its peers, the company benefits from a number of tailwinds.During the recent annual Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference, the company highlighted the robust long-term fundamentals driven by global population growth, expanding middle class, and increasing demand for protein.The current stocks-to-use ratio in grains  ex-China  is at a multi-decade low, suggesting that we need multiple good crop years before supply and demand conditions normalize again.It also highlighted the impact of biofuels on grain demand and profitability in the farming sector.The war in Ukraine has influenced crop challenges and elevated grain prices, encouraging farmers to invest in modernizing their equipment.Moreover, the age of the average farmer fleet presents an opportunity for equipment upgrades, further fueled by advancing technology.The overall industry dynamics suggest a positive demand outlook leading into 2024.Despite a decline in key crop prices  like corn, soybeans, and wheat , demand remains strong, as visible in the company's order books.Furthermore, there are two other major tailwinds.On top of this, the company is focusing on precision equipment as part of its aggressive expansion strategy.The precision equipment segment includes equipment like planters, sprayers, and whatnot that are able to operate with extremely high precision. This lowers input costs  like fertilizers  and often boosts yields significantly.By 2025, the company aims to do  1 billion in precision sales. Using analyst estimates, precision sales could account for almost 7  of total sales.The company has also achieved substantial success by retrofitting precision technology into the aftermarket, distinguishing itself by being OEM-agnostic.AGCO's approach allows retrofitting on competitors' products, expanding its market reach. This is a genius strategy, as it somewhat applies a modular approach to agriculture.I also believe that this is a smart way of potentially grabbing market share.Speaking of market share, the company has a major focus on expanding the Fendt market share in North America and South America.The company targets achieving  1.5 billion in Fendt sales by 2025, aiming to outpace industry growth by 4  to 5  annually.AGCO believes that Fendt's premium technology and high fuel efficiency have positioned it as a leading product, capturing market share by appealing to growers seeking advanced technology and performance.The strategy involves offering a full line of Fendt products, including tractors, sprayers, combines, and planters, allowing dealers to provide comprehensive solutions to customers.As part of a potential pricing war, the company will not lower prices on premium Fendt products but use Messey Ferguson to target farmers looking for lower-priced products.It will also make its dealer network more efficient, which has been a reason why Deere has dominated the North American market.So, what about the dividendAGCO has a special dividend - literally.The company currently pays a  0.29 per share per quarter dividend. The yield is 0.97 .While this is low and nothing to get excited about, there's good news.On May 5, the company announced its highest special dividend ever of  5.00 per share. This brings the total annualized dividend to  6.16, which translates to a 5.1  yield. In other words, AGCO could be a high-yielding agriculture stock if it sticks to this policyFurthermore, the company's net leverage ratio is just 0.2x EBITDA. Next year, the company is expected to end up with more cash than gross debt.The company has a BBB- credit rating.So, what about the valuationThis is the tricky part. According to analysts, the company's growth streak is expected to end next year. I disagree with that, as I do not believe that the company is about to see two consecutive years of contraction - not unless we enter a steep recession with severely subdued crop prices. Or if rates remain so high that farmers are unable to buy new equipment. Rising rates are a major problem.Having said that, expectations are that free cash flow remains close to 10  of its market cap. This means that high special dividends are very likely unless the company engages in M A or decides to further enhance its already healthy balance sheet.With regard to the valuation, rising EBITDA and an unchanged stock price since early 2021 have caused the valuation to drop to just 6.3x EBITDA.Currently, a lower valuation makes sense, as investors aren't willing to buy machinery stocks when global growth is in decline.However, AGCO benefits from strong secular tailwinds, close to zero construction exposure, and a solid strategy to gain market share.Longer-term, I do not believe that AGCO should trade below 8x EBITDA.This would put the fair value at almost  190 per share, 60  above the current price.Please note that this is based on very conservative analyst estimates  I would argue that the company could see 10  to 20  higher EBITDA in 2025.Although I do not believe that AGCO will start this uptrend anytime soon, on a longer-term basis, the stock remains extremely undervalued.Knowing a bit about its top brands like Fendt, I have no doubt that the company is in a great spot to take away market share. I'm not sure that a lot of it will come from Deere, but in general, AGCO is an increasing force to be reckoned with.While Deere   Company remains my favorite dividend growth holding in the agriculture space, AGCO has emerged as a competitor deserving of recognition.Boasting top-tier tractor brands and advancing technologies, AGCO is ready to take away market share from its peers.Despite a dividend yield slightly below 1 , the company offers juicy total yield potential, especially during favorable economic times.With a strong growth strategy and a focus on precision equipment, AGCO is aggressively expanding its market share, aiming for  1 billion in precision sales and a significant foothold for Fendt in North and South America.The company's special dividend policy further enhances its appeal, presenting a potentially significantly undervalued high-yield investment.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Charting A Course In Choppier Waters,"At the start of 2023, consensus expectations were decisively negative and reflected a high likelihood of a recession. A string of positive economic surprises, along with excitement around artificial intelligence  AI , fueled strong equity market performance throughoutNow, market focus has started to shift towards concerns over policy rates remaining higher for longer. While avoiding a recession still appears achievable, alternative indicators suggest that economic surprises may become more two-sided and could pose challenges to equity investors in the months ahead. This also means that the ability to accurately forecast the direction of those surprises may be increasingly valuable for harnessing alpha opportunities as they surface. In this quarter's Systematic Equity Outlook, we explore theEasing inflationary pressures and resilient growth measures were among the string of positive developments that strengthened the case for a US soft-landing earlier this year. Despite acknowledging progress on inflation, the US Federal Reserve  Fed  continues to look for further evidence that policy is sufficiently restrictive to fully restore price stability. The Fed raised the bar for rate cuts and signaled they may keep rates higher for longer with the September Summary of Economic Projections  SEP , prompting a repricing of policy expectations.So can inflation continue to decline and provide the evidence needed to satisfy the Fed  To answer this question, we monitor a wide range of alternative datasets that provide a timely and granular view of inflation ahead of official reports. For example, we use data from online job postings to track wage inflation in real time. Figure 1 shows a reacceleration of wage growth that we started to observe near the end of August. Some official data releases like the September Jobs Report and JOLTS data have since shown signs of increased labor market strength, and we expect other lagged measures to reflect higher wage growth in the coming months.Year-over-year   wage inflationBeneath the surface of high-level wage increases, our job postings data also reveals an important shift in the distribution of wage inflation. Figure 2 shows that the largest wage gains are concentrated in higher-paying occupations while wage gains for lower-paying roles have been more muted. This suggests that declines in wage inflation highlighted in many aggregate measures may be masking a more nuanced story of ongoing tightness in the labor market. Our data shows that along with potentially reaccelerating in aggregate, the wage inflation picture is becoming increasingly complex with growing divergence across occupation types.Year-over-year   change by occupation categoryIt's important to note that the reacceleration of inflationary pressures appears to be confined to wages, as alternative data measures across several other price components are showing continued progress on disinflation. But given wages have been a key driver of stubborn services inflation  especially the so-called  super-core  core services ex-shelter inflation now running back above 5 , the Fed may feel added pressure to keep rates higher for longer.The strong job market is just one characteristic of the post-pandemic economy that's contributed to resilient economic growth  and inflation  throughout the Fed's hiking cycle. The unprecedented level of pandemic stimulus is another factor that's bolstered household savings and supported strong consumer spending. Among a wide range of stimulus initiatives, student loan payments were paused from nearly the start of COVID-19 through September 2023.Now, the resumption of student loan repayments could have the opposite effect on consumer activity. To gauge the magnitude of potential impact, we leverage US state-level student loan and income data. Figure 3 illustrates the aggregate student loan burden for each state, suggesting that the resumption of repayments will likely have the largest impact on household balance sheets in lower-income states.Aggregate spending headwind vs. post-tax income by stateThe resumption of student loan payments also has the potential to drive increased labor participation as households face higher debt obligations. The aggregate participation rate of higher-educated cohorts remains below pre-COVID levels, suggesting that there's room for more normalization to occur.If this is the case, the unemployment rate may increase due to rising labor participation, as we saw in August. While higher unemployment is typically perceived as a negative for the economy, it may be viewed positively if it's driven by an uptick in labor supply rather than broad-based layoffs. This is because it could relieve wage pressures by further restoring balance between labor supply and demand without requiring widespread job losses and economic pain. As shown in Figure 4, corporate layoff mentions across earnings calls and news articles have continued to moderate in recent months. The absence of severe layoffs is one of several indicators suggesting that economic growth in the US remains stable enough to avoid a recession in the near term.Unique mentions of layoffs in US large-cap conference calls and Dow Jones news articlesIn recent months, yield curve steepening has largely dominated equity returns, putting downward pressure on valuations given higher discount rates. Looking ahead, it's possible that equity beta could face some additional headwinds even if a recession is avoided. This is because as the yield curve normalizes  un-inverts , further  would take place. Given that equity market pricing still reflects a largely optimistic growth outlook, the effect of higher discount rates could once again dominate broad equity performance in the absence of a significantly positive growth shock.At the same time, the alpha opportunity set for equity investors has become increasingly compelling. Macroeconomic and market uncertainty is contributing to increased security dispersion, or divergence in returns across individual stocks. Active managers with the ability to rapidly uncover security selection insights and recalibrate portfolios may be well-positioned to harness alpha opportunities amid heightened volatility. This environment particularly enhances the opportunity set for managers who can invest both , as they can exploit performance differences across stocks and target returns in the cross-section of markets with reduced dependence on overall market direction.The AI theme is one area where we see cross-sectional opportunities emerging. In the first half of the year, AI could be thought of as a rising tide that lifted most boats, particularly in the mega-cap tech universe. Now, the surge in long-term rates has dampened the initial broad AI rally, making individual company characteristics a more relevant return driver. Some of the early AI leaders have differentiated themselves by starting to monetize the opportunity and delivering strong earnings results. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we've seen a reversal in the performance of certain companies that initially benefitted from the rising ride but haven't shown evidence of sustained leadership potential.It's worth noting that within BlackRock Systematic, we leverage  to help inform these security selection insights. One example of this is our use of transformer-based models to analyze unstructured text at scale, which provides a higher level of precision and accuracy than more traditional methods of analysis.For example, we can analyze corporate earnings call transcripts from previous quarters throughout history to determine which companies were genuinely focused on AI long before the recent wave of hype. From a broader industry perspective, Figure 5 illustrates the acceleration of AI-related job postings across the economy. We can use the text from these online job postings to understand how companies across industries are integrating AI into their business models, and the potential enhancements to productivity and efficiency that may follow.Cumulative count of job postings over timeAfter a string of positive surprises in the first half of 2023, our outlook is becoming slightly more balanced as we look ahead. Wage pressures and consumer spending headwinds may be emerging, and equity markets could face periods of pressure from further curve steepening even if a soft-landing is achieved. Despite these risks, increased security dispersion is enhancing the opportunity set for active managers to generate alpha amid choppier waters. 2023 BlackRock, Inc.

Maersk Doesn't Need A Soft Landing To Be A Great Investment,"A.P. Møller   Mærsk A S,  or more commonly known as just Maersk, is one of the largest container shipping companies in the world and has its hand in nearly 1 6 of global trade withOne thing that catches my attention every now and then is , and his adoption of bulk shipping companies from time to time.No, Michael Burry did not buy Maersk, but this past quarter, he did start small positions in several shipping companies - Safe Bulkers , Euronav , Costamare  and Star Bulk Carriers . This basket of shipping companies reminds me a lot of his old trade in Golden Ocean  from a couple of years ago, which was highly successful. After I decided to start a recent position in Maersk, I noticed the 13-F filings were starting to come out, so I took a look at Burry's recent changes to his portfolio. I noticed he was also buying shipping companies during the quarter, which was a welcome surprise, but also most likely just a random coincidence of market timing.Burry's trading style is a bit hard to follow because usually his holdings turn over every quarter or two, and he trades at a fast pace which can be hard to draw any conclusions from. Earlier this year, he bought a bunch of US bank stocks and was out of them by the very next quarter. Michael Burry is not a Warren Buffett,  buy-and-hold  forever type of investor, but what can value investors learn from his portfolio  What can be useful to investors from watching Burry's portfolio over time is learning  and seeing when he enters into a trade and what  he chooses to focus on, and come back to time and time again. Could it be the right time to buy into the shipping cycle now  Or is Burry simply making a macro bet on a soft landing with a basket of shipping companiesJust recently, on September 18th, 2023, J Zim Integrated Shipping  citing margin declines as temporary, with a rebound being likely as COVID-era charters get re-chartered or redelivered at cheaper rates. If an economic soft landing is perhaps in the cards after all, shipping stocks such as Maersk are sure not trading like it.Whatever the case may be, I see Maersk as somewhat the opposite of what Michael Burry would typically buy in the industry. The market capitalization and sheer size of the company is not like him at all  Burry typically trades small caps or even borderline micro-cap shipping companies with a short time horizon, but I intend to do the opposite. My goal is to not trade the stock in the short term, but hold Maersk for much longer, reinvesting the dividends along the way.I like Maersk simply because it is a massive company in its industry with a competitive advantage, trading at a large discount to book value, with potential for outsized returns from stock buybacks over time. It is unusual to find a company with such a huge market presence that trades at nearly half of book value  even if this is the shipping industry we are talking about here . The potential returns from just buybacks in future years are significant, but combined with dividend reinvestment over time, I think the stock could be a worthy compounder.In this article, I will outline the basic thesis for investing in Maersk stock, and explain why buying at nearly half of book value makes sense given the buyback strategy.Maersk trades at roughly 0.5x book value and also at historically low levels when isolating for this variable, even slightly below the COVID crash levels of March 2020.Most of the  seem very low, but the recent P E ratio of the stock is somewhat misleading, due to cyclical reasons and the recent years of earnings being abnormally good for the company. I would not go from just the recent earnings of the prior two years, but use other variables to determine if the stock really is as cheap as it currently appears to be.A P E multiple for 2023 is estimated to be around 7x, which seems more in-line with a fair valuation, but earnings could be better than expected next year, even if a soft landing for the economy is not in the cards. The most recent earnings call shed light on this, as management stated that while  on the industry, earnings guidance would be better than expected for the full year. Sort of contradictory statements, but better earnings for the full year would translate to possibly better dividends than expected as well. Recent declining financial results since 2022 and a big crash earlier this year have both pushed the stock from near record highs back to test a support level  near  8.00 for the ADR, which trades as AMKBY . I like the stock here around this price, as the discount to book value should not be viewed as a weakness, but rather as a support level and buying opportunity for those with a longer-term mindset.For me, Maersk seems like a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on the economy and collect dividends along the way. When I look at companies like this, I always try to screen for low valuations, a competitive advantage, nice margin of safety, and if possible, potential for reinvestment of dividends each year. Shipping companies can be tricky because they are cyclical, with highly variable earnings and dividends which are usually not consistent. This makes valuing the company difficult based off of EPS alone.Maersk paid a  in March, which will likely not stay high again next year. Even with a big drop in the dividend yield being priced-in, the recent action in the stock does not worry me. I would rather see management prioritize stock buybacks over dividends anyway at this time, as the discount to book means that more value likely can be created from these buybacks over the next few years, rather than paid out as dividends to shareholders.The future dividend yield is somewhat uncertain, but nevertheless, it helps in terms of offsetting the downside that may be apparent in the next 6 months. Could the stock get even cheaper and trade for under 0.5x book given a hard landing for the economy  Yes, I believe that anything is possible, but this could be a necessary outcome to create future value from buybacks at rock bottom prices before the cycle inevitably turns positive once more.Making macro bets directly via complicated strategies and hedging is not my style as an investor. However, investing in Maersk seems like a good way to have some protection against the downside while making a largely macro bet on the economy.The thing that stood out to me right away in my research into the company was how surprisingly good the balance sheet was. Maersk does not have too much debt, and the company has tons of cash which can be used to buy back stock at discounted prices to book value.This alone will create value for shareholders over time in my opinion, but there is some risk that management may prioritize dividends over buybacks in the next couple years, make acquisitions, or change the capital allocation strategy in some other way which could hinder performance.Shown above is the company's balance sheet from the . Maersk has over  10 billion in cash and around  14 billion in total non-current liabilities. Compare the debt with the total equity, at  56 billion, and the debt-to-equity ratio is close to 0.25.Comparing the cash position to the market cap, at around  29 billion, and it becomes clear just how much buyback potential there is over the next several years. Buybacks have already been aggressive, and management seems committed to this strategy as the stock price has declined in recent months.When considering certain stocks like Maersk as an investment, one should ask themselves, how am I going to get to my desired return  For some stocks, it is clear that growth in some capacity is going to be a main factor, while in other stocks, a lot of the return comes from dividends. What if the company is not growing at all  Are multiples expanding or contracting  In many cases, returns will come from four things - dividends, multiple expansion, earnings growth, and stock buybacks. Reversion to the mean is always something that must be considered, especially with cyclical companies like Maersk. Timing the cycles can be difficult, and so a longer-term approach is necessary to produce favorable results. Trading these stocks in the short term is possible, but it is risky and does not always guarantee that dividends will contribute to the return.One possible place the return could come from would be simply from a reversion to the mean in terms of book value. In my opinion, it is somewhat more likely that Maersk could become loved by the market once more in the next cycle and trade closer to 1x book value, rather than the stock getting punished even further to trade in a range near 0.25x book value from 0.5x book value. A risk is that given a bad enough recession, today's prices could be too high compared to future earnings potential.Another place the return could come from would be the combination of two factors - one being dividends reinvested over each year of the holding period, and management's commitment to stock repurchases going even higher over the next several years. The results of the buyback program are already exceptional, as the number of shares outstanding  from 21 million as of 2019 to almost 17 million as of this year. Aggressive buybacks are one thing, but buying back stock at major discounts to book value is an overlooked mechanism that could supercharge future returns. Dividends will likely not be very large next year, but reinvesting the dividends at opportune moments in future years will be important to the longer-term strategy of holding the stock through various parts of the cycle.The last place the return could come from could be the most overlooked of them all - actual unexpected economic growth in future years and Maersk being re-rated with a higher multiple compared to similar players in the industry. The company has an excellent balance sheet, so it would not be a shock to see the stock trade at a premium to book value at some point in the future when the cycle inevitably reverts.Shipping companies are widely known for their cyclicality. In good times, the earnings and dividends will be astronomical, but in bad times, shipping rates decline and the company struggles to make any profits at all. Similar to the semiconductor cycle, the market goes through ups and downs as conditions with pricing change. One year, a certain company in a cyclical industry has high margins and earns record profits  the next year, the margins are terrible and the company barely makes any money at all. This can be a problem for many shipping companies that use excessive leverage to build their fleets, as the downturns can be worse than expected, causing financial difficulty and instability. In my opinion, Maersk does not use excessive leverage, but this is still a risk which should be considered before making an investment in the company.It is also important for investors to realize that Maersk's earnings potential and dividends in a given year are closely tied to shipping rates, which are highly volatile. In terms of recent years, the post-pandemic environment caused demand to skyrocket, and many bulk shipping companies looked dirt cheap compared to what they were trading for in the middle of 2020. Now that this post-pandemic rush has subsided, for the most part, supply and demand are beginning to look more balanced. Investing in shipping companies is notoriously tricky, as timing the cycles becomes more important than other aspects of the business itself, and being on the right side of the cycle is easier said than done.A.P. Møller   Mærsk A S, or simply just Maersk, is a relatively safe way to make a macro bet on global trade, with a further advantage given due to a margin of safety with shares trading at nearly half of book value. This relative safety stems from managing downside risk with high dividends and the potential for future returns stemming from sizeable stock buybacks over time. The company has an excellent balance sheet, and a commanding market position with a market share of around 17 , giving a competitive advantage in the shipping industry. The valuation is extremely favorable, with a low P E multiple and shares at nearly 0.5x book value, which makes management's buyback strategy even more enticing for longer-term investors. A soft landing for the economy would be an amazing outcome, but this is not entirely necessary for Maersk stock to produce favorable returns in future years. I currently view shares of Maersk as a Buy at this time, and will be watching the stock closely for continued buying opportunities in the  8.00- 9.00 range for the ADR.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

STAG Industrial: Cost Of Capital Exceeds The Cap Rate - Shares Untimely,"One of the salient features of REITs is that profits and prices often move in cycles. And there are two cycles worth considering. First, there is the space market cycle which describes the supply and demand for a type ofSTAG enjoys a BBB rating from Fitch and a Baa3 from Moody s. Both credit agencies have stable outlooks for STAG. Please take a look at Table 1 which compares the total return that can be earned from an equity interest in STAG and the 5-year median yield on the Corporate Baa BBB.Finance is based on several fundamental precepts, one of which is a balance of risk and return. When you can earn 94 basis points more in an instrument that has less risk, it may be time to reevaluate the investment thesis for a stock.In economic theory, when a business can deploy assets and earn a return that exceeds the cost to acquire the assets then value is created. In the case of a REIT, value is created when the capitalization rate, or cap rate, exceeds the cost of capital. The cap rate is the net operating income obtained from the assets and the cost of capital is the cost to use capital to purchase the assets for which income is generated. This is especially important for a REIT because they are not able to retain earnings and have to rely on capital markets to fund their growth. In general, REITs tap debt and equity markets to fund acquisitions for growth and to refinance debt as they come due.Let us now evaluate how much value is created by looking at the difference between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG. Please take a look at Table 2The cap rate presented is the midpoint of the guided stabilized cap rate in STAG s Q2 2023 Earnings Supplement. For STAG to create value, their cost of capital must be less than this figure.In order to calculate the cost of capital, we have to calculate the cost of debt, the cost of equity and weigh each cost to the extent they are used in the business. Let us review the capital structure to see how much debt versus equity is being employed by STAG. Please take a look at Table 3.STAG does not currently have any preferred shares outstanding.Now that we have the relative weights, we now look at each source of capital and estimate the cost. Please take a look at Table 4 for the cost of equity.There are different methods and philosophies around calculating the cost of equity. We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model  CAPM  in which we essentially add a spread to the risk-free rate and scale the spread by the volatility of the particular stock.The beta statistic measures the volatility with respect to the market. The beta is 0.92 which implies that STAG s stock is less sensitive than the market. Conceptually, this is justified because REITs as an asset class generally have revenue streams that are contractual and more stable than non-REITs. I use the 10-year treasury as my risk-free rate and apply a spread, or an equity risk premium of 4.38 . The equity risk premium I used is from . The cost of equity arrived at using this approach is 8.26 . STAG would have to offer an 8.26  return to entice equity investors to purchase shares by this estimate.Now that we have a cost of equity, let us now estimate the cost of debt. Please take look at Table 5 in which we provide the issuer rating for STAG as before and the 10-year Corporate  Baa BBB  median yield.The implication of the cost of debt is that should STAG wish to refinance debt at about the 10-year tenor, it would be facing a cost of debt of 5.70 . This does not mean that their interest expense is going to be exactly 5.70  of their long-term debt because some fixed-rate debt could have originated at a different time when interest rates were lower. Because of this, the actual cost of debt may be somewhat less. In general, businesses will be slow to refinance debt in an inflationary environment to take advantage of previous interest rate regimes and will be quick to refinance debt in a declining interest rate environment to take advantage of lower available interest rates. STAG also employs swaps to manage their interest rate exposure. Nevertheless, for our purposes, 5.70  is the most accurate reflection of the current market conditions and so we will use this as our input.Now that we have a cost of debt, the cost of equity and the weights of each in the capital structure, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital. Please take a look at Table 6.The tax shield normally included in the calculation of the weighted cost of capital is ignored because REITs generally do not pay taxes at the corporate level.Taking into account the current macroeconomic environment, STAG would have to generate a cap rate of more than 7.57  to create economic profit. In Table 7 we quantify the amount of the deficit between cap rate and the weighted average cost of capital for STAG.The calculation indicates that STAG does not create value as measured by this framework. Let us explore further why this may the case. We have looked at the spread between the cap rate and the cost of capital for STAG. Let us take a broader perspective and look at the spread between the Industrial REIT cap rate and the 10-year treasury from 2010-2019. Please take a look at Table 8.In Table 9 we look at the spread as of the second quarter of this year.The 63-basis point spread as of the second quarter is beyond two standard deviations from the mean spread from 2010 to 2019. These figures suggest that cap rates have yet to meaningfully adjust upwards. In the recent earnings call, STAG s leadership The commentary suggests that sellers still have in their recent memory high asset prices that were reflective of a low interest environment. There seems to be some hesitancy on their part to accept the new market environment. When sellers reduce the price, that will potentially increase cap rates in deals moving forward.For cap rates to increase, either the net operating income has to increase or the asset values have to come down. One way for net operating income to increase is when leases come up for renewal, they are re-leased at a higher contractual base rent which is reflective of the current market conditions. For the second quarter, renewals showed a cash rent change of 28.3  which was higher than the year-to-second quarter rent change of 23.5 , suggesting an accelerating trend. The comparable statistics for 2022 were 13.7  and 11.2  respectively.Another way for cap rates to increase is if asset prices come down. Asset prices coming down may seem like a positive development for an acquirer such as STAG, but it could also put a dampening effect on STAG s stock price as their current portfolio will potentially be valued less.Finally, operating performance would be impacted. About 17.4  of their debt principal balance has a maturity date on or before June 2025 which implies meaningful refinance activity in the near term. Additionally, interest expense for the first six months of 2023 was 29.3  higher than the comparable period in 2022. Debt was only 12.88  higher during the period by my estimate. If more of the pie is going to fixed income holders, there is less available for equity investors.Let us look into the operating performance in more detail.Please take a look at Table 10 in which we compare the per share metrics for the first six months of this year with the first six months of 2018.Looking at the metrics, it appears that even with the current inflationary environment, STAG s performance is better than it was in the first six months of 2018. This is the sort of five-year performance you would expect from a REIT in a stable interest rate environment. In 2018, the 10-year treasury was hovering around 2.90  and it is at 4.24  today. Let us look at this in more detail.The metrics presented in Table 10 are per share metrics for the first six months of the respective year. Let us look at the share count  growth from 2018 to 2023. To maintain consistency, the share count is as of the second quarter of each year not year-end. Please take a look at Table 11.Share count growth showed an increasing trend from 2018-2020 and then dropped to about a third of the pace in 2021 and then showed an increase in 2022 and then slowed to a crawl in 2023. My first impression from overall cadence of share issuance is that management is adroit in issuing shares and units when the environment is favorable.The second impression is that the miniscule growth in share issuance in the first half of 2023 is not sustainable. REITs are not able to retain earnings to a meaningful extent so they have to issue shares regularly to fund growth. The slow share count growth in the first six months of 2023 is probably a reflection of the unfavorable market conditions that exist in acquiring assets. When a healthy spread exists between the cap rate and the cost of capital, that would be an opportune time to issue shares and fund growth. There is another dimension to this which may be of potential concern to investors.Because the per share data for the first six months of 2023 as presented in Table 10 does not reflect the historic pace of share issuance as we have seen from Table 11, investors should contemplate on how accurate the performance comparison between the two time periods really is. Had share issuance continued at its average pace in the first six months of this year, the period comparison would probably favor the 2018 performance. Additionally, while management strategy of holding back on share issuance until a balance between cap rate and cost of capital is sensible, it may portend an accelerated pace of share issuance with its dilutive effect.When the fixed income instrument of an issuer can offer a return that exceeds the dividend yield  growth rate, the investment thesis of the stock has to be revisited. In revisiting the worthiness of the investment, we have raised some questions as to the timeliness of an investment in STAG s stockFirstly, there is an imbalance between the cap rate and the cost of capital. Investors should consider waiting until a positive spread is restored and value creation is demonstrated by figures. Secondly, if and when cap rates adjust upwards, there could be downward pressure of real estate asset prices. STAG s current portfolio would be potentially valued less which may negate some of benefit of the cap rate improvement. Thirdly, the per share performance in the first half of 2023 is not reflective of performance under the normal pace of share issuance. When share issuance resumes at its historic pace, operating metrics may compare unfavorably to past periods which may dampen stock prices. Lastly, as debt matures and requires refinancing, increased interest expense will make it less likely that future dividends can grow at an attractive clip.Prudent investors should consider foregoing an investment in STAG at the current time.

BRF: Uncertainty Persists Despite Commodity Cycle Advantage,"Although I see the current momentum with a more positive slant in the face of more optimistic poultryThe slower revenue growth can be attributed to a decline in average sales prices that gained momentum in July. However, ABPA anticipates this trend to reverse. Competing exporters like the United States, Turkey, Ukraine, and Chile face challenges in expanding production. In contrast, China, which recently increased its domestic supply, has reduced breeding stock between late 2022 and early 2023 and has already shown signs of slowing down in the coming months.This combination of factors is advantageous for Brazil, which leads the world in meat shipments with a 35  market share. Additionally, decreasing corn and soybean prices provides further incentives for increased production. ABPA projects a potential growth of up to 3  in Brazil's production in 2023, ranging between 14.8 million and 15 million tons.The growth prospects depend on Brazil continuing to report no cases of avian influenza in commercial farms, likely leading to import barriers from China and possibly other regions. It's worth noting that even if a disease outbreak occurs in commercial farms, embargoes tend to be regional, as has been the case with the United States, which is currently dealing with avian influenza in its production chain.In the second quarter, there was an oversupply of chicken meat in the global market, negatively impacting BRF, Brazil's largest chicken exporter. Additionally, the weakening of the dollar against the Brazilian real led to a 75  decrease in EBITDA from the company's international operations compared to the same period in the previous year, with the figure at R 241 million.However, BRF's management is optimistic about the upcoming quarters, anticipating a trend toward supply and demand rebalancing, even though the company has not released any specific guidance.BRF is poised to witness improved operations and a debt reduction. The deceleration in inflation, declining unemployment rates, and rising income in Brazil bolstered the year-end sales prospects for BRF.Furthermore, he mentioned that the full impact of the drop in grain prices on the index is yet to be realized, signaling the potential for improved profit margins in the upcoming months.Moreover, the company's ongoing restructuring efforts have exhibited a positive outlook for the near future. BRF's operational improvement plan has been highlighted, contributing R 540 million in efficiencies. This underscores that the management is on the right path to provide a more optimistic profitability outlook. Generating higher-than-expected cash flow has been a critical factor in the company's financial position.BRF's net debt EBITDA stands at 7.1x, marking its highest level in the past three years. Despite the company having more debt than equity, it continues to generate positive cash flow. This implies that BRF is producing more cash from its operations than it is expending, which is a positive indicator of its cash generation capability, at least for a certain period.According to Marfrig's statement, this increase in stake is not intended to alter the current composition of BRF's control or management structure. Still, it is solely aimed at expanding its ownership in the company. Additionally, Marfrig clarified that it has not entered into any agreements related to voting rights or agreements governing the purchase or sale of BRF shares.Nevertheless, this increased stake is part of Marfrig's broader strategy to enhance its control over BRF, an initiative that commenced in 2021.This increase in ownership is expected to take Marfrig's stake in BRF to around 50  and that of Salic to 25   currently, the fund holds a 10.7  stake , with minority shareholders retaining 25 .However, the timeline for Marfrig to gain complete control over BRF remains uncertain. On the one hand, the seven-year limitation on Salic's ownership of a maximum of 25  of BRF indicates a potentially more extended timeframe. Additionally, Marfrig has been grappling with reduced margins in the US beef market, which could persist for another year, limiting its cash flow.Recent developments suggest that a merger between Marfrig and BRF may be a less likely scenario. Salic has made investments in BRF, not Marfrig, and it's unclear if they intend to expand their presence in the beef segment further, especially considering their existing stakes in Minerva. This raises doubts about the feasibility of a merger. Nevertheless, the potential for synergies could be seen as an argument favoring such a move.If Marfrig's acquisition of 50  of BRF materializes, it could positively impact BRF's share price due to increased buying pressure. However, for Marfrig, there might be investor concerns about financial leverage.Since Marfrig began increasing its position in BRF in early September, BRF's shares have exhibited a strong positive response, helping to recover from their underperformance throughout the year partially. In contrast, Marfrig shares have moved in the opposite direction.Despite its substantial and challenging debt position, BRF continues to generate cash and is poised to benefit in the coming quarters as the commodities cycle improves, further facilitating the company's ongoing deleveraging efforts.Due to the complexity of estimating an implied share price for a food processing company that involves high capital expenditures, experiences seasonal cash flow patterns, relies on the commodity price cycle, and also maintains a significantly higher level of debt compared to its equity, I believe that analyzing BRF in comparison to its peers provides a relative assessment of its value.As we can observe, BRF has a higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio than its Brazilian peers, such as JBS, which is its primary competitor to Sadia and Perdigão through its Seara brand. It also competes with Minerva, which, despite its primary focus on beef, offers a competitive line of processed products in the domestic market. Additionally, BRF maintains a lower current ratio than its peers, indicating a reduced ability to meet its short-term obligations with its current assets.Given the nature of the meat production and processing industry, I believe the P CF  Price Cash Flow  metric is suitable for making peer comparisons.When we examine valuation multiples, we find that BRF is currently trading at a P CF ratio of 4.35x, representing a premium compared to JBS and Minerva. Considering that BRF carries a higher level of leverage and greater liquidity risk, it is unclear why the stock trades at a premium rather than a discount.The fact that corn prices are currently at their lowest levels in the last three years and soybean prices in the previous two years should support an improvement in BRF's operational margins, particularly in the second half of this year. Additionally, the company appears to be on track with its deleveraging efforts.These favorable conditions could make it an opportune time to consider investing in BRF shares. However, it's worth noting that the company's shares have seemingly already reflected this trend, and their recent boost following the news of Marfrig's increased stake in the company has led to a valuation that I view as a hindrance to investing in BRF.Therefore, I would only consider adopting a bullish stance on BRF if the company traded at a discount in its P CF multiple relative to its peers.Alternatively, I may favor considering other companies in the same sector facing similar challenges but offering a more attractive valuation.

On Growing Federal Debt And Potential For Nuclear War,"Famed money manager Paul Tudor Jones  on CNBC on Tuesday. The well-known billionaire investor, who first made his bones predicting and profiting from theI agree with Mr. Jones that investors should be much more concerned about the exploding national debt than they appear to be at the moment. In addition, his take on the new conflict and its potential to escalate sharply just adds to the myriad major geopolitical events investors have to keep a wary eye on right now. We discuss both topics below.Mr. Jones stated This concern is one I share and is no stranger to my Seeking Alpha followers, as I have highlighted this topic many times over the past few months. Our nation's debt situation gets way too little focus from our media as well in my opinion.The situation seems to be getting worse and not better on this front recently. The federal government deficit for FY2023 that ended on September 30th, is now  to come in at around  1.7 trillion. And this when the country is seeing two percent GDP growth so far in 2023In addition, the national debt has risen some  2 trillion just in the four months since the last debt ceiling raise  The federal governmental debt  some  500 billion just from September 15th to October 5th, it should also be noted.The cost to service the burgeoning national debt will continue to increase at current yields in the quarters and years ahead. All one has to do is basic math. The current blended interest rate on the just over  33 trillion in national debt is just over 2.9 . The current yield on the Ten-Year Treasury is currently around 4.6 . Some 30  of the national debt will roll over and need to be refinanced over the 12 months and just over half will need to do the same over the next three years.As I stated in my recent article, ,  this is simply untenable on a longer-term basis. I believe the Federal Reserve's only option is to continue to increase rates until the economy goes into recession. This will bring interest rates down significantly as inflation finally gets squelched and will lower the costs to service the national debt. This is also something Mr. Jones pointed out during his interview on CNBCIn addition, even though the Fed Funds rate has been taken up by over 500bps since March of 2022, inflation is still not near to the central bank's official two percent target. We saw more evidence of this Wednesday morning when the September PPI  came in much hotter than expected. Thursday morning, the September CPI reading will post before the opening bell as well.The other disconcerting thing the well-known fund manager said was heI put the chances of this new conflict escalating to this point at extremely low, but not out of the realm of possibilities. Israel possesses tactical nukes and if Iran is drawn into an expanding conflict, that country has the capabilities to build  and the to deliver those payloads.We also have a proxy war still going on in Ukraine with Russia, the country with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, that has now gone on for more than for a year and a half. The biggest land war in Europe since WWII has already resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. While the conflict seems to have devolved into a bloody stalemate, there is no telling how events on the ground will go in the coming months and quarters.Then, there is always the  of China invading Taiwan, a concern that has been lingering for more than a year now. In short, there are more potential major geopolitical events than usual within the current environment for investors to worry about.This is on top of concerns about a deteriorating American , a potential commercial real  in 2024, the continuing struggle against  as well as the Leading Economic Indicators declining for 17 straight months now. Something that hasn't occur since 2007 02008, right before the Great Financial Crisis.Despite all these risks, investors are being paid very little premium to hold stocks right now at current trading levels compared to  instruments. This is why 50  of my portfolio is in short-term Treasuries yielding 5.5  currently. I also have approximately three percent of my portfolio in long dated, out of the money  against the . These instruments will pay off massively should the S P have a 20  decline from peak to trough over the next 9-12 months. I view this as cheap  portfolio insurance  against the remaining long positions I hold.This type of decline would be extremely likely should the country go into a recession which I have forecast for 2024, of if any of geopolitical events outlined in the paragraphs above come to fruition.Live Chat on  has been dominated by discussion of lucrative buy-write or covered call opportunities on selected biotech stocks over the past several months.

Where it is not seasonally adjusted, and there are seasonal issues, waiting for the YoY change to change sign will lag the turning point. Thus I make use of a convention  data is scored neutral if it is less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12-month extreme.With long leading indicators, which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole, there is an additional rule  data is automatically negative if, during an expansion, it has not made a new peak in the past year, with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high.For all series where a graph is available, I have provided a link to where the relevant graph can be found.September data included slightly higher than expected consumer and producer inflation. On a YoY basis, only shelter, transportation services, and restaurant prices are still higher by more than 4 .

Importantly, purchase mortgage applications which had bounced around in a fairly narrow range of between 155 and 180 since last October, in the past month have sunk to repeated new lows, several weeks ago at a 28 year lowReal estate loans turned ever more positive during 2022. This was helped by inflation in house prices. This indicator declined by 1 3rd from its peak YoY  change in August, and so became the last real estate indicator to decline from positive to neutral. If it falls below 6.0  YoY, it will be a negative.The Federal Reserve has discontinued this weekly series. Data is now only released monthly. August data was released two weeks agoNo recession has happened without a YoY real M1 negative, or YoY real M2 below  2.5 . Real M2 fell below that threshold in March 2022.

The Chicago Fed's Adjusted Index's real break-even point is roughly -0.25. In the leverage index, a negative number is good, a positive poor. The historical breakeven point has been -0.5 for the unadjusted Index. The leverage index had improved from negative to neutral, but has now retreated back to negative. The adjusted index has improved beyond its breakeven point, so has returned from neutral to positive. The unadjusted index has also moved close enough to its breakeven point to turn neutral.The Miller Score is designed to look 52 weeks ahead for whether or not a recession is possible. Any score over 500 means no recession. This number fell below that threshold at the beginning of August 2021, so not only is it negative, but we are now well into the  recession eligible  time period.The St. Louis Financial Stress index is one where a negative score is a positive for the economy, and during its limited existence, has risen above zero before a recession by less than one year. It did so in December, and then again briefly in March, but almost immediately decreased back below zero again and stayed there.The BCIp, which remained very positive until very recently, deteriorated sharply earlier this year, and is below its recession-signaling threshold, although it has improved in the past several months, and indeed is now above its recession warning signal level, and IM has rescinded its recession warning.Ever since 2021, both measures of the US  were well above  5  higher YoY, and so negative. Recently, both declined into the neutral range, and in the past several months, both turned positive.Bloomberg Commodity IndexGraph at .Bloomberg Industrial metals ETF  from   graph at linkDuring the Boom of 2021, commodity prices soared, and total commodities were very positive. While industrial commodities remain in the bottom 1 3rd of its 12 month range, the broader index is in the middle 1 3rd of that range, so the former remains negative while the latter is neutral.  Note, importantly, that because this particular decline in commodity prices may reflect increased supply rather than destruction of demand, the message of a nearly -10  YoY decline may have been very different from usual. S P 500  from graph at linkStocks made several new 3 month highs and even a new 12  month high earlier this year, including at the end of July. But as of one week ago, they also made a new 3 month low. Thus this indicator changed from positive to neutral. If there is no new 3 month high by the end of October, it will turn negative.The regional average is more volatile than the ISM manufacturing index, but usually correctly forecasts its month-over-month direction. Since last spring, these gradually declined to neutral and then negative. They remain negative now, although they have become  less negative  recently.Initial jobless claimsGraph at .In spring, revisions caused major changes in this index. The 4 week average has been higher YoY for 4  months, but not at levels which have in the past triggered a  recession warning.  Although the absolute numbers are very low, they remain in the 5 -10  higher YoY range, and so remain at a negative rating.Temporary staffing index  from the   graph at link .This was extremely positive at the end of 2021.

In the past four months it improved somewhat.Tax Withholding  from the Department of the Treasury  YoY comparisons peaked in Q1 2022. Since summer, it has oscillated between neutral and positive, and was negative on a monthly basis several times. Since the first of the year, these have generally turned positive. That was not the case for the month of April, but in May it turned back positive, and on a 20 day basis it has been near its best level in 12 months for the last several months.  from the Graphs at Despite recent increases, gas and oil prices both remain  slightly  in the middle  of their 3 year range, and so are neutral.Mileage driven has remained positive in the past few months, but it close enough to unchanged this week to warrant a change to neutral.Note  given this measure s extreme volatility in the past 30 months, I believe the best measure is against their 3 year average. Measuring by 1 year, both have turned negative.TED was above 0.50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions. Since early 2019 the TED spread had remained positive, except the worst of the coronavirus downturn, until last spring. It has been very choppy recently, varying between neutral and negative. It turned positive again in May. As of two months ago, it appears to have been discontinued, although I am searching for another source.LIBOR has been increasing consistently well into its negative range.After a very positive 2021, this measure declined to less than half its best YoY level, thus changing to neutral. It remained in that range all this year until two weeks ago, when it broke above 2.0, changing its rating to positive. Then it declined back into the neutral zone. I have been measuring its 7 day average to avoid daily whipsaws.Open Table s data indicate that by early April reservations had stabilized at slightly below zero YoY, and they have generally faded from -2  to -7  since.The Redbook index remained positive almost without exception since the beginning of 2021 until last October. The new link I have added above goes to a 5 year graph to best show the comparison. After 3 weeks of negative readings, the 4 week average has returned to positive for the past 8 weeks. Its highest was 4.2 . This week it was  3.7 Graph at .Shipping transportRail carloads turned positive early in 2021, before gradually fading to negative from August through the end of the year and the beginning of this year. The total loads index has been consistently negative for the past five months. In the past several months, comparisons have hovered near the zero line, varying between neutral and negative. This week they were positive again.Harpex increased to near record highs again early in 2022, but has since backed off all the way to new lows. BDI traced a similar trajectory, before rebounding sharply earlier this year, but remains negative.I am wary of reading too much into price indexes like this, since they are heavily influenced by supply  as in, a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade  as well as demand.   Since the end of March 2021, against terrible comparisons, this metric had been positive, typically running at a double digits higher YoY percentage growth. In spring 2022, it turned negative, but the YoY comparisons gradually improved. It finally improved to positive for about two months, before turning negative again for a short time. It remains positive this week.Thanks to a commenter for bringing this indicator to my attention. This is a daily update to inflation, similar to the  billion prices project  of the last decade  which required a subscription . I have not added this to my list below of the status of coincident or leading indicators, but needless to say it is an up-to-the-moment reading on this very important indicator.Below are this week s spreadsheets of the long leading, short leading, and coincident readings. Check marks indicate the present reading. If there has been a change this week, the prior reading is marked with an XThis model does use the yield curve, but also recognizes that higher bond yields regardless of the shape of the curve are a negative for the economy in the future. Thus the long leading indicators remain very negative with interest rates near multi-decade highs.The short leading indicators remain neutral, but have stopped improving. Their recent improvement has now translated to the coincident indicators, which continue to improve almost every week and are now solidly positive.My main focus remains on the short leading indicators. Last week, I concluded with the statement that  unless commodity prices fall to new lows, I am looking to see if more of the short leading indicators begin to roll over.  And, with the horrific developments in the Middle East in the past week, commodity prices ex-oil did indeed hit new lows. Ex-geopolitical events, I expect short leading indicators to soften further. But we will have to see if the crisis remains locally contained or spreads to the wider Middle Eastern region.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Energy Transfer: Strong Income Generator Amid Uncertain Times,"I last wrote on Energy Transfer  a bit more than three months ago  see the chart below . The  argued for a buyFast-forward to now, the stock has indeed delivered strong returns against an overall market decline. To wit, the stock has enjoyed aDespite the price rally, I see the stock as an even stronger buy at this point, and consequently, this article will upgrade my rating to Strong Buy. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on two of my key considerations for my upgraded rating. First, I will argue that a few new catalysts have happened since then, and they can provide ET with a better growth potential. Second, because of such a better growth potential, the stock valuation has actually become even more discounted from the Graham P E.Oil prices have recovered strongly since my last article. As seen from the chart below, Brent futures were in the  75 range at that time. It has since then reached a peak of almost  100 and currently hovers around  87. Now, I see a couple of catalysts to keep oil prices  or energy commodity prices in general  elevated and provide a tailwind for ET in the near future.The most important catalyst in my view, sadly, is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. In general, geopolitical risks tend to increase demand for oil and commodities for several reasons. Geopolitical conflicts tend to disrupt supply, transportation, and global trading. At the same time, both the general public and investors may seek to store more commodities as a hedge against the ongoing geopolitical conflicts.Specific to the Israel-Hamas conflict, I see more immediate impacts on oil and energy prices. The conflict could have nonlinear ramifications on other countries in the Middle Eastern region, many of which are important oil production export countries. Iran is the first specific example that came to my mind. Iran is a significant oil production country and also a known supporter of Hamas. As such, it's a possible scenario, in my view, we could see a tightening of restrictions on Iranian oil exports.Admittedly, these catalysts are relevant to the general energy sector and won't only serve as a tailwind for ET. However, I will argue that thanks to a few differentiating factors, ET is better positioned to navigate the ramifications of such geopolitical events than the sector average. The top differentiators are its scale and integrated operations. ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. Its assets are highly integrated, which allows it to achieve significant operational efficiencies. For example, its pipeline network connects production areas to processing facilities and storage terminals, which allows the company to move products quickly and efficiently to market.This unique strength has provided ET with the resilience to deliver strong results amid market turmoil. The following chart shows its recent dividend payouts as a reflection of such resilience. As seen, the dividend amount has recovered very quickly since the COVID-19 pandemic. It increased rapidly from  0.175 per share in the first quarter of 2022 to  0.31 per share at this point. This represents an increase of approximately 77 , and its current payout already is higher than its pre-pandemic level of  0.305 per share.The stock is currently yielding 9.06  on an FWD basis. Such a high yield, when combined with its resilience and discounted valuation  argued next , makes it a strong income generator in uncertain times like this.For the valuation of a  traditional  business like ET, I will follow the Graham approach as detailed in his book  Intelligent Investor . In particular, I will start with the so-called Graham P E. As detailed in my earlier articleIn ET's case, consensus estimates project an EPS growth rate of  1  CAGR at the time of my original article. The above projection was too pessimistic in my view. But even with a 1  growth rate, its Graham P E would be 10.5x. At that time, the stock was trading around a P E of 9.06x, about 14  below the Graham P E. Now, due to the recovery of commodities prices and the other catalysts mentioned above,  have upped the growth projection in the next few years to 3.0  as seen in the chart below.With this new growth rate, the discount has become larger despite the price rallies since as shown in my next table. As seen, its market P E is about 10.22x currently, about 29  lower than the Graham P E. There are a few other risks both in the upward and downward directions that are worth mentioning. In the upward direction, ET's assets are primarily located in the United States, which makes ET less exposed to the risks associated with geopolitical conflicts in other parts of the world than the sector average. Furthermore, its revenue model is primarily fee based. It charges a fee for transporting, storing, and processing energy products for its customers. As such, its revenue model is less exposed to geopolitical events should they take an unexpected turn.In the downside direction, the  shows a smaller discount, as you can see from my analyses table above. The Graham P E only takes into consideration the EPS, while the Graham number considers both the earnings and the book value. As such, the fact that the Graham number shows a smaller discount implies that the market is giving its assets a more favorable price than its earnings. But still, the Graham number also shows a sizable valuation discount of 16 .To conclude, despite the price rally since my last writing, I view ET as an even stronger buy under current conditions. The main factors involved in this upgrading are twofold. First, I see new catalysts that can support a better growth potential  and so do consensus estimates . Second, because of the better growth potential, I see its valuation as more discounted now compared to the time of my last writing.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

My View Of Wall Street: A Disturbing Macro Scene,"It is no secret that many of theSpeaking of a challenge, the Fed has been left with a near-impossible task. They are trying to come up with a solution that measures the right amount of restraint needed to bring inflation back was once believed to be a  temporary  issue beginning in 2021, but the inflation rate defied those forecasts and climbed until reaching a peak in March 2022. The Fed says it is determined to get it back to the 2.0  mark but it does not  - some four years after inflation began to move higher. We've already seen the effects. Higher prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services - gasoline, food, shelter, cars, hotel room rates, and restaurants.These price increases aren't going away anytime soon. It would be foolish to believe we won't see this issue having an impact well into next year, and perhaps well beyond that. The Fed's goal is 2 , but getting inflation back down to the 2.0  mark is not good enough.  to counter some of the cumulative buildup from the long-lasting run-up in inflation. The Fed will surely stay on course  higher for longer  but they are once again  stuck . I doubt the Fed can loosen the reins even after inflation hits its target as they will have to wait until this run-up in inflation is reversed.Inflation spares no one. It erodes the consumer's purchasing power. Unfortunately, the ones hurt the most are those at the lower end of the income scale and those relying on a fixed income. They cannot easily avoid rising food and energy prices and higher rent which consume a very large portion of their take-home pay. The warnings were there. Excessive, and as it turned out all of the added unnecessary spending to  right  an economy that was already  right , may remain a problem that can haunt the MACRO scene for a while.I do not agree with some market pundits' assessments that the economy is less interest rate-sensitive than it has been in the past. Their claim is relatively speaking interest rates are not high when compared to history. They have a point but that argument stops there. We've seen how equities  reacted to any movement in the 10-year treasury note. It's been the speed of these increases that kills their argument. If that isn't enough, after years of zero interest rates, the market will t, but this adjustment period will take time. There is also another unknown that not many are talking about. We have a large contingent of money managers and investors who have never been invested in a stock market where interest rates are moving higher. How they are reacting and how they will act when rates don't come down tomorrow is yet to be determined.So, as a result, I think it is premature to predict a soft, non-recessionary landing, and all systems go for a rousing BULL market. With multiple headwinds building on the horizon, a recession is more likely. How  mild  it is remains unanswered. However, if the Fed loses its patience or overstays its welcome  some believe they already have , the downturn could be more protracted than some of the forecasters expect. I'll note that the  forecasters  referred to in the last statement have dwindled to a scant few.What drives the U.S. economy is Consumer spending, which makes up nearly 70  of the GDP. With the strong labor market, good wage improvements, and all the pandemic stimulus they could ever want, consumers have danced their way through the Fed's aggressive rate hikes and higher borrowing costs. However, there are a few reasons why we can expect things to change. For starters, the labor market is softening. Second, excess savings from the pandemic are swindling so consumers no longer have a cushion to support their spending. Third, with student loan payments set to resume on October 1  likely to subtract 0.4  from consumer spending in '24  and gas prices rising as oil prices move higher  from  68 bbl to  90 bbl , consumers should have less discretionary income to spend going forward. There is a positive, they do have a job, and as long as that remains the case, it will continue to be a tug-of-war. One that will resolve the recession no recession argument.We have seen some weakness creep in and spill over into slightly weaker travel demand. Perhaps we have seen a near-term peak in travel after what has been a robust travel season. And with the headwinds building, a recent Gartner survey flagged that the upcoming holiday shopping season could be weaker than previous years, with only 9  of consumers expected to spend more this season.While economic growth, in aggregate, has not materially slowed, the Fed's 525 basis points of rate hikes are impacting the economy. With mortgage, auto, and credit card rates at multi-year highs, demand for loans from households has fallen dramatically. Banks are not only less willing to lend  the cost of borrowing has become prohibitive. For example, the  With mortgage rates now well above 7.0  and house prices still elevated due to inventory shortages, affordability is becoming a serious dilemma.While housing appeared to be stabilizing over the last few months, the recent plunge in housing starts  to a three-year low , drop in home builder sentiment  to a five-month low , and sharp decline in prospective buyer traffic  to its lowest level since February  point to further weakness ahead. And with buyers more likely to postpone their home purchases and existing homeowners frozen in their homes, the multiplier effect from housing-related spending is likely to dry up.Mortgage, auto, and credit card rates have gone up dramatically since the Fed kicked off its tightening campaign nearly two years ago. As a result, affordability is becoming a major issue.At some point, all of this is going to matter and it will result in a slowing economy.Much of the improvement in the equity market this year has come through an expansion in the price-earnings multiple. The good news reflected in the multiple expansions ran its course during the first few months of the year. That along with more investors joining the soft landing army has kept stocks from following through on last year's BEAR market.Analyst are still optimistic, as their earnings outlook for 2024 remains strong. Consensus is at  248 and Goldman Sachs comes in at  237. That of course is assuming a  outlook. My view is that a more challenging macro environment over the next few quarters suggests that earnings are more likely to tread water in 2024.As a result, companies are likely to have difficulty maintaining their top-line sales growth and delivering improving margins in a recessionary environment. The good news  earnings are not likely to fall precipitously from here, and they will need to move higher from here for equities to deliver the next big uptrend in the market. Once again, investors are left with a glass half-empty, glass half-full situation to try and figure out.Bottom line  It is a difficult market backdrop to navigate. Good news to start the Monday session. The equity market wasn't influenced by the interest rate scene because the bond market was closed for Columbus Day. The Bad news is the terrorist attack over the weekend in Israel that has sparked a war and dampened global sentiment. The S P turned a morning loss into a gain for the day closing at 4335 up 0.63 .Treasury rates dipped and the U S dollar retreated and the rally continued, The S P 500 and NASDAQ ran their winning streaks to three while the Small caps as measured by the Russell 2000  made it five straight days of gains.It was more of a choppy session on Wednesday but the resiliency of the market came through as another late-day rally pushed the S P and NASDAQ to five straight winning days. Both of those streaks were broken as overhead resistance tuned back the S P 500 to a minor loss for the day on Thursday. All of the indices closed in the red and only two sectors  and XLK  showed modest gains on the day.The selling continued keeping the major indices in retreat. In a BULL BEAR tug of war, the S P managed to squeak out its second week in a row with a gain. The DJIA was also fractionally higher this week. No so for the NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 as they both lost ground. For the Russell that made it two weeks in a row and five out of the last six with a loss.

That's much weaker than expected,  However, the direction is not surprising given the various headwinds of inflation and the dysfunction in Washington. Much of the weakness was in the expectations component which dropped to 60.7 from 66.0 previously. The current conditions index slumped to 66.7 from 71.4. The 1-year inflation index surged to a 3.8  rate, the highest since the 4.2  clip from May.The latest minutes from the September 19th -20th policy meeting at the Fed showed unanimity across all members that rates should  stay restrictive for some time . The fact that rates are now in restrictive territory means that the Fed can  proceed carefully  given the general agreement that risks to goals are  more two-sided . Consistent with recent commentary from among others Chicago Fed President Goolsbee,  several  members attempted to shift the debate over rate policy from  how high  to  how long .None of this is a surprise to anyone who carefully watches FOMC's public statements. As a point of fact, there was no notable new information in the minutes that had not already been highlighted by the Fed for months on end. Only those who still believe in the Easter Bunny were surprised and caught off guard.The spike in Middle East tensions following attacks on Israel may help resolve domestic U.S. uncertainty related to the ongoing House Speaker battle and clarify the path forward for new defense funding. This  and general market concerns over DC dysfunction if the events over the weekend materially raise pressure on the House to return to regular order. We've already seen a bounce in  defense sector  stocks which have been sold off hard since September 1.The market will be watching to see whether a consensus Speaker candidate emerges within the GOP and if clarity around the appropriate level of aid for Ukraine becomes more of a focal point, although the path forward on both issues remains highly uncertain. A tightening of oil export sanctions by the U.S. on Iran can also impact the global supply balance, While the U.S. markets will tend to overlook these events  we saw that with Ukraine , this conflict does have a genuine  if relatively low probability  possibility of large spillover. This terrorist attack is the equivalent of our  9-11  where civilians were targeted. A severe Israeli response can't be ruled out. That would include expanding this conflict to Iran, the poster child for state-sponsored terrorism where  were made known in September. Rest assured, Israel will continue to question Iran's involvement the risk premium reflected by stocks, bonds, the dollar, and most of all oil will quickly retreat as is usually the case in periods of geopolitical instability. That should be an investor's baseline view.For others who may be worried about the situation spiraling into something greater  a possibility if Israel decides Iran funded the attack , from a market perspective, you can perhaps look to something like VIX, Gold, Oil, or products related to these. That could provide some protection in the case of a more severe move,I shy away from going overboard with reacting to news and  what if  scenarios because when it comes to investing, they never go away.A breakthrough in the House Speaker's race this week as Jim Jordan  R-OH  offered a nomination speech for Steve Scalise  RLA  in a floor vote. Scalise got 113 of 221 House Republican votes. 217 are necessary to be elected Speaker. While Jordan's willingness to back Scalise is progress, we could be headed for the same kind of iterated floor vote drama that took 15 rounds to elect Kevin McCarthy  R-CA  last January  it will all depend on fringe members like Matt Gaetz  R-FL .That breakthrough turned into a breakdown. Initially, there were roughly a dozen  and counting  House Republicans who were adamantly opposed to electing Steve Scalise  R-LA  Speaker. With only a four-vote margin in the House, that means little prospect for a resolution to the Speaker's race in the foreseeable future.So, Republican Speaker of the House candidate Steve Scalise  R-LA  withdrew his name from consideration. Following a series of meetings Scalise reached the conclusion that the GOP caucus would never reach the near-unanimity required to elect him  or anyone else  Speaker. The alternative candidate is Jim Jordan  R-OH  who only lost the internal caucus vote on Speaker candidacy to Scalise by one vote. But his aggressive conservative leanings  among other issues  could make him a tough pill for moderates to swallow.Of course, if Democrats could be pulled into the voting process almost any GOP candidate would have the votes to win. But the opposition is almost certain to require a very, very high price for that kind of support, and it's not clear anyone in the GOP caucus would be willing to go down that road.One possibility that is being discussed is that Acting Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry  R-NC  simply continues in the role indefinitely, moving legislation that is critically important without ever being formally elected Speaker. This would certainly solve some problems, though it's not clear how McHenry would be empowered to deal with issues like keeping the government open when the temporary extension expires in November.The geopolitical backdrop for energy can contribute to higher oil prices over the medium term with tools available to control prices and keep them higher.Factors for price support around the current range  or higher  includeHowever, expectations are that OPEC Saudi Arabia would put supply back on the market if concerns around demand destruction were to escalate. Here is the WILD CARD. China's sustained oil import demand - it is the world's largest importer - in the face of slowing economic activity will be a factor to watch over the coming months. There is a wide range of scenarios for why China would continue to sustain high import levels, including a desire to take advantage of lower market prices vis-à-vis building up of reserves  China has never been a member of the International Energy Agency and thus needs to have its stockpiling effort . Another, more concerning, possibility is that China is building stocks in anticipation of geopolitical disruption to supply. They are the largest buyer of Iranian oil. It has been noted that China purchased significant quantities of LNG in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Finally, further use of strategic stockpiles is another option for the U.S., especially heading into the 2024 election cycle. However, at some point, that option runs out and we are very close to that being a reality. It may be symbolic but like the first SPR drawdown, it will prove meaningless.After the terrorist attack last weekend we now have another geopolitical event that bolsters the energy trade. I'm puzzled when I hear that sanctions haven't been relaxed when it comes to Iran, an .Janet Yellen - yesterdayThe chart of  in 2023. They stand at an astounding 5-year high, and China is the principal buyer.  Despite sanctions, the People's Republic of China has purchased roughly  47 billion in Iranian oil since this administration took over. Regardless of who is buying  a story for another day  the fact that this oil is hitting the open market.So if the sanctions haven't been relaxed  we'll never get a straight answer   That isn't my opinion - the facts indicate that to be true. Despite the deep discounts Iran has placed on their oil exports it is safe to assume they are reveling in this windfall. Without oil, Iran has no money. Without money, terrorism loses its biggest benefactor.The reason I bring this up is twofold. One has to wonder why a state sponsor of terror that has supported a known terrorist organization like HAMAS since 1990 and is a  is still participating in the global economy. Quite frankly it makes no difference if they were directly involved in  barbarism or not - as an identified state sponsor of terrorism , they should be isolated and cut off from global trade. The Facts support that and  many  global leaders are once again burning their heads in the sand and denying what is right in front of them.I'll now offer an opinion. History suggests only a naive child would believe Iran all of a sudden decided to stop supporting the terrorists. While everyone is looking for evidence that they  involved, there is NO evidence that they . If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck - the probability that it is a duck is VERY HIGH. Be that as it may, the next set of circumstances could very well change the dynamics in the oil market.Secondly, if Israel or a coalition of nations comes together and takes Iran off the world economic map with ,  and or destroys their oil output facilities  then all Iranian oil comes off the market. China will go scrambling to fill that void. None of this is political, it's a fight against terrorists. Similar to when the US decided to destroy ISIS.It's simply another reason to remain with the energy trade, as  pressure  from geopolitical events will likely remain high for quite some time.The S P followed through on the prior week's gains and then hit a resistance level that for the time being has turned the index back.If we are going to see a Q4 rally the index has to hold at or near these levels. If this week's failure proves to be another resistance level that can't be overcome, the S P is in danger of posting another LOWER high from the  TOP  that I noted on July 31.At best a questionable technical scene for the S P 500.Even though perfection is not necessary for a bottom to form or to make money off of it, the stock market continues to play out in a mostly typical bottoming fashion. Post-Labor Day through  Performance is now more likely to be influenced by 3Q earnings season. I am seeing plenty of caution in earnings outlooks ahead of this earnings season and going into this week the bar seems to be set quite low. That increases the probability that we could see more upside surprises.The market by its price action after the terrorist event in Israel, today tells us this new geopolitical situation will be similar to what we saw with Ukraine and  won't be that impactful on stocks. The market will get back to inflation. On both the PPI and CPI front, it sure is another  Higher for Longer   scene, and that keeps the Fed's  higher for longer  rate outlook intact. The market will now have to swallow that as the handwriting that has been on the wall for months has to be reckoned with.Friday marked the unofficial kickoff to earnings season with the major banks and financial companies reporting, and so far, the results have been promising. Between the reports of BlackRock , Citigroup , JPMorgan , PNC, and Wells Fargo , they've all topped EPS forecasts, and only BLK reported weaker-than-expected sales. A lot can change between then and now, but the immediate first impression is positive.For every near-term positive, I can conjure up a near-term negative. This backdrop isn't for amateurs.Despite all of the near-term woes, money managers and analysts are hopeful their wish comes true  A year-end rally. When I reviewed the status of the  BULL  market recently I found an interesting picture. One that suggests it is a bifurcated market scene loaded with uncertainty.While the S P 500 and Nasdaq are still holding onto their uptrends, the DJIA dipped under its longer-term trendline recently for a few days. The Russell 2000 has broken its uptrend and it's been more than just a few days, as this index has screamed a slowing US economy for over a year now. As mentioned earlier the small caps are 30  below their all-time highs. In an unsettled and questionable stock market, it's not uncommon for trendlines to break over a short period just to shake out some of the weak hands, but unless those levels are quickly reclaimed, it often signals a shifting trend in the market. I saw a few more pieces of the puzzle hit the board last week, but there is still a long way before this Q4 picture is complete. I do expect to see the stronger groups remain in demand as it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as money managers  want  to have these stocks overweighted in their portfolios. For a  to materialize, sectors like the semiconductors will have to step back up and become leaders again. If we are to see any continuation of a rebound off the lows we will need interest rates and the USD to slow down their parabolic rallies. That is easier said than done.Nothing has changed - selectivity is the name of this game. On Monday I released a list of ten stocks that should be accumulated for a late-year rally. The opening quote has been Rule Number One for any strategy that I put forth.

"Long QQQ, New Highs Look Imminent (Technical Analysis)","On the first weekday  9 October  after news of Israel-Palestine conflict surfaced over the weekend, equity markets opened lower, only to close the session green.Negative geopolitical headlines tend to be very emotional as they bring upThe most sustainable rally is when the market does not believe in it, but prices defy logic to trudge higher anyways. We could be in this situation now. On top of this, we are in October, a month where equities tend to put in a near-term bottom before finishing the year strongly.I bought the Nasdaq 100  on 9 October when it recouped its opening losses to turn green on the day, and continue to look for opportunities to add.Looking back at major geopolitical events that have taken place since the 1940s, we can see that on average, the S P 500  tends to be higher 6-12 months after the event.There are also some events that theoretically should induce a lot of selling, such as the bombing of the World Trade Center, BREXIT and the North Korea missile crisis. But the equity markets did the opposite instead.Bearish sentiment can get more bearish, and a falling market can continue to fall. However, I like to look at how the majority of investors are positioned, to get a sense of the directional move that will go against their positioning.Below, I am looking at the CBOE Options Total Put Call Ratio, and I used a 10 week MA to smooth out the volatility. The put call ratio is now near the territory that coincides with peak fear during Covid times and the bear market bottom in October 2022.The market is now just above the  extreme fear  category, based on CNN's Fear and Greed indicator.The percentage of stocks within the S P 500 that are trading above their 50 day moving averages stands at 23 , close to the readings seen during the depths of Covid as well as the bear market bottom in October 2022.Looking at the S P 500 index seasonality for the past 20 years, the SPY is at a time where probability is in its favour in terms of putting in a near term bottom. Q4 is a very strong period for equities.The Nasdaq 100  bounced off its multi-month uptrend line, putting in a very strong session on Friday, 6 October. If the Israel-Palestine conflict had not surfaced over the weekend, the price action would have been very constructive. Not only did QQQ respect the uptrend support, but it also defended the August swing lows.Even after taking into consideration the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, price action continues to show strength. It was a big positive that QQQ managed to shrug off opening losses on Monday, 9 October, to close green for the session. To me, it is a sign of strength.QQQ is now trading above almost all of its key moving averages on the daily chart, with the 50 day the last one standing. If that gets taken out as well, then there is not much overhead resistance stopping it from making new highs.Where the chart turns sour would be if price takes out the low of Friday, 6 October. That was a  1.7  day on robust volume. To lose that low would be a big red flag for the chart.Delving into the charts of the major stocks that make up the QQQ, they paint a picture of strength.NVIDIA  continues to drift higher after its bullish earnings in May. It is trading above its key moving averages, which have now converged, denoting pent-up energy for the next big move.Tesla  is consolidating nicely after breaking out from a mini base, with the key pivot at  254. It is trading within a large triangle pattern, and it looks to be gathering strength to breakout higher. Stock is trading above its key moving averages on the daily chart.Meta Platforms  saw a clean breakout from a multi-week base, and is close to making new 52-week highs. Any stock that manages to make new 52-week highs in this environment is a leading stock, and will likely go on to outperform the market.Alphabet  is almost at new 52-week highs, surging higher after breaking out of consolidation. It is on a very clean and resilient uptrend, making a series of higher highs and higher lows. Stock is trading above its key moving averages on the daily chart.Overall, it is difficult to see the QQQ selling off sharply unless the above aforementioned mega-cap stocks take a turn for the worse. Currently, their technical charts are resilient and they look poised to make new 52-week highs.Even if we delve into an expanded technology sector, using the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF  as a proxy, we may observe that the technical chart looks very strong. IGV is now trading above its key moving averages on the daily chart, and also bounced off its multi-month uptrend support.Mega-cap technology stocks have less weight in the IGV ETF. Technology stocks such as Adobe , Salesforce  and Palo Alto Networks  have higher weight in IGV as compared to QQQ.Personally, I like QQQ for its liquidity. Institutions may prefer larger-cap liquid names during uncertain times, which may give QQQ a slight edge over IGV as the former is dominated by mega-cap, ultra-liquid names.Focusing on the larger picture, I am of the belief that both QQQ and IGV  technology stocks in general  will go higher from here. Geopolitical tensions provide a good smokescreen for them to climb higher, as the majority is likely to discredit and not believe in the rally, until it is too late.

ChargePoint: Buy The Dip Before This EV Charging Stock Could Rebound,"ChargePoint  was once considered the most elite EV charging play due to the massive increase in EV demand throughout North America and Europe.However, I must admit that it's been a rough couple of years for CHPT shareholders sinceEV sales are expected to make up  but that's nearly 7 years time away from the current fiscal year. ChargePoint's massive hype has quickly faded and insiders have been dumping CHPT shares at an extremely high rate.On top of this, short sellers are betting against ChargePoint despite the company's positive environmental impact. ChargePoint's short interest is over 26  and could increase even higherIt's sad to see Wall Street put short-term profits over positive long-term environmental benefits.However, I cannot help but see the bright side in this tough situation and spot a massive buying opportunity for this EV charging station SPAC if you maintain a long-term outlook.During periods of high-interest rates, investors show no mercy when it comes to small-cap stocks that lose money. ChargePoint was once considered the  axe and pick  investment for the ongoing EV revolution but the entire market sentiment has quickly changed.In Q2 2023, ChargePoint finished the quarter with  150 million in revenue  Up 39  YoY  and lost  125.3 million  Up 35  YoY  or 53 cents per share despite increased demand for electric vehicles.Since ChargePoint isn't profitable, the company  such as Antara Capital to bolster ChargePoint's balance sheet.In a , ChargePoint sold 41,371,158 at a price of  4.23 per share.ChargePoint CFO Rex Jackson stated that the company has enough funds to last well into 2025 and doesn't need any additional capital raises.This is an extremely bullish indicator in my opinion, which is why I'm finally buying CHPT shares again after a long hiatus.While many ChargePoint bears think the company may go bankrupt, I find it fascinating that management believes the company will break even in Q4 2024.In order to validate these claims, I researched ChargePoint's latest insider trades and noticed that ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano owns several call options priced at  0.27 with an expiration date of 11 04 2024.This expiration date occurs during the same period that ChargePoint believes it will break even and turn its first positive EBITDA quarter.If that turns then ChargePoint could benefit from a short squeeze as short sellers buy back CHPT shares to return their borrowed shares. This doesn't look likely until at least 4 quarters or more so be patient.Another bullish sign is that Pasquale Romano still owns 1,990,345 CHPT shares worth  7 million as of Q3 2023.He also purchased call options expiring in November 2024 and July 2028 at 27 cents and 54 cents, respectively.Despite his heavy selling this year, ChargePoint's CEO holds a rather large stake in the company and hasn't sold any shares since August 18th, 2023.I've remained bullish on CHPT shares despite all of the negativity surrounding the company. I don't like seeing management dump so many shares as of late but it appears much of the insider selling is finished.CHPT stock looks extremely oversold on the Weekly RSI chart so I decided to start buying the stock again during this period of peak fear. CHPT's weekly RSI is 25 but any number below 30 is considered  oversold .I may consider some call options expiring in January 2025 as a lottery ticket play.The EV revolution may come sooner than we anticipate and I truly believe ChargePoint will benefit from the massive shift from ICE vehicles to  smart cars .ChargePoint trades at a slightly higher P S ratio than its competitors Blink Charging and EVgo but I still like the company's massive charging footprint over its smaller competitors.It takes guts to buy stocks when nobody else wants them. Perhaps taking a risk with CHPT could pay off handsomely in the long run if you believe EVs are a critical part of the global economy's future.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"The Budget Deficit: Increasing At A Challenging Pace, And The Impact On TLT","Last week, the U.S. Treasury announced the federal government closed its fiscal year in September 2023 with a  1.7 trillion deficit. The Treasury Secretary, , attempted to put a positive spin on the problematic news, saying, Deficits produce stress. When spending exceeds revenues and savings, individuals and companies are bankrupt. Meanwhile, governments have another option  Print more fiat currency. However, there comes a time when the financial chickens come home to roost. An economic house of cards can have severe consequences as deficits and debt grow.At more than  33.6 trillion, the U.S. national debt is stratospheric. The U.S. government has spent more money than it took in each year since . The U.S. has borrowed money to compensate for the difference, lifting the national debt. Meanwhile, since the 2020 pandemic, the debt has grown by nearly 90 .The reasons why the U.S. national debt is on a one-way path higher areWhile the pandemic and increased military spending have caused the deficit and debt to rise, few proposals exist to control expenditures and clean the U.S. s economic house. Political parties agree on virtually nothing, making a rising deficit and debt a certainty.The U.S. dollar is the world s leading reserve currency and U.S. debt and equity markets have been the most liquid and stable over the past decades. However, a rising deficit and debt threaten the stock market. Moreover, other asset classes could become highly unstable in U.S. dollar terms. The dollar is the benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodity markets. The dollar is a fiat currency, deriving its value from the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Uncontrollable debt erodes confidence and leaves the U.S. open to further credit downgrades.Over the past few years, the U.S. Central Bank has been an influential buyer of U.S. government debt securities. Quantitative tightening ended the buying. China, the world s second-leading economy, became a leading buyer of long-term U.S. government bonds around two decades ago. Chinese economic weakness and tensions between Beijing and Washington have caused China to sell government debt securities.  has sold around  300 billion in U.S. bonds since early 2021. Without the Fed and China, bonds have been weak since the 2020 high. Other governments, like Japan, have also had less appetite for U.S. debt securities.The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures chart highlights the decline to 107-04 on Oct. 23, the lowest level since 2007. The trend in bonds is lower, with interest rates climbing at a furious pace. Individuals are suffering from the trajectory of rate increases. A 30-year conventional mortgage under 3  in late 2021 is now over 8 . The monthly payment on a  400,000 loan is now more than  1,660 higher, excluding many prospective home buyers from the market. While higher rates often cause home prices to move commensurately lower, existing home sales have ground to a halt as sellers with mortgages at far lower rates have no incentive to sell. Therefore, the stock of available homes has declined, keeping prices high. Consumer loan rates have increased, making car and other large purchases more challenging. Inflation at the highest level in decades has raised prices on all goods and services, putting additional pressure on consumer s pocketbooks.While U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen lauds the U.S. economy s ,  inflation has stabilized and remains elevated. The Fed has told markets to expect rates to stay .  While the trajectory of Fed Fund Rate hikes will slow or even pause, the bond market is doing the Fed s job of crushing economic growth to quell inflationary pressures. However, the inflation caused by geopolitical events is above the central bank s pay grade. The hawkish Fed that may stand on the sidelines while the bond market falls to an over decade and a half low, deficits and rising national debt are signs that the U.S. economy could be heading for a very challenging period. The lack of political agreement to address rising debt levels and the continuation of spending have catastrophic consequences.While bonds and inflation are warning signs of an impending crisis, history has taught that a significant bond recovery tends to accompany crisis periods. The 2020 global pandemic pushed the long bond futures to a record high. Bonds rallied during the 2008 global financial meltdown. However, past performance is no guarantee of the future. An economic or other crisis with U.S. debt at the current level, inflation, domestic political discord, and geopolitical turmoil is a toxic cocktail that could cause a continuation of carnage in the U.S. bond market.The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  is highly liquid. At the  84.34 level on Oct. 23, TLT had around  34.83 billion in assets. TLT trades more than 53.5 million shares daily and charges a 0.15  management fee.At  84.37, TLT is at its lowest level since July 2007 and not far above the 2004  80.51 bottom.TLT s trend is lower, and the trend in any market is always your best friend. Time will tell if another crisis is on the horizon and if that crisis will cause the historical bounce in bonds or if selling will accelerate. The U.S. budget deficit adds to the national debt, which is dangerous given the highly volatile geopolitical and domestic landscapes. On Oct. 23, 2023, the trend in bonds and TLT is lower, and we should expect a challenge of the 2004 low.The  is one of the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from a top-ranked author in commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Rivian: Be Careful Of More Dilution,"Rivian  is one of the few EV stocks that I'll continue to avoid due to massive downside risk at current price levels.RIVN stock has fallen over 81  from its all-time highs and could fall even further afterThe bold sale provides extra liquidity for Rivian's balance sheet due to the company's massive quarterly losses. Rivian lost  1.2 billion in Q2 2023 and doesn't show any signs of profitability anytime soon.On a positive note, Rivian has outperformed Lucid, Fisker, and Nio YTD but lagged behind only Tesla in terms of stock price performance.According to the , Rivian loses  33,000 per EV and plans to scale even faster by delivering more EVs in an attempt to become profitable.Rivian sells two electric trucks  the R1T and R1S for an average cost of  80,000 per vehicle. The company was founded by RJ Scaringe in 2009 who encouraged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to invest in this volatile EV startup.Founder-led companies tend to outperform all other companies so it's nice to see RJ Scaringe running his personal startup nearly after 14 years.However, Rivian has a huge cash burn problem that's putting downside pressure on RIVN shares.Rivian finished Q2 2023 on a positive note in terms of production but showed more vulnerability with its huge  1  billion in losses. The company generated  1.2 billion in revenue and delivered 12,640 EVs  Up 183  YoY  with a goal to deliver 52,000 EVs in 2023.While Rivian hasn't released its Q3 2023 earnings report yet, the company  15,564 Q3 2023 deliveries in a preliminary report.Management made several rosy promises including cost-cutting measures and employee headcount reduction to reach the goal of positive gross profit in 2024.The company reported an increase in negative free cash flow of  1.616 billion in Q2 2023 compared to  1.563 billion in Q2 2022.Rising negative free cash flow forces companies to take on debt or dilute shareholders to keep the lights on.Rivian continues to dilute shareholders with the sale of convertible notes including a  in March and the most recent  in October 2023.Will more convertible bond sales come in the future  That's the risk you are taking right now.According to the , the US stock market is overvalued and could dip much lower over the next few months due to more interest rate hikes, a decrease in discretionary spending due to student loan repayments, and negative geopolitical events.Unprofitable high-growth stocks will get crushed during a market downturn, which could send RIVN shares dipping a lot more.While many investors are buying the dip at  18, I think RIVN could dip below  10 in the short run.With RIVN shares trading at a  17 billion market cap, I'm afraid that further dilution would hurt the stock price and compound Rivian shareholder losses even further.Anything is possible and I am well aware of management's goal to reduce the cost of each EV by  40,000. Lithium prices are falling and perhaps Rivian reduces costs by removing several components from its initial EV concept to lower expenses. It's definitely something to pay attention to.Another interesting turn could happen if Rivian settles its convertible bonds before the maturity date in 2030. The sale of these bonds will fund the production of the Rivian SUV and the proposed  5 billion Rivian production plant in Georgia.If Rivian does well over the next few years, then convertible bond holders will prefer common shares instead of bond repayments.I believe a much lower RIVN share price would reduce this potential risk and provide a better  margin of safety .I didn't buy the Rivian IPO hype and don't plan on buying any shares until RIVN shares trade much lower. There's no reason to FOMO into Rivian if more dilution is needed to keep the company in business.The RIVN weekly RSI chart shows a slow but steady decline since the July 2023 spike and I don't see any reason to catch a failing knife right now.Watch out for a dip below the 200-day moving average support level of  18.21.When , prospective investors should have taken a hard look at Rivian's business model in the short run.Rivian should avoid growing too quickly and instead focus on quality to satisfy customers over the long run. Driving too quickly to your destination is a guaranteed way to speed out of control and never reach your final destination.Rivian is backed by Amazon so I don't think the company will go out of business, but be prepared for more dilution and lower RIVN stock prices in the near term.

Gold's Safe Haven Promise Amidst Rising Global Tensions,"The Middle East emerged as a hotspot for heightened geopolitical conflicts, notably between Israel and groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. This tension manifested in artillery fire, rocket attacks, and targeted military operations. However, the regional unrest didn't stay localized, impacting the global landscape through pronouncedThis article explores the influence of recent geopolitical occurrences on the financial market, particularly on gold prices. Gold has significantly rebounded from its solid support base, testing critical thresholds to surpassThe Middle East experienced heightened tensions in 2023 when Israel and Hezbollah traded artillery and rockets amidst the . Additionally, militant operations from Syria targeted northern Israel, prompting Israel to counteract with artillery and airstrikes within Syrian boundaries. This volatile environment intensified on 7 October 2023, as Hamas initiated a significant offensive against Israel, complicating the region's . Such escalation sparked concerns of a broader confrontation, affecting global financial markets and commodity prices.The unfolding conflict introduced a new layer of uncertainty to financial markets sensitive to . It profoundly impacted oil markets, reminiscent of the tensions during Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. Notably, crude oil prices surged due to apprehensions regarding a broader influence on the petroleum-rich Gulf region. Concurrently, gold, seen as a refuge during geopolitical instability, gained prominence. Should these tensions persist, the long-term implications on oil could sustain this market uncertainty, thereby bolstering gold's value owing to its status as a safe-haven asset. This scenario highlights the intricate connections between geopolitical events, global financial markets, and commodity values, illustrating the widespread repercussions of regional disputes on the world economy.The recent geopolitical tensions underscore the critical importance of energy security for nations worldwide. As the world grapples with the dual challenges of navigating these geopolitical conflicts and transitioning from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources, the energy markets will undoubtedly experience significant turbulence. The countries will prioritize securing energy supplies for themselves, potentially leading to competitive scrambles for remaining fossil fuel resources. Countries heavily reliant on imports, like Germany during Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, are exposed to vulnerabilities despite substantial investments in renewables. Furthermore, as investments in fossil fuels dwindle due to ESG standards, the world is at an increased risk of energy shortages during the transition phase. This heightened competition and potential scarcity can drive up energy prices globally.Simultaneously, the energy market's fluctuations will inevitably impact the gold market. During geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, investors traditionally flock to gold as a  safe-haven  asset, increasing prices. The chaos in the energy markets will likely result in broader economic volatility, given the fundamental role of energy in powering industries and economies. As energy prices rise and uncertainties about energy security grow, many investors will seek refuge in gold, driving demand and its price upward. Additionally, if the rapid transition to renewable energy fails to provide the requisite base-load power for essential industries, the resulting industrial downturn can further increase the appeal of gold as a stable investment.Various global events and policies notably influence inflation. War and pandemics are significant triggers. During such times, governments often accrue large deficits, primarily financed by central bank purchases when other investors are scarce. Such actions lead to a swift expansion of the money supply and, subsequently, high inflation.The ratio of M2 to Gross Domestic Product is still above the pre-2008 highs of 0.6, which suggests an unusually high level of liquidity in the economy compared to before the 2008 crisis. An excessive amount of money in the economy leads to inflation, as more money chases after the same number of goods and services. Moreover, high liquidity can inflate asset prices, as the surplus money often finds its way into stock markets, real estate, and other investments, potentially leading to bubbles. This high liquidity and inflationary environment benefit the gold market due to increased demand and a safe-haven appeal.Historically, gold has been viewed as a hedge against inflation. Money's value or purchasing power decreases as inflation rises, but gold often retains or even appreciates. Geopolitical conflict and the aggressive push towards carbon-free fuels at the expense of current resources have created a precarious situation. These factors are expected to elevate energy costs.The chart below presents the trajectories of both CPI and Core CPI. The Core CPI figures show a downward trend, while the CPI is an upward turn, primarily attributed to surging energy prices during the past two months. Based on the above discussion, it's evident that current geopolitical events might further drive up energy prices, potentially exacerbating inflation.Notably, although there was a significant increase in energy prices in August, this growth tapered off in September, as depicted in the chart below.Moreover, the sticky consumer price index also presents a shift in trend from the past three months, highlighting the inflation.The rising inflation often prompts the use of rising interest rates as a monetary policy tool. Higher rates tend to reduce borrowing, spending, and demand-driven inflation. Federal Reserve has increased the interest rates to 5.33  to fight inflation, as seen in the chart below.However, increasing the interest rate to higher levels also dampens economic growth by making borrowing costlier for consumers and businesses. Moreover, the MOVE Index, which measures interest rate volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, is rising, indicating heightened uncertainty in interest rate trajectories, as shown in the chart below.Historically, when the MOVE Index surges, it can correlate with increased demand for gold. This is because gold is perceived as a  flight to safety  during economic uncertainty. As investors anticipate the possibility of rising interest rates to combat inflation and the volatile backdrop of geopolitical tensions, the appeal of gold as a safe-haven asset will likely be reinforced.In such environments, gold's non-yielding nature becomes less of a deterrent for investors when weighed against the uncertainties in other asset classes. The current mix of high inflation, potential interest rate hikes, and a rising MOVE Index suggests that gold's appeal may intensify, reinforcing its status as a safe-haven during challenging periods.In , a robust bullish sentiment was projected for the gold market in the long run. The extended quarterly charts showed recurring bull flags, signaling a continued rise in gold prices. The gold market witnessed a significant upswing beginning in 2016, validating the breakout of the most recent bull flag and pointing to a substantial price escalation. Moreover, the appearance of the  cup and handle  patterns on the quarterly charts identified  2,075 as a pivotal level that needs to be surpassed to kickstart a pronounced rally.  suggested a yearly breakout above  2,075 could propel the market toward an ambitious target of  8,570. This perspective gains traction from the inverted head and shoulder patterns on the . Currently, the gold market oscillates between  1,680 and  2,075. A departure from this bracket is essential to set the stage for the next significant rally.The gold market has been experiencing notable volatility despite maintaining its price range between  1,680 and  2,075, as expected. The chart below delineates an inverted head and shoulders pattern, suggesting that the gold market's long-term forecast remains bullish. Geopolitical disturbances in the Middle East have contributed to a significant bounce in the gold price. The robust October performance is poised to continue, with prices likely to end the month on an upward trend. A monthly close above  2,075 could potentially signal a major long-term surge, marking the onset of a significant rally in the gold sector. This price point is crucial as the market seems to be consolidating, forming the right shoulder of the pattern.The intense fluctuations in the gold market can also be gauged from the weekly chart, which showcases an ascending broadening wedge pattern spanning from a low of  1,124.30 to a peak of  2,089.20. This pattern underscores the market's uncertainty. The current price configuration shapes an inverted head and shoulders pattern, with the head at  1,622.20 and shoulders at  1,673.30 and  1,823.50. Interestingly, the pattern's neckline also converges at  2,075, hinting at a potentially powerful price evolution in the gold sector. With increasing global tensions due to conflicts in the Middle East, market unpredictability has skyrocketed, prompting a notable price surge during the recent market rally. This recent surge reinforces the presence of the inverted head and shoulders pattern and amplifies the probability of surpassing the  2,075 mark. The chart suggests a broad scope beyond this breakout point, signaling the potential for significant price growth.Investing in GLD provides the easiest way for investors to tap into the gold market. Being the world's premier gold-backed ETF in size and liquidity, GLD stands out as a compelling investment choice for big institutions and individual investors. The following chart illustrates the Assets Under Management  AUM  for GLD during the past decade. With an AUM of  54.54 billion, GLD tops its rivals due to its sterling reputation, unparalleled liquidity, and wide-ranging appeal to various investors.Moreover, the 30-day average daily trading volume surge indicates heightened interest and activity around the GLD ETF. Combined with the recent uptick in gold prices due to geopolitical tensions, this suggests that investors are flocking to gold as a safe-haven asset. For the GLD ETF, this can mean increased demand, potential inflows, and a possible appreciation in its value, reflecting the broader sentiment of the market seeking stability and security amid geopolitical uncertainty.Additionally, the long-term technical analysis for the GLD ETF indicates a robust bullish trend, as evidenced by the prominent inverted head and shoulders and the bull flag patterns in the monthly chart below. Notably, the inverted head and shoulders pattern's neckline was breached at  130, forming a bull flag. A monthly close above  195 would confirm this bull flag. Although the price hasn't surpassed the bull flag yet, the potential for an upward breakout remains significant due to the distinct inverted head and shoulder patterns.Heightened tensions in the Middle East have often driven demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. If these tensions subside, along with stabilization in the oil industry or a decrease in its price volatility, the appeal of gold as an alternative investment might wane, potentially leading to a drop in its price. Additionally, countries' efficient transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, without causing significant disruptions in the energy market, could diminish the allure of gold during such periods. Similarly, if the Federal Reserve successfully curbs inflation through higher interest rates, it might make other investments more appealing than gold. Favorable global economic developments, such as trade deals, diplomatic resolutions to conflicts, or robust economic growth indicators, further have the potential to lessen the demand for gold.From a technical viewpoint, the gold market seems to be at a pivotal point. If the gold price fails to surpass  2,075, it will likely consolidate within a broader range. This technical analysis could provide valuable insights for investors tracking the metal's price movements.The escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Hamas have rippled across the globe, leading to palpable shifts in financial markets and commodity prices. Notably, the uncertainty introduced by these confrontations has heightened the volatility in the oil industry and has reinforced the role of gold as a stable refuge during turbulent times. The recent unrest has illuminated the profound interplay between geopolitical events, energy markets, and the gold market. While nations grapple with ensuring energy security amidst this instability, the possible competitive race for fossil fuel resources might further destabilize energy markets. As energy prices face potential hikes, the appeal of gold as a  safe-haven  asset grows in tandem.Furthermore, rising inflation, prompted by various global events and policies, has the potential to amplify gold's appeal. With the Federal Reserve resorting to increasing interest rates to counter this inflation, gold's allure is further emphasized in the face of potential economic downturns and the quest for financial safety. Gold's current market trends suggest it is poised for a significant technical breakout. The price oscillation between  1,680 and  2,075 is of notable interest to investors, indicating that surpassing this range might initiate a substantial rally. Concurrently, GLD ETF emerges as a promising investment avenue given its size, liquidity, and the recent surge in gold prices. Investors may consider buying the gold market at its current price, anticipating a robust surge in gold prices from the  2,075 mark and the GLD ETF at  195.

"Sentiment Speaks: Do You Care About Gold? Well, You Should","This is now my second article on metals in the last week. And, the main reason I have chosen to write recently is because there are just too many fallacies presented in the many otherIn my last article, I addressed the manipulation and inflation fallacies regarding gold, in addition to the confirmation bias which seems to be prevalent in the comments section all too frequently. In this week's article, I am going to address the safe haven fallacy, the inverse-inflation argument, as well as the fallacy regarding the US Dollar.Let's start with the safe haven fallacy.The last time we saw the occurrence of a major geopolitical event was when Russia invaded Ukraine. Yet, goldHow can we explain this based upon the  safe haven  perspective  Did Russia suddenly pull out from Ukraine  Or, can we more reasonably assume that there really is no safe haven driver of gold  I know where I stand based upon the facts of history. In fact, you can see the same in just about every geo-political occurrence through the years. Gold has not diverted from the pattern that it was trading within before the event.Moreover, major rallies begun in the metals market have not been triggered by geopolitical events. Just ask yourself if were there any geopolitical events which started the rally we saw in 2016 in the metals market  That rally took almost everyone by surprise, as most were extremely bearish of the metals at that time. Well, almost everyone.On December 30, 2015, I penned the following message to those willing to listenBut, I digress.So, please spare me with the fallacies of gold being a  safe haven  during geopolitical events. History proves that this is not what drives gold. So, any articles that present an underlying premise based upon the safe haven argument should be summarily dismissed for lack of historical support or understanding of what drives gold.What astounded me even more was an article reasoning that we should wait for inflation to dissipate before gold will rally. It seems that there are people that are surmising that since gold did not rally due to inflation, then it must mean that it will rally when inflation subsides. And, yes, I just shook my head.Folks, for as long as I have been investing in gold  many decades , there have been arguments proffered that gold rallies during inflation, and an equal number of arguments that it rallies during deflation. And you know what history proves  Both arguments are wrong. If you look at historical periods of inflation, you will see there are times that gold will rally, and there are times that gold will fall. And, if you look at historical periods of deflation, you will see there are times that gold will rally, and there are times gold will fall.So, what conclusion should you derive from any arguments focused upon inflation or deflation  You should ignore them because anyone that relies upon those drivers has no clue about how metals work, nor have they bothered to review the lessons of history.Lastly, I have seen many arguments that claim that gold does not rally when the dollar is strong. And, because the dollar is strong right now, then gold will not rally. There are two main issues with this argument.First, I am not going to provide to you a dissertation regarding the many historical periods of time where gold rallied alongside the dollar or dropped alongside the dollar. If you take the time to look, you will find it on your own. But, I will simply point out that the DXY  Dollar Index  is now just below its 20  year highs, and so is gold.Second, the crux of argument is based upon a linear expectation that the dollar will remain in the trend in which it currently is traveling. But, is that how markets work  Are markets really that linear  And, between you and me, I am seeing the DXY approaching a topping point, and will likely begin to drop towards the 96 region.Now that we have addressed further fallacies in the metals market, I will explain to you why you should care about the metals market.As an anecdotal side point, I have to note that the recent metals articles that I have written on Seeking Alpha has been quite poorly read. My articles on the stock market well exceed 10,000 reads every single well. Interestingly, when I used to write about metals years ago, those articles well exceeded 10,000 read every single week. Yet, my current articles see half, if not even less, the reads of those garnered by my general market articles. I think this presents us with anecdotal evidence that there is not much interest in the metals market. And, it supports our expectations of a bottoming in the market price, and our expectation that a major rally will likely take hold into 2024.So, allow me to reiterate my expectation in the metals market. I believe we will see a very strong rally in the gold and silver markets as we move into 2024. And, my minimum target for the next gold rally is the  2,428 region. But, we often see very strong extensions during precious metals rallies, so depending on the size of those extension, we may even see as high as the  2,700 region before the next multi-year correction begins.If you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please hit the button at the bottom of the page to  Follow  me.For those who are questioning why all comments  including mine  go through moderation, you can read here  .Avi Gilburt, CPA., is an accountant and lawyer by training and the founder of Elliot Wave Trader, where along with his team of analysts, he specializes in identifying the major turning points and market trends so you can invest more confidently while applying appropriate risk management.

Depression Alert: Why The Shrinking Money Supply Spells Trouble For SPY,"The U.S. economy is currently experiencing a rare event that hasn't been witnessed since 1949  a shrinking money supply. M2 has declined by a whopping  700 billion since the hiking cycle began. This phenomenon is In this article, we will explore why the U.S. money supply is shrinking and delve into its potentially negative implications for SPY and the broader financial landscape.The recent contraction in the U.S. money supply is not solely due to a single, isolated cause. Rather, it is a result of a complex interplay of factors that have evolved over time, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, financial innovations, and shifts in market dynamics.We will discuss the three most prominent of these factors below One significant contributor to the shrinking money supply is the change in Federal Reserve policy away from quantitative easing and towards quantitative tightening. The Fed has been reducing its massive  8 trillion balance sheet  so far to the tune of  800 billion , which in turn has had a direct impact on savings deposits because as the Fed rolls off assets like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as they reach maturity, it reduces the money supply since these assets instead need to be financed by bank deposits or other forms of money. Additionally, rising interest rates - which have pushed yields higher in numerous financial products such as money markets - have discouraged individuals and institutions from keeping their funds in low-yield savings and checking accounts, leading to a decline in deposits Moreover, the continued growth in credit and debit card adoption by consumers has reduced the reliance on physical cash for everyday transactions, while the years of ultra-low interest rates, the growing digitization of financial markets, and the rise of user-friendly commission-free trading apps like Robinhood  have made it easier and more attractive for households to allocate their savings to investments rather than traditional bank deposits. Yes, interest rates have risen recently, but many individuals have already been activated as investors and have formed the habit of allocating excess savings to stocks rather than to a bank savings account.These three major factors have led to a staggering  2.4 trillion decline in savings deposits since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in early 2022.So what does the shrinking U.S. money supply mean for SPY  The reality is quite nuanced.One of the most accurate ways of measuring the relationship between the money supply and SPY performance is its impact on interest rates, though the relationship between interest rates and stock market performance is complex. Rising interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income assets more attractive relative to stocks. As investors seek higher yields in bonds, there might be a shift away from equities like those in SPY, thereby hurting its performance. We have seen this dynamic at play recently as surging bond yields have weighed on SPY's performanceConversely, when interest rates are very low, investors seeking returns are inclined to invest in riskier assets like stocks, driving their prices higher due to increased demand. This was one of the main reasons why SPY boomed over the decade between 2012 and 2021, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreakAnother reason why interest rates have an impact on SPY is that - when market interest rates rise - it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money for profitable projects, leading to higher interest payments and lower profits. In some cases, projects may become unfeasible. Lower profits translate to lower stock prices because stock prices are a reflection of a company's future earnings. Conversely, when interest rates fall, companies can borrow more easily, boosting profits and economic growth. A classic recent example of this was seen at NextEra Energy Partners , where management just  its target growth rate in half due to a soaring cost of capital.Moreover, Goldman Sachs  that interest rates are one of the more reliable indicators for estimating the impact of tighter monetary policy and financial conditions on the economy, which in turn can assist us with predicting SPY performance. In fact, one of the more prominent S P 500 valuation models in use today is known as the That said, while interest rates certainly do  in the behavior of stock markets, they are also influenced by a myriad of other factors, including investor sentiment, economic conditions, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events. While changes in the money supply can play a role in shaping economic conditions, they are just one piece of the broader puzzle. As a result, historical data reveals that relying solely on monetary aggregates for predicting market performance can be unreliable.Fortunately for SPY, its  are in cash-rich technology mega-cap stocks like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Nvidia , Alphabet , , Tesla , and Meta  as well as one of the strongest conglomerates in the world in Berkshire Hathaway , This should make it more resistant to higher for longer interest rates than some other financial instruments out there. That said, there are still reasons to be concerned. First of all, SPY is quite overvalued based on several leading valuation models such as the Buffett Indicator, the Price Earnings Model, the S P 500 Mean Reversion Model, and the Yield Curve Model.Moreover, as a  pointed outWhen a contraction in the money supply is coupled with inflation, such as we are seeing now, there is an elevated threat of the market and broader economy experiencing a deflationary crash. This would undoubtedly have a terrible impact on SPY. Similar circumstances occurred in the post-World War I era and the Spanish Flu pandemic, resulting in 11  deflation and high unemployment. A mere -2  contraction in the money supply in 1921 triggered this deflationary depression, and currently, in 2023, we are already at a -2  contraction. This suggests that the economy's resilience and the current inflation may not be as robust as believed.While the money supply in 2023 is substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, history indicates that depressions and deflation do not require a linear decrease in the money supply but can result from even a slight contraction of 2-4  year-on-year. Many expect the current inflation to persist indefinitely, akin to the 1970s, but the key difference is that the Federal Reserve is engaged in Quantitative Tightening right now, causing the money supply to contract. As a result, economic history seems to indicate that a deflationary depression in the near future is a possibility unless the Federal Reserve changes course away from QT.The currently shrinking U.S. money supply is a historically rare and complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors, including changes in Federal Reserve policy, rising interest rates, and financial innovation. While there are reasons to believe that it could bode poorly for SPY - particularly given that rising interest rates often follow and are mechanically bad for equity valuations, SPY appears to be overvalued based on numerous models, and a shrinking money supply dramatically increases the chances of depression - it is also important to keep in mind that the relationship between the money supply and stock market performance is not straightforward.As a result, while this analysis does lead us to be bearish on SPY and rate it a Sell, we do not think that long-term investors should overreact, sell everything, and  head for the hills  in a panic. However, it does emphasize the importance of proper diversification and having a financial plan that does not depend on liquidating SPY shares for several years to come.

Gold Prices Surge To Near Summer Highs Amid Geopolitical Turmoil,"Fueled by a profoundly tragic geopolitical event from external forces, gold prices are poised to conclude this week near their highest levels since the summer. So, what has transpired during this weekThe predominant force influencing goldThroughout the week, gold spot prices steadily ascended, occasionally swayed by the macroeconomic factors we typically monitor  which we willOn this Friday morning, there has been a vigorous and sharp acceleration in the rally of gold prices since the commencement of US trading. The price chart effortlessly breached what was anticipated to be sturdy, resistance at the  1900 level, ascending even higher. At lunchtime in New York, spot prices comfortably exceeded  1925 per ounce. This marks the highest bid ask price for gold in almost a month, capping what appears to be the strongest single-week performance for this safe-haven commodity in seven months. While this sudden surge bears the typical hallmarks of a trader's acute  over reaction, it is likely more of a preemptive maneuver as managers and investors seek to reallocate their positions to the historical safe-haven role of gold. They do so with the understanding that there may be no respite in the Gaza conflict, especially over the weekend.Assuming, as we must, that markets will persist after the Gaza conflict concludes  or, as has sadly become the case with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it becomes  priced in  to markets , it is worthwhile to examine the macroeconomic indicators of the week and their impact on gold, or lack thereof. The release of meeting minutes and discussion notes from last month's Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting revealed scant new information and mostly reinforced expectations of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year and possibly in early 2024. Although the consensus projection for November's FOMC decision may still be to maintain current rates, the market's response to this information in gold trading and elsewhere was somewhat muddled by the Gaza headlines and the evolving Speaker of the House situation in Washington. In practice, Wednesday's FOMC minutes did little to disrupt or accelerate the steady climb of the gold price chart.More consequential was Thursday's Consumer Price Index  CPI  report, which provided an update on consumer inflation in the US economy. The closely watched  core  inflation figure exhibited the anticipated modest year-over-year decrease, while the headline CPI figure showed a slightly higher reading than expected. While not a major setback for the Federal Reserve's efforts to mitigate inflationary pressures, it did not present a new argument for the central bank to deviate from its current path of rate hikes. Traders, particularly in the US Treasury bond market, appeared to seize upon this perspective as yields surged once more, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury Note to its highest level since 2007. In response, gold prices experienced their sole intraday decline of the week. This setback on Thursday shifted the starting point for Friday's robust surge in gold prices from  1870 to  1880.As emphasized here, the situation in Gaza unequivocally remains the primary driver of gold's future trajectory. This is expected to become even more pronounced in the upcoming week, as the macroeconomic calendar offers limited counterprogramming. The focal point will largely be on public remarks from key FOMC officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as they address how the central bank anticipates the repercussions of a prolonged and inflamed Middle East conflict on financial conditions and, consequently, the monetary policy stance of the FOMC.Let's take a look at the standard deviation levels anticipated for next week's trading and see where we can capture some profits. This report presents an analysis of the gold futures market for the week, focusing on trend momentum, price momentum, price indicators, cycle analysis, and trading strategy recommendations. The gold futures contract closed at  1941.5, indicating the current market price. Notably, the market is trading above the 9-day Simple Moving Average  SMA  at  1923. This confirms a bearish weekly trend momentum. It's imperative for traders to monitor the 9 SMA closely, as a close above it would negate the weekly bearish trend and shift it to neutral. The market closed above the VC Weekly Price Momentum Indicator at  1915, signaling bullish price momentum. A close below this indicator would change the weekly price momentum from bullish to neutral, potentially affecting trading decisions. For traders with short positions, it is advisable to consider taking profits during corrective phases, particularly at price levels ranging from  1884 to  1827. Conversely, traders looking to enter long positions should be vigilant for a weekly reversal stop signal. If currently in a long position, the  1827 price level can serve as a Monthly Stop Close Only and Good Till Cancelled order. Furthermore, it's prudent to plan for profit-taking as the market approaches the  1973 - 2003 price levels during the month. The next cycle due date is identified as 10.15.23. This date should be incorporated into trading strategies as it may coincide with potential market shifts. For traders already in long positions, it is recommended to consider taking profits within the  1973 -  2003 price range. This range represents a potentially profitable exit point based on the current analysis. In conclusion, the gold futures market is currently exhibiting bearish trend momentum but maintains bullish price momentum. Traders should closely monitor key price levels and the 9-day SMA for potential shifts in trend and momentum. The upcoming cycle date on 10.15.23 should also be considered when formulating trading strategies.Disclaimer  The information in the Market Commentaries was obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but we do not guarantee its accuracy.

Performance Shipping: George Economou's Hostile Takeover Offer Unlikely To Succeed - Hold,"  Last year, small Greece-based tanker operator Performance Shipping  peer Imperial Petroleum , Over the past 18 months, Performance Shipping has raised approximately  37.7 million in net proceeds from a series of equity offerings including warrant sweetenersPlease note that common shareholders suffered additional dilution  albeit to a lesser extent  from share sales executed under two recent at-the-market offerings.The company has used the funds to expand its tanker fleet to eight vessels with an estimated market value of approximately  350 millionInLike other tanker companies with a focus on the spot- and short-term time charter markets, Performance Shipping has benefited heavily from elevated charter rates caused by recent geopolitical events.In H1 2023, the company generated a whopping  40.8 million in cash from operating activities.Despite the favorable market environment, Performance Shipping continues to trade at an eye-catching 90  discount to net asset value  NAV  as investors remain wary of the company's tainted pastUnfortunately, this number remains subject to material dilution from potential warrant exercises and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock conversions with fully-diluted NAV per share estimated to be below  6However, even after the recent rally in the shares, the discount to fully-diluted NAV still calculates to more than 60 .Over the past couple of months, notorious Greek shipping magnate George Economou has accumulated close to 10  of the company's common shares in a series of open market purchases and stated his intention to engage in a .On Wednesday, Mr. Economou surprisingly launched a  to acquire all of Performance Shipping's outstanding shares for  3.00 in cash per share thus causing the stock price to jump by almost 30 .Investors should note that the offer is subject to a large number of conditions with the majority being solely within the control of the company and its Board of Directors.Among other things, the offer is conditional uponBut with Ms. Paliou and Mr. Michalopoulos commanding approximately 90  of the voting rights, there's basically no way for Mr. Economou's hostile offer to succeed.Not surprisingly, Performance Shipping is  vigorously against Mr. Economou's demands  emphasis added by authorAt this point, I just don't see a viable path for George Economou to gain control of Performance Shipping without the consent of the company and its controlling shareholders.With Mr. Economou's offer representing an almost 50  discount to fully-diluted NAV, there's simply no basis for Performance Shipping's controlling shareholders to consider a deal. On the flip side, there's no sense in acquiring the company at a price close to NAV so I do not expect Mr. Economou to raise his offer materially.At least in my opinion, the only way for George Economou to potentially get his hands on Performance Shipping would be to challenge the company's ownership structure in court which would likely result in a protracted battle with limited prospects of success.Things continue to escalate at Performance Shipping with George Economou surprisingly launching a hostile tender offer to acquire all of the company's outstanding common stock for  3.00 per share in cash.Please note that the offer is conditional upon the company removing all obstacles to the proposed acquisition which at least in my opinion is not going to happen.Given this issue, investors shouldn't bet on the share price approaching the proposed takeover price anytime soon.Shareholders considering to accept Mr. Economou's offer should contact their broker in order to make sure that the November 8 deadline will be met.With little prospects of George Economou succeeding in his battle for control of Performance Shipping and the stock price up by almost 200  since my  recommendation in late June, I am downgrading the company's shares from  to .Investors should note that George Economou has also  a sizeable stake in OceanPal, another Palios family-controlled shipping company that was spun off by Diana Shipping  last year and trades at a similar discount to NAV. However, in contrast to Performance Shipping, Mr. Economou has yet to state his intentions regarding OceanPal.Besides a potential deterioration in tanker market conditions, key risks for Performance Shipping's shareholders are further dilution and particularly George Economou abandoning his current efforts to take control of the company.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

The Most Important Inflation Metric Is Back At Target Levels: SPY Implications,"The The rise of AI earlier this year boosted the technology mega-cap stocks - Microsoft Corp , Apple Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. As a result, SPY got off to a roaring start to the yearSince then, however, long-term interest rates have soared higher, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have increased significantly, and the assumption that interest rates will remain higher for longer has taken hold on Wall Street. Moreover, some of the aforementioned mega-cap tech stocks have posted Q3 results that disappointed Wall Street, further weighing on SPY. SPY is also likely suffering from the fact that it is trading at an elevated valuation andThat being said, some good news came out today, with the single most important inflation metric signaling that we are basically back to the Federal Reserve's long-term target level. In this article, we will look at the specifics of this more and discuss its implications for SPY.Today  that in September inflation remained stable without any significant cooling or resurgence, as reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The September Core PCE Price Index, the Federal Reserve's main inflation measure, rose 3.7  Y Y, which was similar to the consensus estimate and slightly down from August's 3.8 .On a month-to-month basis, core PCE, which omits energy and food prices due to their volatility and sensitivity to short-term factors like weather and geopolitical events, rose 0.3 . Furthermore, the overall PCE Price Index increased 0.4  M M, while on a Y Y basis, it grew 3.4 .The best news of all is that - on a three-month annualized pace - core PCE has slowed to 2.4 . If the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate is  2 , that means that inflation is nearly back to normal levels that we last saw in 2020RSM US Chief Economist, Joseph Brusuelas, seconded this notion when he statedBesides being the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures index is often cited as the best predictor of long-term inflation for the following reasonsAnother piece of excellent news for inflation's outlook was that consumer spending - which is largely credited with being the main force keeping inflation sticky - surpassed personal income. Personal income increased by 0.3  M M, while spending rose by 0.7 , pushing the personal saving rate down to 3.4 , its lowest level of the year. As a result, inflation is likely going to subside at an accelerated pace in the coming months as consumer spending is on an unsustainable pace and the saving rate is reaching low levels. As Morning Consult's senior economist, Kayla Bruun commentedWith interest rates soaring and credit card debt at , it is highly unlikely that the consumer is going to be able to rely much more on debt to sustain its shopping spree moving forward. As a result, we think the conclusion is inevitable that we are on the threshold of inflation falling meaningfully. With Core PCE already nearly at the Federal Reserve's long-term target, a decline in consumer spending will likely push us below 2 , enabling the Federal Reserve to not only pause but likely begin to pivot towards cutting interest rates.Declining inflation and falling interest rates would  for the stock market, and SPY would be no exception. That being said, we also need to bear in mind that falling consumer spending would likely mean that a recession hits the economy as well, which will weigh on some of the less defensive names in the index, including mega-caps that are more consumer-facing such as AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN. After all, recent yield curve behavior implies that a recession is highly likely, as when the spread between the 10 Year treasury yield and the 3 Month treasury yield becomes negative  yield curve inversion , it has historically been a precursor to recessions, as seen by the  Inversion Points  in the chart belowMoreover, SPY is clearly overvalued based on several valuation metrics, includingAs a result, while falling inflation and interest rates could potentially cheer the market up in the near term, a corresponding decline in corporate earnings due to an economic downturn will likely offset much of this initial cheer and potentially cause investors to take a fresh look at the lofty valuations that they have assigned to some of these companies.What does this mean for us as investors  For starters, we remain bearish on SPY and expect it to underperform its historical average returns in the next few years. As a result, we rate SPY a Sell.That said, with so much of the market priced for higher-for-longer interest rates, opportunities for investors certainly do abound right now. We think that hedging against geopolitical and financial crisis risk is certainly prudent right now, making gold  a particularly compelling investment at the moment. Energy  is also a compelling investment given the soaring geopolitical risk in top oil-exporting nations like Iran and Russia. That said, the risk of a sharp economic downturn could lead to significant near-term downside for oil prices should geopolitical risks not manifest into an actual supply chain disruption event, so we think that the risk-reward is more favorable in the midstream  portion of the sector right now.We also think that beaten-down quality defensive names in the utilities and yield co  and REIT  sectors make a lot of sense right now as these stocks offer very attractive dividend yields right now, are poised to soar in the wake of falling interest rates, while also providing strong protection against an economic downturn. As a result, we are buying precious metals, midstream, infrastructure, and REITs hand-over-fist right now, while avoiding SPY and the richly valued mega-cap tech names that dominate its portfolio composition.

Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,"Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock  The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at  59.5B. This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang, the market didn't seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover, many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance, you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes, transaction costs or asymmetric information about management's intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations. The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the company's future investment opportunities. For example, one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musk's company isn't known for paying dividends but the market  rightly or wrongly  puts a very high value on its investment opportunities.The Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified. Investors pay taxes and transaction costs  a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining management's ability to invest in negative present value projects. Last but not least, many individual and institutional investors simply need current income. You could theoretically generate income from a non-dividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costs.In practice, companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities. Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities . You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of management's confidence in the stability of the business. Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isn't obliged to maintain them in bad years.Importantly, a very high dividend - or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage - doesn't by itself make for a good dividend stock. If anything, leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project. The dividend may also be at risk of being cut, i.e., the stock may be a  dividend trap.At the end of the day, oil   gas is a cyclical industry and producers can't control the price of their output. For this reason, large U.S. independents like Marathon Oil , APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividends.Exxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said, integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays, but it's still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staples.It depends on your time horizon. Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years  this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter   Gamble However, a nice  dividend growth series doesn't mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from -250  to  250 . The financial leverage also tends to yo-yo a bitUnsurprisingly, the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if you're a buy-and-hold investor though  I would say yes. Even if you never sell any stocks, you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever. To illustrate this point, I ran a backtest that assumes you started with  1,000 in January 2001 and invested another  1,000 each month thereafter, all the way through September 2023. I compared Exxon to PG, as a typical consumer staples company, and to Devon , as a more risky, upstream player. I assumed all dividends were reinvestedUltimately, XOM and PG got you to a similar place but arguably PG did so with fewer sleepless nights. A XOM-only portfolio was more stable than Devon but still lacking compared to a pure defensive stock.Here are also the XOM drawdowns underwater periodsIn 20 or so years, there were 3 drawdowns of 25  or greater with underwater periods of 2, 3 and almost 8 years  In contrast, PG had only one drawdown of 25  or more that continued for three and half years.So does this mean XOM is bad dividend stock  No. However, it shows that it should be managed actively.To some extent yes. The  dividend discount model  or DDM is one of the basic valuation tools that can be applied to a dividend paying company. Exxon grew its dividend from  0.23 per quarter to  0.91 over the last 22 years. This implies a CAGR  compound annual growth rate  of about 6.5 . Assuming 10  cost of equity, XOM may be close to its intrinsic value  however, note the sensitivity to minor changes in the growth assumptionWe have been trading in a  100- 120 range for over a year now, so the DDM approach isn't very useful.A simpler approach is to look directly at the dividend yieldHistorically, for Exxon it has averaged about 3 . At the  110 or so stock price now, XOM yields 3.31 . For the yield to converge to its historical average, the stock price would need to appreciate to  120. The caveat is that a 3  yield in a 5  risk-free rate environment isn't the same as a 3  yield when the risk-free rate is close to 0 .The problem with the DDM is that Exxon is a capital intensive business. A dividend paying consumer staples or utility company can focus on maintenance capex with predictable returns. This is why we can base our valuation considerations on the dividend. Exxon certainly has maintenance capex too but oil fields get depleted and new ones need to be discovered and developed. The success of Exxon's business is more sensitive to its capital allocation decisions, whether they are poor, as XTO, or good, as many consider Guyana to have been.Exxon's ROCE  return on capital employed  may therefore be more informative as I have discussed in a different Prior to 2008, Exxon achieved higher ROCE compared to the 2009-2021 period when adjusting for the oil price. It looks that 2022-2023 may have broken away from the  lean  period and are more consistent with the profitable years before 2008. This is why I am bullish long-term on the stock.Tactically, XOM's stock is a bit in no man's land right now. We've been stuck in a  100- 120 range for over a year. I would be more comfortable recommending a buy if we were closer to  100 or moving back up after hitting  100Secondly, in the last few days we have seen another geopolitical conflict unfold, this time in the Middle East and oil went up on the risk premium. However, most geopolitical events start with a spike in oil prices early in the crisis  e.g., 1991 Gulf War, Russia-Ukraine last year  after which the impact fades. Barring an escalation involving more actors that may bring us to WW3  XOM stock won't be my primary concern if that happens , I would expect oil to give up some gains. This may affect XOM's stock price too although it may also not given equities have not fully participated in the latest oil rally.In summary, I do think  140 is possible but I don't have a view if we are going to see  100 or  120 first. Personally, I am long XOM but trimmed 25  of my position at  120 when we failed to break above that level for the third time in a row this year.Wall Street's average target is  132, which makes sense, but note the dispersion around the averageThe  274 by the way seems to be a data feed error. It is the target an analyst  to Pioneer based on a XOM target of  118 and the exchange ratio agreed in the all-stock deal. Nevertheless, the range of forecasts is indeed broad.The short answer is no. The XTO deal didn't derail the upward trajectory in Exxon's dividend and I don't expect the PXD one to do so either. If you seriously consider opening an Exxon position, I encourage you to check out the entire acquisition , but here I will focus on just one slide that shows some of the strategic rationale for the dealWhile Pioneer is known to be one of the U.S. independents with longest shale inventory runway  perhaps 15-20 years , the deal isn't just about the upstream aspect. Pioneer will also be integrated into Exxon's downstream infrastructure which should reduce further the volatility of the combined company's cash flows. So, if something does change, I think it will be greater diversification cash flow stability which is helpful from a dividend perspective - to the extent of course things can ever be  stable  in energy.XOM has been a reliable dividend player but that doesn't mean the dividend was always safe. Investors need to differentiate between ex ante and realized risk. Just because we lucked out doesn't mean things couldn't have gone badly. Currently, XOM's business is improving structurally  higher returns on capital, adjusted for the oil price  so that bodes well for the dividend too.However, while Exxon is much safer as an investment than a pure upstream oil and gas player, it isn't a buy and forget stock. Despite the diversification that comes with the integrated model, energy remains a volatile sector. Even if you never sell stocks, deciding when to buy XOM will be more consequential for your long-term returns compared to the impact of the entry point on an investment in a traditional defensive stock.

Alibaba's Turning Point: Stimulus And Satellite Optimism,"Amid China's evolving socio-economic environment, tech behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Limited  find themselves at a crossroads. Foreign investors' growing  Avoid China  sentiment puts immense pressure on Chinese tech stocks.Although the Xi administration suggests thatThe decade-low stock price is down to critical support levels, the encouraging satellite data, and China's upcoming massive stimulus boost puts Alibaba at an inflection point, reaffirming the  for the next 2-3 years.The reasons for China's stock market decline are multifaceted. A combination of a distressedA crucial step for China's leadership, particularly President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, is the rapid development of transparent and globally trusted capital markets. Such an environment would provide Alibaba with a more stable foundation for growth. Recent outreach efforts, such as those by the central bank Governor Pan Gongsheng, signal a more inclusive approach to foreign capital, potentially benefiting Alibaba.Reflecting on past financial crises, like the 1997 Asian financial meltdown, offers insights into China's current property market challenges. Such tumultuous periods can influence investor confidence and impact Alibaba's capital expansion strategies. The People's Bank of China  PBOC  is also pivotal, adjusting policies to stabilize the economy, which may indirectly influence Alibaba's business dynamics.Local government financial strategies, especially around the local government financing vehicles, present another layer of complexity. Mismanagement in this domain could ripple through China's financial ecosystem, affecting businesses like Alibaba. Given these extensive reforms and economic shifts, Beijing must prioritize transparent communication of its intentions and policies. For Alibaba, clarity on these fronts can guide its future growth strategies.Investors might find Alibaba's upward movements predictable and short-lived, as stocks have been making abrupt movements for months based on even the slightest hint of economic interventions by the government.Recent  indicate that China plans to raise its 2023 budget deficit, specifically earmarking it for infrastructure development. The strategy is China's proactive approach to achieving its official economic growth targets. Bloomberg claimed that policymakers are considering the issue of at least 1 trillion yuan  in additional sovereign debt for expenditure on infrastructure projects like water conservation projects, pushing this year's budget deficit considerably above the 3  threshold established in March.It's a waiting game till an official statement emerges. However, the kind of stimulus hinted at by Bloomberg might be the required intervention. Investors are concerned by China's ideological hesitancy in deploying a consumption-centric stimulus to uplift the economy, considering President Xi Jinping's reservations towards a Western-style consumption-driven growth model.Redirecting the focus towards infrastructure spending might be China's alternative strategy for stimulating the economy, sidelining its reliance on consumption. This might be the spark of hope that these recent rumors of stimulus plans differ from the previous ones. However, this strategy is the ideal solution for companies like Alibaba and JD.com , which thrive on consumer spending.As analyzed by US-based company SpaceKnow,  paints an  of China's economic landscape. September saw a consistent bustle around Chinese shopping malls, continuing the trend observed in August. This active engagement is a robust indicator of renewed consumer confidence and a potential resurgence in consumer spending.However, not all sectors are experiencing an uptick. The construction sector remains tentative despite the positive retail and shopping activity indicators. The prolonged property downturn, evident from SpaceKnow's cement production data, continues to drag on the construction industry. While cement manufacturing showed signs of recovery since June, current levels still lag behind those in 2021.The fluctuating patterns of consumer behavior are also evident in mall activities. While the end of August witnessed a peak, there's been a subsequent slight decline. This could reflect changing consumer spending patterns or a seasonal adjustment at summer's end. Adding to this, Morning Consult's index indicates that while the consumer sentiment gains of the previous month were mostly retained in September, there was a slight dip.For Alibaba, these indicators hold significant implications. As a behemoth in China's e-commerce space, Alibaba's fortunes are . The positive trends in shopping mall activity suggest a favorable environment for retail giants. If these trends hold, Alibaba could witness a  in its e-commerce and retail sectors.Further indicators of China's economic health come from broader economic metrics. The World Economics' Sales Growth Index and the Emerging Industries PMI suggest an economic momentum building up. Predictions from Goldman Sachs Group also align with this narrative, indicating a potential expansion in output for September. Larry Hu of Macquarie Group further reinforces the optimism, identifying three significant tailwinds supporting China's economic recovery  a recent shift in fiscal policy, stabilization in exports, and adjustments in property strategies.However, the market isn't without its challenges. The lingering concerns over the property sector and the observed fluctuations in mall activity necessitate a strategic approach from Alibaba. The company must leverage positive economic indicators while staying agile to navigate potential market pitfalls.Although slower at 3  to 5 , China's growth rate is expected to surge in areas that align with Beijing's priorities, such as technology and green transition industries. The ongoing US-China geopolitical tensions, especially US sanctions limiting China's access to vital technologies, are prompting Beijing to invest more in electric vehicles, semiconductor chips, and computers.Mallari-D'Auria  that while Alibaba's valuations might not reach their pre-crackdown highs, they can still experience significant growth if consumer spending and confidence increase.In absolute valuation, several key  highlight a substantial undervaluation. The forward P E non-GAAP ratio, compared to the 5-year historical average, reveals an undervaluation of around  49 . Likewise, the forward enterprise value to sales ratio indicates an undervaluation of  65  relative to the historical average over the same period.Other essential metrics reinforce this trend  forward enterprise value to EBIT shows a significant undervaluation of  62 , forward price to sales indicates a sizable undervaluation of  63 , and forward price to book reflects an undervaluation of  57 , all in comparison to the 5-year historical averages.Conversely, when assessed in the context of relative valuation measures, the situation becomes more nuanced. The forward P E Non-GAAP, Enterprise Value to EBIT, and Price to Book ratios indicate  of  29 ,  19 , and  40 , respectively, compared to the sector median. In contrast, other metrics employed earlier indicate overvaluation.In 2023, the overall trend of hedge funds holding positions in BABA remained relatively stable. Not surprisingly, in Q2 2023, some hedge funds  their exposure to Chinese companies based on weak trends in the economic recovery in China and elevated geopolitical tensions. Among these adversities, Alibaba is at the center of the tornado.The number of hedge funds with  of their portfolio stakes in Alibaba was reduced by  during the quarter. At the same time, the number of hedge funds with Alibaba among their top 50 positions was reduced by 17  during the same period.Despite strong fundamentals, Alibaba's market valuation has experienced a significant downtrend and hit historic lows during the last 12 months. Interestingly, a few funds are rapidly accumulating Alibaba against the trend. Although Appaloosa, Third Point, and Segantii Capital have different investment strategies, they have common rationales for investing in the stock, while others jump ship.Appaloosa is known for its opportunistic investment approach, seeking undervalued assets and turning around distressed companies. It invested significantly in Alibaba, constituting  of its portfolio. Their average purchase price was  87.74 per share. In the second quarter of 2023, Appaloosa dramatically increased its shares by 4375.0 , equivalent to an addition of 4.38 million shares. They hold 4.48 million shares with a total valuation of  421 million.Third Point employs a value investing strategy, seeking companies with solid growth prospects and catalysts for positive change. Its portfolio allocation to Alibaba stands at around . Their shares were procured at an average price of  93.21. In Q2 2023, Third Point significantly expanded its stake by 122.4 , corresponding to a gain of 1.62 million shares. Presently, they retain 2.95 million shares, amounting to a total holding value of  277 million.Segantii Capital is known for quantitative strategies incorporating data-driven analysis and market anomalies. Its investment portfolio features a substantial  allocation to Alibaba. Their initial purchase of shares was made at an average price of  92.46. In the second quarter of 2023, Segantii Capital notably increased its stake by 243.08 , adding 1.32 million shares. Their current holdings comprise 1.87 million shares, with a total valuation of  156 million.During Q2 2023, Alibaba's stock hovered at a decade low and tested critical support near  75. Most importantly, Alibaba has entered a new accumulation phase during the quarter, serving as one of the ideal positions to build a long position. These funds' recent long positions drag their average buy price near the critical support level of  75, offering an optimum risk-reward ratio for these funds.China's stock market is navigating turbulent waters, influenced by many domestic and international factors, from a shaky property market to geopolitical upheavals. As a significant player in China's tech arena, Alibaba finds itself at the crossroads of these challenges, shaped by the broader macroeconomic environment and specific internal dynamics. Notwithstanding these complexities, recent signals from China's leadership bode well for a potentially more stable future.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

September CPI Report Preview: Focus Is On The 0.3% MOM Print,"The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the CPI inflation report for September on Thursday, October 12th. The consensus market expectations are for 1  the headline CPI inflation to decreaseThus, the disinflationary process is expected to continue, as the September 4.1  core CPI print would be the lowest inflation reading since the peak. However, that's still double the Fed's 2  inflation target, which means that the disinflationary process still has a long way to go.However, the expected drop in core CPI is due to the base effects. Specifically, the core CPI spiked by 0.6  in September ofMore importantly, the August 2022 spike is the last spike in the monthly inflation, so it will be more difficult to achieve a meaningful year-over-year disinflation going forward.Specifically, the 2  inflation target requires 0.2  mom readings, with a few 0.1  mom readings. The inflation readings in June and July of 2023 were very positive, with the 0.1-0.2  mom prints, which is consistent with the Fed's 2  target.However, the positive streak was broken in August with the 0.3  core CPI mom reading. The September monthly increase in core CPI is expected to extend the 0.3  streak, which, if it continues, produces a 3.6-3.8  annual inflation. Thus, the core CPI inflation is expected to stay well above 3  in the foreseeable future.The headline CPI inflation bottomed out at 3  in June, and it has been rising since, so the slight decrease from 3.7  to 3.6  would be a good sign. However, the headline CPI is significantly affected by the price of crude oil, and thus the geopolitical situation, which has significantly escalated.The Fed is using the core PCE inflation as the benchmark for the 2  inflation target. The Fed sees the core inflation at 3.7  in 2023, which is attainable. However, the Fed projects that core inflation would fall down to 2.6  in 2024, which is unlikely at this point - because that requires a consistent 0.2  mom inflation, and the core inflation is currently rising at 0.3  a month.In fact, the Atlanta Fed Inflation Nowcast predicts that core CPI could even rise be 0.4  mom in September, and again by 0.3  in October - so the 0.3  streak is likely to continue, which indicates that annual inflation is likely to say well above 3 , probably closer to 4 .The numbers above show that inflation is currently somewhere between 3.5  and 4.5 , and likely to stay in the 3-4  range in 2024 - strictly based on the month-over-month readings.However, we are in a high-inflationary environment, and the risk to the inflation outlook is to the upside. We could be in an environment similar to the 1970s, with successive inflationary spikes - and we could be facing another spike.First, there is a serious US labor shortage due to 1  demographics, as ageing baby boomers exit the workforce and reduce the labor force, 2  onshoring of some jobs due to deglobalization which increases the demand for labor. The labor shortage is causing the transfer of power from capital to labor, which could lead to higher wages, either voluntarily as companies scramble to find the workers, or forcefully due to strikes. Higher wages could lead to the proverbial wage-price inflationary spiral.Yes, the recent labor report showed only a 0.2  wage growth, but does not reflect the current environment. The outcome of the UAW strike is likely to provide a guide on what to expect for the overall wage growth, at least over the near term. If the Big 3 automakers agree on a 40  pay rise, this could trigger more strikes in other industries.Second, we are in the midst of a serious geopolitical situation which could result in sharply higher oil prices . These is an active Russia-Ukraine war, Saudi Arabia has joined the BRICS  and it's cutting the oil supplies, China is circling Taiwan, and now Hamas attacked Israel. If there is any proof that Iran participated in the Hamas attacks on Israel, the price of oil could potentially sharply spike and trigger a 1973-type inflationary shock. Oil dropped last week due to indications that Saudi Arabia could increase oil supplies due to US-brokered Israel-Saudi Arabia approachment, but that seems very unlikely now.Broadly, we are in a process of deglobalization, and these geopolitical events are likely to be more frequent - which increases the risk of inflationary spikes.The trade barriers are currently not discussed in the media, given the geopolitical situation. However, there is an actual US-China trade war, specifically in the high-tech industry, concentrated in the semiconductor sector for now. Trade barriers are also inflationary and likely to expand to other goods as the China-US decoupling advances. The escalation of the China-Taiwan situation could also cause an inflationary shock due to global shortages of chips.The September CPI report could indicate that the process of disinflation is continuing. However, given that monthly inflation numbers are back to the 0.3  level, the annual inflation in 2024 is likely to be well above the 3  level, which is well above the Fed's estimate of 2.6  for 2024.The market now expects that the Fed will pause the interest rate hiking campaign at 5.25-5.50  and cut in 2024 by 50bpt. Given these inflation predictions, the Fed could be forced to continue hiking, even in 2024.More importantly, the risk of another inflationary spike is very high, given the high-inflationary environment  labor shortage, geopolitical escalations, and trade barriers.As a result, long-term interest rates  are likely to continue to rise, gold  is likely to benefit as safe-heaven, while the stock market  is likely to sharply correct.My short-term  on S P500 is still Neutral given the seasonality, but my  for S P500 is a Sell with the 2800 level target, and my positioning trigger is the 4200 level breakdown.

"Scorpio Tankers Q2: A New Fleet, A Strong Strategy, A Promising Future"," , a leading provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the challenging market conditions, the company has demonstrated resilience and strategic financial management, which are key indicators of its potentialThe oil shipping market is influenced by a myriad of factors. These include global oil supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and broader economic conditions. Each of these elements plays a significant role in shaping the industry's landscape and, more specifically, the spot rates for oil tankers.Global oil supply is one of the key drivers of spot rates in the oil shipping market. Spot rates, the price for immediate charter of aCurrently, we are witnessing a period of relatively low oil inventories, which is contributing to an upward trend in spot rates. This situation is beneficial for oil tanker companies like Scorpio Tankers, as higher spot rates are leading to increased revenues and profitability.Another critical factor influencing the oil shipping market is the rate of fleet growth. The number of new ships being built and added to the global fleet can significantly impact the supply-demand dynamics in the industry. Currently, the industry is experiencing lower fleet growth levels relative to historical averages. This trend is primarily driven by high interest rates, which make the financing of new ship construction more expensive, and the fact that many shipyards are currently occupied with building other types of ships.This lack of new ship construction is leading to a tightening of supply in the oil shipping market. With fewer new ships entering the market, the existing fleet is in higher demand, which can further drive up spot rates. For well-leveraged oil tanker businesses like STNG, this situation presents an opportunity. With a modern and efficient fleet, they are well-positioned to capitalize on these market dynamics.STNG's financial results for  showed a net income of  132.4 million and an adjusted net income of  133.3 million. While these figures represent a decrease from Q2 2022, it's important to consider them in the broader context of the company's performance and the market conditions.The global oil shipping market is known for its volatility, with rates and revenues often fluctuating in response to changes in oil supply and demand, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. Despite these challenges, STNG has demonstrated a strong ability to navigate this complex landscape and generate increasing profits.Looking at the company's performance for the first half of 2023  H1 2023 , STNG reported a net income of  325.6 million and an adjusted net income of  328.9 million. These figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in 2022, indicating a strong upward trend in the company's profitability.Furthermore, STNG's ability to maintain profitability despite the decrease in net income in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022 demonstrates the company's resilience in the face of market volatility. It suggests that STNG has effective strategies in place to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities, positioning it well for future growth.Management has been actively managing its debt through a combination of lease repayments, debt reductions, and new financing agreements.In , STNG exercised purchase options on several vessels that were previously financed under various lease agreements. This resulted in a significant aggregate debt reduction of  300.2 million. In July 2023, the company continued this strategy by exercising purchase options on six more vessels, leading to an additional debt reduction of  143.6 million. STNG also gave notice to exercise purchase options on two more vessels, which is expected to result in a further debt reduction of  36.5 million by the end of Q3 2023. This shows a strategy of wanting to deleverage, especially away from more expensive lease agreements.In addition to these debt reduction strategies, STNG has also secured new financing agreements. The company executed or received commitments for three separate credit facilities totaling up to  1.2 billion. The first credit facility, executed in May 2023, was a  117.4 million facility from a European financial institution. The second, executed in July 2023, was a term loan and revolving credit facility from a group of financial institutions for up to  1.0 billion. Upon execution,  440.6 million was drawn from this facility to finance 21 of the company s unencumbered vessels. The remaining availability of this facility is expected to be drawn between Q3 2023 and the end of Q1 2024, primarily to repay and refinance more expensive lease financing. The third credit facility commitment, expected to close within Q3 2023, is a  94 million facility from DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, which will be used to finance four vessels.These strategies reflect STNG's proactive approach to managing its debt. By reducing its existing debt through the exercise of purchase options on leased vessels and securing new, lower-cost financing, STNG is effectively lowering its interest expenses and improving its financial position. This approach not only reduces the company's financial risk but also frees up resources that can be used to invest in its operations and growth initiatives.Scorpio's active share repurchase program is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future prospects and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. Share repurchase programs are often implemented when a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment. In their  Scorpios management outlined their thoughts on this explicitly stating  Share repurchases preferred over dividends when trading a significant discount to NAV.  During the most recent quarter, STNG purchased  283 million worth of shares at an average price of  48 per share. This move reduced the company's basic shares outstanding to 53 million from 56.8 million. Since the start of 2023, STNG has repurchased a substantial 8.6 million shares for a total of  421.1 million. This aggressive repurchase strategy underscores the company's belief in its intrinsic value and its commitment to capitalizing on what it perceives to be a market undervaluation of its shares. Over the past few months, STNG has been buying shares at prices ranging from  43 to  49 per share, demonstrating its commitment to this strategy and providing an idea of what they see is trading below NAV.Moreover, STNG still has  213 million remaining under its 2023 securities repurchase program. At current prices around  50 per share, this could potentially lead to the repurchase of an additional 4.26 million shares, or roughly 7.5  of the current shares outstanding. This further reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to an increase in earnings per share  EPS , all else being equal, and continue to boost the share price.It's also worth noting that STNG has preferred share repurchases over dividends when its shares are trading at a significant discount to Net Asset Value  NAV . This strategy suggests that the company is focused on long-term value creation rather than short-term yield.The age of a company's fleet is a significant factor in the maritime shipping industry, particularly for oil tankers. The typical useful lifetime of an oil tanker is between 20 to 30 years. After this period, the cost of maintaining and operating the vessel often outweighs the benefits, leading companies to retire and replace these older vessels.The global fleet's average age currently stands at 11.7 years. This figure is a crucial benchmark as it provides context for comparing individual companies' fleet ages. A fleet age significantly below this average suggests a company is operating with newer vessels, which often translates into operational and financial advantages.Scorpio Tankers Inc. stands out in this regard, boasting a modern fleet with a Deadweight Tonnage weighted average-year built of 2015. This figure is considerably newer than the global average and also surpasses some of Scorpio's direct competitors. For instance, International Seaways  and Nordic American Tankers  both have fleet average build years of 2011.Moreover, some of these competitors' fleets include ships that are reaching or have already reached their retirement age. This situation could lead to substantial capital expenditures in the near future as these companies may need to invest in new vessels to maintain their operational capacity.In contrast, Scorpio's oldest ship was built in 2012, meaning none of its vessels are approaching retirement age and many are debt-free and still have dozens of years of operation. This situation provides Scorpio with a significant advantage, as it can avoid the substantial costs associated with replacing older vessels for the foreseeable future.The benefits of a younger fleet extends beyond avoiding the costs of replacing older vessels. Younger fleets often have lower maintenance costs as newer vessels are less likely to require significant repairs. They also tend to be more fuel-efficient and are more likely to meet the latest safety and environmental regulations, which can lead to cost savings, operational efficiencies and help reduce political risk associated with older vessels. Scorpio Tankers' conservative dividend payout ratio of 10.42  demonstrates the company's strategic approach towards its long-term financial health. By retaining a significant percentage of its earnings, the company has more capital available for reinvestment into its operations and growth initiatives, and for reducing its debt load.A focus on debt reduction is particularly advantageous in the current economic climate, where rising interest rates are a concern for many businesses. By reducing its net debt, which has fallen from - 2,934 million in Q4 2021 to - 1,523 million currently, Scorpio Tankers is effectively lowering its future interest payments. This is significant because a substantial proportion of the company's debts are in the form of floating rate notes, the interest rates of which increase in tandem with market rates. A lower debt burden could even potentially lead to improved credit ratings and better loan terms in the future.Despite the expected drop in the Fleet TCE rate to  26,210 from  32,154 in Q2, the company's strategic financial management and modern fleet position it well to navigate these challenges. The company's focus on debt reduction and share buybacks over dividends suggests a long-term growth strategy that could yield significant returns for investors.The company's revenue is heavily tied to the global oil industry, and fluctuations in oil supply and demand can directly impact its profitability. This commodity price risk means that a drop in oil prices could reduce the demand for oil transportation, leading to lower revenues for Scorpio Tankers which is predicted by Scorpio in their latest earnings.Furthermore, the company's significant debt load, a portion of which is subject to floating interest rates, exposes it to interest rate risk. Should interest rates rise, Scorpio Tankers could see its interest expenses increase substantially, affecting its profitability and ability to service its debt. The company also faces regulatory risk as the shipping industry is subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. Changes in these regulations could necessitate major capital expenditures, potentially impacting Scorpio Tankers' financial performance. Operational risks, inherent to the shipping industry, include potential accidents, piracy, and environmental disasters, which could lead to significant costs, damage to the company's reputation, and potential legal liabilities. Finally, the cyclical nature of the shipping industry and its susceptibility to global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in seaborne trade patterns create market risk for Scorpio Tankers. Downturns in the shipping cycle could decrease demand for the company's services and put downward pressure on shipping rates, which could potentially impact revenues.With all of this information on dividends, , stock buy backs and overall strong market tail winds. How do we value STNG not only against the overall market but also against some of it's peers  From a dividend perspective, STNG is trading slightly higher than their 4Y average of 1.97  at an estimated FWD rate of 2.11 . It is the lowest among its peers, especially when you add in INSW's special dividends that don't show up in their yield in the TTM or Fwd. But they also have a low payout ratio, so as they finish up deleveraging, and as their stock rises to a point they feel matches their NAV they will likely begin to focus more on dividends and less on stock buybacks. I imagine that target NAV valuation is around the  52- 55 mark, and I expect them to continue to have large stock buybacks below that price. Delving into the Price to Earnings ratio, Scorpio Tankers stands out with a trailing twelve months  P E ratio of 3.27, the lowest among its peers. This can be attributed to its relatively high debt load, as evidenced by its EV Market Cap ratios. This ratio provides a snapshot of a company's financial situation, encompassing debt, cash, and market value. STNG's position towards the higher end of this industry ratio suggests its financial strength may be less robust compared to competitors like INSW and DHT.However, the future looks promising for STNG. I anticipate that as the company manages its debt more effectively and harnesses the industry-wide earnings momentum to boost its cash reserves, it will be better capitalized. This improved financial health should enable the company to provide increased returns to its investors and drive a non-linear return, especially if Spot Charter Rates stay elevated. In my view, Scorpio Tankers Inc. represents an attractive investment opportunity, especially in terms of its Net Asset Value. Given the high valuations of ships and STNG's relatively new fleet, I believe purchasing its shares at any price below  57 represents good value. If the price drops below  40, it would be a highly attractive investment.It's important to remember, though, that the market is cyclical and can be significantly influenced by geopolitical events, which can quickly shift price targets. While this price target isn't high relative to the current prices levels. I like to set low Price Targets that I believe afford optimum risk reward ratios rather than pie in the sky valuations that companies will struggle to grow in to. Scorpio Tankers Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, strategic debt management, active share repurchase program, modern fleet, and low fleet to EV valuation.

Gold Rebounding Again,"By Brien LundinGold is taking off to the upside again, as investors rush to the supposed  safe haven  of the yellow metal and the speculators quickly cover their short bets.Sometimes a good day for gold isThere s no good reason why anyone should buy gold when violence breaks out somewhere in the world, even when the event is as horrendous and ripe for escalation as the Hamas attack on Israel.The reason to own gold is because you believe the purchasing power of your currency is going to dive even more steeply, and that prospect simply doesn t apply in this case.So a gold rally in the wake of a geopolitical event is, usually, something to be avoided.I want to explore howEarly last year, as the Fed was readying for the initial rate hike in its campaign to stymie growing inflationary pressures, gold started to rally.Gold often, in fact , rises during Fed rate hikes. That seems counterintuitive, but the record is clear on this.For example, during gold s legendary bull run of the 1970s, gold continued to rise because inflation was rising more quickly than the Fed could raise rates. Finally, Volcker was able to kill off inflation by drastically hiking rates above 20 .Now, back to early last year.As you can see from the chart below, gold began to rise in January of last year as Fed rhetoric started to point toward an imminent rate hike campaign. Notably, the gold price ran for at least a couple of weeks before the potential of a Russian invasion emerged.Note that, after the gold price had risen for about a month, Russia actually did invade, and this briefly turbocharged the gold rally.Then, after World War III failed to emerge, the crisis moved from the front page and, as usual, the gold price declined after the initial panic subsided.In effect, this geopolitical crisis overwhelmed the drivers that were already in play. And the price downtrend it created as the initial fears passed led to an extenuated bear market as the Fed relentlessly raised rates over the next 18 months.Fast forward to today, and we see that gold was dramatically oversold as the crisis in Israel unfolded, and in fact seemed to have bottomed on Friday, the day before the attack began.Yes, there is the risk that the gold price will fall if and when the tensions in the Mideast subside or there is some resolution after Israel invades Gaza.But we re in a much different macroeconomic environment today, as compared against early 2022.Today, the U.S. economy is straining under the burden of what may be the harshest tightening cycle ever enacted by the Fed. Bankruptcies are surging, and the lagging effects of the rate hikes are yet to be felt.Even before the violence erupted, this rate hike cycle had essentially peaked. So whenever these troubles begin to fade away, we will either be in or approaching the downside of the cycle.These forces will be far too powerful for the easing of geopolitical tensions to overcome. This rally will not be killed off. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",4,2023-10-11T21:15:00.000-04:00
Cheniere Energy: A Strong Hedge Against Renewed Geopolitical Instability,"As new catalysts impact financial markets, some investors are likely looking for stocks that act as a potential hedge against crucial risk factors. Events in Israel over the past week are a significant risk factor that can impact financial markets ifThe LNG market has boomed over the past two years due to the Russia-Ukraine war, causing Europe to dramatically lower its imports from Russia while increasing its LNG imports from the . European natural gas prices were extremely high in 2022 butIn the past, I was  because the stock appeared to have downside risk due to falling LNG prices in Europe. Europe's natural gas and LNG prices have continued to slide since then, causing its quarterly EPS to decline from over  20 per share in Q1 to just  5.60 in Q2. As contracts continue to roll, its Q3 profits may be even lower due to lower LNG prices today, potentially making Cheniere Energy overvalued. That said, the stock rocketed up by around 8  in value over the past week in response to the geopolitical crisis. Accordingly, I believe it is a critical time to take a closer look at Cheniere's exposures and the global LNG market to determine if its outlook has improved or is merely reacting to fear and hype.The natural gas price in Europe primarily drives the US price of LNG because most US LNG flows to Europe today. Europe's LNG demand was extremely high in 2022 as it raced to secure new sources of its primary power source, leading to an extreme increase in its natural gas prices. US LNG prices also rose dramatically, up to  9 over the base price of natural gas. However, since its supplies have normalized, the spread between LNG and natural gas has normalized and is now back at  3.80, roughly its typical historical level. See belowEurope's natural gas price has moderated tremendously from last year's level as fears of a shortage have declined. Warm winter weather last year and slower economic growth in Europe benefited the market by pushing demand lower. Europe's natural gas price is currently  roughly  16 MMBTU. While Europe's natural gas price is much lower than it was, being briefly over  300 MWH, it has doubled since summer when it was just    25 MWH. Crucially, Europe's natural gas price soared by 40  this week due to concerns regarding Middle Eastern natural gas supplies, as Europe is more dependent on the Middle East today after losing Russian sources.Still, Europe's natural gas storage level is extremely high today, pushing up against its capacity level. Europe has more natural gas today than at any point over the past five years and is significantly above the average seasonal level. See belowEurope is going into withdrawal season in a robust position. European weather forecasts also  of warmer weather,  lowering demand throughout the season. So, aside from geopolitical risks to Europe's natural gas supply, the continent's demand for US LNG should not be exceptionally high today. One bullish factor not particularly geopolitical is the increasing demand for LNG from  countries actively looking to move away from coal. As Asian demand continues to grow, while Europe may not see a return in Russian gas flows any time soon, there is reason to believe US LNG export prices will remain elevated, or at least not decline significantly. Additionally,  may soon go on strike amid an increase in global labor issues, potentially limiting some future LNG supply worldwide.That said, multiple geopolitical pressures could increase US LNG export prices. For one, the undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia is believed to have been deliberately  planning to  respond  if a culprit is found. This potential attack occurred one year after the initial Nord Stream 1  after Finland joined NATO. Further, the second-largest European LNG provider is Qatar, which recently signed long-term LNG export contracts with European countries. Those deals quickly became scrutinized because Qatar is widely seen as a  leaders.Of course, there are also direct pressures created by conflict. Israel had to half its , reducing LNG supplies going toward Egypt, indirectly creating slight pressure on the European market. The conflict also occurs relative to the Suez Canal, through which much . Accordingly, a potential escalation that causes the inclusion of other Middle Eastern countries would undoubtedly threaten a significant portion of Europe's LNG supplies.These issues are not isolated to East Europe and the Middle East but include Central Asia. While the issue has not made as much headlines,  an offensive into contested territories from Armenia. Azerbaijan is a critical Russian-alternative natural gas producer for  call on the EU to cut imports from the country as it had with Russia. However, that is generally unlikely, as Armenia is arguably tied to Iran and Russia, while Azerbaijan is close to Turkey. Regardless, I believe any conflict in this key gas-producing region will influence natural gas prices, mainly because it is the region between Russia and the Middle East.As the situation is today, I would not state that Europe's demand for US LNG will rise due to renewed conflict in gas-producing areas. That said, investors must be aware that that may occur,  pushing natural gas and LNG prices in Europe back into 2022 levels. Further, from a broader perspective, we can see clearly that Europe's dependence on natural gas from virtually all eastward directions is unstable. Key reasons include higher geopolitical instability in East Europe, central Asia, and the Middle East. Further, as seen in pipeline attacks, natural gas lines are a massive target in these conflicts  thus, Europe will likely look to expand its US LNG imports to ensure energy stability.The core issue in valuing Cheniere is accounting for the  binary option  in the European natural gas market. The East Asia natural gas market, to which the company currently sells  of its product, is expected to see steady demand growth for LNG over the coming years. Historically, Cheniere sells more gas to Asia than Europe, so this trend secures the company's long-term potential, given  are completed. However, should Middle Eastern, Central Asian, and Eastern European conflicts continue to grow, a significant portion of Europe's  post-Russia  natural gas resources could be under fire.In my view, without geopolitical risk escalation, we will most likely see US LNG export prices continue to compress toward the breakeven level for Cheniere. Historically, the company has had positive profits and operating cash-flows when the US LNG export price is above around  8 MMBTU, or around  4 to  5 above the Henry Hub spot price. Of course, Cheniere's derivatives and long-term contracts can skew that factor a bit, but I believe that the company's Q3 income will likely be near or below zero due to compression in commodity prices, with LNG export price being at  6.60 MMBTU or  3.80 above spot.Cheniere's current Q3 EPS outlook is  2.57, with its EPS expected to be around that  2.50- 3.00 range over the coming years, giving it an annualized profit outlook of  11 per year. Importantly, its EPS outlook remains around that . While I believe its Q3 EPS may be a bit lower than the consensus estimate, I think that is a reasonable long-term outlook given it should earn a consistent EPS in light of growing Asian demand. That target gives the company a year-ahead  P E  ratio of  15.9X, a very high figure for a cyclically exposed energy company. Considering the firm is also working on various capital-intensive projects and is prone to commodity price risk, I believe its  fair value   P E  is closer to 9X, in line with the Thus, without an improvement in its fundamentals, I believe the stock is overvalued by around 75 , meaning it would need to decline by  44  to reach its fair value, given no improvement in its EPS outlook. The company's income is not expected to ever increase beyond its current level, so there is essentially no good reason to buy the stock today unless one firmly believes that geopolitical pressures will permanently increase US LNG export prices.It is challenging to value Cheniere because it will likely go down one of two distinct paths and is unlikely to fall anywhere between that range. If European natural gas supplies from its eastern regions remain unthreatened, Cheniere should lose value as its  P E  ratio falls toward the energy sectors. This could push the stock lower by over 50  and mirrors my bearish outlook from earlier this year.However, Cheniere would be undervalued if the global LNG market fell under pressure due to the many geopolitical catalysts facing natural gas-producing areas today. Following the height of the 2022 run-up in LNG prices, Cheniere earned a quarterly EPS of  17.50  the average of the recent two peak quarters , or  70 annualized. That occurred while European natural gas import prices soared as it raced to restore power supplies. If such a high EPS level were sustained due to prolonged war anywhere between Russia and Qatar, then Cheniere would likely be worth upwards of  350 or more, or 5X that annual EPS target.In my view, in one to two years from today, Cheniere will likely be trading either around that  300  range or lower, around  100, depending on what happens next in the LNG market. Personally, not being privy to all of the many geopolitical issues across central Eurasia, I have no strong bias on the potential for continued escalations. However, I believe the outcome is likely binary, meaning  LNG should move dramatically from its current value in either direction.Investors looking to hedge against this risk, which would be bearish for most other stocks, may find hedge potential in LNG. Personally, I do not consider that to be profiting from bad news, as US investment into Cheniere is likely critical for securing Europe's energy market stability. More speculative investors could find value in a straddle option trade on  LNG, betting it will move dramatically in either direction. LNG's implied volatility is , which, though not low, is lower than my expected volatility of  50  in either direction. The critical issue with that trade is that it would need to be done on long-term options at least six months out, which are likely not liquid enough for more prominent positions. Still, personally, I would not buy or sell LNG today. Still, I expect it to face significant volatility, with upside potential depending primarily on geopolitical events amongst natural gas producers and transit lanes.

The company is heavily playing up its strategic importance to Western supply chains in order to gain government support and receive government money. You can read the most recent updatesIntel Foundry Services  IFS  is Intel's business unit that will fabricate semiconductors for outside firms. This is a shift in direction from Intel's primarily internal foundry operations and it remains to be seen how effectively Intel will be able to compete in this area. The foundry business is notoriously capital-intensive and there is a lot of collaboration that goes on between the foundry and its design customers. Intel lacks the robust testing packaging manufacturing infrastructure that exists in Taiwan, and economies of scale will be difficult to come by. The company is a competitor to many firms that are potential customers of their foundry division, which may keep them from utilizing IFS because they don't want to fund a competitor.Intel is currently unprofitable on an operating basis and is experiencing a continued decline in revenue. This is generally a recipe for disaster, but due to the cyclical nature of the industry, some investors are willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. We view the financial situation as being dismal, especially given how much investment will be required for them to catch up in design and manufacturing  building out IFS.The company is facing massive capex requirements tied to its foundry buildout, with net capex increasing dramatically year over year. They have needed to increase their debt to fund these expenditures as their operating cash flows have declined considerably. Absent a meaningful turnaround in operating cash flow, the company will likely need to borrow even more money over the next couple of years. This is an unattractive prospect given where interest rates are at the moment.The bull case surrounding Intel relies on two things going at least partially right. The first is the company needs to improve its competitiveness on the logic front. NVIDIA  is currently demolishing the competition but there is an appetite for an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs in HPC, and Intel can meet the market need if they play their cards right. This will take not only time but also patience from the company.The second thing that needs to go right is Intel needs to create and expand a financially viable foundry operation, which is no easy task given their competition in TSMC . While some investors may doubt Intel's IFS adventure, we believe that the move is prudent and helps to future-proof the company. There is the potential for the x86 ecosystem to continue to lose popularity and for GPUs and CPUs to be replaced by ASICs SOCs for HPC applications. Intel's customers may opt to design their own chips instead of purchasing from Intel. This would be devastating for the company unless they can make money from fabricating the chips of their former customers. The foundry business is not an easy one, but it is one that Intel can succeed in over the long term. The battle will be long and arduous, and we believe that most investors don't truly grasp how tough it will be. The financial rewards will likely be far out in the future even if IFS and IDM 2.0 are a success. The stock could have a prolonged period of stagnation as investors who expected a quick turnaround throw in the towel and the prolonged risk factors keep a lid on investor appetite.Intel is set to report its Q3 earnings on October 26. Some key metrics to watch out for are their profitability and cash flow. If these metrics continue to worsen it may signal that the turnaround will take even longer than expected. It could also signal that Intel may become financially challenged and need to take on more debt. On the conference call, investors should listen for progress on design and manufacturing. Bullish investors would like Intel to communicate that they have a pipeline of competitive designs and that they are taking the right steps to create useful foundry capacity. These things are the key to the fundamental thesis, and if they still appear to be behind in these areas then investors should discount their valuation for the company. It will be useful to compare the results from Intel against companies such as AMD and Nvidia to get a gauge of how far behind Intel is, and how much of their weakness is macro-related versus how much weakness is firm-specific.Intel has been on a nice run in 2023, with the stock returning nearly 40 . Going forward the company will need to execute well on IFS and improve its competitiveness in logic. If they can achieve this, the stock's upward momentum appears likely to continue.Intel is currently free cash flow negative and has a forward PE ratio of nearly 57. This is a high price to pay for a company that is experiencing a dramatic decline in revenue and profitability while also facing increasing capex requirements.Intel isn't the only company in the semiconductor industry experiencing a decline in revenue. That being said, Intel has faced growing problems within its business for several years now. For that reason, investors are generally more skeptical of Intel re-accelerating revenue growth than for companies such as AMD  or TSMC.Despite the significant weakness in their business Intel is trading at the highest forward PE of any of the companies listed on the chart. This seems highly optimistic and signals that investors may be looking for a quicker turnaround from Intel than is realistically possible. It seems reasonable to expect Intel to trade at a valuation somewhere between TSMC and AMD, which at the moment would result in a much lower share price.Intel has taken on additional debt to fund its foundry capacity buildout. Their balance sheet is still in good shape but a lot relies on how well IFS goes and how efficient their capex is going forward.The fundamental thesis for Intel revolves around the company's ability to right the ship and fix its operations. We believe that the current valuation is not compelling and would wait for the company to make considerable progress before investing. Investors don't have to capture 100  of the move to make money and there is a lot to be said for avoiding turnaround stories until they actually make the turnaround.Some risks to the bullish thesis are the potential for their design units to fall behind the competition and for their semiconductor sales to remain in a relative slump due to a tough macro environment.While some investors view an adverse geopolitical event involving Taiwan as being good for Intel, the company relies heavily on Taiwan for part of its supply chain and China is a large end market. For these reasons, the net effect of a China Taiwan conflict would likely be very negative for Intel.The major risk to the bearish thesis is the potential for Intel to execute on its ambitious design and manufacturing goals. This would demonstrate the success of IDM 2.0 and allow Intel to not only make money from chip design but also expand into the foundry business. This would subsequently increase their earnings while helping to de-risk the business. Intel's design and manufacturing goals are operationally challenging and we have our doubts, but they are certainly within the realm of possibility.We view the overall risk reward as being unattractive at this time. That being said, Intel is a company that is worth having on an investor's watchlist.Intel is a company that attracts many value and contrarian investors. Despite how tempting the investment may seem, we believe that staying on the sidelines is the best course of action. The company has a lot to prove and investors don't lose a dime by waiting for the fundamental picture to improve. If they can return to operating profitability  show signs of success in design and IFS we would turn more bullish on the company. For now, we will watch and wait.Thanks for taking the time to read this articleToday's question is  Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Enterprise Products Partners: Stability At A Fair Price,"  is a North American company that offers midstream energy services for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals. They have an extensive infrastructure with over 50,000 miles of pipelines, 260 million barrels of storageIn early August Enterprise Products Partners reported adjusted 2Q23 net income of  1.283 billion, a decrease from the previous year, with .This decline was due to lower prices for various energy products and hedging losses, despite increased natural gas and NGL volumes. Net revenue fell by 34 , and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 10 , both below consensus estimates.But on the other hand, the company's operating costs were significantly reduced due to cost-reduction initiatives. The gross operatingIn February 2022, Enterprise Products Partners acquired Navitas Midstream Partners for  3.25 billion in cash, a move seen positively as it provided EPD with a foothold in the productive Midland basin, offering natural gas gathering, treatment, and processing services along with substantial processing capacity., in Q2 EPD completed several major growth projectsCurrently, EPD holds a leading position in the natural gas and NGL value chain within some of the largest-producing basins in the United States. They have  4.0 billion worth of growth projects in the pipeline, expected to come into operation in the coming years, while also continuing to invest in the development of shale plays.The increased production of hydrocarbons from shale basins and unconventional drilling has created structural cost advantages for petrochemical production in the U.S. This, in turn, has driven greater demand for NGLs from the petrochemical industry. I think this favorable market dynamic should enhance earnings visibility for EPD and support growth in their distributions, which have been growing for the past 25 years.In his August report from a proprietary source, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky highlighted that EPD continues to maintain the most robust DCF coverage ratio among the MLPs covered by Argus.However, using another MLP coverage list  from BofA , I cannot say that EPD has an outstanding dividend yieldThe same cannot be said about the FCF yield - 7.61  looks solid in absolute terms, of course, but it is not an outstanding result compared to other MLPsOn the other hand, EPD is qualitatively different from other companies in terms of its credit risk - the company's debt ratio is far below the industry averageEPD's leverage profile looks exceptionally strong, with 97  of debt being fixed-rate, consolidated liquidity of approximately  4 billion, and a net leverage ratio within their target range of 2.75x to 3.25x.Overall, I like EPD. Thanks to its healthy balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio below the industry average, the company will most likely continue to perform well in any market environment and continue to pay good  if not the best in the industry  distributions. Argus analysts expect EPD to benefit from the continued recovery in gathering and processing  G P  volumes, new growth projects, and the recent acquisition of Navitas Midstream Partners, and I agree with them here.As you have already seen above, EPD stock cannot be called undervalued in terms of FCF yield compared to its closest peers  Despite the rather high absolute value of this ratio, it is not outstanding. According to another valuation multiple - the forward EV EBITDA - EPD looks even looks overvaluedBut perhaps EPD will have higher EBITDA growth next year to justify such a high comparative multiple. Let's take a lookAnalysts' consensus expects EPD's EBITDA to be 8.9  above the current TTM next year - just 0.75  above the sample average. At the same time, EPD's FWD EV EBITDA figure is 4.9  above the peer group average.Valuation is a subjective thing. Sometimes it's completely incomprehensible why a stock continues to outgrow most others while its valuation has a comparative premium.In the case of EPD, however, it seems to me that the premium is primarily explained by a  a more stable leverage profile and b  a fairly reliable history of rising DCF figures, which is what all income seekers want.So, to me personally, EPD looks like a high-quality, fairly valued income stock that should feel comfortable in an investor's portfolio in any weather. However, Argus' Bill Seleski believes EPD is actually somewhat undervalued compared to its major peers, as its P E ratio is still quite low given its 5-year earnings per share growthOf course, investing in EPD stock at its current price level presents a range of risks that should be carefully considered. First of all, the company's fortunes are closely tied to the volatile energy market, subject to fluctuations in oil and gas prices that can impact revenues. Regulatory and environmental risks, including evolving regulations and unforeseen environmental incidents, pose potential challenges. Also, EPD's distributable cash flow, the basis for its distributions to investors, can be sensitive to market variables  even if it wasn't the case in the past , while competition, geopolitical events, technological shifts, and changing investor preferences for sustainable investments further underscore the complexity and uncertainties involved in investing in the energy sector.However, despite all these risks, to which is added the risk of slight overvaluation according to some valuation metrics, it seems to me that EPD is now trading fairly, distributing quite a bit of money to its shareholders. The complex energy landscape and wars in various regions of the world play into the hands of EPD and its peers, making their high yields even more desirable in the modern age of uncertainty. That's why I rate the stock a  Hold  this time, which I would consider a  Buy  if I saw it undervalued relative to other companies in the industry.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Archer-Daniels-Midland: We Are Again Right On Target, Slowdown Is Part Of Normalization","We  Archer-Daniel-Midland at  89.41 in February this year with a  Sell  rating, and it subsequently realized an 18  decline to  72.62 by June. At that point, we changed our rating to  Hold , Archer-Daniel-Midland had just released a day ago. The company's EPS of  1.63 has beaten the expectationAs we previously predicted, this slowdown in revenue and operating profits came as no surprise. The company it was coming down from a  very strong  result of last year. The volume from Ag Services in this quarter was high, but mostly driven by the record crop from Brazil. We also mentioned this in June. With its  to the commodity market, which trending back to the historical norm subsiding from the effect of the Russian-Ukraine war, this quarterly result in fact shouldn't be seen as a  slowdown  but a return to normalcy.Its adjusted segment operating profits for the latest quarter have gotten back to where it was in Q3 2022, mostly due to the decline in the Ag Services and Oilseeds  A O  segment. This segment's Q3 profits declined by about 20  compared to Q3 2022, due to the fact that it has the most direct impact from the commodity prices normalization as grain processing and crushing dominate its profits. However, this decline was compensated by the expansion of its Carbohydrate Solutions  CS  segment, which grew 35-40  QoQ and YoY. As the company noted in , it has not only achieved higher profit growth for this segment but also delivered carbon reduction in its , where its North American headquarters is located and it holds the single largest location and employee base for the company. This is when the CS segment's revenue has declined YoY both quarterly and YTD by almost 9-14 .To see how ADM has been able to achieve this, look no further than its efforts throughout this year. Most of the company's newest efforts were made in sustainable farming and production through alternative protein sources and carbon reduction. Its  continued to expand from 2 million acres to a target of 4 million acres in 2025 to cover more farmers in the States and Canada. It has  important factors in building out an alternative protein ecosystem and made north of  30 million  to develop probiotics production, which aims at boosting its smallest segment, the Nutrition segment's revenue from currently just under  500 million to  2 billion in 10 years. These efforts that used to be seen as alternatives have indeed driven the newest profit margin for it.To avoid being the function of commodity market swings, ADM not only needs to continue these efforts for the smaller segments but also ramp up their impact in its largest segment, the Ag Services and Oilseeds. As a starter, the company has tried to scale up growing low-carbon-intensity crops for biofuel generation in partnership with Syngenta Group. This could eventually deliver higher margins with a lower cost sustainably.As we continue building out the investment thesis based on not only ADM's specific development but also the influence of the commodity markets, we see that from here on, falling grain PPI could bring down another 30-40  of the company's earnings, although with a slim chance of staying at or around current profitability.For its free cash flow, we expect lower Grain and Oilseed Milling PPI could bring out even larger volatility both on the upside and the downside. The swing could widen to more than  1 billion from quarter to quarter. For the grain markets, the latest development isn't just about weather but also geopolitical events. The uncertainty isn't just about potential supply constraints but also shocks to demand.The initiatives ADM undertook this year to upgrade its network and production to aim at carbon reduction and expansion of alternative food sources sustainably have become more than just alternatives. The need to stabilize its revenue and earnings from the impacts of commodity markets will continue to call for more value-added projects in its growth. We see this as a great start, although for the near term, the effect will not be enough yet.Currently, we maintained our previous fair valuation, which was described initially in  in January, and reiterated in  in June. In the initial coverage, we already predicted there would be a slowdown of growth in 2023 in our base case. We would only be bullish if the volatility of its cash flow had been smoothed out, and that hasn't happened so far. We originally expected a YoY decline of 30  in its free cash flow in our base case, but so far this retracement is set to decline more than that. Q4 is usually the seasonally weak quarter for ADM. So we don't expect large upside surprises from here on till the end of the year. In the chart below you will find our initial fair valuation, which was assessed ten months ago. Contrasted with this, we are now more inclined toward between the base case and the bearish case.What we want to stress is the current quarterly result is a reflection of normalization instead of a sudden slowdown. Investors should not expect ADM to climb back to previous highs any time soon. As  the summer highs were not going to sustain, for the investors who have bought in the summer, it will probably take a while to get back to that level. Our expectation is ADM's stock price will stay at or below its current levels into early next year. It is still a hold for us right now.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

My View On Wall Street: I Assess The Pros And Cons,"The S P 500 has declined about 9.5  since I last published the Equity Market PROs and CONs report on July 28th. At the end of July, investors were flying high as the major indices had put in an impressiveWe closed out another losing month in September and set sail into Q4, and now we'll revisit the PROs and CONS that are on the scene today. In this report, the  12-8 - with 2 issues that I consider Neutral.The last two months of trading in the market have been difficult for the BULLS. The major averages peaked in late July early August and have been trending lower everInvestor sentiment took forever to turn bullish this year. ironically it turned earlier this summer just in time for equities to peak and pull back in August and September. This typical contrarian indicator worked again. Now, it's back to bearish for investors. The Bespoke Investor Sentiment Composite is negative once again and CNN's Fear   Greed Index is registering  Fear  right now. Since the sentiment is contrarian, excess bearishness is considered Bullish.Seasonality was a 'Con' in my last PROs and CONs report, and unfortunately for the BULLS, it didn't disappoint. August and September weakness for equities held to form this year, but now seasonality moves back into the 'PRO' column as Q4 is typically the best time of year for stocks. As shown below in the snapshot from the Bespoke Seasonality Tool, the upcoming 3-month period has been the very best 3-month period of the year for stocks over the last ten years.The 100th percentile for gains is certainly bullish.Core inflation has come down and is showing signs of stability. Supercore inflation is deflating slower but still making progress. While inflation isn't DEAD, the stock market by its price action after the last report believes the peak is definitely in and is ready to deal with current readings for a while longer.Initial jobless claims have steadied while employment growth has slowed. Prime-age employment remains just shy of a record-high share of the population. While job openings have declined  indicating weaker labor demand , the level remains very high compared to historical readings.Consumers still have lots of cash on their balance sheets, even relative to much stronger consumer spending relative to pre-pandemic. While savings rates are low, consumer borrowing is well-covered by income and households can keep spending at a healthy  if slowly moderating  pace for some time. When consumers have jobs they will continue to spend. In addition, Corporations are not about to give up the employees they had a hard time acquiring after the pandemic. That keeps the labor situation  tight .A range of manufacturing industries are rapidly adding factory capacity in response to recent industrial policy  CHIPS, BIL, IRA . Construction on factories is running north of  200bn per year with hundreds of billions more in spending to come. At the same time, the housing market is still short of inventory and will be for years to come. Finally, infrastructure spending has accelerated sharply thanks to fiscal policy and is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a double-edged sword. Good news for select sectors of the economy but it also keeps  Debt  and  Inflation  elevated.During the 2022 bear market, rolling 12-month forward earnings estimates fell 6.5  from peak to trough. Since then, they have recovered almost the entire decline. Of course, analysts tend to lag the market, and estimates only started getting cut well after the 2022 bear market was underway. Still, underlying earnings are in good shape. Recent results have also started to turn more positive. The EPS beat rate fell from its historic post-COVID surge, but over the last few months has ramped back up again. A similar, more modest recovery in guidance raise rates is also taking place.The equity market thrives on  themes , and  AI  has been the market's theme in a big way for most of this year. There's a good chance this becomes a  rather than  wave. Over the long term that is bullish for equities. Every week there seems to be some new technology in the AI space introduced, and search interest for AI topics remains elevated and trending higher.The only question is when will real money hit the bottom line.Outside of the mega-caps in the S P 500, it has been a flat year for the market. So even though the cap-weighted S P 500 is still showing a 10  YTD gain, things aren't nearly as rosy underneath the surface. The median S P 500 stock is flat, while the median stock in the small-cap Russell 2000 is solidly in the red at -7 . That doesn't look like the  new  BULL market backdrop that the majority says it is. As the week ended I now see ALL of the indices barely above their Long term trendlines. This equity  market   is living on the edge.Main Street media always talk about the 2-year 10-year Treasury Yield curve. The Fed also watches another metric. The 3-month 10-year Treasury yield curve has now been inverted for a record 222 consecutive trading days. The curve reached its maximum point of inversion in early May at 183 basis points and has steepened to its current level of -75. Given that it has been nearly a year since the curve first inverted and the economy still appears to be steady, there's a growing consensus that the current signal has been a false alarm.But don't dismiss the yield curve too quickly. As shown in the table below, historically, the average number of days between when the yield curve first inverts to the start of a recession is 589 days.From the time the yield curve bottoms to the start of a recession, the average is 395 days. Based on these two figures, a recession in the second half of 2024 would fit right within the averages.The Leading Economic Indicators index published by the Conference Board takes a range of different economic and financial market data points into account and creates a single index that tends to deteriorate before recessions and recover before activity bottoms. As shown in the chart,  In other words, if we don't see a recession following this run of data, it will be an unprecedented result.The Leading Indicators have fallen for 18 consecutive months. Only two other periods have seen longer streaks of decline  the mid-1970s recession and the global financial crisis.There is a consensus view that the FOMC is near its terminal rate or close to it. However, the message we heard this week from Chair Powell is  It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That too is pretty scary. The Fed is in a box and along with the market is facing a lose-lose situation.Home prices have surged thanks to a mismatch between supply and demand. High mortgage rates mean existing homeowners are unwilling to surrender extremely low rates, further restricting supply.Those high mortgage rates also damage affordability driven by high prices. When combined, affordability has hit the worst levels since the 1980s, with the average non-managerial worker needing to pay the equivalent of 86.7 hours of wages to cover the mortgage payment for the median existing home assuming 5  down. And down payments are increasingly difficult to save up given high prices.The shock to the banking system delivered late last year and early this year has largely been digested by the market. However, leading indicators of bank credit suggest a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank lending over the next year.The SLOOS  Senior Loan Officer Outlook Survey  asks lenders whether they are seeing higher or lower demand for credit, as well as whether they are raising or lowering the standards they underwrite to. As shown in the chart below, the reported demand for credit and the reported credit standards suggest that commercial   industrial  C I  loan growth is set to slow dramatically.Declining credit outstanding would only do bad things for the economic backdrop.The terrorist attack in Israel highlights another U.S. policy error. From a financial point of view that brings the country into another conflict. The US  debt  issue was highlighted in last week's MACRO update. It appears the US is now supporting two wars. Ukraine, and now Israel along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the  since WWII. This country has never been more stretched and vulnerable, and at some point, this will have a serious impact on the MACRO economic scene. At some point, the market sniffs this MACRO issue as the serious threat that it is.Two years ago, we could look at an S P 500 P E ratio in the high teens, or even 20, and say that at least interest rates were low. Bespoke Investment group  On a trailing basis, the S P 500 trades for 20.6 times earnings, and while that is far from a record, it ranks in the 83rd percentile relative to all other readings in the post-WWII era. Comparing the earnings yield of the S P 500  inverse of the P E ratio  to the yield on the 10-year US Treasury, the current spread of 0.25 percentage points is the lowest since 2010.While 'the market' is expensive, the key driver of the valuation stems from the largest stocks in the index. As shown below, the 10-largest stocks in the index, which account for 32  of the S P 500, trade for a median of 31.7 times earnings with four stocks trading for over 65 times earnings.Meanwhile, the median multiple of the remaining 490 stocks is  20 times trailing earnings. That was OK when interest rates were zero, but at 5  we are in a different backdrop that typically takes PE ratios down.This  CON  has been on the list since the beginning of the year, yet stocks have risen. As mentioned earlier, the S P 500's earnings yield relative to Treasury yields and real rates is at its lowest levels in decades, meaning stocks are less attractive relative to risk-free rates. The S P 500's dividend yield was more than 100 basis points higher than the 2-year Treasury yield two years ago,  There is an alternative to stocks again. As uncertainty ramps higher, investors will reach for risk-free yield. All of that cash that many analysts and BULLS say is on the sidelines and will go into stocks, seems more like a  Hope  trade. Those analysts are living in the past.While inflation readings have come down dramatically over the last year, the June Year over-year reading of 2.9  might be as good as it gets in the near term. Huge month-over-month increases in CPI in early 2022 are now removed from the y y CPI tally, which will make it harder for CPI to continue lower in the coming months unless we see outright deflation which is not currently projected. Investors expecting the y y CPI number to continue lower may be surprised to see it keep ticking higher up towards 3.5 -4  through year-end and beyond. The latest PCE report confirms that inflation is still hanging on, and any further progress will be SLOW.From the October 2022 peak through the July 14th bottom, the broad trade-weighted dollar fell 8.4 . Over the last three months, it has risen close to 4 . Since 1973, larger-than-typical dollar rallies have led to lower-than-typical S P 500 returns. As long as the dollar is strong, it's doubtful the stock market will take off in a big way. Of course, the inverse statement is also true  a reversal lower in the dollar would set up a positive backdrop.The bull market's uptrend from the October 2022 low has been celebrated, but as I have continually pointed out the near-term technicals do not look good. They still have a lot to prove before I can BUY into the New BULL market scene.We've seen  since the market made its high for the year on the last day of July. For this negative technical action to turn, we'll need indices to break above their early September highsThe results of all five of the regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys for September were released. Altogether, regional Fed surveys have shown that manufacturing activity improved slightly in September. The PRO crowd will claim that we have seen the bottom and improvement is on its way.The folks that present the Bearish argument say  Show me . They point out that after two years of declines, the net readings are still in contraction territory. The fact that stocks hit such extreme oversold levels towards the end of September - a notoriously weak time of year for stocks - is a 'PRO' in the minds of an optimist, as there is a tendency for prices to revert when they get this overdone.Furthermore, Treasury yields, the dollar, and oil are all at extremes to the upside at the same time. It doesn't take much for a big reversal to occur when things get this one-sided. That is true BUT  extreme  conditions can last for longer than an investor wants to believe.  Hoping  for a change in direction is a bad strategy.This time around there are some distinct changes on the list. In July the standout on the PRO side was the trend reversal resulting in a BULL market backdrop that I said trumped just about all of the negatives. This time around we see that has changed again as many indices and the DJIA along with the Russell 2000 are back in a BEAR backdrop.On the CON side, the T.A.R.A. argument is still there and it has started to impact the market, especially when uncertainty ramps up. There is plenty of cash on the sidelines, but probabilities suggest a lot of that cash won't make it into equities due to the  risk-free  alternatives. This is one of the reasons I do not see another rip-roaring BULL market leg to new all-time highs on the horizon. The Earnings forecast is the one issue to watch, and  It is a fluid situation that can change quickly. At the end of the day that will control what happens in the very near term. After I put the report together, I came away with the feeling that the PROs are centered around the near-term prospects, while many of the CONs speak to the MACRO view.Last week's selling pressure bled over to Monday's  open  with the S P establishing a new intraday low during this  correction . However, buyers emerged and the S P rebounded to post a modest seven-point loss. The price action was typical for a market that is trying to find a bottom.

Rather, the issue is that many skilled workers of the national oil company have fled the country amid record-setting inflation and political chaos. Likewise, following the past decade's nationalization confiscation of energy assets owned by some international companies, it is difficult to imagine them wanting to return.Therefore, it is doubtful that any  supply  from this dictatorship will have any impact on the global energy scene.

UiPath: Operating Loss May Turn Into Operating Profit In A Year,"UiPath  stock price decreased after it started a rally due to its better-than-expected Q2 FY 2024 financial  in September. In the past few weeks, UiPath  a few announcements about its new partnerships a recent Gartner indicates, implying that there are beneficial opportunities out there for the companies that are providing AI-powered automation. However. So, it is all about how well UiPath can market its AI-powered automation products and services, and how much its platform can help companies to operate more efficiently.In the AI-powered automation market, there are still some serious deficiencies such as the lack of end-to-end platforms, challenges in linking AI capabilities to real-world execution, and immature user-interface capabilities. hat its platform is designed in a way to solve these challenges, by providing stable and robust automation. PATH is one of the pioneers in providing end-to-end platforms which from my perspective, can be one of the most important things for customers that are seeking AI-powered automation to increase their productivity. Companies want to use AI-powered automation services to decrease their operating expenses and increase the processing of their task. AI platforms that are not end-to-end may even increase the complexity of the operations. Leveraging AI, ML, and NLP, PATH has developed an end-to-end platform that can help customers simplify their operations without requiring significant changes in their technology infrastructure.Figure 1 shows that from FY 2019 to FY 2023  as of 31 January , PATH s customer base grew in a significant way, supporting the company s claim about the functionality of its platform. As of 31 January 2023, PATH had 10800 customers, up 6.9  YoY  excluding non-paying partners and users of free trial subscriptions . Other than the fact that PATH has been able to prove the functionality of its AI-powered automation platform to customers, answering parts of the demand for AI automation from different clients in different industries, we should consider the fact that PATH s customer base is not growing as fast as it was growing 2-3 years ago. However, even with the current operating results, I believe we are going to see a turning point in PATH s financial results in about a year.Figure 1   UiPath s customer baseFrom FY 2020 to FY 2021, and from FY 2021 to FY 2022, PATH s customer base increased by about 33 , and 28 , respectively, significantly higher than the growth rate from FY 2022 to FY 2023. According to UiPath s second quarter fiscal year 2024 conference , as of 6 September 2023, the company had approximately 10890 customers, representing a slight increase compared to 31 January 2023. With the current operating result, I estimate the growth rate of PATH s customer base from FY 2023 to FY 2024 to be less than 2 . For the three months ended 31 July 2023  Q2 FY 2024 , PATH reported total revenue of  287 million, gross profit of  238 million, and operating loss of  78 million. With its current customer base, PATH is not able to cover its sales and marketing, R D, and general and administrative expenses. According to Figure 2, PATH s operating expenses didn t decrease in the past quarters, and I don t expect PATH s operating expenses to decrease in the future. Thus, we cannot assume that UiPath has already paid enough for sales   marketing, general   administrative, and R D expenses, reaching the position to cut these expenses.As a result, assuming no significant change in PATH's operating expenses in the following quarters  the company's quarterly operating expenses in the past few quarters have been about  300 million , to turn its operating loss into operating revenue, PATH needs to increase its total revenue by at least about 30 . Indeed with higher operating expenses, PATH's total revenue needs to increase more than 30 . For the second quarter of FY 2023, PATH reported a total revenue of  242 million, and according to its Q2 FY 2023 conference, the company was serving 10500 customers at that time. After a year, PATH s customer base increased by about 4 , while its total revenue increased by 19 . It simply means that it is not all about increasing the number of customers. The company s ability to sell more of its products and services to its current customers plays an important role in turning the current operating loss into an operating income. PATH s revenue per customer for the three months ending 31 July 2022 was about  23000, which increased to about  26000 for the three months ending 31 July 2023, up 13 . Controlling the number of customers  eliminating the effect of a higher number of customers in Q2 FY 2024 , PATH s revenue per customer increased 15  YoY.As high interest rates and geopolitical events are hindering global economic growth  global growth is  to slow from 3.5  in 2022 to 3  in 2023 to 2.9  in 2024 , I don t expect PATH s customer base to increase more than 5  in the following year. Assuming a 5  increase in the customer base in the following year  about 550 new customers , and about 15  growth in PATH s revenue per customer, I estimate PATH s revenue in the three months ending 31 July 2024 to be about  320 million. Assuming no increase in the company s operating expenses, I estimate PATH s operating loss in Q2 FY 2025  three months ending 31 July 2024  to turn into an operating income, which can be a turning point for PATH s quarterly financial results.Investors basically rely on PATH's technology, patents, and overall, intellectual property rather than the value of its tangible assets. Thus, P B value is not the right metric for the valuation here. However, the stock's P B value can be used to determine how much investors are valuing UiPath's intellectual property.PATH has a book value per share and a tangible book value per share of  3.50 and  3.31, respectively. It means that currently, investors are valuing its intellectual property, including its patents, brand, customer base, business strategy, and the company's relationship with its customers at about  13 per share. Investors are valuing PATH's intangible value about 5 times its tangible book value. In January 2023, PATH had a book value per share and a tangible book value per share of  3.45 and  3.25, respectively. Thus, PATH's book value per share and tangible book value per share haven't changed in the past two 9 months. However, the company now has a stronger customer base, and a more efficient AI-powered automation platform and services. By the next year, PATH's intangible assets net value can increase significantly as I believe the company can have improved technology and a stronger customer relationship. PATH is now trading at the levels it was trading in January 2023. Thus, I believe the stock is undervalued at its current price.Figure 2   PATH s operating results in the past 3 yearsDespite the strong market outlook and PATH's reliable customer base, some risks must be considered. As I previously mentioned, lots of companies demand AI-powered automation products and services to increase the efficiencies of their operations. To answer this demand, PATH's current features are not enough, and the company needs to introduce new features and improve the effectiveness of its platform. But there is no assurance that PATH can be able to do so, and its competitors may be able to produce more efficient platforms or services, replacing PATH's platform and services. To develop new features, PATH's R D sales can increase significantly, preventing the company from turning its operating loss into operating profit by next year. Another important issue is that companies that are using PATH's AI-powered automation platform still haven't had enough time to assess the long-term impact of PATH's AI-powered automation services on their operations. AI algorithms and models that PATH is offering may be proved to be less efficient than the company claims, and the end-users of PATH's system may conclude to stop using AI solutions provided by UiPath.The market outlook of AI-powered automation is strong, and UiPath has been able to build a strong relationship with companies that are demanding AI-powered automation for their daily activities in the past three years. With the current market outlook and PATH s current operational results, I estimate its operating loss to turn into an operating income by 2Q FY 2025  less than a year from now .

S&P 500 Mostly Unswayed By Geopolitics,"Considering the outbreak of geopolitical events in the past week, it may be surprising that the S P 500  Index   end the week higher than it closed in the previous week. The index rose 0.45  to end the trading weekThat's not to say there is no effect. Given a consumer price inflation report that wasn't negative enough to force the Federal Reserve to resume hiking interest rates on Thursday and the strong earnings reported by U.S. banks on Friday, there's a good argument to be made that stock prices should have risen higher. The increased tensions in the Middle East as Israel responds to Hamas' 7 October 2023 invasion and massacre may perhaps be constraining what should otherwise have been a much better week for stock prices.But theThe fingerprints of geopolitics are legitimately showing up in the market-moving headlines of the past week.

Allison Transmission Holdings: An Undiscovered Gem For A Cheap Price,"  is a  5.3-billion market cap company based in Indianapolis, Indiana, that designs and manufactures vehicle propulsion solutions, including automatic transmissions and electric systems for various applications. They offer transmissions for aWhile most of their revenue  74  comes from North America, they also have a global presence, serving customers in Asia, Europe, South America, and Africa through a network of independent distributors and dealers.The company operates in a single segment, but provide revenueIn the second quarter, Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. reported robust financial and operating performance across almost all of its end markets. Total net sales increased by 18  YoY, reaching a quarterly record of  783 million, contributing to a record 1H revenue of  1.5 billion. Despite challenges in the operating environment, Allison managed to increase its gross margin by 190 basis points YoY and achieved a 52  YoY growth in EPS to  1.92, surpassing the consensus figures by a heavy marginThey have also been actively investing in their defense end market, anticipating  100 million of incremental annual revenue in the coming years. I wrote in  on ICF International  that I believe U.S. defense spending will most likely only increase in the coming years, so ALSN's expansion in this end market seems absolutely realistic to me personally. The company is involved in various U.S. Department of Defense programs, including the M10 Booker Light tank and the M88A3 armored recovery vehicle, offering additional revenue opportunities. Furthermore, the eGen Force electric hybrid propulsion system is set to contribute to long-term growth in the defense market as modernization programs gain importance.Allison's international growth is also expected to be robust, being delivered through partnerships with global defense OEMs, such as Turkey, South Korea, Egypt, Australia, Norway, and Poland. Additionally, new product developments like the 3040 MX transmission are poised to drive international growth, with applications in India, Poland, and other European programs, the management noted during .In addition, the company sees development opportunities in , which is estimated to be worth  35 billion in 2030 and is expected to reach  89 billion by 2040, at a CAGR of 9.78  during the projection period. ALSN positively looks at the regulatory changes in Europe and the potential shift in the U.S. toward hydrogen combustion, as hydrogen-powered vehicles would use conventional transmissions, aligning with Allison's expertise.Furthermore, over the past few quarters, it is evident how the company's robust operational performance has significantly enhanced its liquidity and leverage positions. The current ratio is approaching its highest point in the last decade, and the debt-to-equity ratio has returned to pre-COVID levels, standing at less than 0.5Another metric of financial improvement after COVID times is debt coverage through cash flow from operations - this metric of ALSN is now over 0.3 on a TTM basis, which means that the company is able to cover more than 30  of its total debt through cash flow from operations alone, which is quite a lot.Allison has raised its FY2023 guidance after reporting for Q2, with anticipated net sales of  2.96-3.04 billion, reflecting strong demand and growth initiatives. The company also expects solid net income, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, and free cash flow in 2023.I like the company's performance and growth, and its addressable markets look promising in my opinion. But how attractive is the stock, really, considering it's up  46  YTD, ALSN has a fairly strong Valuation profile, rated  B-  with key metrics 30-50  below  medians.ALSN looks very cheap compared to its peers - Eaton Corporation , the closest in operational terms, trades at an EV EBITDA 2.9 times that of ALSN, and the company ranks last in terms of P E ratiosAt the same time, the company cannot be said to be lagging behind  in its projected growth  The forwarding company's growth figures show the oppositeAccording to my calculations, ALSN should be worth  6.5 billion after deducting net debt, assuming a median EBITDA of a projected  1.05-1.11 billion and an EV EBITDA of 8x, which I think is very fair. This results in an undervaluation of 22  compared to the current market capitalization.Surely, investing in ALSN stock carries various risks everyone should be aware of. For example, the industry risk is a concern due to the cyclical nature of the commercial vehicle sector, where economic downturns can reduce demand, negatively affecting the company's sales and profits. Competition risk is present as rivals like Eaton Corporation, Dana Incorporated , and others offer similar components for commercial vehicles, and losing market share to these competitors could impact ALSN. Technology risk emerges from the industry's rapid technological advancements, which may challenge ALSN's market position if it fails to keep up. Economic risk is linked to general economic downturns affecting commercial vehicle demand. Geopolitical events and global operations introduce geopolitical risk, including trade wars and currency fluctuations.Despite these risks, however, ALSN appears to be a fairly solid player in its industry, with improving financials and strong tailwinds from end markets that are likely to continue to positively impact the company for the foreseeable future. In addition, the 22  undervaluation I've identified provides investors with some margin of safety.Therefore, I rate ALSN stock as a  Buy .Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Moreover, the company will have to repay debt principal in quarterly installments of  3.05 million.In contrast, larger competitor Tidewater recently  to place a  250 million unsecured bond with a 10.375  coupon while SEACOR's recent  to attract investors for a senior secured note offering at competitive rates had failed earlier this year as admitted to by management in the In addition, all leading offshore drillers successfully accessed the bond markets in recent months at interest rates between 8.00  and 8.75 .However, SEACOR managed to retain considerable financial flexibility as the loan conditions allow for prepayments at rather moderate penalty rates starting in late 2024Following the transaction, SEACOR's total debt amounts to  360.1 million with an average interest rate below 10 .Please note that with the conversion option currently well into the money, the company's  35 million in 4.25  convertible notes due 2026 are likely to be converted into new common stock at a price of  11.75 per share.At this point, I am still looking for SEACOR to generate between  60 million and  70 million in EBITDA this year and cash flow from operations to turn substantially positive in the second half.With higher utilization and more vessels rolling over from legacy contracts to prevailing market rates, the company should achieve annual EBITDA well in excess of  100 million in 2024.Please note that in contrast to many competitors, SEACOR expenses all maintenance and drydocking costs rather than capitalizing them on the balance sheet, which understates margins and profitability relative to peers.Admittedly, I would have preferred SEACOR placing a  200  million secured bond at an interest rate well below 10  but at least the company retained the option to refinance at more attractive terms in the not-too-distant future.With a substantial increase in profitability and cash flow generation anticipated over the coming quarters, investors should use any major weakness to initiate or add to existing positions in SEACOR Marine Holdings as the recovery in offshore drilling activity continues to be supported by persistent tailwinds from recent geopolitical events.Given ongoing, strong market conditions, I am reiterating my  rating on the shares while keeping my price target at  15 based on a 2024 EBITDA EV multiple of 6x.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

What Do The Markets Believe About The War?,"We aren t geopolitical experts and do not know howAt the time of the Hamas attack on Israel the oil market was slightly oversold due to a price plunge over the preceding week. Consequently, at least a countertrend rebound was likely regardless of news.During the three trading days after the war news hit the wires  9th-11th October , the oil price bounced and then pulled back. We wrote in the 11th October Interim Update that this price action suggested an expectation among large oil traders that the conflict would not broaden or that if it did broaden then Saudi Arabia would act to offset any loss of oil from Iran.The subsequent price action indicates that the oil market has not  changed its mind . We say this because the rebound in the oil price from its pre-war-news low looks more like a countertrend reaction than the start of a move to above the September-2023 high. Also, the extent of the backwardation in the oil futures market has decreased over the past week, which suggests less urgency to stock-up on physical oil.In summary, the oil market does not believe that the war will have a significant negative effect on global oil supply.Prior to the war news hitting the wires the gold market was very oversold in both momentum and sentiment terms and therefore was poised for a rebound. As a result of the war news, the rebound has been much stronger than it otherwise would have been.The performance of the US  gold price indicates that large speculators initially were uncertain as to how big the war would become. Would it be confined to Israel versus Hamas in around Gaza, or would it expand to encompass direct involvement from the US and Iran  Also, how much additional US government spending would result from the war in the Middle East and how would this spending affect the resources directed towards the NATO-Russia war in UkraineAt the moment large speculators in the gold market believe that these are open questions, with a substantial expansion of the war being one of the more likely scenarios. That s a reasonable conclusion because the gold price continues to hover around resistance at US 1980- 2000   about  180 above where it was three weeks ago.We ll know that the perceived level of uncertainty risk has increased significantly if the gold price breaks above US 2000. By the same token, we ll know that the perceived level of uncertainty risk has begun to wane when there is a clear downward reversal in the US  gold price. Note that a downward reversal in the US  gold price is likely to precede a turn for the better in the news from the Middle East.In the US stock market, the war has prompted a shift away from risk but has been very much a secondary issue. The primary issue is the downward trend in the bond market  the upward trend in long-dated Treasury yields .In early-October the Dollar Index , was very overbought and had just begun to  correct . The war news may have reduced the magnitude of the correction, but up until now has not been sufficient to propel the DX above its early-October high.As far as we can tell, according to the currency market the outbreak of war in the Middle East has increased the attractiveness of the US  relative to other fiat currencies but also added to concerns about the pace at which the US government is going into debt. Putting it another way, what s priced into the currency market at the moment is both the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the war and the offsetting consideration that the war is increasing the risk of a US government debt spiral.Summarising all of the above, the oil market is not concerned about a significant supply disruption, the gold market has priced-in considerable uncertainty risk and could price-in more of the same before reversing, the US stock market is more concerned about bond yields than about the Middle East, and the currency market thinks that the benefits of holding the US  in a period of increasing geopolitical instability are being mostly offset by the likelihood that a further increase in geopolitical instability would accelerate the already rapid pace of US government deficit-spending.

United Airlines: Now Is The Time To Buy,"The airline industry is currently navigating a turbulent environment, encountering a dual challenge stemming from labor disputes and geopolitical conflicts. United Airlines Holdings , a prominent player in this sector, recently unveiled third-quarter financial results that, at first glance, appeared promising. The companyThe macroeconomic outlook hints at potential disruptions in the form of suspended flights to Tel Aviv, a consequence of the ongoing conflict in Israel. Furthermore, the company's forecast for earnings per share fell short of Wall Street's consensus estimates, casting a shadow over its near-term prospects. Tensions in the Middle East often lead to surging oil prices as well, which paints aThe challenges faced by United Airlines are not limited to geopolitical tensions. Labor unrest among its pilots and flight attendants is another challenge the company has to deal with. Employee demands for higher wages and improved working conditions have reached a pivotal juncture. Notably, United Airlines' pilots have ratified a , touted to be the costliest in the U.S. aviation industry, with an estimated value exceeding  10 billion. The agreement, demanded by the Air Line Pilots Association, promises substantial pay hikes, potentially reaching up to 40  over four years.Even after digesting these challenges, I believe United Airlines is grossly undervalued in the market today, which creates an opportunity for long-term-oriented investors.The travel sector has shown impressive signs of recovery following the pandemic-induced downturn. Notably, air travel experienced a robust summer season, with international revenue surpassing that of domestic ticket sales. United Airlines stood out in this resurgence, reporting  in both the Atlantic and Pacific regions. In the Atlantic region, revenue saw a remarkable 15  increase compared to the same quarter in 2022 and a substantial 70  growth when compared to the same quarter in 2019. The Pacific region also performed admirably, with revenue exceeding 2019 levels despite operating with 24  less capacity than the same period in 2019.An interesting statistic further underscores the travel sector's resurgence. According to a  by the New York Fed, approximately 32.8  of U.S. households embarked on vacations between May and August, a notable increase from 28.5  in August 2022 and a record high since 2015. This rise in travel was also confirmed by the Transportation Security Administration, which  that 246 million people passed through TSA checkpoints between May 1 and October 16, marking an 11  increase from the same period in 2022.The situation in the Middle East introduces a complex dynamic at a time when the leisure sector is continuing to benefit from the pent-up demand for travel. According to UNWTO, the region had  impressive results in the first seven months of 2023, with arrivals surpassing pre-pandemic levels by 20 , the only region to do so. Nevertheless, the Israeli-Palestinian military conflict poses a significant challenge to travel in this region. If the conflict escalates, it is expected to increasingly impact tourism traffic to and from the Middle East.The U.S. State Department has advised against traveling to Lebanon, citing an unpredictable security situation due to kidnappings, unrest following the Israel-Hamas war, and ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. United Airlines, with significant exposure to Israel, has suspended flights to Tel Aviv until conditions permit their resumption. Of the three major U.S. carriers, United Airlines has the most significant exposure to Israel. According to a  of Cirium data, for the fourth quarter, Israel constitutes 1.9  of United's planned global capacity. This suspension, along with others by U.S. and international carriers, is projected to contribute to United's non-fuel costs which are  by as much as 5  in the December quarter compared to the previous year.Given these circumstances, United Airlines has projected a year-over-year increase of 9  in its fourth-quarter revenue if Israel flights remain suspended through the end of the year, and 10.5  if the suspension lasts only through October. On a positive note, the company has observed a 20  year-over-year increase in revenue from premium products, accounting for more than half of its passenger revenue. This suggests a resurgence in lucrative business travel, with bookings for trips closer to departure dates in August and September significantly outpacing last year's trends.The resurgence of fuel prices since July has presented a formidable challenge to the profitability of U.S. carriers, and United Airlines is no exception. In a span of just a few months, the company has witnessed a staggering increase in fuel costs,  mark since mid-July. This substantial surge in fuel expenses paints a complex picture for the airline, with projections indicating an anticipated 11  increase in the average fuel bill for the quarter through December when compared to the previous quarter. The ramifications of this spike are amplified by the fact that jet fuel prices at major U.S. airports have surged by nearly 25  since the beginning of the summer season.A noteworthy aspect of the fuel price equation is the impact of geopolitical events, particularly the war in Israel. Although this conflict has not directly disrupted the physical supply of oil, it has added what could be termed a  war premium  to oil prices. This premium reflects the market's anticipation of potential risks to oil supply, should the conflict escalate into a regional confrontation. This element of uncertainty has contributed to the increased volatility in oil prices over the last week, further complicating the cost dynamics for airlines.The situation becomes even more complex when considering  from the International Air Transport Association. While the week ending October 13 witnessed jet fuel prices averaging  121.20 per barrel, it's worth noting that this figure represents a decline of almost 10  from the levels observed for the week ending September 15. Airlines were gearing up to make the most of these declining fuel prices but geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, in my opinion, will likely exert pressure on oil prices, ruining the party for airlines.Navigating the current challenging geopolitical conditions will be tough, at least in the short term, for United Airlines. However, as a long-term-oriented investor, I believe there is an opportunity for investors to exploit here.When the airline sector faced unprecedented challenges at the height of pandemic fears and mobility restrictions in 2020, I thought Southwest Airlines  was a good bet for contrarian investors given that the company had substantial exposure - it still does - to the domestic air travel market which I thought would recover faster than international travel. Today, the tables have turned. I am expecting a saturation of domestic air travel demand in the coming quarters while the international sector and business travel sector will remain strong in the foreseeable future. This is one reason for me to shift my focus from Southwest Airlines to the likes of United and Delta Air Lines . Although flight cancelations resulting from geopolitical tensions and elevated jet fuel prices will negatively impact United's margins in the foreseeable future, I believe there is room for long-term margin expansion.Through 2032, United is expecting the delivery of 800 new aircraft, which includes both narrowbody and widebody aircraft. This represents a strategy shift from the company from before the pandemic when United focused on cost-cutting measures to expand margins. This is one of the main reasons why I avoided United as I am a growth investor looking for mispriced bets in the market. Today, United's strategy has shifted to a more growth-focused approach where the company is trying to improve operational efficiency by acquiring new aircraft that are more fuel-efficient. This strategy also allows the company to sell more premium and extra legroom seats, which is likely to positively impact margins. The company, with access to a higher number of total seats, will be well-positioned to compete with low-cost airlines in the future as well, potentially grabbing market share across several categories.From a valuation perspective, the company immediately looks attractive at a forward P E of around 4. The company is valued at a quarter of its TTM sales too. However, before jumping on board, investors have to evaluate the threat of a few risks that are looming on the horizon.That said, I believe United is already trading at a discount to many of its closest peers, which gives me the confidence to claim the company is fairly valued in the market today, even in the worst-case scenario where the company will take a massive revenue hit from a disruption of international air travel demand.It is not a bad idea to invest in a fairly valued company when long-term growth prospects are intact. United, in my opinion, is a company with a meaningful runway for growth and is fairly valued.The short-term outlook for United Airlines is not rosy. The company, however, is well-positioned to benefit from favorable travel industry trends and market dynamics in the long run, and as a growth investor, I believe the company's new approach to margin expansion is commendable. The recent selloff, therefore, makes UAL stock an attractive bet. offers a wide range of tools and resources to help you achieve superior investment returns.

Attacks On Israel Introduce Tail-Risks To Oil Prices,"At the outset, our thoughts and sympathies go out to those affected by the shocking attacks in Israel.This past weekend, we witnessed a severe escalationBefore these developments, the ongoing talks around normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel were a key market focus, given their potential implications for oil production. Saudi Arabia had reportedly expressed a willingness to boost oil production if crude prices remained high. This was part of a complex deal, brokered by the U.S., that aimed for Saudi Arabia's recognition of Israel and a commitment to increased production. The talks were under close scrutiny by investors, asHowever, the recent attacks have dramatically shifted these dynamics. The escalating conflict has likely decreased the chances of near-term normalization in Saudi-Israeli relations. This could potentially affect Saudi oil production plans, leading them to extend their existing cuts for a longer period, which could further deplete already low global oil inventories.Another significant player in the global energy market, Iran, is also expected to see a major shift in U.S. policy. Before the attacks, the U.S. had adopted a softer posture toward Iran, allowing it to approach pre-2018 levels of oil production. However, given recent events and Iran's known support for Hamas, the U.S. may adopt a stricter stance, potentially leading to a reduction in the Iranian oil supply.These developments underscore the real and potentially harmful risks presented by geopolitical uncertainties. Persistently high oil prices could drive inflation, affecting both stocks and bonds. In these uncertain times, assets sensitive to geopolitical events could serve as a potential hedge. In particular, we believe the energy sector, which is intrinsically linked to geopolitics, may offer an opportunity.That said, the implications of recent events are only beginning to emerge, and we will watch closely in the coming weeks for signs of potential direction and impact for commodities and the broader financial markets and economy. 2009-2023 Neuberger Berman Group LLC.

Amgen's Acquisition Of Horizon Means The Stock Is A Buy,"In my previous  on Amgen , explaining the market outlook for the company s products, its developments, and its performance, I said that the stock is a buy. Since my previous article on the stock, AMGN's stock priceHorizon Therapeutics' revenue for the twelve months ending 30 June 2023   3.6 billion, and its revenue for the full year 2022 was also  3.6 billion. Also, for the twelve months ending 30 June 2023, Horizon Therapeutics had an operating income of  513 million, and for the full year 2022, Horizon had a net income of  617 million. As I mentioned previously, Amgen acquired Horizon at an equity value of  27.8 billion. As a result of the acquisition of Horizon, Amgen s inflammation portfolio is now stronger due to medicines such as TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, and UPLIZNA, which treat rare inflammatory diseases. Also, Amgen s international footprint has now widened, and the company is in a better position to conduct further research and development. Based on Horizon s previous financial results, and Amgen s current operating results, I estimate this acquisition can increase Amgen's annual revenue by 12  to 14 .As of October 9, 2023, Amgen had an equity value of about  143 billion. Thus, we can say that Amgen has an equity value to annual revenue of 5.3x, and based on Horizon's revenue potential and the cash that Amgen paid to acquire it, Horizon s equity value to revenue can be calculated to be about 7.9x. It simply means that Amgen valued each dollar of revenue that Horizon can make at  7.9, while investors are valuing each dollar of revenue that Amgen can make  excluding the effect of the acquisition  at  5.3. Also, I calculated Amgen and Horizon s  before being acquired by Amgen  equity value to operating income to be 14.9x and 46.3x. It simply means that Amgen valued each dollar of operating income that Horizon can make at  46.3, while investors are valuing each dollar of operating income that Amgen can make at  14.9. Finally, I calculated Horizon s equity value to total liabilities, and equity value to total assets to be 6.9x and 3.0x. It means that Amgen valued each dollar of Horizon s total liabilities and total assets at  6.9, and  3.0, respectively. On the other hand, investors are valuing each dollar of Amgen s total liabilities and total assets at  1.8, and  1.6, respectively. From my perspective, it is not rational to think that Amgen s management overvalued Horizon Therapeutics this much  Thus, I can count on one of these two scenarios  Amgen is undervalued by investors, or due to the acquisition of Horizon, Amgen s financial results and metrics in the future can improve in a significant way. Either way, the result is that I believe Amgen is undervalued at its current prices.Regardless of the positive effects of the acquisition of Horizon, you should know that compared to six months ago, Amgen is in a stronger position. In my previous article, I explained that due to the inclusion of Repatha on China s National Reimbursement Drug List as of 1 January 2022, Amgen s Repatha sales can increase. In the first quarter of 2023, Amgen revenue of  388 million from Repatha, which  to  424 million in 2Q 2023 and can increase further  driven by higher sales volume . Also, I explained that due to increased competition, Amgen s Enbrel and XGEVA sales might decrease. In the first quarter of 2023, Enbrel sales were significantly lower than in 4Q 2022  however, increased again in 2Q 2023 driven by a higher net selling price. Enbrel sales in 3Q 2023 and 4Q 2023 can be higher than in 2Q 2023 as better insurance coverage may lead to a higher number of patients. Also, contrary to the expectations, XGEVA sales in 1Q 2023 were higher than in 4Q 2022, meaning that the negative effects of higher competition on Amgen s XGEVA sales were not significant. The company s XGEVA sales increased further in 2Q 2023, and due to a higher net selling price, Amgen s XGEVA sales in 2H 2023 can be higher than in 1H 2023.Overall, in the second quarter of 2023, Amgen s total product sales of  6,683 million was 2  higher than in 4Q 2022, and 14  higher than in 1Q 2023. Due to its expanded international footprint, positive top-line data for Tarlatamab  for treatment of small cell lung cancer  and LUMAKRAS  for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer , the company is well positioned to reach its revenue target of between  26.6 billion to  27.4 billion  excluding any contribution from the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics  and reach higher revenues in 2024. For the six months ended 30 June 2023, Amgen reported total revenues of  13.2 billion. It means that Amgen s 2H 2023 revenue can be 1.5  to 8.0  higher than in 1H 2023  excluding the contribution from Horizon .Despite the strong market outlook for Amgen s products, and despite the positive effects that can come from the acquisition of Horizon, some risks for Amgen must be considered. A great part of Amgen s revenue is linked to coverage and reimbursement from government and third-party payers. Thus, Amgen s profitability and operational results can be negatively affected if the availability and the extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers change. Any pressure on healthcare budgets  due to economic slowdowns, inflation, geopolitical events, etc.  may result in lower coverage, and lower reimbursement rates for Amgen s products. Furthermore, every day there might be new products out there that can be proved to be more efficient than Amgen s products, resulting in lower net selling prices, and lower sales volumes. Thus, it is important to keep an eye regularly on the new products that Amgen s competitors launch and address the effect of the new products in the market on Amgen s market share and profitability.Since my last article on Amgen, the stock price increased by 16 . Now that Amgen s acquisition of Horizon is completed, and the company has been able to increase its revenues, I want to reiterate my buy rating on the stock. From my perspective, the positive effects that the acquisition of Horizon can have on Amgen s financial and operational results are being ignored by investors, and the stock is undervalued.

Gold: Time To Load Up The Van,"The Federal Reserve has kept its key interest rate , a sign of moderation in its stance against inflation as inflation pressures have eased. Consumer inflation has reduced to 3.7 , but it remains above the Fed's 2  target. The Federal Reserve expectsInflation concerns still linger, with the Fed targeting a soft landing of the economy to avoid a deep recession, ensuring that inflation moves closer to their 2  target while managing resilient job markets and economic growth. The economy is foreseen to grow by 2.1  this year, a revision from the 1  forecast in June. Despite these advancements, the costs of some services continue to rise.Gas prices and oil prices are on the rise, impacting consumer spending, withWhen the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchanged, it can have varying impacts on gold and stocks, depending on investor expectations, prevailing economic conditions, and market sentiment.Given the context of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged amid high inflation, the reaction of gold and stocks will depend on investor interpretation of the Fed's decision. If investors see the unchanged rate as a sign that the Fed is not doing enough to combat inflation, gold prices may rise due to its status as an inflation hedge. Simultaneously, stocks may experience increased volatility due to concerns about prolonged high inflation affecting corporate profits.However, if the market perceives the unchanged interest rate as supportive of economic growth without exacerbating inflation, stocks might react positively due to the prospect of continued economic expansion and corporate profitability, while gold might not experience significant gains due to a reduced need for inflation hedging.To be able to better identify the standard deviation levels in gold, let's take a look at the weekly standard deviation report for next week published in the Market Place section as Mean Reversion Trading and see where we can identify some short-term trading opportunities.

Deere & Company Fiscal Q3: I'm Buying Any Weakness On Its Path To $600," has been the cornerstone of my dividend growth portfolio since 2020. I initially bought the stock because of two reasonsExcluding dividends, I'm currently up roughly 130  on my initial investment, as Deere has done tremendously well since 2020. The company has consistently beaten earnings estimates and aggressively hiked its guidance.The just-released  were no different.This Moline, Illinois, based agriculture giant beat earnings estimates by a mile and hiked its full-year guidance  again .Nonetheless, the stock sold off roughly 5  after earnings.Despite my bullish view, I do not disagreeWhile supply chain issues are rapidly fading, the company mainly benefited from pricing. It saw demand weakness in its smaller agriculture segment and might struggle with cyclical demand unless economic growth indicators improve.However, given my long-term view of this company, I embrace weakness, as I want to boost my stake in Deere at better prices before I expect a new uptrend to  600.Now, let me give you the detailsLet's start with  that hit the wires first. In the third fiscal quarter, Deere reported  10.20 in GAAP EPS, which beat estimates by  1.99, the third consecutive and largest earnings beat since it missed estimates in 3Q22.However, this earnings beat was caused by one-off items, as I will discuss in a bit.This exceptional performance was attributed to sustained demand for both farm and construction equipment and effective operational execution across all business units.The fundamentals in the agricultural sector were characterized as healthy, with a robust order book and positive customer sentiment indicating a strong finish to fiscal year 2023.Meanwhile, the construction and forestry segment remained sold out for the rest of the fiscal year due to strong retail demand and rental re-fleeting.It may have something to do with the massive surge in construction spending fueled by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.As a result of the aforementioned tailwinds, net sales, and revenues increased by 12  to reach  15.8 billion, with net sales for equipment operations growing by 10  to  14.3 billion. Net income came in at  3.0 billion, or  10.20 per diluted share.Please bear in mind that the net income number included a  243 million tax benefit and  47 million of associated interest income stemming from a favorable tax ruling regarding Brazilian VAT tax subsidies.In other words, the aforementioned EPS beat needs to be taken with a grain of salt.Having said that, let's dive a bit deeper.The   I often call this the  segment  reported net sales of  6.8 billion, marking a 12  increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.Growth was mainly provided by higher prices.Furthermore, this segment achieved an operating profit of  1.8 billion, resulting in a robust operating margin of 26.2 .The increase in operating profit was mainly driven by favorable price realization. Volumes had a minor impact.These gains were partially offset by higher production costs, increased selling, general, and administrative  SG A  expenses, research and development  R D  spending, as well as unfavorable currency exchange.Net sales for the  segment increased by 3 , totaling  3.7 billion in the third quarter.Growth was primarily driven by positive price realization. Volumes were down.The operating profit improved year-on-year, reaching  732 million and resulting in a 19.6  operating margin.This increase was driven by positive price realization, partially offset by higher production costs, lower shipment volumes, and increased SG A and R D spending.Construction and forestry segment net sales rose by 14  to  3.7 billion in the third quarter, mainly driven by price realization and higher shipment volumes.The operating profit increased year-on-year to  716 million, yielding a 19.1  operating margin, as pricing power blew cost headwinds out of the water.Having said all of this, I have mixed feelings when looking at these numbers.The best news isAccording to Deere, its factories operated smoothly, hitting production schedules as planned. The company saw a return to normal seasonality in the top-line quarterly cadence, indicating the company's commitment to customer commitments and a better customer experience.The bad news isThis brings me to the next part.Thanks to a strong performance in the third quarter, the company raised its net income outlook for FY2023 to be between  9.8 and  10 billion to reflect strong results and ongoing optimism.The effective tax rate was updated to be between 21  and 23 , considering the aforementioned favorable tax ruling in Brazil.Operating cash flow from equipment operations is projected to be in the range of  10.5 to  11 billion for the fiscal year.Having said this, in the construction sector, industry fundamentals remain strong, with construction job growth and infrastructure project spending driving demand.While megaprojects tied to government funds will impact 2024 and potentially 2025, the residential housing market is stabilizing, and non-residential demand fluctuates with reshoring benefits and weakness in some sectors.Agriculture fundamentals showed strength as well, with strong equipment demand, healthy net income projected for North American farmers, and favorable trends in farm inputs leading to improved farm margins.Grain production volatility and geopolitical events contribute to tighter stock use, supporting a positive outlook for North American ag markets.These comments are confirmed by every single agriculture player I've researched so far this year.Furthermore, Brazil's agriculture market experienced a dynamic year influenced by political uncertainty and lower grain prices, impacting farmer income.Despite these challenges, Brazil maintained record production, expanded acreage, and introduced a supportive government-sponsored financing program.As a result, equipment production was adjusted in response to changing conditions, with the order book extending through the fiscal year and robust pre-sales for combines.Inventory levels in North America are expected to wind down, with both new and used inventory projected to be below historical levels on a unit basis by year-end.Adding to that, Early Order Programs  EOP  provided preliminary data on product demand and trends.In Europe, order books extend into the second quarter of 2024, with market dynamics varying between Western Europe and Central Eastern markets.Stable arable cash margins, declining input costs, and strong dealer networks contribute to a positive outlook for Western markets.Dairy margins may face pressure, and markets near Ukraine may experience commodity price challenges.Hence, the company believes that the dynamic European market will be better understood as the fiscal year approaches. In light of new geopolitical challenges in Europe, I agree with that statement.Deere is trading at 12.8x NTM EBITDA, which is a very fair valuation. Nonetheless, I wouldn't bet against a bit more downside, as the market will likely price in a higher likelihood of weakening volumes in the quarters ahead. On top of that, pricing power is likely getting weaker as a result of weaker crop prices and the fact that inflation has come down.However, I stick to my long-term target of  600, as the long-term bull case remains in a very good spot.Given short-term challenges, I am looking to buy more Deere if it drops to  340  or lower .Once Deere gets support from cyclical growth indicators, I have little doubt that we'll see a violent breakout above  460.So, for now, we might see more stock price weakness, but I'm going to use that to my advantage.Hence, my rating remains a rating.Deere   Company has been a cornerstone of my dividend growth portfolio, driven by its consistent dividend growth and impressive total returns.The recent Q3 2023 earnings demonstrated sustained demand for agricultural and construction equipment, resulting in robust revenues and profits.The company's pricing power and operational excellence shine through, offsetting challenges like supply chain issues and weakening volume in certain segments.While short-term concerns exist, my long-term bullish outlook on Deere   Company's superior products, customer service, and potential for cyclical growth keeps my target at  600.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Keysight Technologies: A Global Leader Continuously Advancing Its Dominance,"My recommendation for Keysight Technologies  is a buy rating. KEYS has recently showcased a commendable financial performance, achieving record figures in both revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter. While there were some challenges, as evidenced by theKEYS is a leading global company specializing in electronic measurement solutions, catering to industries ranging from communications and aerospace to semiconductors and education. KEYS provides advanced hardware and software solutions that assist engineers, researchers, and professionals across various sectors in designing, testing, and optimizing their products and systems. Their offerings encompass a broad range of applications, including wireless communications, aerospace and defense systems, and digital solutions.Over the past 5 years, KEYS has demonstrated robust top-line revenue growth. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in KEYS revenue of approximately 2 . As the impact of COVID-19 subsided in 2021 and 2022 and as economies reopened, KEYS revenue also rebounded. The company's compound annual growth rate over these five years stood at 7 . Impressively, in 2022, KEYS reported a double-digit growth of 10 , still continuing to surpass its 5-year CAGR.When it comes to net income, KEYS's performance has been notably impressive, showcasing consistent growth. In 2018, the company reported a non-GAAP margin of 16 . By 2022, this figure had risen to 26 , marking a significant expansion of 8  over the period.The company reported revenue of , up 1  on a core basis, marking a record for the third quarter. The gross margin stood at 66 , and the operating margin was a record 31 . The earnings per share amounted to  2.19, an all-time high.While the company's orders for the quarter landed on the lower end of their expectations, suggesting potential challenges in demand or in converting leads into confirmed orders, there was a silver lining. Despite this dip in order intake, there was a consistent and positive trend in customer research and development  R D  spending. This steady  is a promising sign, indicating that customers remain committed to innovation, which could translate to future demand for KEYS offerings.Furthermore, the company witnessed growth in the aerospace, defense, and government sectors. These sectors are known for their long-term contracts, high regulatory requirements, and significant barriers to entry. KEYS's growth in these areas is a testament to their credibility, product quality, and ability to meet the stringent demands of these sectors. Such growth can also be seen as a sign of potential revenue stability, given the often multi-year nature of contracts in these domains.But perhaps one of the most exciting revelations was KEYS's growth in automotive electric vehicles  EV  and autonomous vehicles  AV  solutions. The automotive industry is in the midst of a transformative phase with the rise of EVs and AVs. KEYS's active participation in this transformation, underscored by their strategic win with a prominent European Original Equipment Manufacturer  OEM  for an EV battery test system, positions them favorably in this rapidly evolving landscape. Their involvement in the EV and AV sectors is not just timely but strategic, tapping into what is widely regarded as the future of transportation.In essence, while there might be short-term concerns due to the lower order intake, the consistent R D spending by customers and growth in pivotal sectors like aerospace, defense, government, and automotive EV AV paint a promising picture for KEYS future prospects. The company appears to be in sync with current industry trends and is poised to benefit from future technological shifts.In the midst of challenges faced by the semiconductor sector, a bright spot for KEYS Technologies has been the sustained high demand for their silicon photonics test solutions. Silicon photonics, which integrates optics with traditional semiconductor processes, is emerging as a pivotal technology in the industry. It harnesses the power of photonic systems to transmit data among computer chips, offering a promising avenue to meet the escalating data rates in modern computing. The robust demand for KEYS solutions in this domain suggests that the industry is increasingly gravitating towards the benefits of silicon photonics, such as enhanced speed, power efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. KEYS's prominence in providing these testing solutions underscores their adaptability and forward-thinking approach, positioning them well to cater to the next wave of semiconductor innovations. As the landscape of the semiconductor industry evolves, KEYS's ability to tap into and serve emerging technologies like silicon photonics indicates their potential for continued relevance and growth.In the evolving landscape of the technology industry, KEYS has adeptly navigated the shift toward software-centric solutions. A significant indicator of this transition is that software and services now make up a substantial one-third of the company's total revenue. This not only underscores the growing customer reliance on KEYS software offerings but also highlights the company's strategic diversification of its revenue streams. Such a move is pivotal in mitigating the risks associated with market fluctuations in specific sectors.Further solidifying their commitment to software solutions is KEYS's intent to acquire , a frontrunner in the realm of virtual prototyping. Virtual prototyping, which allows for the simulation, testing, and optimization of products in a digital environment before physical production, is becoming increasingly crucial in today's fast-paced tech world. By integrating the expertise of ESI Group, KEYS is poised to offer an even more comprehensive suite of solutions, addressing a wider array of challenges in product development and testing. This acquisition not only broadens KEYS reach into new markets and customer segments but also underscores their vision to stay at the forefront of industry trends.All in all, KEYS's pronounced focus on software and its strategic moves, like the ESI Group acquisition, showcase the company's adaptability and forward-thinking approach. As the preference for software-driven solutions continues to grow in the tech sector, KEYS's alignment with this trend signals a promising path for their sustained growth and market relevance.According to my model, KEYS is valued at  138.12 in FY24, marking a 10  increase. This valuation stems from my growth predictions of 1  for FY23, aligning with the guidance from KEYS's management in their earnings report, and 6  for FY24, which slightly exceeds the market consensus. Several pivotal factors bolster my growth expectations for KEYS. Firstly, their expanding presence in the aerospace, defense, and government sectors promises consistent revenue, given the long-term contracts these sectors typically offer. Secondly, the unwavering demand for KEYS's silicon photonics test solutions showcases their readiness to harness the next wave of semiconductor advancements. Lastly, KEYS's strategic pivot towards software-centric solutions, evident as software and services now constitute one-third of their total revenue, underscores their adaptability and forward-thinking approach. Given these dynamics, I remain optimistic about KEYS's growth prospects in the upcoming years.Currently, KEYS is trading at a forward EV EBITDA multiple of 13.22x. With a net margin of 21.79  and an EBITDA margin of 29.67 , KEYS lags behind its peers in profitability metrics. This is reflected in its valuation, as KEYS trades at a slightly lower forward EV EBITDA compared to TER  EV forward EBITDA of 15.9x, net margin of 22.9 , EBITDA margin of 30.6 . Given this context, I consider KEYS's valuation to be reasonable. Based on its prevailing forward EV EBITDA, my target price for KEYS is  138.12. When compared with its current trading price of  126.01, this represents a potential upside of 10 . Given these factors, I recommend a buy rating for KEYS.Given the global nature of the semiconductor and electronics industries, KEYS is exposed to potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. Over the past few years, trade disputes, tariffs, and other geopolitical events have impacted global supply chains, leading to increased costs, delays, and uncertainties. If KEYS faces challenges in sourcing critical components or experiences delays in its supply chain, it could impact their ability to deliver products on time, potentially leading to missed revenue opportunities and decreased customer trust. Additionally, any escalation in geopolitical tensions or further trade restrictions could adversely affect KEYS's operations, sales, and profitability, thereby impacting its stock price.KEYS has demonstrated strong financial performance, marking notable achievements in both revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter. While the company faced challenges in order intake, the unwavering commitment to R D by its customers showcases a silver lining, hinting at a continued focus on innovation and potential future demand for KEYS offerings. Strategically, KEYS has solidified its position in pivotal sectors such as aerospace, defense, and government, benefiting from the stability offered by long-term contracts. Their active engagement in the transformative automotive EV and AV sectors, along with the sustained demand for their silicon photonics test solutions, emphasizes their adaptability in a dynamic tech environment. Additionally, KEYS shifts towards software-centric solutions and their intent to integrate expertise from the ESI Group further accentuates their forward-thinking approach. In essence, KEYS's strategic initiatives, alignment with industry trends, and adaptability paint a promising picture for their future growth and market position. Therefore, I recommend a buy rating for KEYS.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Apple Doesn't Need China,"  stands as a globally renowned company, currently holding the title of the world's most valuable, with Microsoft Corporation  hot on its heels. Their innovations, including the iPhone and iPad, have left anPresently, the stock is aptly valued. However, should China reconsider its perplexing stance, Apple could potentially unleash an intrinsic upside of 43 . This upside might surge further as Apple transitions from being  fairly valued  to  overvalued.  Consequently, Apple represents an enticing  buy  opportunity.The latest news concerning Apple revolves around the release of its iPhone 15 lineup. In addition to this, a noteworthy development is theRegarding the iPhone 15 line's success, it remains challenging to make a definitive estimation. However, the prevailing consensus suggests that it is .In essence, there isn't much to report about Apple in terms of breaking news, given its status as one of the most renowned companies globally. The company's founding story and the legacy of Steve Jobs are subjects widely explored in both business and computer science realms.Now, let's delve into the growth prospects for each of Apple's segments. Firstly, we have the consumer electronics market, which is anticipated to exhibit a growth rate of  , as per Statista's projections. However, an alternate perspective from Yahoo Finance suggests a potentially more robust  spanning the years 2023 to 2033, in contrast to Statista's forecast, which encompasses the period from 2023 to 2028.Next, we turn our attention to Apple's services, a substantial segment that can be further categorized into apps, repairs, and banking. The apps segment is predominantly underpinned by App Store revenue and is expected to experience growth ranging from  to . Meanwhile, the consumer electronics repair market is forecasted to grow at a rate spanning from  to 7.7 . In the realm of banking operations, we look to the  fintech  market, where projections indicate a potential CAGR range of 9.9  to , with the upper end of this range being the highest estimate sourced from Allied Market Research.Lastly, we consider the consumer electronics accessories sector, with an estimate of a CAGR between  and . It's important to note that these estimates have been collated from various sources. However, for the purpose of illustrating that Apple's reliance on China is not imperative, I will be employing the most conservative estimates, which, nonetheless, suggest that Apple's growth potential exceeds the projections outlined in the discounted cash flow  DCF  models.Since 2017, Apple has consistently achieved an annual revenue growth rate of 9.6 . However, when you delve into the nature of Apple's revenue, you'll notice a distinct seasonality, exemplified by the substantial revenue spike from 2020 to 2021. This spike can be largely attributed to government stimulus efforts aimed at mitigating potential economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps this seasonality is the impetus behind initiatives like the Vision Pro and Apple's foray into banking, designed to mitigate the fluctuations inherent to being a consumer electronics designer by establishing recurring revenue streams.Apple's profit margins are, needless to say, robust, boasting both operating and net income margins comfortably exceeding 20 .In terms of financial leverage, Apple carries a debt of  109.28 billion while maintaining a hefty cash reserve of  62.4 billion. This substantial cash reserve accounts for 57  of Apple's debt, underscoring its solid financial position. While there are companies with more cash than debt, Apple's financial position is undoubtedly commendable.Lastly, let's examine Apple's free cash flow, which has seen impressive growth, primarily driven by increased cash from operations. Since 2017, Apple's overall free cash flow has grown at an impressive annual rate of 17.76 . This growth has played a pivotal role in the remarkable ascent of Apple's stock price. Apple's cash flow margin, standing at 22.9 , may not place it at the pinnacle of profitability among companies, but it is undeniably robust.In summation, Apple finds itself in a robust financial position, generating substantial cash flows despite its more moderate revenue growth. This cash flow surge has been the driving force behind the company's remarkable stock price increase, underlining its reliability as a profitable enterprise, with margins consistently exceeding 20 .Firstly, let's initiate the initial valuation model under the assumption that China does not impose a comprehensive nationwide ban on iPhones. In this scenario, all operations proceed as usual, and we anticipate the following revenues for each of Apple's operational segmentsNext, I compile the necessary variables to compute EBITDA. This includes revenues, to which I've added  23 billion for projection stability. Additionally, we consider net income, calculated with a 23.08  margin, a tax rate of 14.93 , and depreciation and amortization  D A  as well as interest expenses, both derived from revenue-based margins at 3.30  and 0.98 , respectively.Now, let's examine the table of assumptions, which, in essence, contains all the current trailing twelve-month  TTM  data without any unique or noteworthy factorsAs evident from this analysis, Apple's fair value is assessed at  175.82, a figure remarkably close to its current stock price of  175.74. This suggests that, assuming China refrains from declaring an all-out war on Apple, the company is presently trading at a fair valuation. Looking ahead, the projected future price stands at  251.47, indicating a substantial 43  upside potential and an annual return of 8.6 .Now, let's delve into the second discounted cash flow  DCF  model, which posits that Apple's stock would not face severe repercussions even in the event of China deciding to ban Apple products within its borders. It's essential to note that, as of the latest quarter, China accounts for 19  of Apple's total revenue. In light of this, I project that China's ban would result in a 4.75  reduction in revenue over a four-year span, spanning from 2025 to 2028. Adhering to the same structural approach and adjusting revenues to this revised scenario, the EBITDAs manifest as followsAs you can discern, the situation remains relatively stable. The current fair price stands at  168.64, indicating a modest 4.2  reduction from the current stock price. Looking ahead, the future price is estimated at  240.99, representing a respectable 37  upside potential, equivalent to an annual return of 7.35  through 2028.Recall my earlier mention of utilizing the most conservative growth estimates  Well, should Apple manage to attain the loftiest projections, it would signify a fair price of  185.77, with a prospective future price of  266.11. This equates to an impressive annual return of 10.27 , all under the assumption that China continues to contribute to Apple's revenue stream.Lastly, it's imperative to emphasize that Apple holds significant importance for China, arguably more than China represents for Apple. Apple's operations have contributed to the creation of over 5 million jobs in China. If you multiply this by China's GDP per capita of  12,964, it amounts to a substantial  64.8 billion in value added to the Chinese economy. Given China's ongoing economic challenges, including declining industrial production and rising unemployment, it prompts contemplation on whether it is prudent to expel a company that played a pivotal role in China's economic transformation.Despite the current concerns surrounding China, I maintain a  buy  rating for Apple. These models suggest that China's actions would not severely impact Apple's stock price. Apple's growth potential could even surpass these projections, with its banking operations potentially playing a pivotal role. It is imperative, however, to exercise caution and learn from the lessons of history, as exemplified by the experience of General Electric Company  under the leadership of Jack Welch.The primary concern for this thesis does not revolve around whether China's impact exceeds our expectations, but rather the vulnerability of individual segments, with the most pivotal being the iPhone. If, for instance, Apple's iPhone 15 fails to garner the anticipated level of success, it could potentially deliver a more severe blow than anything China might impose.Additionally, there is the macroeconomic risk factor to contend with. This entails the possibility of an economic downturn, as Apple is more than just a technology company - it is, to a significant extent, a status symbol. Notably, approximately 50  of Apple's revenue is correlated with changes in In summary, Apple's risks are more intertwined with the success of its devices than external factors like China, economic recessions, or supply chain disputes, as these issues tend to be temporary in nature. Conversely, a substantial decline in the sales of Apple's devices could potentially result in a staggering 63  downturn.In assessing Apple's prospects in the face of China's policies and other potential risks, it becomes evident that the tech giant's resilience lies in its multifaceted approach to business. While China's influence on Apple's fortunes remains a notable concern, it is not the sole determinant of the company's future performance. Two distinct valuation models underscore this point, revealing that even in the scenario of a significant Chinese setback, Apple's stock remains poised for growth. The financial stability of the company, strong profit margins, and robust cash flows fortify its position as a steadfast investment choice.Nonetheless, as we navigate these projections, it is crucial to acknowledge the pivotal role that Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, plays in shaping its fate. The imminent success of the iPhone 15 could significantly impact Apple's trajectory, potentially overshadowing the consequences of geopolitical events. Moreover, a deep-seated connection between Apple's revenue and global economic conditions raises macroeconomic concerns. Apple's status as a symbol of affluence underscores its vulnerability to economic slowdowns, as it becomes a discretionary expenditure rather than a necessity.In this dynamic landscape, it is evident that Apple's destiny is intrinsically tied to its device sales and innovations. While external factors like China's policies and economic fluctuations remain noteworthy, they often represent transitory challenges. On the other hand, a substantial decline in the appeal or sales of Apple's devices could carry a more profound and lasting impact, potentially constituting the most substantial risk to the company, with the potential for a significant market downturn. Consequently, as investors weigh the future of this tech titan, it is the performance of its devices and their reception in the market that will continue to be the primary drivers of Apple's journey forward.

Bridgford Foods: Distribution Network Expansion Resulting In Compounding Growth,"Bridgford Foods Corporation  has recently seen a pullback in shares over the past year due to stagnant guidance. I believe that Bridgford is a buy due to the firm's solid balance sheet amid macro headwinds, distribution expansion resultingBridgford Foods Corporation, along with its affiliated companies, is engaged in the production, promotion, and distribution of frozen, refrigerated, and snack food items within the United States. The company's two main divisions are snack food products and frozen food products. Biscuits, various bread and roll dough goods, dry sausage, and beef jerky products make up the majority of its product line. The company offers both retail clients and the food service industry a wide variety of about 130 frozen food items. Distributors, cooperatives, and wholesalers all distribute these goods. Additionally, Bridgford Foods provides about 160 snack food products, which are distributed to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, convenience stores, andBridgford is currently valued at around  101.3 million in the market, with a Return on Invested Capital of 3 . The stock is presently priced at  11.16 per share, slightly below its 200-day moving average of  12.26. It's noteworthy that the company's P E GAAP ratio is at 22.91. This figure is lower than comparable peers indicating a relative undervaluation for the firm.Although Bridgford does not pay a dividend, the firm has decreased its debt significantly and is committed to investments in its core business to return greater shareholder value in the future. The firm has also maintained its outstanding shares, which demonstrates its commitment to preserving value as well.Bridgford recently reported disappointing earnings in Q3 2023 with net income falling from  41.3 million to  684,000 and sales falling from  59.52 million to  54.2 million. This demonstrates that Bridgford is experiencing difficulty during these macro headwinds to have steady cash flows. But, although earnings were weak, the firm's ability to leverage through its solid balance sheet as mentioned later in this article along with its distribution expansion will allow the firm to leverage while also stabilizing cash flows in the long term.Over the past 10 years, Bridgford has underperformed in the S P 500 due to a recent decline in earnings and revenues. I believe that the firm must restructure its strategy to stimulate growth and recover from recent negative price action in the long run.Bridgford also maintains a robust financial position with a substantial reduction in debt and enhanced interest coverage at 7.83. This resilient, low-debt balance sheet provides the company with flexibility for potential leveraging, particularly during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions that may strain cash flows. Demonstrating a Current Ratio of 3.46 and an Altman-Z-Score of 4.14, Bridgford's ongoing operations are stable and promising for the near to medium term.In order to calculate an accurate fair value for Bridgford, I first had to find the firm's Cost of Equity by using the risk-free rate from the . Based on this rate, I was able to find a Cost of Equity of 7.6 .Assuming the previously calculated Cost of Equity, I created a 5-year Equity Model DCF using FCFE. I decided to use the discount rate of 7.6  because the firm is adequately leveraged for macroeconomic headwinds and will be able to take on debt if cash flows become a concern. I also estimated revenues and margins to grow with company guidance estimates as shown below. This resulted in a fair value of  14.36 presenting a potential upside of 22 .As a key component of its corporate strategy, Bridgford Foods is dedicated to expanding its distribution network. By maximizing how its items are delivered to retail locations and end users, the corporation hopes to ensure that consumers can easily access its products.Their efforts to form strategic alliances with significant retail chains and distributors served as one illustration of how they were enhancing their distribution network. Bridgford Foods was able to increase the visibility of its products in stores and get greater shelf space by working with influential players in the retail sector. This strategy improved both the accessibility of their products and brand recognition.Bridgford Foods has looked into expanding its distribution options by adopting e-commerce. The business attempted to increase its presence in numerous online marketplaces after realizing the growing trend of online shopping. By making this change, they were able to reach customers who valued the ease of acquiring their goods online, thereby expanding their customer base.Through such strategies, Bridgford Foods Corporation aimed to make its products more easily accessible to a wider audience, ensuring that consumers could find their offerings in their preferred retail outlets or through online platforms. This will not only improve sales but also expand margins due to the underlying costs being cut on an e-commerce platform along with greater wholesale pricing power once store items become more popular in large chain stores. This will result in improved cash flows along with greater FCF leading to the further expansion of its core business to outpace competitors.Natural disasters, supply-chain disruptions, labor issues, and any other operational challenges that affect production and distribution.Price fluctuations for ingredients like wheat, beef, and other raw commodities as a result of market dynamics, climatic circumstances, or geopolitical events, which have an impact on manufacturing costs and total profitability. Regulations governing food safety and quality must be followed  failure to do so could lead to product recalls, legal action, reputational harm, and monetary losses.To summarize, I believe Bridgford is a buy due to the firm's solid balance sheet amid macro headwinds, distribution expansion resulting in greater long-term FCF, and undervaluation assuming my DCF figures.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

CrowdStrike Stock: Growth Through AI,"October is celebrated as Cyber Security Awareness Month, known as CSAM. Interestingly, cyber security stocks are going up. Is it just a coincidence  Who knows  But it's definitely not the only reason.Two different events occur with CSAMAdditionally, nation-state attacks are attempting to attack critical infrastructure in Western governments. The websites of the Belgian Prime Minister, the Federal Parliament and the Royal Palace were cyberattacked by pro-Russian hackers, for example, probably as a reaction to the  to Belgium of the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky and the Belgian decision to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.CrowdStrike One of the traits of CrowdStrike that Forrester recognized is the fact that CrowdStrike emphasizes preventing attacks from happening in the first place rather than cleaning up after a breach has occurred.At the same time, you can see on the graph that this is a crowded space  pun not intended , with powerful players like Microsoft , Palo Alto Networks  and Broadcom . On the other hand, there are up can coming companies like SentinelOne  and Bitdefender.Let's start by looking back at CrowdStrike's Q2 2024 results. 2024, yes, not a typo. CrowdStrike is one of the companies that have a fiscal year one year ahead of the calendar.CrowdStrike reported total revenue of  731.6 million, a 37  increase year over year. ARR or Annual Recurring Revenue came in at  2.93 billion, which means it was up 14 times in just five years.If you look at free cash flow  shortened to FCF from now on  you see  227.4 million, compared to  157.5 million in the comparable quarter last year, so it's up 44.4 . If you divide FCF by revenue, 227.4 731.6, you get a 31  FCF margin.The Rule of 40 is a principle that states a company's combined revenue growth rate and profit should equal or exceed 40 . It's a good measure stick for high-growth companies, especially in SaaS - Software as a Service. As  profit  usually FCF is taken. So, 37  revenue growth   31  FCF margin means CrowdStrike scores 68  on the Rule of 40. Very impressive, and even more so in these challenging times.Many high-growth companies are finding it challenging to maintain high revenue growth, but CrowdStrike has been able to deliver growth near 40  consistently since its Initial Public Offering. CrowdStrike's last five years' total revenue compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, is 69 .As CrowdStrike has grown, it also has become more efficient. Gross margins have climbed by more than 20 percentage points in the five years ended in fiscal 2023, and subscription gross margin clocked in at 80  in the first half of fiscal 2024.I remain impressed with CrowdStrike's ability to keep cross-selling clients on additional software modules. As of July 31, 2023, an impressive 63  of subscribers had five or more modules, 41  had six or more, and 24  had seven or more.Combined with gross client retention figures, which has consistently been around 98  in the past five quarters, CrowdStrike's dollar-based retention rates have stayed above the company's 120  target threshold for more than five years.According to the company, its total addressable market or TAM is predicted to grow from approximately  100 billion this year to nearly  128 billion by 2025, even with its current set of features. CrowdStrike plans to expand its product roadmap, however, and take advantage of more cloud security opportunities, which will significantly increase its TAM. The company predicts a TAM of  225 billion by 2028.CrowdStrike was also profitable on a GAAP basis. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles net income was  8.5 million, which is a significant improvement compared to a loss of  49.3 million in the second quarter of the previous year. In EPS, this means  0.03, an increase compared to a loss of  0.21 in the second quarter of the previous year.CrowdStrike announced in its Q1 earnings that it had achieved GAAP profitability for the first time since it became a public company, and it maintained this profitability in its Q2 earnings.One more thing I like about CrowdStrike is the cash-to-debt ratio. The company has  3.17 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Total debt is  790.6 million, remaining stable. If we compare the cash and debt position for CrowdStrike over time, debt remains steady and the cash position is growing consistently, which is encouraging. You can see this in the graph below.For Q3, CrowdStrike guides for  775.4 to  778.0 million, slightly higher than the consensus of  774.14 million. On an adjusted basis, CrowdStrike projects earnings of  0.74 per share, substantially higher than the  0.60 consensus.Turning to the full fiscal year, the company raised its guidance to a range of  3.030.7 million to  3,042.9 million. That means CrowdStrike raised the low end of its yearly guidance by  30.7 million.CrowdStrike now sees a range between  2.80 and  2.84 per share for adjusted earnings for the full year, quite a bit higher than the consensus of 2.39 per share.While the earnings were great again, we have to remain vigilant, as competition is fierce in cybersecurity.Palo Alto Networks  PANW  posted revenue in its most recent quarter that was more than 2.5 times CrowdStrike's sales, and the  400 million in additional sales Palo Alto brought in was more than double CrowdStrike's new revenue on a dollar basis.At the same time, you could see this as an example of what CrowdStrike future could look like. If you look at growth as a percentage, CrowdStrike beats Palo Alto by quite a wide range  26  vs. 37 . The fact that Palo Alto is still growing so fast at its size may be great news for CrowdStrike .Of course, there's always the eternal threat of Microsoft, of course. But at the same time, all industries are competitive and with such high margins and great growth numbers, CrowdStrike must be doing something right.One lowlight for CrowdStrike is its stock-based compensation or SBC, which continues to weigh on GAAP profits. In the last 12 months, the company paid  588 million in SBC, which means 22  of revenue, which is high.At the same time, if you look at the shares outstanding, they were just up 1.89 , which is not exaggerated for a high-growth company like this and its lower than others in this industry, like SentinelOne, Zscaler and even a bigger player like Palo Alto Networks.Seen from this angle, the stock-based compensation doesn't look exaggerated.Now that we have looked back at the previous quarter, let's look forward to what the company has to offer in the future. We could already see a glimpse of that on Fal.Con, the company's annual conference.CrowdStrike hosted a three-day Fal.Con 2023 conference on Sept. 19-21 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is a great event for networking and connecting with partners, vendors, and customers.The whole focus was the brand-new launch of CrowdStrike's generative AI cybersecurity analyst, Charlotte AI. In a private customer preview, Charlotte AI introduces the ability for customers to ask natural language questions - in English and dozens of other languages - and receive intuitive answers from the Falcon platform.In addition to querying the massive datasets in the Falcon platform, Charlotte AI also benefits from CrowdStrike's unique human-validated content. This encompasses the highest-fidelity security data and trillions of security events, continuously improved through a human feedback loop from CrowdStrike's counter adversary operations and managed services threat intelligence and hunting team of experts.CEO George Kurtz demonstrated an impressive live demo of Charlotte AI for all attendants. The reactions were very positive. Charlotte AI can combine all information and reduce work that normally takes a full work day to minutes, all while you speak to it in normal speech. For those who were there, it was an impressive demonstration.Falcon cybersecurity platform is a foundational product. They launched quite a bit of new features, functionality, and modules.So, what is XDR  It stands for Extended Detection and Response, which is the next evolution of EDR - Endpoint Detection and Response. XDR provides a unified security incident detection and response platform that automatically collects and correlates data from multiple proprietary security components. With a single console to view and act on threat data, XDR enables security teams to uncover hidden and advanced threats easily. It also allows them to automate complex, multi-step responses across their entire security technology stacks.Approximately 80  of cyber security attacks exploit identity-based vectors. They launched the module ITDR - Identity Threat Detection and Response to prevent identity attacks. That single module generated more than  200 million in revenue and more than 2,000 customers in just 10 quarters.Just to make sure, CrowdStrike is not eating Okta's  lunch in the identity and access management space  they have a symbiotic relationship to be powerful against cyber security attacks.The company has recently acquired Bionic, which offers application run-time protection and fills a gap in the Application Security Posture Management or ASPM. With Bionic's addition, the CrowdStrike platform can now provide complete protection and visibility of risks for the entire cloud infrastructure, including the applications and services running within it.CrowdStrike achieves 100  protection, 100  visibility, and 100  detection in MITRE Engenuity attacks. MITRE Engenuity, a subsidiary of MITRE, through its public-private partnerships and federally funded R D centers, works across government and in partnership with industry to tackle challenges to the nation's safety, stability, and wellbeing.During the evaluations, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform stopped 13 of 13 protection scenarios spanning every stage of an attack, without relying on prior knowledge or legacy signatures. The evaluation demonstrated the power of a modern, AI-powered platform, rigorously testing CrowdStrike's pioneering EDR, XDR, identity protection, and threat intelligence capabilities, all delivered through a single, powerful agent that consolidates point products to stop breaches.At Fal.Con, CrowdStrike CFO Burt Podbere presented the financial roadmap for the next 5-7 years.Currently, CrowdStrike's ARR stands at  2.9 billion for fiscal year 2024, and they aim to achieve  10 billion in ARR in the next 5-7 years.This represents a 3.5x increase in ARR, a significant milestone for CrowdStrike. Given their track record of under-promising and over-delivering, it wouldn't be surprising if they achieved this target by the end of their fiscal year 2029, so in 2028.CFO Burt Podbere presented an opportunity for expansion. Currently, its penetration in global 2000 companies is less than 30 , leaving room for growth to 60  or more within the next seven years.Additionally, the company has less than 5  penetration in medium-sized companies, indicating big potential for growth in that market as well. They also have the opportunity to expand into international markets, with a projected revenue of over  100 billion by fiscal year 2028. The company also sees potential for growth within its existing customer base by encouraging the adoption of more modules. Currently, they have a growing network of more than 160 partners, each with a business worth over  10 million.CrowdStrike had presented a financial target model during the IPO, which they successfully achieved ahead of time, except for the operating margin, which they achieved in Q2, 2024, the quarter we discussed previously in this article. This already is impressive. I don't know if there is any research about this, but my feeling is that most companies wear rosy glasses during their IPO tour and project numbers that are much too optimistic.This year, CrowdStrike presented an updated financial target model that aims to increase their Subscription gross margin by 4 , operating margin by 9 , and free cash flow by 5 . These targets are expected to be achieved within 3-5 years. This is an encouraging sign and shows that the company is moving in the right direction.Charlotte AI looks to have everything to be a game-0changer in the enterprise world. For instance, imagine having to go through a 300-page security report to locate findings. Charlotte AI can save the security team's time and effort by reducing more than eight hours of work into minutes.CrowdStrike operates in a competitive cybersecurity industry, has become one of the leaders and keeps impressing with its revenue growth and innovation. While the macro environment conditions and price movements may affect sentiment, the long-term outlook remains very promising. I believe that CrowdStrike has the potential to capture an even larger share of the growing pie.From Growth To Value is an individual investor with a long-term perspective.

Major Middle East Conflicts And The Stock Market: What History Teaches,"To start the article with the most important message, let me say that I am deeply troubled by the human tragedy caused by the Hamas  Israel conflict. Accordingly, the movements of financial markets, and the analysis of stock prices, are of relatively minor significance comparedNevertheless, my focus on writing for Seeking Alpha continued to anchor on financial commentary. And following the events of what is happening in the Middle East, I aim to provide investors with a reference analysis of how conflicts in the Middle East have historically impacted global markets - specifically stocks. In that context, I provide insights on how the S P 500  performed surrounding the key events  1  Six-Day War ofConflicts in the Middle East can impact the S P 500 and global financial markets in several ways. Firstly, the Middle East is a major source of global oil production, and any instability in the region can disrupt oil supplies, leading to price spikes. And as investors certainly know and understand, higher oil prices can increase production costs for many S P 500 companies, which affects their profitability.Relating to being a key geography for oil supply and trade, the Middle East plays also a crucial role in international trade. For example, the Suez Canal  Egypt , is one of the world's most vital waterways, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, thus being of major importance for economies in Europe and Asia. Similarly, the Strait of Hormuz  Iran Oman  is arguably the world's most important chokepoint for global oil trade, with  of oil passing through the Strait every day  about 20  of global demand . In addition, in the Middle East, there are also many important global trade hubs for goods, including the Port of Jebel Ali  United Arab Emirates, Port of Jeddah  Saudi Arabia , Port of Haifa  Israel , Doha Port  Qatar , and the Chabahar Port  Iran .So far, the Hamas  Israel conflict has not impacted the S P 500 much. But markets are not entirely out of the woods yet. Specifically, investors should consider that conflicts in the Middle East have the potential to send tremors through the global political landscape, with second-order consequences affecting evolvement not only from key countries in the Middle East, most notably Iran but also international countries with an interest in oil supply and political  defense-support agreements, such as the U.S. and China.Personally, I see two main scenarios that investors should watch to assess the impact of the war on markets. In the first scenario, the conflict remains confined to Gaza and Israel, thus not affecting oil prices and the global economy much. In the second scenario, however, the conflict spills over to neighboring countries like Lebanon and Syria, perhaps also turning into a proxy war between Israel and Iran. Such an outcome may easily disrupt global oil markets, with Bloomberg Economics estimating that oil prices  to above  150 a barrel, clearly bringing the potential to tip an already weakened global economy into a recession.With that frame of reference, it is worth noting that by Friday 13, October, the price of oil  Brent benchmark  surged to its highest point since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict, surpassing  90 per barrel. The U.S. marker, West Texas Intermediate, also increased notably, by 5.9  to  87.69 per barrel.Now let's see what history teaches.Let's start with the most notable, direct example of a conflict involving Israel, the Six-Day War of 1967, Jun 5, 1967 - Jun 10, 1967. The event in question was a brief but highly consequential conflict between Israel and several neighboring Arab states, including Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, resulting in a crushing victory for Israel. While a significant geopolitical event, the Six-Day War did not have a notable, or sustained impact on the S P 500. In fact, as highlighted in the chart below, the start of the war only led to a short-lived 5-10  sell-off in the S P 500, which the index quickly recovered, continuing to chase new valuation highs.Next, the Gulf War was a conflict triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Contrary to the Six-Day War, the Gulf War caused a notable impact on global markets, including the S P 500. In the first week of the war, the S P 500 dropped sharply, falling over 9  on concerns relating to disruptions to the global oil supply chain. However, as the war continued, and international efforts helped to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait, markets rebounded quickly and aggressively. By the end of the war in February 1991, the S P 500 had recovered much of its losses and ended the year slightly positive.Next, in the spring of 2003, the U.S. led an invasion into Iraq, resulting in mixed effects on the S P 500. The market pressure on the S P 500 was confined mostly to the months leading up to the invasion, with the index declining by approximately 14  as markets correctly anticipated the war. But once the war started, markets didn't move much. In fact, after the capture of Baghdad, the stock market began a slow recovery, followed by a sustained bull market leading up to the Great Financial Crisis.Finally, the Arab Spring. This event is best understood as a series of protests and uprisings in various Middle Eastern and North African countries, that contributed to regional instability. Although the S P 500 did fluctuate during this period due to investor concerns about geopolitical instability and its impact on global markets, especially oil supply, the effects were not as pronounced as in some previous conflicts.The Hamas  Israel conflict sends a feeling of unease through the world, with worries extending to investor confidence in stocks. However, while broader concerns about what is happening in the Middle East are more than justified, the lessons of history do not suggest that a conflict in the Middle East is bearish for the S P 500.Reflecting on the insights of history, I hope this article can ease concerns about the stock market's reactions in response to the Hamas  Israel conflicts. In that way, we can again focus our energy and thoughts on how to support efforts to restore peace and reduce human suffering.

The Art Of Hedging For A Market Meltdown: 5 Strategies (Ranked),"Financial markets are never immune to turbulence, and history has shown that market meltdowns, though unpredictable, are a recurring part of the investment landscape. Whether triggered by economic downturns, geopolitical events, or unforeseen crises, market meltdowns can wreak havoc on portfoliosIn this article, we explore the art of positioning for a market meltdown. We'll delve into a range of strategies and assets that historically have shown resilience during downturns, helpingThe first hedging idea that I want to discuss is also the most obvious  Buying put options on the S P 500 . For those who are not familiar with puts, and options, put options are financial contracts that give investors for a relatively small fee  premium  the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific asset, such as a stock, at a predetermined price before or at a specified future date. This means that as the S P 500 falls, the value of the long puts rises, effectively providing insurance against losses in the portfolio. Accordingly, these options contracts provide investors with the ability to profit from a decline in the S P 500 index, giving investors exposure to a direct, inverse correlation to the performance of the broad market.What is so great about options as a hedge, in my opinion, is that buying puts gives investors the opportunity to cap downside, as limited by the maximum loss equal to the options premia outlay. Moreover, puts also allow investors to achieve significant, and tailored, exposure to the market's downside with a relatively small upfront investment. This  implied leverage  can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the hedge, basically allowing investors to insure their portfolio for 180-240 days at a 2-5  implied interest on the portfolio  with costs dependent on implied volatility, interest rate, dividend payments, strike and time to expiration . By selecting different strike prices and expiration dates, long puts offer flexibility in designing a hedge that aligns with individual objectives and expectations regarding the market's performance. Scenarios can be simulated here -- on the .Finally, options on major indices such as the S P 500 are highly liquid and accessible through all major brokerage platforms.The price of an option depends on market volatility. Higher volatility raises the price. This is bad for the put options strategy discussed in the previous argument, as times of market uncertainty usually come with elevated implied volatility levels on options, thus making the Strategy somewhat expensive for investors. An opportunity to avoid paying high premia to hedge the portfolio, and actually take advantage of the high implied volatility during times of market stress relates to call overwrite strategies, such as pursued by the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF .To give readers a better understanding of , I point out that JEPI generates income by leveraging a combination of options selling and investments in U.S. large-cap stocks. Its primary objective is to provide investors with a consistent monthly income flow derived from the premiums earned through option sales and dividends from the stock holdings. To achieve this, JEPI creates a well-diversified equity portfolio with a focus on minimizing volatility, mostly dividend stocks, and complements the equity holdings with short call options on the S P 500.By selling call options, JEPI agrees to sell its underlying assets at a predetermined strike price, if the options are exercised. In ideal cases, the call options sold may not be exercised by the buyers, allowing investors to retain ownership of the underlying assets, and continue to retain the benefit from any future appreciation in the asset's value. Now, while the call writing may also cap an investor's upside potential, it also establishes a level of protection though the options premium, which can be especially valuable during market meltdowns  and this article is all about downside , as the premium income from selling call options can provide a buffer against potential losses in the underlying assets.Buying treasuries is another no-brainer when markets behave nervously. Historically, in times of market turmoil and uncertainty, U.S. Treasuries, particularly longer-term bonds, have emerged as a safe-haven asset and a classic and effective hedge against systematic risk. Again, the fundamental reason for the Treasuries' value as hedge is actually quite simple  When market conditions turn turbulent, investors often seek refuge in government-backed securities. And talking about government securities, debt of the U.S. government continues to be one of the most highly regarded investment options on strong creditworthiness, despite the most recent controversies relating to the . Also, investors should not forget that the Dollar remains the world's most-widely used, and accepted, currency.The attractiveness of buying Treasuries is of course also dependent on the broader fundamental backdrop of fixed income securities. In that context, the value of U.S. government backed securities shines very bright. For reference, the 10-year treasury yield is currently quoted at a 4.6  yield, outshining even some of the most highly regarded dividend benchmarks. Moreover, it is important to recognize that there may be another argument supporting an investment in treasuries -- namely the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates. With an implied effective duration of approximately 8, for every 100 basis points that the Fed cuts, the 10-year Treasury is expected to appreciate by 8-10  in value. The interest rate duration sensitivity is even higher for longer dated securities, such as the Depending on the nature of the downside risk, buying energy-focused equity securities may be a great way to hedge systemic beta. Specifically, I see energy securities very strong in context of geopolitical tensions  especially relating to the Middle East  and inflation. More specifically, the reason why I like energy in times of market uncertainty is relatively simple, and fourfold  First, many energy companies are known for their consistent income and dividend payments. This income not only shields investors during market turmoil but can also serve as a source for reinvestment in undervalued assets  Second, energy assets have generally a unique quality of acting as a hedge against inflation. While inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, energy companies often experience rising revenues and profits during inflationary periods due to increasing energy prices  Third, energy stocks display defensive characteristics, akin to those found in sectors like consumer staples or utilities. No matter the economic or political backdrop, energy remains an essential product with inelastic demand  Fourth, investors should consider that market meltdowns are often succeeded by recoveries. Energy ETFs can enable investors to position for the eventual rebound, as energy consumption typically resurges as the economy regains stability.To be fair, the energy argument per se encompasses securities in both traditional fossil fuel industries, as well as renewable energy markets. Expanding on the dividend argument, however, for downside protection I would prefer the fossil fuel exposure. That said, I recommend the Lastly, as a final asset to hedge against a market meltdown, let us not forget the yellow metal, gold. In times of economic turmoil and market uncertainty, gold has a consistent, long-dating and strong track record of performing well. Historically, the value of gold has tended to rise when other assets, such as stocks or currencies, have faced value depreciation or instability. In fact, gold often exhibits an inverse relationship with stock markets, meaning when equities face steep declines, the demand for gold tends to surge as investors seek a safe-haven asset  like Treasuries .Moreover, Gold is often considered an effective hedge against inflation  like energy discussed above , something that is well acknowledged globally. Historically, the value of gold has transcended geographic boundaries and currency fluctuations, offering a level of stability in the face of international economic challenges.Now, while gold boasts numerous advantages as a hedge, it is essential to also understand that gold does not generate income, and its value can be influenced by various factors, including currency movements and market sentiment. As such, if you buy an ounce of gold, and store it in a safe for 10 years, after 10 years you still will have an ounce of gold. And the extent of which the gold investment appreciated in value depends entirely on market participant's willingness to buy the yellow metal. Thus, buying gold is my least favorite hedging instrument, although I may consider buying some gold-focused productive assets such as miners.Preparing for a market meltdown may be a prudent strategy in an ever-changing financial landscape. Now, while it's impossible to predict the exact timing or triggers for such events, having a well-considered plan in place can help investors weather  unforeseen  storms. The strategies discussed, from  1  utilizing options,  2  buying alternative investments like JEPI,  3  investing in Treasuries, and diversifying with assets like  4  energy and  5  gold, can all play a valid role in safeguarding your portfolio. Sophisticated readers, and long-term Cavenagh Research followers, may argue that my article is missing Credit Default Swaps  CDS . This is true. But while CDS can be a valid strategy for hedging against credit-related risks during a market meltdown, investors should also consider that they come with complexity, counterparty risk, and accessibility challenges. Accordingly, retail investors may find it more practical to explore the strategies mentioned in this article. That said, it's crucial to remember that risk management is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and the right strategy should align with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

But housing permits declined, and existing home sales declined to a 28 year low, excepting one week in 2010.RatesGraph at .Yield curveGraph at .30-Year conventional mortgage rate  from   graph at linkWith the new highs in interest rates in the past month, their rating reversed from neutral to negative.

Importantly, purchase mortgage applications which had bounced around in a fairly narrow range of between 155 and 180 since last October, in the past month have sunk to repeated new lows, several weeks ago at a 28 year lowReal estate loans turned ever more positive during 2022. This was helped by inflation in house prices. This indicator declined by 1 3rd from its peak YoY  change in August, and so became the last real estate indicator to decline from positive to neutral. If it falls below 6.0  YoY, it will be a negative.The Federal Reserve has discontinued this weekly series. Data is now only released monthly. August data was released three weeks agoNo recession has happened without a YoY real M1 negative, or YoY real M2 below  2.5 . Real M2 fell below that threshold in March 2022.

I also average the previous two quarters together, until at least 100 companies have actually reported. The average of Q2 and Q3 is  2.1 .

The Chicago Fed's Adjusted Index's real break-even point is roughly -0.25. In the leverage index, a negative number is good, a positive poor. The historical breakeven point has been -0.5 for the unadjusted Index. The leverage index had improved from negative to neutral, but has now retreated back to negative. The adjusted index has improved beyond its breakeven point, so has returned from neutral to positive. The unadjusted index has also moved close enough to its breakeven point to turn neutral.The Miller Score is designed to look 52 weeks ahead for whether or not a recession is possible. Any score over 500 means no recession. This number fell below that threshold at the beginning of August 2021, so not only is it negative, but we are now well into the  recession eligible  time period.The St. Louis Financial Stress index is one where a negative score is a positive for the economy, and during its limited existence, has risen above zero before a recession by less than one year. It did so in December, and then again briefly in March, but almost immediately decreased back below zero again and stayed there.The BCIp, which remained very positive until very recently, deteriorated sharply earlier this year, and is below its recession-signaling threshold, although it has improved in the past several months, and indeed is now above its recession warning signal level, and IM has rescinded its recession warning.Ever since 2021, both measures of the US  were well above  5  higher YoY, and so negative. Recently, both declined into the neutral range, and in the past several months, both turned positive.Bloomberg Commodity IndexGraph at .Bloomberg Industrial metals ETF  from   graph at linkDuring the Boom of 2021, commodity prices soared, and total commodities were very positive. While industrial commodities remain in the bottom 1 3rd of its 12 month range, the broader index is in the middle 1 3rd of that range, so the former remains negative while the latter is neutral.  Note, importantly, that because this particular decline in commodity prices may reflect increased supply rather than destruction of demand, the message of a nearly -10  YoY decline may have been very different from usual. S P 500  from   graph at linkStocks made several new 3 month highs and even a new 12  month high earlier this year, including at the end of July. But as of one week ago, they also made a new 3 month low. Thus this indicator changed from positive to neutral. If there is no new 3 month high by the end of October, it will turn negative.The regional average is more volatile than the ISM manufacturing index, but usually correctly forecasts its month-over-month direction. Since last spring, these gradually declined to neutral and then negative. They remain negative now, although they have become  less negative  recently.Initial jobless claimsGraph at .In spring, revisions caused major changes in this index. The 4 week average has been higher YoY for 4  months, but not at levels which have in the past triggered a  recession warning.  Although the absolute numbers are very low, they remain in the 5 -10  higher YoY range, and so remain at a negative rating.Temporary staffing index  from the   graph at linkThis was extremely positive at the end of 2021.

Measuring by 1 year, both have turned negative.TED was above 0.50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions. Since early 2019 the TED spread had remained positive, except the worst of the coronavirus downturn, until last spring. It has been very choppy recently, varying between neutral and negative. It turned positive again in May. As of two months ago, it appears to have been discontinued, although I am searching for another source.LIBOR has been increasing consistently well into its negative range.After a very positive 2021, this measure declined to less than half its best YoY level, thus changing to neutral. It remained in that range all this year until two weeks ago, when it broke above 2.0, changing its rating to positive. Then it declined back into negative, before turning back to positive this week. I have been measuring its 7 day average to avoid daily whipsaws.Open Table's data indicate that by early April reservations had stabilized at slightly below zero YoY, and they have generally faded from -2  to -7  since.The Redbook index remained positive almost without exception since the beginning of 2021 until last October.

This week they were positive again.Harpex increased to near record highs again early in 2022, but has since backed off all the way to new lows. BDI traced a similar trajectory, before rebounding sharply earlier this year, but remains negative.I am wary of reading too much into price indexes like this, since they are heavily influenced by supply  as in, a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade  as well as demand. Since the end of March 2021, against terrible comparisons, this metric had been positive, typically running at a double digits higher YoY percentage growth. In spring 2022, it turned negative, but the YoY comparisons gradually improved. It finally improved to positive for about two months, before turning negative again for a short time. It remains positive this week.Independent, economic   financial data in real time on-chainThanks to a commenter for bringing this indicator to my attention. This is a daily update to inflation, similar to the  billion prices project  of the last decade  which required a subscription . I have not added this to my list below of the status of coincident or leading indicators, but needless to say it is an up-to-the-moment reading on this very important indicator.Below are this week's spreadsheets of the long leading, short leading, and coincident readings. Check marks indicate the present reading. If there has been a change this week, the prior reading is marked with an XThe long leading indicators remain very negative with interest rates at multi-decade highs. It is hard to believe that short leading and coincident indicators can withstand this onslaught.The short leading indicators remain neutral, but have stopped improving. Their recent improvement has now translated to the coincident indicators, which continue to improve almost every week and are now solidly positive.My main focus remains on the short leading indicators. To repeat what I wrote in the past three weeks, I am looking to see if more of the short leading indicators begin to roll over. Commodity prices ex-oil have did indeed hit new 12 month lows. Ex-geopolitical events, I expect short leading indicators to soften further.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Short Inno On Sight,"Building technology company, Inno Holdings Inc. , is set to go public on 1 November this year, with the firm said to be offering 2.5 million shares at an indicative price range of According to McKinsey Global Institute s report, Over the last two decades, labor-productivity in the industry has grown by 1  a year, while in the global economy it has grown by 2.8  a year, and in manufacturing it has grown by 3.6  a year. MGI s data shows that only a quarter of construction firms have matched the labor-productivity growth of the economies in which they operate.  dog the industry. Were the industry to catch up the the global economy s labor-productivity growth,  1.6 trillion in value would be created. A third of that opportunity is within the United States. Inno s market opportunity is worth around  40 billion.Added to poor productivity and overruns, Inno believes that the sector suffers from structural labor shortages, which have served to increase labor costs. This is where Inno believes it can make a vital contribution and earn attractive profits. Inno operates out of five acres in Brookshire, Texas, where it manufactures 15,000 linear feet of product per day. Inno s proprietary cold-formed steel-framing technology and other building innovations, have been developed to ease the inefficiencies and waste in traditional lumber-based construction. This steel-framing technology decreases construction times by at least 50 , by prefabricating panels, and they can reduce labor costs by a similar magnitude thanks to reduced construction times. Similarly, the cost of steel mill products is in secular decline, making them increasingly competitive with softwood lumber. Although softwood lumber continues to be more expensive than steel mill products, Inno believes that demand for its steel framing products will continue to grow in the long run because construction times are lower, which in turn reduces labor costs, the quality is higher, and because of the insurance savings. The company cites fiscal 2022, when steel prices rose 143  but revenue rose nearly 49.9 . With softwood lumber tracking steel mill prices closer, this allows management to assert that their products will remain competitive going forward.The company, whose name is derived from  innovation , develops steel studs, tracks, and headers to increase efficiencies across the construction process, improve structural solutions and reduce labor costs. The company s computer numerical controlled  CCNC  machine operations punch the holes in Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing  MEP  channels, reducing the number of steps undertaken in a job site, compared to traditional methods. These cold-formed steel members are created by intelligent machines and novel technologies and the firm also offers solutions to turn raw materials into steel framing products and prefabricated homes. Per the , Inno believes that by  reducing construction times while providing more affordable, environmentally sustainable, and durable solutions compared to traditional construction materials and methods , it will disrupt the  10 trillion global construction industry.Founded in 2019, Inno has grown the number of customers it serves from 20 in fiscal 2021 to 48 in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, the firm had 11 repeat customers. In fiscal 2022, the firm has four customers who each contribute to an average of 10  of revenues, so there are some risks entailed in the firm s revenue.With the growth in the number of customers has come an increase in revenue, with revenue growing from  3,003,624 in fiscal 2021 to  4,502,568 in fiscal 2022. In the first half of fiscal 2023, the firm had  397,614, representing an 81  decline in revenue compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, when the firm earned  2,076,946. Management says that this occurred because customer construction activity declined from 26 in the first half of fiscal 2022 to 16 in the first half of fiscal 2023, resulting in a corresponding revenue per customer decline from  79,883 to  23,466. The riskiness of the company s revenues increased, with the number of repeat customers declining to six in the first half of fiscal 2023, and the number of customers accounting for at least 10  of revenue rose to five, with one customer accounting for 28  of revenue. In addition, the firm s backlog of remaining payments from signed customer contracts was between  15 million and  20 million, which management expects will be paid within the 24 months following March 31, 2023.Stripping away the non-recurring and non-operating elements of Inno s GAAP earnings allows us to arrive at a measure of their . This exercise shows us that the firm s core business has been stronger than its GAAP earnings show. When we add back non-core items such as the non-recurring stock compensation expense of  300,000 in 2022, or the  121,345 payments to non-controlling interest in the same year, the core profitability we observe is higher than expected but still deeply negative.Inno s growth has not been accompanied by any positive net operating profit after tax  NOPAT , with NOPAT deteriorating from - 227226 in 2021 to - 502,452 in 2022.Inno s operating expenses have steadily risen, from  3.31 million in fiscal 2021, to  5.3 million in fiscal 2022. Operating expenses fell from  2.47 million in the first half of fiscal 2022 to  1.8 million In the first half of fiscal 2023, driven by the decline in  revenues, which led to a corresponding decline in cost of materials and labor. This suggests that costs are tied to revenue, and so, there is a great deal of protection inherent in the operating model. It should be added that, given that materials are locally sourced, the company is less prone to disruptions from geopolitical events such as the Russo-Ukrainian War, which will tend to soften price increases.Using the convergence formula as the basis for our calculations, we can estimate what we can call a zero-growth value for shareholders. In other words, we can determine what the value of the business will be, if any growth the company enjoys does not add any shareholder value. We can estimate a per share value, assuming 20.75 million outstanding shares, of - 0.31, well short of the  4- 5 range that the company is seeking. Trends in the last year do not suggest that things have improved. In a word, Inno is not ready to go public.Source  Author CalculationsAlthough Inno operates in a market with enormous inefficiencies, and a high potential for growth and attractive profits, this has not translated into profitability. Indeed, the company s fortunes seem worse than ever. The proposed IPO seems driven by a need to raise capital without consideration for the firm s ability to earn shareholder value. Avoid or short Inno, do not buy it.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Nine Energy Service Bonds Offering Attractive 16% Yield,"Nine Energy Service  is an energy service company that specializes in oil and gas field preparation. Earlier this year, the company engaged in an unconventional refinancing of debt Nine Energy's profit and loss performance is mixed for 2023 so far. The company has grown revenue by  65 million in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period a year ago. Expenses are also higher, but not by as much as income from operations, which has more than doubled to  16 million compared to last year. Unfortunately, the new debt deal has increased interestDespite the loss from operations, Nine Energy is currently generating positive free cash flow. Thanks to a change in working capital, cash flow from operations was  37 million higher than a year ago. After accounting for  12 million in capital expenditures, the company is generating free cash flow of about  19 million. In order to pay off their maturing 2023 notes, Nine Energy engaged in offering the current notes plus a  40 million draw on its ABL credit facility. Nine Energy's balance sheet highlights the risk of the investment. All the company's assets are collateralized against debt. Shareholder equity is modestly negative at  13 million but improving. One thing that is positive is that there is over  200 million in current assets against the  332 million in long term debt. It's also positive that the company's debt structure is essentially comprised of an ABL credit facility and the 2028 maturing notes, which is simpler than many of the CCC rating companies I've reviewed. I am hopeful that Nine Energy will utilize some of its cash and positive free cash flow to cut into its ABL facility and make the 2028 noteholders the only creditors, which would be beneficial to recovery if the company were forced to restructure. At first, I was skeptical about a company being able to support debt with a 13  coupon. In order to be able to make debt service payments on that level of debt without incurring additional borrowing, companies need to generate a return on invested capital  ROIC  greater than their cost of capital. In the case of Nine Energy Service, the ROIC for the first half of 2023 is greater than 15 , a good turnaround compared to a year ago.It's important to note that Nine Energy is operating under challenging conditions in the energy market. As the company disclosed in its most recent 10-Q, energy prices impact exploration and production, which has a direct impact on their business. Oil prices have been down, but natural gas prices have been extremely low thanks to a mild winter. Natural gas prices are at pre-pandemic levels and have spent nearly all of 2023 below  3. Should a cold winter occur, or geopolitical events cause upward pressure on oil prices, Nine Energy should benefit with growth in cash flows and profitability.  Despite a difficult year in energy, Nine Energy Service is turning around its financial challenges. The company is now generating positive free cash flow and is able to service its existing debt without the need for further borrowing. With one of the highest coupons in debt markets, investors should enjoy the income while waiting for the company to complete its turnaround.CUSIP  Price   91.00Coupon  13.00Yield to Maturity  15.9Maturity Date  2 1 2028Credit Rating  Moody's S P  NR CCC   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Alimentation Couche-Tard: Slim Margin Of Safety In Its Valuation,"Alimentation Couche-Tard  first quarter 2024 results reflected a strong performance. This growth is largely attributed to exceptional fuel margins in the U.S. and consistent, strong results in Canada. U.S. fuel margins reached a record due to advantageous market conditionsATD CAFor the first quarter of 2024, net earnings stood at  834.1 million, or  0.85 per diluted share. This is in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which saw earnings of  872.4 million, also at  0.85 per diluted share. When adjusted, the net earnings for the quarter reached around  838.0 million, slightly down from the  875.0 million of the previous fiscal year's first quarter. However, the adjusted diluted net earnings per share showcased a growth of 1.2 , moving from  0.85 in the previous year to  0.86 in the current one.ATD CA reported a strong first quarter FY24 result. This upswing has its roots in two primary factors  the outstanding fuel margins from the U.S. market and a consistently strong performance in Canada.A milestone for ATD CA, the U.S. fuel margins peaked at 50.05 cents per gallon  CPG . This record performance can be traced back to favorable market conditions and strategic improvements ATD CA made in its supply chain. Recent data from the EIA underscores this, indicating a rise in gas demand to 8.410 million b d in the week ending September 15th. Concurrently, US gasoline stocks decreased by 831,000 barrels. International events, such as Russia's temporary halt on diesel and gasoline exports, further exerted pressure on global fuel markets. Given these dynamics, I'm inclined to believe that ATD CA's fuel margins will sustain higher profitability levels in the foreseeable future.Compared to its counterparts, ATD CA is primed to lead in terms of fuel margins. This edge is due in part to shifts in the industry landscape, especially the mounting operational costs for smaller operators. Such changes have positively affected ATD CA's break-even margin compared to the industry's underperformers. While U.S. fuel volumes didn't quite meet predictions, ATD CA's strategic initiatives, including Global Fuel Day and the Circle K rebranding, are contributing to a rise in volumes and diminishing cost strains.In-store sales in the U.S. witnessed modest growth of 2.1  year-over-year. However, ATD CA remains proactive, employing strategies to retain its share in the declining cigarette market. The company's growth trajectory is also marked by its emphasis on initiatives like Fresh Food Fast, private-label offerings, and innovative beverage sales. Nonetheless, factors such as waning stimulus support and escalating fuel costs are applying pressure on consumer expenditure.On the international front, while Canada basks in substantial growth, Europe grapples with some hurdles. Canadian in-store sales surged by 6.4 , bolstered by beverage sales and competitive fuel pricing. Europe, however, faced a 1.5  drop in fuel volumes year-over-year and an 8.21 CPL in fuel margins, challenges exacerbated by ATD CA's intricate supply chain in the region. Additionally, sales in Europe and other regions were impacted by tax alterations in Hong Kong and comparisons with previous lockdown periods.I believe ATD CA can grow at 13 . This anticipation stems from its impressive first-quarter 2024 performance, particularly its robust fuel gross margin. This margin enhancement results from both favorable market conditions and strategic supply chain enhancement made by the company, coupled with escalating fuel demand. Events like Russia's decision to momentarily suspend diesel and gasoline exports have further tightened the global fuel market, pushing prices higher. Globally, Canada's significant growth somewhat balances out the weaker sales observed in Europe. Canada s growth was driven by beverage sales and attractive fuel prices.Currently, ATD CA forward P E is trading at 16.81x, aligning closely with its industry counterparts. In terms of EBITDA margins, ATD CA excels beyond its peers, showcasing a margin of 8.02 , which surpasses the industry median of 6.37 . However, it's worth noting that ATD CA's next twelve months  NTM  revenue growth rate of 6  lags slightly behind the industry median of 8 . Thus, I view its forward P E as reasonable.By applying ATD CA existing forward P E, I've calculated a target price of  61.28 for ATD CA, which is currently below its traded price. Given the slim margin of safety, despite ATD CA's commendable financial performance, strong in-store sales, and anticipated sustained strong fuel margins, I'd recommend a hold rating on the stock.There are potential upside opportunities connected to ATD CA. One positive factor stems from the stability of the global market. While ATD CA faces challenges in specific regions, it also has the potential to benefit from stable markets in other areas. As uncertainties in Europe and other regions get addressed, and if there are increases in fuel volumes along with favorable changes in regional taxation, these developments could enhance ATD CA's overall financial performance, resulting in share price improvements.Another potential avenue for growth centers on further enhancements in fuel margins. If external factors like prolonged or worsening geopolitical events further disrupt the supply-demand balance, this could result in increased fuel demand, presenting an opportunity for ATD CA to further expand their fuel margins.In summary, ATD CA's impressive first quarter FY24 results are driven by exceptional fuel margins in the U.S. market, consistent in-store sales in the U.S., and strong international in-store sales. ATD CA stands out as a front-runner in fuel margins when compared to its industry peers, partly due to the evolving industry landscape and the mounting operational costs affecting smaller operators.While U.S. in-store sales showed moderate year-over-year growth, Canada experienced thriving sales despite encountering its own set of challenges. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the impact of reduced stimulus support and the rising costs of fuel, which are squeezing consumer spending.Looking ahead, the company appears poised for ongoing profitability, bolstered by increasing fuel demand and strategic supply chain improvements.Considering these factors and the relatively slim margin of safety, despite ATD CA's robust financial performance, strong in-store sales, and the anticipation of sustained strong fuel margins, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

What To Make Of The Current Geopolitical Situation (Israel) And Implications For Oil?,"First and foremost, the situation in both Israel and Gaza is horrible beyond our wildest imagination. This article is not about politics, and it will not focus on what's right or wrong. Instead, we will do our best to think through what thisWTI and Brent, as of this writing, are up  3 , with WTI  trading above  85 and Brent above  87. Initially, at the close of Friday, WSJ published a report noting that the U.S. is close to finalizing a megadeal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It even contained a quote stating that the Saudis may increase production by early 2024 if prices are too high. Soon after, Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel. If you want to thoroughly review the events, Some of you may wonder, what does this have to do with oil  Historically speaking, geopolitical risk premiums are usually embedded into the price of oil in case of supply disruptions. In this case, Israel is not a major oil producer, so what's the catch  The catch, in our view, has to do with Iran's potential involvement in this whole ordeal. WSJ published a piece noting that Iran's senior officials helped plan this attack months ago.While the U.S. has not condemned Iran or associated Iran in any way with these attacks just yet, it does make you wonder what this means in terms of oil sanctions on Iran.For starters, we need context to what we are writing. In June,  noting that Iran is already back in the oil market. Since then, IEA has confirmed via its figures that Iran's oil production is close to  3.1 million b d. Our supply   demand model assumes  3.3 million b d, and official Iranian figures support that production is around  3.3 million b d.Putting all of this together, Iran is exporting close to  2 million b d. Visible tanker exports account for  1.5 to  1.6 million b d, while shadow exports account for  400k b d.Since H2 2022, the Biden administration has turned a blind eye to Iranian crude exports. As we wrote earlier in the year, this was most notable in the rapid decline in Iranian floating storage.With floating storage gone and crude exports back to  2 million b d  500 to  800k b d below the previous peak , what's the chance that Iranian crude exports drop going forward  Perhaps the U.S. does nothing and leaves Iran as is, but what probability would we assign to thatIn my view, while the risk of a major loss is low, we think Iranian crude exports would move lower in the following months. We think the average would fall from  2 million b d to  1.6 million b d. In terms of visible tankers, this means Iran's crude exports would drop closer to  1.2 million b d.While it won't be much of a decline, it will be compounded by the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia will continue with their voluntary cuts into year-end and possibly well into H1 2024.Looking at our latest supply   demand update, we made a few important assumption changesIn essence, global oil inventory draws should continue and accelerate once global refinery maintenance season finishes by month-end. And if the U.S. starts to enforce some of the sanctions on Iranian crude exports, then our balance could surprise to the upside. But with a deficit of  2.2 million b d, the lack of production decline from Iran won't make that much of a difference, either.On the other hand, with no mega deal on the horizon  between Israel and Saudi , the possibility of a production increase from the Saudis also decreases. Pierre Andurand has also argued in  that the Saudis won't be interested in increasing production until Brent is at least  110 bbl. With Brent trading at  87, we will have to wait a bit before that becomes a reality.In conclusion, global oil inventories should accelerate downward. But the physical market will keep fighting the mainstream worries over an incoming recession. Fund flows will ebb and flow, so oil prices won't skyrocket anytime soon. Only an extremely tight physical oil market could change perception. Until then, we see prices grinding higher, with frequent retracements to solidify technical support levels.For readers looking to add energy stocks, Q4 will provide ample opportunities. We see energy stocks lagging the broad move higher in oil. Consolidation and M A are heating up, so you will see more and more mergers announced. But more importantly, always remember that with these oil prices, the energy companies you own are generating free cash flow hand over fist. Please be patient, fundamentals are on your side.For energy investors, the 2014-2020 bear market has been incredibly brutal. But as the old adage goes, .  Our deep understanding of US shale and other oil market fundamentals leads us to believe that we are finally entering . Investors should take advantage of the incoming trend and be positioned in real assets like precious metals and energy stocks.

Gold: Interest Rates Peaking During A Seasonal Bottom Could Be Explosive For Prices!,"Atlanta Federal Reserve  on Friday said he doesn't envision interest rate cuts happening until well into 2024.He emphasized that it's unlikely for interest rates to be reduced before the middle ofIn light of several recent speeches by Federal Reserve members, including Chair Jerome Powell's comments on Thursday, the market's assessment has shifted away from the possibility of a rate increase during the upcoming FOMC meeting on October 31-November 1. The likelihood of an increase in December is only 25 , according to the CME Group's FedThe financial markets are currently expecting the potential for two or three quarter-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. One potential reason for the Fed to contemplate reducing rates would be a slowing or recession in economic growth. Although Bostic mentioned that he doesn't anticipate a recession, he did acknowledge changing economic conditions, with business contacts indicating their preparations for an economic slowdown.He made it clear that his outlook does not include a recession, but he does foresee a slowdown in economic activity, and he expects inflation to eventually reach the 2  target. Bostic made these comments in the context of significant movements in financial markets, especially in Treasury yields. While the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield  briefly surpassed the psychologically significant 5  level earlier in the session, it subsequently moderated and was most recently trading around 4.97 .Gold prices are influenced by various factors, including interest rates and inflation expectations. Here's how Bostic's statements could impact gold pricesIt's important to note that the relationship between central bank statements and asset prices is complex, and many other factors also come into play, including economic data, geopolitical events, and currency movements. Therefore, while Bostic's comments can have an impact, they are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding and predicting gold price movements. To get a more accurate assessment of the situation and its effect on gold prices, let's take a look at the weekly standard deviation report published in the Market Place section as Mean Reversion Trading and see what short-term trading opportunities we can identify.Oct. 22, 2023 9 26 AM ETThis comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of monitoring key indicators and adhering to prudent risk management practices.

Seacor Marine Holdings: Strong Q2 Results Likely Just The Beginning - Buy,"  SEACOR Marine Holdings or  SEACOR  is a leading provider of marine As of June 30, 2023, the company operated a diverse fleet of 59 support vessels, of which 57 were owned or leased in and two were managed on behalf of unaffiliated third parties  SEACOR's closest publicly-traded peer is Tidewater , a company I have been very  on for quite some time now, based on the ongoing recovery in offshore drilling markets and persistent tailwinds from recent geopolitical events.While Tidewater cleaned up its  in bankruptcy six years ago, SEACOR has managed to avoid ChapterOn Wednesday, the company  strong second quarter results with revenues, average day rates, direct vessel profit, and EBITDA all reaching new multi-year highsManagement attributed the ongoing improvement to the company's international operations in Africa, Europe and the Middle East while domestic activity in the Gulf of Mexico was impacted by the recent  of leading shallow water player Cox Operating LLC as well as delays in contract startups for several offshore wind projects in the Northeast.In addition, one of the company's premium liftboats remained offhire for previously reported repairs. Management expects the vessel to return to service during the second half of the year.As a result, direct vessel profit for the company's domestic operations turned negative in Q2.During the second quarter, SEACOR  the shipyard financing for three Chinese-built platform supply vessels  PSVs , albeit the terms were nothing to write home about.The new interest rate is more than double the rate charged by the shipyard, but admittedly, the interest environment has changed quite meaningfully as of late.Please note that competitor Tidewater recently  to place a  250 million unsecured bond at a similar interest rate while SEACOR's recent  to attract investors for a note offering at competitive rates have been unsuccessful as stated by management in the Given the strong business environment, CEO John Gellert's optimism in the  regarding further improvements going forward is hardly a surpriseWith average day rates expected to increase further and fleet utilization likely to exceed 80  sooner rather than later, SEACOR should start to generate meaningful earnings and free cash flow in the near future.At this point, I am still looking for SEACOR to generate between  60 million and  70 million in EBITDA this year and cash flow from operations to turn substantially positive in the second half.With higher utilization and more vessels rolling over from legacy contracts to prevailing market rates, the company should achieve annual EBITDA well in excess of  100 million in 2024. Please note that in contrast to many competitors, SEACOR expenses all maintenance and drydocking costs rather than capitalizing them on the balance sheet, which understates margins and profitability relative to peers.Despite some weakness in the company's domestic operations, SEACOR Marine Holdings reported strong Q2 results with revenues, average day rates, direct vessel profit, and EBITDA all reaching new multi-year highs.With a substantial increase in profitability and cash flow generation anticipated over the coming quarters, investors should consider initiating or adding to existing positions in SEACOR Marine Holdings as the ongoing recovery in offshore drilling activity continues to be supported by persistent tailwinds from recent geopolitical events.In addition, a comprehensive debt refinancing at favorable terms could provide an additional, near-term catalyst for the stock.Given ongoing, strong market conditions, I am increasing my 2024 EBITDA expectation for SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. to  120 million and reiterate my  rating on the shares while raising my price target to  15 based on a 2024 EBITDA EV multiple of 6x.

TORM: The Company Has Strong Financials And Market Outlook For H2 2023,"Figure 1   TRMD s leverage conditionTo support the company s capability of higher growth and shareholder returns, it is worth noting that TORM has reached its highest free cash flow in recent years. The company s cash from operations surged to circa  820 million in TTM versus  502 million at the end of 2022, which aligned with  393 million of capital spending resulting in approximately  427 million of free cash flow. This improvement demonstrates the management s capability of generating stable distributions even in times of higher commodity prices  see Figure 2 . Moreover, TORM is going to pay a dividend payment of  1.5 per share, and based on their 82,500,000 outstanding shares, it will lead to approximately  124 million of distribution payment, which is easily self-funded by their free cash flow.Figure 2   TRMD s free cash flow  in millionsNotwithstanding a healthy financial position, the company expects to generate lower earnings at the end of the third quarter versus the second quarter. In other words, by mid-August, they covered 74  of the third quarter at  30,534 per day, which shows lower rates than the second quarter  as a result of refinery maintenance, product stock draws and slightly lower demand for products.  However , we expect the markets to recover, and we expect a stronger fourth quarter.  The Figure 3 -After analyzing TORM s cash and leverage conditions, we realize that the company is in a healthy position to perform well even in periods of volatile commodity prices. Albeit the management declined their EBITDA generation  from  750-1,100 million for the end of 2023 due to the current fleet size, including published acquisitions and divestments of vessels, their stock valuation is still undervalued. As Figure 4 demonstrates, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. It is worth mentioning that during the last five years, the company s net debt level grew by 4.7  on average. However, as they have generated a good amount of free cash flow in the first half of 2023, their net debt level might decrease more if the management decided to direct the free cash flow to pay back its net debt.Figure 4   TRMD stock valuationIt is crucial to note that a high portion of TORM s revenue is from its product tanker fleet. As a result, even small volatility in supply and demand in this market and their impact on freight rates may significantly affect the company s cash flows and operations. Moreover, TRMD employs the majority of its vessels on spot voyage charters on short-term charters. As a result, it generates a significant portion of its revenues from the spot market. Therefore, the company needs to receive profitable spot charters, while the spot market is too volatile. Therefore, a sudden decrease in spot charter rates may adversely affect the company s profitability and ability to meet its obligations.OPEC  announcement regarding production cuts and its impact on higher commodity and refined products prices caused TORM stock price decline in the previous months. However, TORM s strong financial condition and stability protect the company from the volatility of commodity prices to a great extent. In addition, Europe s lower stockpile from their average levels and higher seasonality demand will bring upside to the product tanker market in the second half of 2023. Ultimately, even if TORM company generates an EBITDA of  837 million, which is the middle of their expected range, their fair value would reach  28 per share. When all is said and done, I believe that TORM stock is still a valuable investment decision.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Bank Of Canada Preview: Stretching The 'Hawkish Hold' Approach,"Market expectations for the upcoming Bank of Canada policy meeting have fluctuated quite a lot since the last policyHowever, since then the data has been moving in the opposite direction and after the September inflation readings the probability of a hike next week has crashed back down to 17 . This week, September CPI figures showed a faster-than-expected slowdown in all measures ofIt isn t only the latest inflation number that has surprised. The economy posted a shock contraction in the second quarter, and since then activity has flat-lined with wildfires, floods and strike action, all acting as a brake on activity in addition to the cumulative effects of policy tightening from the Bank of Canada. The BoC Business Outlook indicator slumped further in the third quarter on the back of weaker demand expectations, as well as a reduced plan for hiring and capex spending.With an increasing number of households facing mortgage rate resets at much higher borrowing rates, there is a concern that highly indebted households will feel intensifying pain over coming quarters. We have already seen three consecutive monthly declines in home sales and further weakness is likely with affordability looking incredibly stretched.Canada s jobs market has surprised even the most optimistic forecasters recently. August and September saw employment rising by a total of over 100k, equally split between part- and full-time hiring, while unemployment remained low at 5.5 .In a recent speech, the BoC Governor said  , stressing the importance of inflation expectations and wage growth. Wage inflation has been on the upside according to official data, touching 5.3  year-on-year in September after four consecutive months of acceleration. Wage figures in Canada tend, however, to be rather volatile.The BoC puts a lot of weight on the BoC Business Outlook survey, and the third quarter issue contained a few notions that partly offset the strong labour market narrative. Firms reported expected wage growth at around 4.3  for the year ahead, a fifth consecutive quarter-on-quarter decline, with a record 60  of respondents expecting increases in labour costs to abate in the next 12 months.Incidentally, hiring intentions have declined in tandem with collapsing investment plans and are at the lowest since the third quarter of 2020. A key driver of strong employment gains   supply shortages   also appears to be abating  the BoC indicator of labour shortage intensity has dropped to the lowest since 2009.We must add another factor to the equation  higher bond yields. Canadian sovereign yields have jumped in line with the US ones, reaching a peak a 4.24  peak in early October and now trading around 4.10    over 100bp higher compared to when the BoC last met in September. BoC speakers have not been as vocal as their Fed counterparts about the link between higher market yields and lower chances of another hike, but there are few reasons to believe they strongly oppose such a line of reasoning.When adding the clouded growth pictures and indications that the extreme tightness in labour market may not last much longer, we see little scope for a surprise rate hike by the BoC on 25 October. However, policymakers still have all the interest to keep the higher-for-longer narrative to keep a floor below Canadian yields and let them do part of the tightening.Moving ahead, we are of the view that economic weakness will also contribute to inflation continuing to slow to target, meaning no further rate hikes from the Bank of Canada. We see the potential for the BoC having to start to reversing course and bring policy rates towards a more neutral level from the second quarter of 2024 onwards.The CAD OIS curve is pricing only 4bp ahead of the October meeting, meaning that a hold is a very well-telegraphed outcome and should not have a major impact per-se. Markets will primarily focus on the content of the monetary policy report  revisions of the inflation and growth projections will be particularly in focus, and there is a risk those may hinder the attempts by Governor Macklem to maintain a hawkish stance.There are still around 15bp of tightening in the price to a peak, and therefore some downside risks for CAD if new projections show a more benign path for inflation and or worse growth outlook. Either way, USD CAD should remain primarily driven by non-Canadian factors  the USD performance on the back of US data releases, geopolitical events and the connected implications for commodity prices and risk sentiment.Despite trading around the levels of late August and early September, our short-term fair value model shows that USD CAD is not overvalued as it was back then   meaning that the move in spot is justified by the rates and equity dynamics and there is no risk premium into the pair. While we still expect a turn lower in the pair on the back of a broad-based USD decline from the first quarter of 2024, we maintain a neutral bias  1.37 1.38  into December, with only some potential downside risks on the back of seasonal USD weakness into year-end.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

SFL Corporation: Buy On Prospects For Major Dividend Hike,"  More than two years ago, I managed to make a great call near the bottom in sharesAs a reminder, SFL had guaranteed material amounts of bank debt related to offshore drilling rigs leased to Seadrill. These guarantees came into play when Seadrill filed for bankruptcy for the second time within three years in late 2020.As a result, SFL had to shell out more than  100 million in cash to address the debt related to the worthless semi-submersible rig  which was scrapped later on.InThe material cash drain and uncertain medium-term outlook for the semi-submersible rig  caused SFL to reduce the quarterly dividend by more than 50  from  0.35 to  0.15 per share over the course of 2020.Adding insult to injury, the company decided to replenish its dwindling cash resources by selling 19.1 million of newly-issued shares into the open market for net proceeds of  150.9 million, thus resulting in outstanding shares to increase by more than 15 .However, SFL has managed to overcome the impact from the Seadrill disaster in recent years and slowly increased its quarterly dividend back up to  0.24Fast-forward to today.With COVID-related lockdowns seemingly behind us, a more-disciplined OPEC  approach and recent geopolitical events having resulted in lasting tailwinds for oil and gas exploration, charter rates for offshore drilling rigs have increased to their highest levels in almost a decade.This is very much evident by the company's recently announced contract awards for the harsh-environment semi-submersible rig On the  last month, management stated expectations for the rig to contribute approximately  100 million in EBITDA over the next 12 months alone, which would be very close to the company's most recent quarterly EBITDA run rateHowever, investors shouldn't expect a similarly stellar contribution from the company's harsh environment jackup rig  as the unit continues to work in the North Sea under a long-term charter agreement with ConocoPhillips . While the contract is based on a market-indexed rate, drilling activity in the North Sea has remained weak and is not expected to pick up before sometime next year.Consequently, the rig's EBITDA contribution is likely to remain limited for the time being.Please note also that SFL is currently seeking almost  30 million in damages from Seadrill related to the recent redelivery of the as stated in Seadrill's  on form 6-K  emphasis added by authorA potential award would help offsetting some of SFL's estimated  100 million investment for required upgrades and the Hercules' special periodic survey, as stated by management on the Q1 conference callWith  finally contributing to the top and bottom line in the current quarter, resulting cash flows should more than offset the remaining payments related to the above-discussed upgrades and special survey of the rig.However, the company's fourth quarter should see the full impact of the Hercules contribution, as the rig's earnings will no longer be offset by upgrade and survey costs. Given this issue, I wouldn't be surprised to see SFL's Q4 Adjusted EBITDA approaching  150 million.But SFL has more things going for it than just the  rig, as the company stands to benefit big time from the record charter rate environment for car carriers.In May, the company  with Volkswagen on new three-year charter contracts for the vintage car carriers  and  at vastly improved rates. Consequently, the pair's annual EBITDA contribution is expected to increase from a paltry  9 million to a whopping  47 million.On the flip side, Volkswagen will benefit from long-term charter agreements for two newbuild car carriers  before the recent rally in charter rates.But with these vessels currently under construction in Asia and the Volkswagen charters commencing upon arrival in Europe, SFL will likely be able to perform the vessels' maiden voyages at elevated spot charter rates of  100,000  per day thus resulting in an estimated  10 million one-time cash flow benefit.In addition to returning material amounts of capital to shareholders via dividends each quarter, SFL recently initiated a  100 million share repurchase program. So far, the company has acquired an aggregate of approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of  9.27 per share.Given the anticipated, significant increase in cash flows over the next few quarters, I firmly expect shareholders being rewarded by an estimated 25  quarterly dividend hike to  0.30 per share next year.Assuming a 9  dividend yield, share price upside would be close to 15  which is decent for an income vehicle like SFL.Investors often tend to scrutinize the company's substantial debt load which represents approximately 70  of assets based on stated book values.In addition, SFL's large containership exposure is sometimes viewed as a cause for concern following the rapid decline in charter rates in recent quarters.However, considering the company's conservative chartering strategy with the vast majority of the fleet working on , investors shouldn't be overly concerned.Moreover, due to management's focus on long-term charters, SFL has not been a prime beneficiary of the recent boxship bonanza. As a result, earnings are unlikely to fall off a cliff when the company's containerships are coming up for renewal going forward. In fact, only a small number of vessels will be up for renewal in the near term.With the company's offshore drilling exposure having turned into a major tailwind as of late and projected vastly increased contributions from the car carrier segment, I firmly expect SFL Corporation to reward shareholders by additional stock repurchases and a substantial dividend hike next year.Based on an assumed 9  dividend yield, I am assigning a 12-month price target of  13.35 to the shares. Including dividends, investor returns would calculate to approximately 23  at prevailing trading prices.While shares have rallied by almost 30  from their May lows, I would advise investors to use any major weakness to initiate or add to existing positions.

FTEC: Get Ready To Pounce On Fidelity's Tech Fund,"Continuing the thesis of my recent widely-read  article, today I am alerting investors to what I believe will likely be a coming excellent opportunity to add to  or start a new position in  the For now, I rate FTEC a HOLD, but recommend potential investors put it on their watch list and have the cash ready to make a significant investment in the ETF between now and year-end. IThe investment thesis in the Tech Sector is well-known and widely understood  at least by most investors . Despite the 2022 bear market in Tech, and the recent weakness in the fund, the 5-year total returns of the FTEC ETF have significantly outperformed the broad market averages as represented by the Vanguard S P 500 ETF , the SPDR  Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF That being the case, from a long-term perspective, the case for investing in FTEC is strong  it holds some of the strongest brands and most dynamic companies on the planet.However, and as explained in my  article, from the beginning of Q3, crude oil and energy stocks have been rising, and Tech stocks have generally been falling. I suspect that will be a continuing trend during the 2H. However, at some point crude will come down - either due to more supply, or from global and macroeconomic weakness due to crude oil's outsized impact on inflation - thus putting upward pressure on interest rates - which will lead to oil demand destruction.As I explained in the previously referenced article, higher interest rates push up the value of the US Dollar Index , which makes the foreign currency  FX  translation for global Technology companies a significant headwindYou can clearly see the upward strength in the U.S. dollar last year that was a primary catalyst for the Tech selloff, and the weakness in the Index this year that led to the big Tech rally  FTEC is  31  YTD despite the recent selloff . You can also see what the market is currently worried about on the far-right  no pun intended  of the diagram  a strong bounce in the U.S. Dollar in response to higher crude oil prices, the prospect for continuing inflation, and therefore a higher-for-longer outlook for the Federal Reserve's Fed Funds rate.What that as background, let's take a closer look at the FTEC ETF to understand why I believe the fund could offer investors a very nice entry point in the 2H of this year.The top 10 holdings in the FTEC ETF are shown below and come directly from the , where investors can find more information on the fundAs can be seen in the graphic, FTEC is certainly a top-heavy fund with  43  of the portfolio allocated to just two stocks  Apple   Microsoft  while the top-10 holdings combine for 61  of the entire portfolio.This is why I said earlier that this fund is not a good choice for investors that already have a full position in either Apple or Microsoft. But for those who do not  like the author , this fund is an attractive Tech fund.These two companies have been leading FTEC down since the beginning of Q3  July 1And that weakness is likely to continue for three primary reasonsOn that last point, note that FTEC, Apple, and Microsoft all trade at a significant premium to the S P500Note  unless otherwise referenced, all TTM P E are from Yahoo Finance, all Forward P E and yields are from Seeking Alpha.That being the case, I can easily see FTEC falling another  10-15  at some point between now and year-end. However, over the longer term I am bullish on both Apple and Microsoft. Bullish on Apple for its strong global brand, a growing services segment, its strong free-cash-flow profile, and an imminent iPhone15 release.While I don't believe in the  ChatGPT Bing takes over Google Search  narrative  according to GlobalStats, in July 2023, Google still had a  share of the global search market , I do believe that MSFT will be able to integrate AI into Office and leverage the power therein to grow its enterprise software and Azure Cloud businesses for many years to come.The  3 holding with a 4.6  weight is AI heavyweight Nvidia . NVDA is up close to 200  this year on a huge increase in forward sales guidance amid , its AI roadmap, and the potential in its foray into the networking space.One of my favorite and arguably under-valued stocks is Broadcom . This is the  4 holding in FTEC, with a 3.2 . Broadcom recently broke through its 50-day moving average and gapped lower afterwardsFrom a technical standpoint, I can see further consolidation in AVGO as well. However, the stock is a relative value today in comparison to its strong free-cash-flow profile, its forward P E of only 19.6x, its  18.40 share annual dividend  2.2  yield , and its excellent exposure to AI through growth in its top-tier networking products - specifically its leading-edge Ethernet switches. AVGO is  52  over the past year.AMD  rounds out the top-10 with a 1.5  weight. Over the past year, AMD has been significantly lagging the gains that its direct competitor, NVDA, has demonstratedSpeaking of Nvidia, Baird analyst  in an investor note   Our channel checks suggest no competition in AI enterprise for the medium term.  Gerra also thinks NVDA's Grace Hopper GPUs will likely become cannibalistic to x86 chips produced by competitors, such as Intel  and AMD.Note there is no Google ,  or Amazon  in the FTEC portfolio. For those with full positions in those companies  like the author , this fund is an excellent way to achieve a more balanced allocation across the biggest and best Tech companies.The risks of my thesis would be a more severe selloff in the Tech Sector due to out-of-control crude oil prices  i.e., inflation  as a result of some geopolitical event  similar to Putin's horrific war on Ukraine that broke the global energy supply chain .Also, FTEC has a 0.08  expense fee, which is relatively cost-efficient, but could be lower had the MSCI Index it is based on held fewer stocks. It makes little sense to me that FTEC has 61  of the entire portfolio in just 10 stocks, but then has another 300 in the portfolio to share the remaining 39 .Apple's valuation may contract if the company's doesn't get back into the growth mode that many investors may want to see in order to rationalize its current valuation level.The FTEC ETF has an excellent 5-year performance track record  20.1  and with a 0.08  expense fee is relatively cost-efficient. However, FTEC has been weak since the beginning of Q3, and I expect further weakness to come in the 2H of the year, perhaps dropping another 10-15 . That, I think, would be an excellent entry point for investors who do not already have big positions in Apple or Microsoft. So, I advise investors who already hold FTEC to keep holding it as a core long-term Technology equity within a well-diversified portfolio. For those investors interested in acquiring some FTEC, I'd start buying at  110-112, and would buy with both hands if the market selloff is strong and takes FTEC below  100.

"BASF: Weather Threatens EU Operations, Geopolitics Its China Expansion Plans"," BASF SE  one of the most solid European industrial companies before the Ukraine war, now trades at a valuation level that is just over 1 3 of its maximum stock price reached in 2018. Such aFor H1, in 2023, BASF saw its net adjusted earnings decline to 2.4 billion euros, from 4.6 billion euros in the same period of 2022. Sales volumes declined by 19  for the period. The impact on sales volumes was mostly due to a decline in prices, but production volumes also declined significantly.The decline in production is in line with global trends, but especially the trends we are seeing in Europe, where the decline has been the steepest. China seems to be the only place where the chemical industry is still growing.The main factor impacting its profits seems to be a lack of global demand, leading to a price drop. BASF in particular has probably had to contend with a decline in demand, but also a natural gas price surge last winter, which could occur this winter again, depending on weather conditions.Other financial trends of note, include a significant increase in net debt, from 16.3 billion euros in Q2, 2022, to 20.2 billion euros in the latest quarter. The company's future outlook was mostly revised to the downside in its H1 presentation.As things are currently going, the already downward revised forecast may probably turn out to be overly optimistic, especially if we see another natural gas price spike in the EU as we head into winter.Europe is by far BASF's most important market, therefore what happens there tends to dominate its financial results.The European market is facing the constant threat of a natural gas shortage scenario, since the break in EU-Russia economic ties. Thanks mainly to a very mild winter in the 2022-2023 season, Europe's gas  have been more than adequate for most of this year.As we can see, current storage levels are very near full capacity levels, however by the end of the year, assuming an average winter in terms of consumption, we are set to return to historical storage levels and stay at those levels through the winter and into spring. If however, winter will turn out to be colder than average, the EU can easily plunge into a severe energy crisis, which will leave BASF, together with much of the EU petrochemicals industry more exposed than most other companies   sectors of the economy.It should be noted that a colder-than-average winter in North America, combined with a colder-than-average winter in Europe is the potential catastrophic scenario, given that the EU is now increasingly dependent on US LNG imports. If storage levels start to drop in the US and prices start to spike, those LNG shipments will likely be curtailed. BASF could potentially be asked to shut down production entirely in the EU, perhaps for a prolonged period in such a scenario. Even if production shutdowns do not occur, the natural gas price spike we will likely see is likely to severely impact its financial results. This is a long-term threat for BASF, which it is set to face every year for the foreseeable future.BASF's investment options within the context of an arguably tough business environment for the entire global petrochemicals industry have seen a trend of mostly pivoting towards the Chinese market. Its largest  is a  10 billion project in Zhanziang, China that will provide syngas   hydrogen. BASF already has a presence in China, therefore its China exposure goes far beyond this one projectAs it is increasingly the case, for investors as well as companies, a fast-paced deterioration in the global state of geopolitical relations seems to be catching a growing number of people and business entities in offside. In BASF's case, the increased risk factor regarding its China sales   operations started with an EU announcement that China's EV industry is set to be subjected to an  regarding Chinese subsidies. It is widely expected that it will lead to stiff tariffs on Chinese EV sales in Europe or other protectionist measures. China's reaction has been robust, given that it expected Europe to become a major market for its EVs.To top it all off, Germany's FM,  called China's premier a dictator in a recent interview. Coupled with the EU's decision to engage in economic derisking, which the Chinese see as an economic decoupling, perhaps just slightly softened, it is likely to lead to a vicious cycle of deteriorating economic relations. My take on it is that when it comes to EVs, China will most likely give up on Europe as a growing export market, since it is likely to face obstruction. It is also likely to hit back by targeting European companies exporting products to China or operating inside China. BASF could very well become one of the companies being targeted in retaliation.Not long ago, most investment decisions largely involved an analysis of market fundamentals, combined with company-specific considerations, with little regard for much else. That was before we entered a new era of the world's great economic powers moving from competition to outright trying to harm each other. We arguably entered this new era with the outbreak of the Ukraine war, with many actions that led up to this new state of things, starting at the beginning of the century, arguably making the point of outright confrontation between great powers unavoidable. Thus, we now have to not only do our homework regarding company specifics, as well as the big picture fundamentals, but we also have to consider geopolitical risk.BASF is arguably an example of precisely such a company. As I pointed out in an  I wrote a few months back, it may have to resort to writing down some of its European assets, due to the dramatic shift in Europe's energy supply situation, due to its break with Russia on the economic front. This reality will probably become far more evident once Europe goes through a harsh winter.In response to the risky situation it is faced with in its home base in Europe, BASF seems to have ramped up its pivot toward China, which makes fundamental sense, given that it is proving at least thus far to be one of the only major economies or regions that is still seeing an expansion of its chemical industry. While the fundamentals fit, geopolitical events of just the past week suggest that such multi-billion euro investments in China as BASF is currently engaged in, could become the target of retaliation by the Chinese government, if we do not see a reverse course from the current path of rising economic and geopolitical tensions between the two sides.Assuming that BASF's leadership understands the emerging risks, the situation presents it with quite a dilemma. It could accept becoming a shrinking company, as its European operations will most likely have to be reduced this decade, to adjust to the lack of security of natural gas, without attempting to expand elsewhere. It could decide to avoid risking exposure to the next potential geopolitical hit and halt its China expansion plans. Or it can hope for the best, and go ahead with those plans, in the hope that things will not deteriorate to a point where China and the EU will engage in an all-out effort to mutually undermine each other economically. Either way, the risk for the company   investors is great, with the result being far from predictable.As we can see, BASF stock is currently trading at a P E ratio of just under 12, which is not very expensive from a strictly fundamental point of view. A dividend of over 7  makes it an especially enticing potential longer-term investment. At the same time, as I write this, Germany's  just warned German companies to cut their exposure to China, citing some of the recent tensions that are emerging. Between BASF being left exposed to a perpetual EU energy insecurity crisis, and being stuck with a dilemma regarding its China expansion, within the context of what looks like fast-deteriorating relations between the EU   China, there is no telling how big of an impact all these external factors might have on its business. In an extreme case, it could even become severe enough to drive it into bankruptcy. There is of course always the chance that there will be a sudden relaxation of tensions and many of the risk factors will dissipate as everyone steps back from the brink, in which case BASF stock would have some significant upside from current levels. Things do not seem to be headed in that direction currently, but rather toward a continued deterioration in the global business environment, therefore the potential risk reward ratio for this company remains unappealing.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cross-Asset Tactical Opportunities In A Cycle-Ending Recession,"The major force driving the financial markets over the foreseeable future will be the unfolding trend of deglobalization. Specifically, we are in a process of the fragmenting the global economy into the two blocks, the firstInflation is likely to be higher. Specifically, 1  there will be more frequent spikes in oil, and other commodities, due to the likely geopolitical events, 2  the cost of goods will likely be higher due to the trade barriers and the higher cost of production due to reshoring and onshoring production from China, and 3  there will likely be a chronic shortage of labor due to onshoring, but also due demographic trends - aging population, which is likely to keep the wage growth elevated, and thus the service inflation sticky.Growth will likely be slower as the global markets shrink for some goods, resulting in less trade - less exports. Corporate sales are likely to decrease as the global markets become more restrictive for some products.Thus, the financial markets are likely to be more volatile and more cyclical - with the more frequent recessions. Specifically, the central banks will likely be forced to respond to more frequent inflationary episodes, and given the slow growth expectations, this will likely cause a more frequent recessions - the business cycle will be shorter. This is in contrast with the goldilocks over the last 40 years, where we had low inflation and robust growth, with only 3 recessions, in 1991, 2000, and 2008, excluding the Covid19 related 2020 recession.Thus, long term buy-and-hold investing is not going to be appropriate in the foreseeable future - investors will have to be more tactical, forced to play the cycle.Currently we are in a monetary tightening cycle. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy since March 2022 to respond to the post-pandemic inflationary shock by increasing the interest rates and reducing the balance sheet. The inflationary shock has been initially caused by the post-pandemic supply-chain disruptions, and broader supply demand imbalances. However, the current inflationary forces are more related to the unfolding trend of deglobalization.For example, 1  the price of oil has been recently rising due to the supply cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia, both in the China's BRICS  block, 2  the current labor shortage is partially caused by strong labor demand due to onshoring, and 3  the trade barriers heavily concentrated in the high-tech sectors, like semiconductors, are increasing the costs of some goods, like autos.So, the key question is where we in the current cycle are. The Fed has indicated that we are near the end of the interest rate hiking cycle, with 1 more possible rate hike in 2023, although the QT is expected to continue. Further, the Fed expects to start modestly cutting interest rates in 2024, by 50bpt, as inflation falls to 2.5 , but keeping the real rates elevated - due to what appears to be expectations of sticky inflation. Specifically, the Fed acknowledges that the labor shortage will persist, by estimating the full employment or a 4.1  unemployment rate, until 2026, which will likely keep the service inflation elevated.The Fed does not explicitly expect a recession in the SEP dotplot, but Powell has indicated that soft landing is not the baseline scenario. However, the yield curve has been inverted since October 2022 - and thus, based on the historical evidence, a recession is likely imminent, which in-fact ends the monetary policy tightening cycle.The yield curve has been deeply inverted for a long time by historical standards, which suggests a very deep recession - a hard landing. However, the recession has been delayed due to 1  strong consumer spending supported with the pandemic-related excess savings, and general post-pandemic pent-up demand for travel and entertainment, and 2  fiscal spending particularly on manufacturing construction. Note, the wealth effect is also still very strong, due to the still inflated housing prices and the overvalued stock market, both initially boosted by the pandemic-related fiscal and monetary policy stimulus - and this has also been supporting consumption.However, it appears that the consumer excess savings have been nearly exhausted. Further, given the restart of student loan payments, the consumption is likely to decelerate over the near term - supporting the imminent recession thesis. Further, the excess fiscal spending is flagging the unsustainable deficit, which is starting to get reflected in higher long-term interest rates, also contributing to the expectations of slower consumption and investment.Thus, the current tactical positioning opportunities are based on the expectations of an imminent recession - which is the key macro theme, within the longer-term investment framework.The 2-Year Treasury Note  is the proxy for the expected Fed's interest rate policy over the next 24 months. Currently, the 2-Year Note, with the yield at 5.12  is predictingThe 10-year Treasury Note nominal yield is reflecting the real interest rate and the inflation expectations. The 10Y yield has been rising, and currently the 10Y yield of 4.51  reflectsTactical opportunitiesThe US Dollar  is pricing the relative economic strength, and the relative monetary policy.Gold  price remains elevated near the 2000 level, despite the increase in real yields - historically, higher real yields resulted in a lower gold price. Given that real yields are expected to increase, gold is unlikely to sustainably break above the 2000 level. However, gold is likely to remain near the 2000 level in anticipation these events, which could push gold much higherThe current cycle is likely to end in a recession, which will curb the demand for oil and other cyclical commodities. Thus, the oil price  is likely to fall, despite the supply curbs. Any short-term gains are likely to be limited, depending on further geopolitical escalations, which are possible, but unpredictable.The stock market is currently pricing these 3 assumptionsWithin the longer-term investment framework shaped by deglobalization, we are currently near the end of the current monetary policy tightening cycle. Given the depth and the time length of inverted yield curve, this cycle is likely to end with a recession, which is currently not priced by the markets.There are two major cross-asset tactical positioning opportunities at this stage. First, there are an opportunity to buy 2Y Treasury Note and lock in the yields above 5  for the next 2 years, or bet on the deeper Fed cuts in 2024 by buying FF futures with expiration in mid-late 2024. Second, there is an opportunity to sell stocks in anticipation of a major drawdown due to the PE multiple contraction, earnings downgrade, and the spike in credit risk.Looking at the step forward, the new cycle will likely start with a weakening USD, as the Fed starts the new policy easing cycle, with interest rate cuts and balance sheet expansion. But for now, the strategy is to play the expiration of the current cycle.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

3 'Ludicrous' Events That Could Happen Soon,"Ludicrous - .Today, we take a look at three possible '' events that are unlikely but have a much higher probabilityInflation has risen over 17  since the beginning of 2021. While workers' wages have increased more than the historical norm  the average American has lost approximately three percent of their buying power over that time. Naturally, workers are pushing for higher wages, especially at unionized companies. Pilots recently received roughly 40  wage increases over four years at major airlines. The Teamsters union helped Now, the UAW has their sights set on negotiating a new contract with , , and  simultaneously. The old contract expires on September 14th. Traditionally, the UAW has negotiated a new contract with one of the Big Three automakers and then used that as a template for new contracts with other two automakers. They have also been willing in the past to continue working while negotiations continued.However, neither of these tactics will be employed in this round of contract renewal talks. The UAW is now headed by a much more militant  by the name of Shawn Fain. The union already has  and is  a 46  pay raise over four years. The organization also wants a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay as well as a restoration of traditional pension plans among other demands. Ford has countered with a 15  wage increase .Given the massive chasm between the UAW's demands and automakers' counter proposal, a strike is all but a certainty at this point. Given the divergence between the two sides and the fact the UAW has amassed an over  800 million strike fund  it is hard to see how this does not get dragged on for many weeks and more likely months. This obviously will have downstream impacts on auto suppliers, dealers, and the whole automotive ecosystem as well as the overall economy. This is one key reason I recently  that Ford seems like a '' despite a low P E and a nearly five percent dividend yield. I also think most pundits are underestimating the duration and economic impact of this upcoming UAW strike, which very well could last months.There are so many false narratives being spun by the majority of the media that it is hard to keep track of them these days, in my opinion. One of the most noxious to me is that Ukraine is '' against Russia. Despite being the biggest land war since WWII in Europe, pretty little footage or reporting is coming from western media from the region despite massive amounts of taxpayer funds being sent there in the form of military and humanitarian aid. Some 500,000 casualties have  in the 18-month war according to a recent article in the NY Times.So, how do I know Ukraine is losing this war and are currently taking much more casualties than their adversary  Basic logic. Since the advent of industrial scale war, artillery has consistently caused nearly two thirds of battleground casualties and deaths. This is especially true on a static battlefield like now exists in Ukraine, a mix of WWI style trench warfare intermixed with 21st century technology  Ex, Drones . Russia is firing five to ten more artillery  per day than Ukraine, this is not in dispute. The West is even struggling to replace that expenditure of ordinance.Second, military history shows that the attacker generally takes two to three casualties per defender loss between roughly equal forces. Given the Russians have three lines of deeply entrenched lines of defense that have been heavily mined, I would say that is the minimum ratio Ukrainian forces are currently taking since their spring offensive launched in early June. Add in Russia enjoys clear air superiority and a massive artillery advantage, I would not be surprised if the ratio is closer to five to one.It is little wonder the offensive has been hugely disappointing in the amount of territory recovered and, in most places, the brave Ukrainian armed forces have not even breached the first of the three lines of Russian defenses. This slaughter could easily lead to the collapse, if not outright mutiny, by the Ukrainian personnel being forced into this meat grinder. At the very least, it has severely weakened Ukrainian manpower, ordinance stores and armor.The Russians could very well just maintain the status quo and continue to let Ukrainian forces continue to expend themselves in this fruitless endeavor. However, I would not be surprised at all if Russia launches a counter offensive once Ukraine has exhausted itself. The most likely target of this military effort would be the seizure of the major port city of Odesa. Capture of this city would have significant ramifications.First, it would deprive Ukraine of its remaining access to the Black Sea, further crippling its economy. Second, it would severely curtail grain exports. This would significantly increase the cost and supply of many key items throughout the globe causing great hardship in Africa and the Middle East and a significant tailwind to inflationary forces. Ukraine is a major  of sunflower oil, corn, wheat, barley and rapeseed among other commodities. Further sanctions on Russian energy exports would also lead to higher global energy prices.Then there are the geopolitical ramifications that would follow the capture of Odessa. Obviously, this would put Ukraine and its supporters in a much weaker position for any peace negotiations. As importantly, how would the current U.S. administration react  Would they now push for peace negotiations knowing the outcome in Ukraine is unwinnable  This, following the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, would be another foreign policy '' for the current administration.Or would they double down and escalate the conflict with the largest nuclear power in the world further  Perhaps even drawing in NATO deeper into this conflict  Abject humiliation or escalation both seem like they would spike volatility in the markets and be negative for equities.The United States has experienced a hotter than normal summer this year. Temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are also warmer than norms for this time of the year. Two named storms formed in the Atlantic in April, which was a historical anomaly. However, despite this, there has been little in the way of hurricane activity so far this season. A recent hurricane did just hit the western part of Florida. Fortunately, the storm was fast moving and hit a relatively unpopulated area of the state, so damage and economic disruption were minimal. However, we still have roughly 6-8 weeks of prime hurricane season to weather.There are new tropical  forming in the Atlantic. Call it a hunch, or just a reversion to the mean after a quiet first half of hurricane season in 2023. I believe we will see one or maybe two major hurricanes make U.S. landfall before the end of October. My ludicrous prediction is one targets the Gulf Coast and shuts down oil and natural gas production for at least a week. This will add to the current tailwinds pushing oil towards the  90 a barrel. With most of the SPR  and at a 35-year low, this could result in still higher energy prices and also would be a setback on the inflation front.I recently outlined the key reasons I am negative on the market in an article named ''.

L3Harris Growth Prospects Take Off With Space Wins And Defense Spending,"L3Harris  is an American technology and information services provider that focuses on the defense industry. It was formed in 2019 by a merger between L3 Communications and Harris Corporation, making it the 6th largestLHX is poised to benefit from increased defense spending, particularly the EU's 24.9  increase year over year in equipment spending. With major wins in the space segment and a massive  25 billion backlog, LHX offers dividends, growth, and a reasonable price.EFV  Estimated Fair Value    EFY26 EPS  Earnings Per Share  times PE  Price EPSEFV   E24 EPS X P E    13.2 X 18.0    237.60Numerous significant geopolitical events around the worldThe US military budget is slated to be  824 billion in discretionary spending, the largest ever. Per the , a large part of this is ensuring US dominance in the face of China's rapid modernization and technological achievement. There is near bipartisan consensus on increasing military spending to deter China in the Pacific, with additional commitments to Ukraine . Additionally, there is huge emphasis on the space domain, with Secretary Frank Campell stating that space is near the top of the .To address the huge backlog in the space area and expand the addressable market, LHX closed its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in July of 2023. LHX has increased its presence in space by 10x in 4 years, with over 50 active contracts. LHX hopes to repeat this growth, with a 4x increase in deliveries targeted from FY21-FY25.Rocketdyne would add  2 billion per year in revenue and  7 billion to the backlog while maintaining a similar company-wide EBITDA margin of 15 . Rocketdyne will add a product line through rocket motors, a segment that includes key ballistic missile defense contracts, NASA, and hypersonic research. The acquisition will be accretive in the first year, with integration efforts being slow and steady through FY25.LHX operates 3 primary segments  Integrated Mission Systems, Space   Airborne, and Communication Systems. Across all segments, LHX averages 15.4  operating margin, and 75  fixed price contracts. LHX provides several key technologies at the core of the cutting edge of military technology, and its products make up the backbone of global military communication and intelligence networks.Across all segments and domains, LHX got several key contract wins, adding to the extensive backlog. LHX maintains a huge backlog, which has increased 25  year over year. This backlog represents  25 billion in contractual obligations, with a company-wide book-to-bill of 1.18x. The space area had the largest and most impressive results, with a book-to-bill of 1.7x, for a total of  940 million in orders. Air saw  750 million in orders, including a  300 million addition to the existing  12 billion in aviation maintenance and upgrade contracts. Sea saw  390 million in new wins, Land  500 million, and Cyber  250 million.The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 suspended the debt limit through 2025, and established new discretionary spending for defense accounts, the previously mentioned  842 billion figure. This will offer some short-term relief for uncertainty, but the move was unpopular and will almost certainly lead to a standoff in the future. There is a serious risk of a government shutdown, meaning defense contractors do not receive payment.Defense contractors have two primary periods  short-term and long-term. The short-term represents procurement of new items, and the long-term represents contracts for maintenance or supply agreements. LHX derives a significant income  75  from the long end of these. LHX products are often at the core of systems or bolt-on rather than specific large line-item procurement like its competitors. While this creates a more reliable cash flow stream over time, LHX cannot exercise nearly as much pricing power in the short end.LHX capital deployment targets 1.5  revenue to capex  currently 2  and maintains a debt-to-EBITDA ceiling of 3.0x. During 2Q23, LHX repaid  800 million in notes. We expect this to trend higher as increasing the  and deleveraging from the Rocketdyne acquisition has become a strategic priority. This will be facilitated by divestitures and by a  moderation  in share repurchases.Despite increased debt repayments, free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at  2 billion generated for FY23. As previously stated, repurchases will likely trend down, but LHX currently yields 2.72  or  4.56 per share annually. The 5-year growth rate on the dividend is 13.6 , with LHX consistently raising the dividend as financial results improve.On a secular basis, there is significant growth in the space area with over  900 million in new contract wins, targeting a further expansion of this by FY25 with the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Additionally, NATO militaries are drastically ramping up procurement efforts for modernized equipment in the face of the war in Ukraine, and the US is heavily investing in Chinese deterrence, driving a  25 billion backlog. LHX has positioned itself as a  trusted disruptor  in several key areas within global militaries. It provides a stable yield and has good growth prospects.

NACCO Industries: Cheap Valuation But Beware Of The Risks,"NACCO Industries  passes under the radar of the vast majority of investors, who prefer to avoid exposure to the industry of coal, which is characterized by a secular decline over the long run. However, the stock has shed 38  inNACCO Industries is the largest producer of coal in the U.S. and one of the top 10 coal producers in the world, with a history of more than 110 years. It produces coal from mines in North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico and sells its output to power generation companies via multi-year contracts. Each mineNACCO Industries has greatly benefited from the war in Ukraine. Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine, the U.S. and the European Union imposed strict sanctions on the exports of oil and natural gas of Russia. Consequently, the prices of oil and natural gas skyrocketed last year, to 13-year highs. Due to the insufficient global supply of natural gas, the global use of coal surged and thus the price of coal  to a 15-year high last year.NACCO Industries  of operating with a fee-based model, which somewhat protects the company from the wide fluctuations of the price of coal. However, the company has enjoyed a double tailwind thanks to the sanctions of western countries on Russia  an increased demand for coal and much higher prices. As a result, NACCO Industries grew its earnings per share  last year, from  6.69 in 2021 to an all-time high of  10.06 in 2022.However, the global energy market has almost fully absorbed the effect of the Ukrainian crisis this year, partly thanks to an abnormally warm winter in the beginning of the year. As a result, the price of coal has plunged 68  off its peak of  431 in 2022, to  138 now. The current price is still much higher than the normal range  60- 100  before the Ukrainian crisis but the steep decrease of the price signals that there may be more downside ahead.The latest  of NACCO Industries was certainly much worse than the reports in the preceding quarters. In the second quarter, the company saw its earnings per share plunge 93  over the prior year s quarter, from  5.07 to  0.34. In addition, management stated that the earnings in the second half of 2023 and the full year are expected to decrease significantly over the prior year s levels. Given this guidance and the 83  plunge of the earnings per share in the first half of the year, it is safe to expect the earnings per share to slump by at least 70  in the full year. To be sure, the company has posted earnings per share of  1.09 in the first half of the year and hence it is unlikely to post earnings per share above  3.00 in the full year, given the current business momentum.Going forward, it is essentially impossible to forecast the earnings of NACCO Industries in the upcoming years, given the pronounced sensitivity of the company to the demand for coal, the sensitivity to the cycles of the price of coal and the unpredictable pace of the global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources  more on this below . It is also important to note that the stock is not covered by any analyst.If one insists on forecasting the future earnings of NACCO Industries, one should note that the company posted 10-year low earnings per share of  2.10 in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic, 10-year high earnings per share of  6.69 in 2021 thanks to pent-up demand after the pandemic and record earnings per share of  10.06 in 2022 thanks to the aforementioned sanctions. Therefore, the period 2017-2019 is the most recent period with normal business conditions for the coal industry. During that 3-year period, NACCO Industries posted average earnings per share of  4.93. Going forward and given the headwind from the ongoing energy transition, NACCO Industries is not likely to achieve sustainable earnings per share above  4.93.The coal industry is in a secular decline, as most countries  including the U.S.  are doing their best to shift from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. This is clearly reflected in the chart below, which shows that the consumption of coal in the U.S. has steadily decreased over the last 15 years.Source  Despite the temporary bounce in the demand for coal in the last two years due to the aforementioned tailwind from the Ukrainian crisis, the long-term trend is clearly downward. In fact, the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine last year has led most countries to accelerate their efforts on shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. As a result, according to the International Energy Agency  IEA , the global investment in clean energy sources  the global investment in fossil fuels by about  700 billion last year. The global shift from fossil fuels to green energy projects is a major threat for the business model of NACCO Industries.On the bright side, the company is doing its best to navigate through this shift. NACCO Industries has taken an interest in the Thacker Pass Project, which is expected to begin producing lithium in the second half of 2026. Lithium is a vital component in the global energy transition.The global demand for lithium  at a breathtaking pace in the last three years, nearly tripling between 2020 and 2023. Moreover, it is not expected to take a breather anytime soon. Instead, it is expected to more than quadruple until 2030 thanks to the reliable growth in the sales of mobile phones and electric vehicles.Electric vehicles are in the very early phases of their growth trajectory. The global sales of electric vehicles  in the last two years and are  to keep growing at a double-digit rate for many more years. It is also critical to realize that electric vehicles require 5,000 to 10,000 times as much lithium as mobile phones and hence lithium producers have exciting growth potential ahead. Overall, the participation of NACCO Industries in a major lithium project is certainly in the right direction, as it will enhance the diversification of the company and will somewhat hedge it against the secular decline of its flagship business.The management of NACCO Industries should be praised for maintaining a debt-free balance sheet. The company  any interest expense while it has a net cash position  cash   receivables   total liabilities  of . The net cash position is 15  of the market capitalization of the stock and hence it is material. A rock solid balance sheet is paramount in the highly cyclical coal industry, which is characterized by a secular decline. The financial strength of NACCO Industries enables the company to easily endure unforeseen downturns in its business.NACCO Industries is currently trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of only 7.9x. This earnings multiple is much lower than the 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2x of the stock but it is equal to the 5-year average valuation level of the stock.As the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources has greatly accelerated in the last three years, the 5-year average valuation of NACCO Industries is probably more representative of the current potential of the stock. It is also worth noting that NACCO Industries appears more expensive than its peer Peabody Energy , which is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only .On the one hand, the management of NACCO Industries is doing its best to protect the company from the threat related to the ongoing energy transition by investing in a major lithium project and by maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. On the other hand, it is only natural that the stock is trading at a single-digit price-to-earnings ratio, given the long-term decay of its flagship business. Overall, the stock appears reasonably valued right now.About a year ago, the stock of NACCO Industries peaked at  60, which is nearly double the current stock price. If another energy crisis shows up, e.g. due to an escalation of the ongoing tension in the Middle East, the price of coal may surge again. In such a case, the stock of NACCO Industries is likely to enjoy a relief rally. However, in the absence of a major geopolitical event, the use of coal is not likely to increase meaningfully. On the other hand, if the price of lithium enjoys a steep rally after 2026, when the Thacker Pass Project begins producing lithium, the stock of NACCO Industries will probably benefit.NACCO Industries is trading at a cheap valuation level but for a good reason. The company is doing its best in the parts of its business it can control but it remains sensitive to the underlying demand for coal. Overall, the stock seems fairly valued right now.

Praetorian Capital Fund Q3 2023 Investor Letter,"During the third quarter of 2023, the Praetorian Capital Fund LLC  the  Fund  appreciated by 11.92  net of fees . Given the Fund s concentrated portfolio structure and focus on asymmetric opportunities, I anticipate that the Fund will be rather volatile from quarter to quarter. During the third quarter, many of our core portfolio positions advanced slightly, while the Event-Driven book produced a small positive return.While we are positive for the year, I remain frustrated with the Fund s net performance over the past six quarters. This Fund is focused on absolute returns and structured to dramatically outperform over rolling three-year periods  half-way into a rolling twelve-quarter period, we have not been outperforming. That is not to say that the results are terrible. Instead, they show moderately positive performance. However, the goal here is outperformance regardless of any benchmark or market environment and currently our positions seem to be lagging.As a reminder, I primarily seek out investments that are undergoing some sort of dynamic change that has not been recognized by the markets. In theory, this allows us to purchase securities at substantial discounts to fair value, helping to reduce the downside should I get the trend wrong. Sometimes the revaluation is almost immediate, and sometimes it takes a few quarters for the markets to notice. In the case of our portfolio, the vast majority of our positions have appreciated dramatically from where first I purchased them, and are now in a consolidation phase, hopefully before a renewed upward movement.While these consolidation phases can take many quarters to play out, I am particularly frustrated as many of our core themes themselves appear to be dramatically outperforming my initial expectations  Rather than bemoan the inability of our equity positions to track the performance of the underlying trends, I ll just note that there are periods where equities can lag and then there are periods with rapid catch-up phases. I remain hopeful that we ll experience such a catch-up phase should the economics underlying our positions continue to improve.This isn t the first period of consolidation and frustrating performance in my investment career, and I m sure it won t be the last such period. The important thing is to constantly re-evaluate our positions and make sure that I am not missing anything that would account for the subdued performance.You have likely received a list of changes to the Fund s Private Placement Memorandum. The primary changes are designed to give me additional flexibility when seeking out investment opportunities. In particular-Our registration as a Commodity Pool Operator  CPO  will allow me to be able to better hedge the portfolio while enabling us to better target situations in the futures markets. While I am generally against using futures to increase the Fund s leverage, I m very much in favor of using options positions to increase notional exposure, and without the CPO registration, we ve been restricted in terms the total notional exposure we could employ. Given my views on elevated levels of inflation, I believe that this flexibility will serve us well.-Our decision to use a second prime broker will give us access to a number of smaller country markets where interesting Event-Driven situations have appeared, yet we were unable to participate using our current broker.-Our ability to invest in pre-IPO private securities should open up a new window of opportunity as we have previously been presented with a number of attractive investments that we were forced to pass on as we did not have the ability to invest in private securities. With the investment landscape of public securities increasingly becoming competitive, I believe that pre-IPO securities are an interesting opportunity that may grant us a competitive edge, due to my extensive business network. However, given the illiquid nature of such securities, I plan to ensure that private securities remain only a few percent of our overall capital. Additionally, we will only invest in situations that have planned liquidity events through IPOs.Finally, we ve registered our Cayman entity with HMRC, in order to provide tax benefits to current and future UK domiciled clients.There are a number of other changes to the documents, mostly driven by regulatory changes  however, I wanted to make sure that you were aware of these three changes in particular as they should give us increased flexibility and open up new opportunities to us. As always, I m trying to think outside the box, especially given how competitive the landscape for investing has become.Normally, I d post some market views, but given the rapidly evolving geopolitical situation in the Middle East, anything that I say is likely to be obsolete by the time you read it. Instead, I would like to note that our portfolio is heavily weighted towards securities that should do well if geopolitical volatility increases.It may take some time still, but I believe that society will eventually settle on nuclear power as a compromise solution for baseload power generation. This will come at a time when there is a deficit of uranium production, compared with growing demand. As aboveground stocks are consumed, uranium prices should appreciate towards the marginal cost of production. Additionally, there is currently an entity named Sprott Physical Uranium Trust , U-U   Canada  that is issuing shares through an At-The-Market offering, or ATM, in order to purchase uranium  we are long this entity . I believe that these uranium purchases will accelerate the price realization function by sequestering much of the available aboveground stockpile at a time when utilities have run down their inventories and need substantial purchases to re-stock. The combination of these factors ought to lead to a dramatic increase in the price of uranium as it will take multiple years for sufficient incremental supply to come online even if the re-start decision were made today.In 2020 when oil traded below zero, drilling activity ground to a halt and many energy service providers declared bankruptcy. Many of these businesses had teetered on the verge of bankruptcy for years due to reduced demand and over-leveraged balance sheets. The bankruptcies led to consolidation and reduced future industry capacity, removing future competition in the recovery.With oil prices now recovering, I believe that demand for drilling and other services will increase from subdued levels. While producers have been slow to increase spending on exploration despite recoveries in energy prices, I believe that this only extends the timing on the thesis. In the end, the only way to reduce future energy prices is to see a dramatic increase in global oilfield services spending. Any postponement of this spending only leads to higher prices and more wealth transfer from the global economy to the oil producers, which will likely end up resulting in an increase in spending on exploration and production.We purchased many of these positions at fractions of the equipment s replacement cost, despite restored balance sheets and positive operating cash flow. As spending in the sector recovers, I believe that the potential for cash flow will become more apparent and this equipment will trade up to valuations closer to replacement cost.JOE owns approximately 170,000 acres in the Florida Panhandle. It has been widely known that JOE traded for a tiny fraction of its liquidation value for years, but without a catalyst, it was always perceived to be  dead money.Over the past few years, the population of the Panhandle seems to have hit a critical mass where the Panhandle now has a center of gravity that is attracting people who want to live in one of the prettiest places in the country, with zero state income taxes and few of the problems of large cities.The oddity of the current disdain for so-called  value investments  is that many of them are growing quite fast. I believe that JOE will grow revenue at 30  to 50  each year for the foreseeable future, with earnings growing at a much faster clip. Meanwhile, I believe the shares trade at a single-digit multiple on Adjusted Funds from Operations  AFFO  looking out to 2024, while substantial asset value is tossed in for free.Besides the valuation, growth, and high Return on Invested Capital  of the business, why else do I like JOE  For starters, land tends to appreciate rapidly during periods of high inflation particularly an inflationary period where interest rates are likely to remain suppressed by the Federal Reserve. More importantly, I believe we are about to witness a massive population migration as people with means choose to flee big cities for somewhere peaceful.I suspect that every convulsion of urban chaos and or tax-the-rich scheming will launch JOE shares higher, and it will ultimately be seen as the way to  play  the stream of very wealthy refugees fleeing for somewhere better.We are currently accumulating shares of a company that has historically produced elevated returns on capital yet has recently seen its share price decline as calendar Q3 was likely quite weak, when compared to the recent spate of very strong quarters. I believe that this weakness is a short-term blip in a longerterm pro-cyclical inflation and volatility story. If the business returns to prior levels of economic activity, or exceeds that activity as I anticipate, then the shares should appreciate dramatically.I ll likely have more to say about this position in a future letter after we ve completed purchasing it.At quarter end, we were long a basket of Argentine securities in the belief that the coming Presidential election could herald a watershed opportunity for Argentina to escape the doom-loop of socialism. We believed that either of the two leading candidates, Milei and Bullrich, would both set the country off in a very positive direction. As Milei was leading in most polls, it seemed likely that he would become the next President of Argentina. My belief was that a Milei presidency would involve de-regulation and then Dollarization of the Argentine economy, which would ultimately unlock the potential of the country.Unfortunately, Milei had a weaker than expected showing in the first-round election on October 22.While I still believe that he will win the Presidency, if he does win, it will be with an insufficient margin to effect change. When a country is as screwed up as Argentina, you need a true mandate from voters to fix things and Milei is unlikely to get that mandate.We had invested in Argentina through a basket of US listed Argentine equities, with a focus on businesses with hard assets. Upon seeing the election results, I fully exited our position. As an inflection investor, I ve learned that when the trend loses strength, you have to get out. Especially in a trend that is as volatile and risky as Argentina. Fortunately, we have realized a small gain on this investment, including dividends, despite getting the thesis wrong.As always, the point of my inflection investing strategy is to identify situations where expectations and valuations are so low that even if I get the thesis wrong, I m able to exit with a small gain or loss. While it won t always work out this well on an investment that goes wrong, if I repeatedly risk very little and set us up for multi-bagger upside when correct, the Fund should do quite well. In the end, the biggest loss for us has been opportunity cost, and that is unfortunately the price that we pay for being an inflection investor.Returning to the markets, during the third quarter of 2023, the Fund experienced a positive return. The performance has remained subdued and I remain frustrated. I believe we are invested in some of the strongest macro trends in the markets, given our focus on only owning highly undervalued securities with a reduced chance of downside risks. Unfortunately, those securities remain relatively rangebound for now.Recent geopolitical events, along with the collapse of bonds in many developed markets, seem likely to lead to an increase in overall market volatility. I believe that I thrive in more volatile markets. After an elongated period of subdued volatility, I am excited that things may finally get interesting again.Let s hope for fireworks.

Mosaic Might Double As Its Bull Case Returns,"I have looked forward to writing this article for two reasonsThe company's just-released earnings confirm what we've discussed in a number of prior articles  most recently, . Subdued fertilizer prices and elevated crop prices have created higher affordability, which is fertile  pun intended  ground for higher volumes down the road.Furthermore, we're seeing strong regional demand as global crop inventories remain subdued, worsened by the weather impact in major growing areas.When adding energy market dynamics, we get a confirmation of my bull case, which could send MOS shares to  80 andSo, let's dive into the detailsThe quote below is a big part of the takeaway from my last article  emphasis addedWhile it's bad for inflation, I'm glad to say that all these developments are working out very favorably for the agriculture bull case.Starting with energy prices, we see an upswing in key oil benchmarks like WTI and Brent, which are starting to positively impact agriculture crop prices.The chart below compares December WTI crude futures to December  new crop  corn futures.This is what the comparison between Mosaic and longer-term oil futures looks likeSure, Mosaic doesn't produce oil. It produces potash and phosphates for farmers.However, energy is a big part of my bull case, as agriculture commodities tend to trade slightly above the cost to produce them. Energy is the single biggest driver of production costs.Hence, when energy prices rise, it changes supply dynamics, resulting in higher crop prices. This has an impact on farm income and a wide range of other financial numbers.I expect energy to remain in a bull market, as global demand isn't as bad as expected, and we're now at a stage where US shale production growth is rapidly declining.First of all, the 2Q23 numbers weren't great. Revenues came in at  3.4 billion, which is 37  below the prior-year quarter. Operating earnings fell below  370 million, which is a decline of 78 .The decline was visible in every segment as a result of poor pricing and volume headwinds in the Potash segment and Mosaic Fertilizantes, the company's Brazilian operation.This is what the development of fertilizer prices looks likeHowever, these declines were expected. Analysts actually expected total revenue to come in  250 million below the actual result.What matters more than anything is the company's outlook.During its earnings call, the company highlighted the constructive fundamentals of the market, supported by robust global demand for crops coupled with supply challenges.Geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine, have impacted supply dynamics. The UN Black Sea Grain Initiative's collapse and subsequent grain terminal bombings have caused Ukrainian corn and wheat exports to plummet by up to 30  compared to the prior year, putting a floor under crop prices and creating a bigger incentive for other regions to boost production.Furthermore, weather extremes worldwide, including drought conditions in North America and El Nino's effects on Southeast Asia and Australia, are influencing crop production.To counter these challenges, farmers have to increase fertilizer applications, particularly potash, to enhance drought resistance and crop resilience.With regard to supply dynamics, China's increased imports of soybean, wheat, and beef are reshaping global trade flows. The reduction in Ukrainian supply affects not only China, but also Europe, Africa, and Asia.Meanwhile, China's exports of phosphates have been constrained for a while without a high likelihood of a turnaround.Essentially, China's environmental policy has reduced domestic capacity, affecting exports. Industrial demand, particularly in lithium iron phosphate production, is expected to grow substantially in China.In India, food security also remains key, which led to export bans on non-Basmati white rice.Supply constraints and strong demand are creating pressure on global stock-use ratios, which are already at multiyear lows.These factors collectively support a favorable agricultural market outlook, fostering robust fertilizer demand in key markets.Improved affordability, inventory destocking, and sustained grain and oilseed demand have stimulated market activity, particularly in the markets that matter most to Mosaic  North America and Brazil.Furthermore, according to the company, favorable grower economics are driving early supply procurement, despite logistical constraints like low water levels on the Mississippi River and limited trucking capacity.In Brazil, demand is picking up as anticipated.Overall, the fertilizer market recovery aligns with the company's expectations, with volumes and prices reacting positively.As part of ongoing tailwinds, the company is investing in both maintenance and expansions. The company's investments include debottlenecking projects to boost production capacity in both potash and phosphates, reinforcing its position in value-added products, and strengthening its competitiveness, which should be a long-term margin tailwind.Furthermore, Mosaic is investing in a 1-million-tonne blending and distribution facility in Brazil to extend its distribution footprint.The company is also exploring opportunities in the lithium iron phosphate battery market, investing in differentiated phosphate products, and expanding its MicroEssentials offerings, which is also a margin-enhancing project.With regard to the outlook below, the company noted that the guidance for potash volume depends on international shipping capabilities, which have been impacted by labor unrest and ongoing repairs.Despite these challenges, the midpoint of the guidance aligns with historical averages, emphasizing strong North American demand without pricing in too much optimism.Furthermore, the company's summer fill program has seen robust demand, surpassing expectations by 30 .There's also potential for higher phosphate volumes due to global demand, even though inventory constraints exist.Production is anticipated to increase sequentially, which offers an opportunity to exceed the current guidance range.Pricing details reveal that 70  of the Q3 order book is committed and priced.So, better pricing is possible, particularly in the fourth quarter, given a portion of unpriced tonnes.Putting a target on commodity-driven stocks is tricky, as it's impossible without incorporating a thesis for the underlying commodity.That's also why so many professional sell-side analysts upgrade stocks after a rally has started because  almost  nobody is willing to bet their careers on certain macro trends. They would rather predict based on current numbers and or stick to stocks that have a much more consistent performance than volatile and cyclical commodity-driven stocks.Having said that, after rising 15  in the past four weeks, MOS shares are now trading at their consensus price target.MOS shares are currently trading at 6.2x NTM EBITDA. This is fair and far from overvalued, especially because I expect fertilizer prices to rise meaningfully over the next 12 months.Hence, I stick to what I wrote in my prior article. Back then, I also reiterated my  70 to  80 price target, which makes me one of the most bullish analysts.My bullish stance on Mosaic has been vindicated by its recent earnings report and supportive market dynamics.Affordability driven by subdued fertilizer prices and elevated crop prices forms a fertile ground for increased volumes.Furthermore, strong regional demand, exacerbated by weather impacts, underscores the company's promising outlook.Energy market dynamics, particularly rising oil prices, further amplify the bullish case, influencing agriculture prices and potentially enhancing MOS's profitability.Additionally, the correlation between corn and oil prices emerges as a potential catalyst, while Mosaic's robust performance, strategic investments, and optimistic market outlook reinforce my positive outlook.As the industry recovers and Mosaic continues its growth initiatives, a target price of  80 and beyond remains within reach.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Liquidity risk arises, with the potential for challenges in liquidating assets when needed, complicating cash flow management. Interest rate risk, a specter for all financial institutions, is a constant concern, while formidable competition from traditional banks, fellow BDCs, and alternative lending platforms adds to the complexity.

"Cross Timbers Royalty Trust Is Risky, Even After A 39% Decline","About three years ago, I  that Cross Timbers Royalty Trust  could double over the following two years, as its stock price had been beaten to the extreme amid the coronavirus crisis. The stock doubled in justCross Timbers Royalty Trust is an oil and gas trust that holds a 90  net profit interest in some producing properties in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico and a 75  net profit interest in a few other properties in Texas and Oklahoma. The trust  approximately 50  of its revenues from oil and the other 50  from natural gas. Therefore, it is important to examine the outlook of both the oil market and the natural gas market in order to evaluate the stock.Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has been thriving since early last year thanks to the Ukrainian crisis. Shortly after the invasion of Russia in Ukraine, the U.S. and the European Union initiated strict sanctions on the oil and gas exports of Russia. As the latter had a market share of about 10  in the global oil market and 35  in the European gas market, both markets became extremely tight and thus the prices of oil and gas skyrocketed to multi-year highs last year.These developments were ideal for a pure upstream oil and gas producer, such as Cross Timbers Royalty Trust. To be sure, the trust grew its distribution per unit  last year, from  1.10 in 2021 to an 8-year high of  1.96 last year.The prices of oil and gas have moderated off their blowout levels last year, as the global energy market has begun to absorb the impact of the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, as there is a lag between benchmark prices and the actual realized prices of the trust, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has offered total distributions of  in the first 9 months of this year. When annualized, this performance is roughly in line with the performance of the trust last year. At the current stock price, these distributions correspond to a 10.9  annualized yield.However, in the second quarter, the price of oil decreased 18  over the prior year's quarter while oil production remained flat. The average realized gas prices rose significantly, but their effect was offset by reduced gas output due to timing of sales. As a result, the distribution of the trust in the second quarter decreased 16  year-on-year.Moreover, the realized oil and gas prices of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust decreased further in the third quarter, as they finally caught up with the decrease in benchmark prices. Although Cross Timbers Royalty Trust will report its third quarter results in November, we already know that its distributions in the third quarter fell 34  over the prior year's period.As Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is highly sensitive to the prices of both oil and gas, we will examine the outlook of each market separately in order to evaluate the stock.As mentioned above, the price of oil reached a multi-year high last year due to the sanctions of western countries on Russia. However, Russia has finally found ways to offset the impact of the sanctions by directing higher volumes of crude oil to China, India and a few other Asian countries.On the other hand, OPEC and Russia have implemented several rounds of production cuts in order to limit the global oil supply and thus support the price of oil. The latest decision of Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their production cuts of 1.3 million barrels per day until the end of the year triggered a 22  rally of the oil price in just one month. Overall, the price of oil has remained above average, even though it has deflated off blowout levels last year.However, it is important to realize that the strategy of OPEC and Russia results in a transfer of market share from these countries to non-OPEC countries. As per the latest  of the International Energy Administration  IEA , the aggregate production cuts of 2.5 million barrels per day of OPEC and Russia since early this year have been offset by record U.S. and Brazilian output and a steep production increase from Iran. Therefore, OPEC and Russia are not likely to continue reducing their production much further to support the oil price.Moreover, demand growth is expected to decelerate from next year due to the exponential increase in the sales of electric vehicles and a record number of green energy projects that are in their development phase. The boom in green energy projects, which has resulted from the sky-high oil prices experienced last year, is not likely to abate until oil prices plunge from current levels. Given also the proven cyclicality of oil prices, it is prudent to expect lower oil prices in the upcoming years.The price of natural gas collapsed early this year due to an abnormally warm winter but it has recovered strongly since then thanks to strong demand, though it remains about 65  lower than its multi-year peak last year.As per the latest  of the Energy Information Administration  EIA , U.S. natural gas consumption is expected to have grown by 5  in September over the prior year, to a new all-time high, after record levels in July and August. This helps explain the approximate 50  rally of the price of natural gas off its lows this year.However, U.S. natural gas consumption is expected to decrease from 89.7 to 88.8 billion cubic feet per day next year while production is expected to grow by 2.2 billion cubic feet per day. While higher LNG exports are likely to cover part of the resultant surplus, the gas market is likely to be well supplied next year, in the absence of severe winter weather. Given also the aforementioned boom in green energy projects, which resulted from the fierce energy crisis experienced last year, it is prudent not to expect higher gas prices in the upcoming years. As soon as all the renewable energy projects being developed begin to generate energy, they will probably reduce the consumption of natural gas.Most stocks are evaluated based on their price-to-earnings ratios. However, oil and gas trusts distribute all their net income to their unitholders. Therefore, they can be evaluated based on their distribution yield. More precisely, investors can compare the current distribution yield to the historical average distribution yield of a trust to draw a conclusion on the valuation of the trust.As mentioned above, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust has offered total distributions of  1.52 in the first 9 months of the year, corresponding to a 10.9  yield at the current stock price. However, as oil prices have decreased and gas prices have plunged off last year s blowout levels, this yield is misleading.The trust has offered total distributions of  0.49 in the last four months. These distributions, which correspond to an annualized yield of 7.9 , are more representative of normal commodity prices. The 7.9  yield may seem high on the surface, but it is lower than the 10-year average yield of 9.3  of the stock.The market has historically required such a high yield from Cross Timbers Royalty Trust over the last decade primarily due to the risk related to the long-term natural decline of the production of the trust. The trust  that it expects its oil and gas production to decrease by 6 -8  per year on average over the long run. This is an extremely strong headwind for future returns. To be sure, despite the 13-year high prices of oil and gas last year, the distributions in 2022 were 26  lower than those in 2014.To conclude regarding the valuation of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust, we note that its current yield  7.9  is lower than its 10-year average yield  9.3 . Therefore, the stock appears overvalued right now.Notably Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is currently offering a higher yield than its peers Sabine Royalty Trust  and Permian Basin Royalty Trust , which are yielding  and , respectively, based on their distributions in the last four months. However, these trusts are probably overvalued as well thanks to the above average prices of oil and gas prevailing right now.As mentioned earlier, it is prudent to expect oil prices to deflate off current levels and gas prices to moderate, primarily due to the accelerated shift of the entire world from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Whenever oil and gas prices incur a material correction, Cross Timbers Royalty Trust will probably have significant downside risk.In order for Cross Timbers Royalty Trust to reach a reasonable valuation level, the stock should correct by about 18   9.3 7.9  -1  and then by at least  20  in order to account for the expected moderation of commodity prices and the production decay of the trust. Therefore, a more reasonable stock price would be approximately  12.2  18.64   0.82   0.80 .The long-term outlook for oil and gas prices is bearish due to the boom of green energy projects but a temporary rally of these prices cannot be excluded. If OPEC and Russia keep reducing their output, they will trigger a rally of the price of oil or avert its correction. A geopolitical event, such as the recent turmoil in Israel, could also fuel a rally of the oil price. In addition, natural gas prices will probably rally if we experience an exceptionally cold winter. In all these cases, the stock of Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is likely to enjoy a rally off its current price.Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is offering a seemingly attractive yield of 7.9 . However, oil and gas prices are likely to decrease at some point in the upcoming years due to the ongoing transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. As a result, distributions are likely to decrease in the future. Given also the material decrease in the production of the trust over the long run, the stock has significant downside risk.

Patrick Industries: High-Quality Business With Attractive Valuation,"Patrick Industries  was one of the major beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the demand for recreational vehicles surged. The stock price more than doubled between 2019 and 2021, but in 2022, PATK's investors faced aPatrick Industries is a component solutions provider for recreational vehicles  RV , marine, manufactured housing  MH , and various industrial markets. PATK operates through a nationwide network that included, as of the latest fiscal year-end, 185 manufacturing plants and 67 warehouse and distribution facilities located in 23 states.The company's fiscal year ends on December 31. PATK operates within two reportable segments  Manufacturing and Distribution. According to the , the Manufacturing and Distribution segments accounted for 74  and 26  of sales, respectively, in FY 2022. RVs accounted for over half of the company's net sales in the last two fiscal years.The company's financial performance over the past decade has been strong. Revenue compounded at a staggering 26.3  CAGR, and the operating margin improved notably, from 6.8  to 10.2 . I like it when companies can deliver profitability ratio expansion as the business scales up because it suggests that the business model is sound. As a result, the free cash flow  FCF  margin ex-stock-based compensation  ex-SBC  more than doubled over the decade. However, the FCF has been very volatile in recent years but consistently positive.Despite having a consistently positive FCF margin, PATK's balance sheet is highly leveraged. The company is in a substantial net debt position, and its D E ratio is far above a hundred percent. On the other hand, the major part of the debt is long-term, and current liquidity metrics are in excellent shape. Overall, I cannot praise the capital allocation approach in the past because having a high amount of debt, while paying out dividends and conducting stock buybacks, does not look optimal to me. At the same time, I have to underline that the net debt dynamic is positive and decreasing from last year's peak.The latest quarterly earnings were released on July 27, when the company missed consensus revenue estimates but outperformed from the bottom line perspective. Revenue demonstrated a dramatic YoY 38  decrease, and the adjusted EPS more than halved. The weakness in revenue almost did not affect the gross margin, but the operating margin shrank by more than three percentage points.The upcoming quarter's earnings are expected to be released on October 27. Quarterly revenue is forecasted by consensus at  836 million, which suggests about a 25  YoY decline and a 9  sequential decline. The adjusted EPS is expected to follow the trajectory of the top line and drop from  2.43 to  1.77.Overall, the company is in a strong position in its niche, given a broad network of manufacturing and warehousing facilities, which allows it to drive logistics efficiency. The revenue growth is impressive, and  suggests that PATK's profitability metrics are mostly higher than the sector median, meaning the management is efficient in driving growth. But there are still plenty of jobs to be done to improve the balance sheet, especially in the current environment of  for RVs. I like that the  the need to improve cost-efficiency by streamlining and automating internal processes. The ultimate goal is to improve the balance sheet, and it is a positive sign that in the latest quarter, out of the  179 million operating cash flow,  117 million was used to reduce the outstanding debt balance.The company's efforts to improve and diversify the end market mix are also impressive. RVs represented almost 70  of the total sales in FY 2017, while this market's Q2 2023 TTM share decreased to 43 . The company is focusing on expanding its offerings in the Marine and Housing markets, which is strategically correct in my opinion.The stock rallied 23  year-to-date, significantly outperforming the broader U.S. market.  assigns PATK an average  C  valuation grade, meaning the stock is approximately fairly valued. Most of the multiples are significantly lower than the sector median. On the other hand, the current valuation ratios are close to historical averages. That said, I believe the stock's current market price is close to its fair price based on the multiples analysis.I want to simulate the discounted cash flow  DCF  model to get more evidence about the valuation. I use an elevated 12  WACC for discounting due to the notable volatility in the FCF margin over the past decade. Revenue  are available only for the next two years. For the years beyond, I incorporate a modest 3  CAGR. I use the last decade's FCF ex-SBC margin of 3  and expect it to expand yearly by 50 basis points over the next decade.According to my DCF simulation, the business fair value is  2.8 billion. This indicates a substantial undervaluation with an upside potential of 65 . That said, I think the stock's fair price is  124.The business is vulnerable to swings in the broader economic cycles. Periods of economic downturns will weigh on revenue growth, and profitability metrics are likely to shrink amid macroeconomic turbulence. Apart from affecting the revenue side, the cost also significantly depends on the cyclicality of raw materials prices.Such a massive portfolio of manufacturing and warehousing facilities poses multiple operational risks for the company. It is crucial to sustain an efficient supply chain resistant to disruptions like geopolitical events or temporary harsh weather conditions. PATK should also ensure strict product quality control is in place to mitigate reputational and financial risks. While having an extensive network of facilities is an asset allowing it to maximize logistics efficiency, it is also a burden to a company because physical facilities require substantial resources to be invested in maintenance and modernization. The company's facilities should improve in accordance with the evolving technological environment, and failure to do so might make these expensive assets obsolete.To conclude, PATK is a  Buy.  The valuation looks very attractive to me, and the upside potential outweighs the risks and uncertainties. I see a lot of positive trends indicating that PATK is a high-quality business, and I like the management's initiatives and long-term approach to creating value for shareholders.

Blue Bird: A Countercyclical Value Buy,"In today's environment of increased geopolitical tensions, elevated inflation levels, and falling stock markets, finding an investment immune from a cyclical downturn and potentially reduced discretionary spending levels is quite Difficult.Blue Bird Corporation A two-year turnaround plan at BLBD has delivered a high-margin, highly efficient manufacturer with significant growth potential. The highest volume alternative fuel school bus manufacturer looks set for growth unparalleled in its 80-year history.Wall Street and the SA Quant system rate Blue Bird as a strong buy. Blue Bird has a sustainable competitive advantage with a newly energized workforce, making the business an excellent countercyclical investment, a genuine value stock.From 2018 to 2021, Blue Bird seemed to spiral downward  sales revenue fell, and profits almost disappeared.Blue Bird was hit hard by the pandemic, as school lessons moved online and school buses were put in storage. Buses were neither properly maintained nor replaced, decimating Blue Bird parts and new vehicle sales.The pandemic reduced demand and led to supply constraints in most industries. The Backlog at BLBD crept up to 4,200 units in Oct 2021, not because of increased orders but because they could not produce vehicles being unable to source crucial components. BLBD reported minimal cancellations due to the delays and said 2,000 bus sales were deferred into 2022 .When the pandemic ended, supply chain issues continued, and the cost of inbound materials rose. The pre-pandemic backlog was still on the order book at fixed prices, and gross margins were wiped out, leading to the - 44 million EBIT in 2022.BLBD has emerged from the trauma of the pandemic as a lean and efficient producer with market-leading, high-margin products in an industry primed for significant growth. Management has transformed the business by concentrating on margins, production efficiencies, and staff.Increasing margins is not simple  by 2022, gross margins had dropped to 4.6 , turning cash flow to the company negative and unsustainable. 2023 margins are coming in around 16   Q3 earnings call , an astonishing turnaround. BLBD has achieved this by implementing several key strategies.The first and most obvious was to increase prices. It is easy to say but not always easy to do. From 2021 to 2023, sale prices increased by 25 , and 2024 models have a further  2,500 per bus increase. New contracts have price escalation clauses to cover changes to raw materials. Despite the price increases, sales volume is up over the period, and BLBD now has a backlog of 5,000 units, almost all of which are at the new higher price points  slide 17 of the . This backlog is due to increased orders, not a lack of production.An almost complete change in senior management was enacted in 2021  FY 2022  the new administration has worked to improve employee relations and redesign operating practices and factory layout. Total headcount has been reduced from 2,300 in 2020 to 1,600 today, a drop of 30  while at the same time increasing production.BLBD managed this change in workforce carefully, and employees have received significant improvements in terms and conditions, including additional paid holidays, pay raises, and improved benefits. The workforce voted to unionize last year, increasing their sense of job security. BLBD now works closely and transparently with the United Steel Union.  Q3 2023The changes have had a dramatic effect  it now takes 20 days from starting a build to booking  it used to take 40 days.  Q3 2023After the pandemic, most schools have returned to face-to-face learning. BLBD has seen a boost to its spare parts business as buses go back into operation, and with an aging fleet, new orders are arriving with some urgency. This spending is not discretionary  the buses must be replaced, and the market will be far more robust and predictable than many others.Diesel is being replaced as the dominant fuel by CNG and electricity. BLBD gave the following guidance EVs are the highest margin and highest priced of the three options, with diesel being the lowest priced lowest margin product. Alternative fuels are an area in which BLBD has had particular success. They claim a 60  market share of the alternative fuels market, and only they and Thomas Built Buses currently offer a CNG version. Blue Bird has produced 20,000 CNG buses using a Ford engine and ROUSH CleanTech low-pressure system. In the Q3 earnings call 2023, the relationship with Ford and Rousch was described as exclusive. CNG lowers fuel prices  compared to diesel and has fewer emissions.Cummins provides the electrical drive train through its Accelera brand name. The deal with Accelera appears to be exclusive, although I could find no evidence of this. Blue Bird is , and none of the BLBD competitors use the Accelera products. Cummins is an excellent partner in this field, having extensive electrical engine experience and a Hydrogen Fuel cell division for the future. The Cummins deal may be a source of a sustainable competitive advantage, Blue Bird's biggest competitor may have a problem in this area.  discussion below of Thomas Built BusesBLBD has produced more alternative fuel buses than the rest of the industry combined.  FY 2022 CEOFuel represents the most significant cost for School bus operators, and that price looks to be increasing. A general awareness about air pollution and the effects of car emissions on climate change are all driving a move towards the electrification of the school bus fleet. Electric buses reduce maintenance costs by as much as 80  and reduce the total cost of ownership. The range anxiety that appears to have halted the adoption of battery-electric heavy-duty trucks is not as crucial in school buses as they tend not to cover significant distances daily.The US government has launched several plans that give incentives to help states and schools move to electric vehicles. In 2022, a bi-partisan  scheme was launched to replace existing diesel buses with zero-emission ones.The scheme will award  1 billion in grants annually from 2022-2026. The 2022  announced, and BLBD did exceptionally well. Using the published data, I forecast the following sales for the 2022 round.  I could identify the supplier of 790 of the awarded buses from the published list and then assumed the   would be valid for the other awards where I could not find the manufacturer.Blue Bird has the largest market share, followed closely by Thomas Built Buses wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck , Lion Electric , and Navistar  known as IC Bus .Competitive analysis of the different busesThe buses are all quite similar  Thomas Built uses the Proterra Inc.  power train. Proterra stunned the industry in August when it filed for Bankruptcy, covered  by the excellent analyst Henrik Alex. We will have to wait to see how Thomas Built is affected. The parent company of Thomas Built Daimler Trucks North America may get involved by buying some of Proterra or supplying a new power train.I looked at Lion Electric and considered them a buy.Likely, the quality of the dealer channel, established service centers, and earned trust levels allowed BLBD and Thomas Built to acquire the largest market share. The problems with Proterra may push more orders towards BLBD in the future  however, in the Q3 2023 earnings, the CEO said he hoped to gain a little more than 25  of future awards, which would agree with my earlier analysis.This government initiative should deliver more than 700 EV school Bus orders to BLBD annually for the next five years, a transformative repeat order.In the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO said that BLBD now had 550 EVs in the backlog, and deliveries were up 50  year on year. BLBD continues to invest in its EV production upgrading facilities at its new EV production center. Alternative fuel buses were 63  of unit sales in the quarter.  We continue to be the clear leader in this space. No other manufacturer comes close to these numbers.  said the CEO.To further emphasize the transition, Britton Smith was appointed company president  Britton led the EV side for the previous 18 months.A 40,000 sqft building has been converted for EV chassis assembly, and capacity has increased from 2 units per shift to 4 with the expectation that they will move to 6 buses per shift later in the year. A double shift would give a capacity in excess of 5,000 units per year. A potential second market for these vehicles has been identified, selling commercial strip chassis for last-mile delivery  they should be with customers sometime in the next six months. Q3 2023 transcriptThe new efficiencies and changing product mix make a material difference to BLBD operating figures. In the q3 earnings, the following statistics were released.Unit sales up 24  year on yearNet revenue of  88 million, 43  higher than last yearFree cash flow of  43 million was  83 million higher than the previous year's outflowAverage revenue per bus increased 17  to  126,000The gross margin across the business was 15EPS was  0.44, up from - 0.09 last year.The SA Quant system has rated BLBD a strong buy since April 2023, placing it 3rd out of 42 in its industry. Most SA readers will be aware of the Quant system's predictive ability. In BLBD, we have a mix of the Quant system using historical data to make a positive prediction combined with a clear business case for increasing profits and returns.Wall street also gives it a strong buy with six analysts covering the stock.The six analysts give an average one-year price target of  27.58, an increase of almost 50  from today's price, and they are highly correlated with only a 15  difference between targets.The same analysts give an annual forecast earnings growth of 92 , giving an EPS target of  2 in 2025 from its negative  1.66 at the end of 2022.Using management guidance, I have constructed a 3-statement. The medium-term forecast for revenue is less than that provided by the management guidance, and margins are slightly tighter than the guidance. I am unsure if it will be possible to maintain their 28  EV market share and keep the same high margins. There will be other entrants to this space, which will inevitably have some impact.The model leads to a fair value of  31.50, almost 70  higher than its current valuation.BLBD is 14  owned by the general public and 84  owned by institutions investment companies, and the share price is up 150  in the last year  however, it has fallen from its June high of  28.There has not been meaningful dilution in the last year. However, some of the most significant shareholders have taken advantage of the 100  share price increase to book some profits on their investment.American Securities remains the largest single shareholder with 20  of the stock.As discussed, BLBD has had several difficult years, and the balance sheet still reflects this.Short-term assets do not cover short-term liabilities  shareholder equity  Total assets   Total Liabilities  is only  10 million. Debt is  135 million, giving a debt-to-equity ratio of 1,292 . EBIT does not cover interest payments, but this is better than the negative equity situation of 2021.Blue Bird will need the EPA school bus program to run its full five years and to maintain its high-margin product mix, enabling it to continue generating positive cash flow as it improves its financial position. With only  136 million of available liquidity, interest payments of  15 million per annum, and operating costs in the region of  100 million, the company has little room for error. The business is on an excellent path but does not have the luxury of being able to afford many setbacks.BLBD is a market leader in an established industry entering a growth stage. The growth is due to pent-up demand caused by delayed decisions during the pandemic, a significant government incentive scheme to transition to zero-emission buses, and an ongoing need to update the country's aging fleet of school buses.The alternative fuel School Bus market is a high-margin sector where BLBD has a significant and sustainable advantage with excellent products and the support of leading power train suppliers Cummins and Ford. The competition uses less well-known drive-train suppliers, and Blue Bird's largest competitor uses a power train from a bankrupt supplier.BLBD has a large backlog of orders at newer, higher price points and is in the process of increasing manufacturing capacity.The industry for school buses is unlikely to be affected by any slowdown in consumer spending or any fallout from the current geopolitical events unfolding.BLBD represents an excellent countercyclical investment and seems to be excellent value.

NL Industries: Undiscovered Dividend Stock For Income And Capital Gains,"Since January 2022, only two articles have been published about . However, I strongly believe that this undiscovered high-yield dividend company has many key positives that make it ideal for long-term investors, including income investors who want toAdditionally, I strongly believe that its strong fundamentals have been heavily downplayed, while its risk associated with the lead pigment litigation has been overplayed.So I decided to write an article about NL, presenting why it combines high yield of  with high capital appreciation potential.NL is a diversified holding company from the industrial sector, as Given that NL's business is mainly dependent on CIX's business, this is a brief excerpt about CIX, a As noted above, NL has a minority stake in KRO, which is a producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments  TiO2 , as Given that NL owns 87  in CIX, NL's revenue are coming from   security products and marine components , as illustrated belowNL has increased its revenue over the last years, as  and . It's also noteworthy that its revenue of  140.8 million in 2021of  124.2 million in 2019, despite the negative impact of Coronavirus. Additionally, its revenue of  166.6 million in 2022 again far exceeded its pre-pandemic revenue. On top of this, its revenue in 2023 are estimated to again far exceed its pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. That said, after three years in a row of meaningful growth, revenue in the first half of 2023 declined just 6  compared to prior year period, However, gross margin remained flat at about 30 , despite the high inflation and supply chain challenges that have weighed on numerous companies over the last couple of years.SG A expenses and other corporate expenses  compared to prior year period. As a result, NL recorded strong profitability in H1 2023 while maintaining a fortress balance sheet with zero debt and a lot of cash, despite the fact that its operating income dropped 30  compared to H2 2023.So I would like to emphasize that the loss at the bottom line in H1 2023 . Specifically, the loss at the bottom line in H1 2023 was due to these factors As a result of its investment in KRO, NL recognized equity in losses of  7.2 million compared to equity in earnings of  31.5 million in H1 2022. An unrealized loss of  10.9 million related to the change in value of marketable equity securities compared to an unrealized gain of  19.8 million in H1 2022. Specifically, NL owns debt securities  current marketable securities  and equity securities  non-current marketable securities , as quoted belowand belowA non-cash loss of  4.9 million due to the termination of its U.K. pension plan, as quoted belowWhen it comes to NL's cash flow, it's highly dependent on CIX's cash flow, but it's not equal to CIX's cash flow because NL does not own 100  of CIX, as quoted belowThat said, NL has generated positive operating cash flow  OCF  and positive free cash flow  OCF - CapEx  in H1 2023.Furthermore, it must not pass unnoticed the fact that its OCF in H1 2023  compared to prior year period, as illustrated below  in thousandsNL's market cap at  4.80 per share is approximately  235 million. As linked above, cash   cash equivalents   marketable securities are approximately  141 million, while interest-bearing debt is zero in Q2 2023. Therefore, the Enterprise Value is approximately  94 million at  4.80 per share.I project that Revenue and adj. EBITDA in 2023 will be approximately  160 million and  19 million, respectively. As a result, and  are estimated to be about  and   respectively, at the price of  4.80 per share. In other words, NL is very cheap no matter how you slice it.As noted above, NL conducts its operations through its majority-owned subsidiary CIX. And CIX is a highly profitable company with zero debt and a lot of cash that  positive operating cash flow and free cash flow over the last years, so it can afford to grow its business by expanding its geographic footprint and enhancing its product portfolio in the foreseeable future.On top of this, outlook for CIX's business is, despite some short-term challenges, as quoted from andandAs quoted in the previous paragraph, NL's revenue are coming from CIX. However, as noted above, the minority stake in KRO is included into NL's balance sheet and impacts NL's bottom line positively or negatively every year, so it's good to know that long-term outlook for KRO's business is , as quoted from   emphasis addedand  emphasis addedand  emphasis addedNL is not new in paying dividends. NL  since 1996, so I believe that it deserves to be included into an income portfolio.Based on the results for the first half of 2023 and outlook for CIX's business, I project that annual operating cash flow will be at least  30 million in 2023 and the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, annual CapEx has never exceeded  5 million over the last years, as . And it was just  .5 million in the first half of 2023, all of which relate to CIX, as quoted below  emphasis addedSo it's not surprising that CapEx in 2023 will be less than  5 million for another year in a row, as quoted below  emphasis addedOn that front, I forecast that annual CapEx will continue to be less than  5 million in the foreseeable future, so I project that annual free cash flow will be at least  in 2023 and the next years.Meanwhile, annual dividend payment is only , based on  0.28 per share annual dividend. Therefore, the annual free cash flow the annual dividend payment in 2023 and the foreseeable future.On top of this, NL has zero debt and cash   cash equivalents   marketable securities of approximately Q2 2023 , so this large cash cushion can be used to cover the gap, if any, between free cash flow and annual dividend payment in the next years.After all, I project that the regular dividend of And actually, in the next years.In August 2022, NL  of  0.35 per share, which translates into a current yield of approximately 7 . From a cash flow standpoint, NL paid just , which is a very small portion of its cash   cash equivalents   marketable securities of   in Q2 2023. NL also noted that  emphasis addedLast year's special dividend also is a strong indication that NL is confident about these thingsIts remaining cash is more than enough to meet payments in the future,  related to lead-paint complaints.It does not expect to have any cash flow problems, and projects that it will continue to generate positive operating cash flow and positive free cash in the foreseeable future.Given also that NL is a consistently profitable, debt-free company with its cash   cash equivalents   marketable securities being approximately  141 million  Q2 2023 , I believe that  in the foreseeable future.Insider ownership is very high, so insiders' interests are aligned with shareholders'. Specifically, based on the , the Simmons family owns  in NL, as illustrated belowNL is a small cap stock with relatively low daily volume due mainly to the high insider ownership, so high volatility is likely. Therefore, NL is not for day traders, momentum traders or short-term traders. Instead, the potential buyers need to have a 12-month investment horizon  at least . NL's revenue are highly dependent on CIX's business, which faces competition, as quoted  belowThe minority stake in KRO  NL owned approximately 35.2 million shares of KRO's common stock at June 30, 2023  impacts NL's bottom line positively or negatively every year, as also noted in a previous paragraph. And KRO faces competition despite its leading market position and the positive industry outlook, as quoted  below  emphasis added The Lead pigment litigation,   emphasis addedIn other words, this risk has to do with uncertainty regarding the outcome of the aforementioned litigation. Will NL finally pay a fine  If yes, how muchHowever, the following facts favoring NL cannot pass unnoticed, as quoted aboveA number of cases are inactive or have been dismissed or withdrawn.No final, non-appealable adverse judgments have ever been entered so far against NL.NL has never ultimately been found liable with respect to any such litigation matters, On top of this, there is one more key fact favoring NL that cannot pass unnoticed. Specifically, NL has insurance coverage agreements in place, so these insurers will reimburse NL for a portion of the future lead pigment litigation defense costs, if any, as quoted from the company's report linked above  emphasis added The case with California Department of Toxic Substances Control, as quoted from the company's report linked above  emphasis addedHowever, the following facts again favoring NL cannot pass unnoticed, as quoted from the company's report linked above  emphasis addedI have often noted that income investors need to diversify their holdings while also steering clear of indebted companies with high leverage such as REITs. Leverage does matter, and the REIT bloodbath over the last years offers a valuable lesson. The higher the leverage, the higher the investment risk, although many investors ignore or downplay the investment risk associated with the debt.That said, I strongly believe that NL at the current price levels deserves a prominent place in an income portfolio. It offers a juicy regular dividend of  while also having high upside potential thanks to its fortress balance sheet, low key multiples and positive outlook.From a stock performance standpoint, NL stock has corrected over the last couple of years due largely to negative market sentiment associated with the market bloodbath in 2022 and high stock market volatility in 2023. However, I strongly believe that this NL Industries, Inc. stock correction represents a big buying opportunity for the long-term investors.Value Digger is a former fund manager with more than 30 years of investment experience.

"Intuit: Big And Stable, But Still At The Mercy Of Weak Macro Climate","Based on my current outlook and analysis of Intuit , I recommend a hold rating. While I acknowledge that INTU is a big and stable business that has consistently compounded FCF over the years, I believe itINTU is a famous brand for anyone who does their own tax, small businesses, and accountants. There are 5 key products that INTU offers to its customers  , , , , and Mailchimp. The business has been around for a long time, and through organic andBased on what I learned from reviewing INTU  last week, the company's future looks bleak for the foreseeable future. Management's long-term revenue growth target of 15 to 20  was restated during the presentation, which was encouraging given that growth has been well below that range in recent quarters. My negative viewpoint is that Intuit, which grew 13  in FY23 and is expected to grow 11  at the midpoint in FY24, would need to significantly speed up its growth rate in order to meet these targets.Unfortunately, this trend appears to be here to stay for the foreseeable future, and I attribute much of it to the persistently difficult macro environment. I interpreted management's openness to sharing information about the macroeconomy as a signal that the economy will remain weak in the near future. To my mind, management's observation that small businesses have 90  less cash on hand this year compared to this time last year indicates that liquidity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue in the macro environment. As a result, spending money on riskier expansion projects or anything else deemed unnecessary will be put off as long as possible. The statistics  mentioned by management  showing a decline of 13 points in small businesses' credit scores and an increase of 30 percentage points in their average credit card balances corroborate my assessment of the current macro situation. In addition, as student loan payments resume and interest rates remain higher than in recent years, pressure is increasing on consumers' discretionary income. I'd also point out that the  and  are both on the rise. Clearly, we are nowhere near the end of this pain.But this is not the end of the road for INTU. Although I am pessimistic about the near future because of the sluggish macro situation, I think investors were heartened to see management actively pursue incremental growth opportunities. For instance, if well implemented, management's decision to expand Quickbooks' reach into the SMB mid-market  10 to 100 employees  should prove to be a significant growth driver. There is no dearth of product features, so I believe the odds of success are high if a solid go-to-market strategy is implemented. INTU is ramping up its efforts to increase its market share in the mid-market by strengthening its marketing strategy and expanding its sales team. If this upmarket shift is successful, INTU will have more experience figuring out how to expand into the market for companies with more than 100 employees  most likely between 100 and 250 . The end goal is probably increasing market share in the enterprise sector, but I don't think that will happen anytime soon. However, the fact that INTU has been able to successfully break into increasingly larger markets gives investors reason to believe they can achieve their ultimate goal of breaking into the enterprise market, which could be a stock valuation re-rating catalyst.Being conservative, I am assuming that growth rates stays at the current low-teens region, implying that INTU will not be meeting management s target for high-teens growth. Under this assumption and applying INTU historical average forward PE   which I think is fair as the business is growing in line with historical low-teens rate, my price target is  545, or 8  above where the stock price is today  507 .My primary concern is that recent economic and geopolitical events have caused widespread uncertainty and harmed businesses, causing some IT customers to become more picky in their purchasing decisions, delay modernization projects, and cut back on spending. Customers' IT spending and, by extension, demand for INTU's products and services, could be negatively impacted if the economic climate continues to deteriorate, especially given the company's exposure to SMB.My recommendation for INTU is a hold rating. INTU is a substantial and stable business with a strong track record of generating free cash flow over the years. However, it remains vulnerable to near-term macroeconomic conditions, which have a significant impact on its primary customer base, including small businesses and consumers. While there are promising long-term growth initiatives, I believe it may be prudent to wait until the macroeconomic challenges subside before considering an investment.

August CPI Report: Disinflation Remains But Not Enough To Pivot,"Earlier today, the . While the overall inflation number met expectations by rising 0.6  in the month of August  due to energy price increases , the core CPI number  which excludes food and energy  wasThe core inflation number, despite being above expectations, continues to show the trend of disinflation. Over the last three months, monthly core inflation numbers have been the lowest of the 12-month period. When annualizingThe disinflation trend is also continuing to be validated when looking at some of the  stickiest  pricing areas in the economy. Year-over-year prices for housing showed renewed deceleration in August, although rent inflation is decelerating at a slower pace and remains up 7.8  over a year ago. Service sector inflation dropped below 6  for the first time since July of 2022, also indicating a disinflationary trend there.What really throws a wrench onto the path to 2  inflation is the rise in headline inflation. Despite being segregated from core inflation, energy prices eventually make their way throughout the economy. August s headline inflation number is the largest monthly increase of the past 12 months and has reversed the downward trend in year-over-year inflation. The Fed will need to carefully monitor whether this is an outlier or a new trend developing.While energy prices are going up, they're still considered deflationary when examining the year-over-year data. This makes sense considering the major decline in prices that has occurred in the natural gas markets. If we experience a cold winter, or geopolitical events push oil prices higher, we may see energy become a bigger factor in future inflation reports.One additional price jump in the August inflation report revolved around nondurable goods. The inflation rate jumped from near zero to 2.5  year-over-year. The strong consumer and the growth rates of consumer spending continue to be another  fly in the ointment  for the Fed achieving price stability. If this is the start of a trend in goods inflation, the Fed may need to hold or hike for an even longer period. One silver lining may be the , but we will have to wait and see.Based on our recent history with the Federal Reserve, I do not believe the FOMC is willing to place an asterisk next to inflation and state that energy justifies current pricing levels. Fed fund futures are currently priced 12 basis points higher , meaning a coin flip as to whether or not another hike will occur before the end of this year.Disinflation continues in our economy, but it's still premature to determine where the bottom is here. Inflation may stall above 3  and require further action from the Federal Reserve or the sticky items may drop harder and bring us to the 2  core target. What's clear is that the idea of a rate cut or pivot is still premature.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Israel-Hamas war spurs oil uncertainty, higher geopolitical risk - TD Asset Management","TD Asset Management said Wednesday that oil  should trade at a relative premium in the near term as uncertainty grows around the state of affairs in the Middle East in the shadow of the ongoing war between IsraelThe conflict between Israel and Hamas is adding more uncertainty to markets already grappling with higher geopolitical risk and rising volatility,  Michael Craig, Head of Asset Allocation at TD Asset Management .I think oil in general will trade with a bit of a premium now because we have some degree of uncertainty now about what might transpire from here. It might be a localized war, or it might draw in other actors,  he added.  And then, that way, you could actually see a real material move in oil much higher.TD Asset Management also indicated that if the war remains localized, elevated oil prices should blow over in the coming months. However, if the war escalates and other nations become involved, the firm predicted that oil could surge well north of  100 per barrel and probably move towards  120 to  130 with a possibility of even  150 per barrel.On Wednesday, oil bumped up in price to  88.60 a barrel, reflecting a  move.As the energy market remains under pressure, here are some energy-related stocks and exchange traded funds and how they have performed since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas Exxon Mobil  , Chevron  , TotalEnergies  , ConocoPhillips  , Schlumberger  , and Occidental Petroleum  .United States Oil Fund LP  ,ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil  ,United States 12 Month Oil Fund LP  ,Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  ,Vanguard Energy ETF  ,SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF  , and VanEck Oil Services ETF  .",6,2023-09-13T14:25:32.000-04:00
U.S. Oil And Gas Echoes Macro And Geopolitical Environment (Video),"The most unfortunate threats to global economies are the volatility and instability wrought by the recent attack on Oct. 7 of Israel. We were already troubled by the Russia invasion of Ukraine. There has subsequently been a re-working of energy trade routes with both oil and natural gas. With the trouble in the Middle East, energy trade relationships could alter courses again.The centers of geopolitical gravity of late have been the Middle East and Russia. Notably, in a recent U.S-EU , a NATO leader spoke of how U.S. LNG hasWith respect to the Middle East, where I have spent much of my bandwidth assessing and the majority of my time from Oct. 4 to now even   of course, oil prices have risen to reflect a risk premium. Just like what happened with Russia last year, markets start to settle once specific events and their direction are more apparent. But we have groups willing to incite scorched earth policies and events. Eventually, this will have repercussions in another form, whether it be domestic political instability or being out of favor with investors as an investment destination.In both cases, alternative sources of gas and oil have been found by market participants. The U.S. is a significant player as a source of global oil and gas supply in Asia, and more so in Europe than previously.Also, in Europe, from a NATO perspective, they continue with sustainable sourcing of energy such as alternative fuels, microgrids, storage   more home-grown solutions. In Montana, on a panel and conversation with a former Governor of Montana, we talked about various forms of storage and energy. Energy storage is becoming an increasingly interesting space in which new ventures and acquisitions will be happening. All of the majors such as Exxon Mobil  and Chevron  are investing to make sure they can play in emerging energy spaces of the future.Given the events of the day, oil and gas markets and the energy transition have changing investment implications. Interest rate increases are a driver in ways we are just starting to see, especially with renewables and EVs. Higher rates shift decision making. This idea was echoed by the CEO of AT T, who l listened to at the economist conference I attended just before Montana. Regarding  transition  type investments, I would focus more on needs-based investments. The Inflation Reduction Act legislation is a real mixed bag on its incentives, distortions and ultimate effects, and thus capital signals.In the end, oil is fungible and a most-traded commodity. In advanced economies, electrification is becoming potentially more inflationary with all of the factors of green, as witnessed in Europe. Many countries in Europe are rolling back their initial plans to some degree, but not entirely either. Power generation grows in the rest of the world. From a recent Texas-focused energy conference at Texas Tech University on Oct. 20, unique demand centers are emerging in the tech space that can offset the supply-demand mismatches that are occurring. My 2023 theme of  is playing out in a big way in Texas, owing to its decentralized market.The natural gas trade is shifting around the globe, as alluded to in the  work. The U.S. is a low-cost producer in oil and gas and a reliable partner. We're a global benchmark as I noted in the past, and in my Montana presentation  roughly half way through .Oil prices will remain higher with tight supplies occurring to the year end. U.S. producers are expected to respond, but this is still a capital discipline regime by oil and gas firms. It seems that natural gas prices in the U.S. will stay on the lower side. Importantly, U.S. production is a player on the global stage, with new avenues emerging as geopolitics shift thinking and strategies.In recent, West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, a key U.S. oil price benchmark, is now to be folded into the global benchmark Brent, alongside its other constituents.In the past, I have written extensively about Pioneer, the Permian, and more recently about the Exxon acquisition. The market s reception is quite significant and positively viewed. Given the events of the last couple of weeks in geopolitics, it's all the more positive that consolidation and scale occur in parts of the industry. In my article from April, where the acquisition idea was floated, much is covered.  First    potential tie-up article .With the Chevron-Hess   announcement, the continuing consolidation in the industry indicates the ideas of scale and efficiency  this was discussed and analyzed more in-depth since the first quarter of 2023.The   possibly looking to acquire Marathon Oil  speaks to this continued theme.At the National Association of Business Economists conference Oct. 9-10, a few takeaways stand out. One of the sessions I attended focused on the macro environment, with attention to rising long-term yields. This Wall Street Journal article speaks to the idea.Logan didn t delve deeply into what specifically is driving up term premiums. But on Wall Street, many have  that yields have been rising largely thanks to a growing federal budget deficit.However, being in the room on Oct. 9, my notes sayPressure is stemming from long-term yields. Where the pressures are coming from determine the direction of interest rates changes, whether up or down. Logan mentioned that half of the long-dated yields is from the term premium.Then the 19, Fed Chairman Powell , echoing what Logan had saidOn the global macro side, Logan mentioned slowing global growth in the second and third quarter. China s structural issues influence this but also near-shoring trends are influencing global trade flows.Additionally, I was struck by a comment in the deindustrialization panel. Bottomline  Different trading relationships are happening. We're still dependent on China trade  it s just happening differently via proxies such as Vietnam.Also, there's the chance that trading blocs shift toward that of like-minded partners. North America looks good and offers  balance.  Other parts of the world are more difficult to project, especially now with this current crisis and its effect in the Middle East and beyond. In the longer term, the momentum of  markets  will prevail   but we are effectively disrupted.Our U.S. industry is global, capable and efficient. We will continue to utilize technology to produce resources more efficiently and cleanly in the future. I think with Exxon s purchase of Pioneer, the sheer size of Exxon will allow for new advances in the Permian, and translate elsewhere. The same is true of the Chevron-Hess acquisition.In general, my geopolitical takeaway is  Disengagement is not an option. We can engage with the rest of the world in energy and alongside our capital markets. That is a positive path forward  our technology, innovative minds and markets  transparency.Secondly, the theme of natural gas being a  transition  fuel is still my main idea in that thought experiment. However, on a practical level, natural gas is a generally reliable and affordable source of baseload power. It has a cleaner emissions profile and more work is being done globally to cleanup methane emissions, a byproduct of its production when not addressed.With regards to Energy Transfer  and an upcoming feature, the eventual start of their Lake Charles LNG plant is a net positive for the U.S., the industry and other countries. There has been support for their stewardship in this capacity from global players such as Shell  and others.  Once the story is online, I will post a link in comments.In summary, U.S. oil and gas offers a bullish investment theme as noted in the video. Given geopolitics, oil market tightness and the economic outlook, the majors have picked their moment well. In the  shale story, I noted that the majors had l, and now they have returned. In 2023, they have returned again in even more full force. The requisite energy infrastructure has to work, connecting supply to demand centers, as geopolitics and market conditions shift the landscape again. The midstream sector, which includes diversified players like Energy Transfer with their large global footprint, also will be part of the solution.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was a good quarter for our community and our business. We estimate that there are now more than 3.9 billion peopleThere continues to be a ton of innovation in AI. And we used Connect to describe and start launching a lot of the new consumer AI experiences that we expect to become meaningful parts of all of our apps and our business over the coming years. We started rolling out Meta AI, our new assistant that you can access across all our messaging experiences and smart glasses to answer questions, get access to real-time information, and generate photorealistic images. We started launching our AI Studio platform that enables people to create and interact with lots of different AIs for help getting things done and just having fun. We rolled out Emu, our image creation model that produces high quality images and stickers fast. We launched an early alpha of business AIs so that eventually every business can have an AI to interface with customers to do sales and support. And we let out the plan to launch creator AIs next year, so every creator can have an AI their fans can engage with to help them build out their community. And that's just a snapshot of some of the AI work that we're doing.The experiences that we start rolling out at Connect are going to transform the way that people use all our services, feeds, messaging, hardware, advertising, business messaging, interacting with creators and more. But it's going to take time to tune all these experiences before hundreds of millions or billions of people are going to use them. And I expect that dialing in these products and the vision that we articulated at Connect is going to be our theme for much of the next year. And I think that it's going to be a very exciting 2024. As we are looking ahead and planning for next year, I want to share a few thoughts on what I'm expecting. I've been happy with our results this year so far, and we are planning to continue focusing on operating efficiently going forward, both because it creates a more disciplined and lean culture and also because it provides stability to see our long-term initiatives through in a very volatile world.Now, in terms of investment priorities, AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024, both in engineering and compute resources. But I want to avoid allocating a lot of new headcount. So we're going to continue deprioritizing a number of non-AI projects across the company to shift people towards working with AI instead.On the recruiting front, one dynamic that I want to flag is that, we have a sizable hiring backlog right now since part of our layoffs earlier this year included teams swapping out certain skill sets for being able to hire others. And we're still going to be hiring those roles into 2024. So that means that even though we're planning to grow headcount at a much slower rate going forward, the actual rate next year may temporarily be faster as we work through this hiring backlog.All right. Now, let's get into our product updates. Let's start with Reels, which continues to do very well. We estimate that with all the ranking and product improvements that we've made, Reels has now driven more than 40  increase in time spent on Instagram since launch. We also reached a monetization milestone earlier than expected. And we estimate that Reels is now net neutral to overall company ad revenue. In many ways, Reels has now graduated from being an early initiative to now being a core part of our apps.So going forward, and we're going to continue focusing on Reels, but we'll also look at growing it as part of our overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of the time that is spent on Facebook and Instagram. And there s a lot more to do across all of these.All right, AI. AI advances are driving a lot of our product and business performance. Generative AI will increasingly be important going forward. I outlined our product roadmap earlier. And on top of that, we're also building foundation models like Llama 2, which we believe is now the leading open source model with more than 30 million Llama downloads last month. Beyond that, there was also a different set of sophisticated recommendation AI systems that powers our feeds, Reels, ads, and integrity systems. And this technology has less hype right now than generative AI, but it is also very important in improving very quickly.AI-driven feed recommendations continue to grow their impact on incremental engagement. This year alone, we've seen a 7  increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6  increase on Instagram as a result of recommendation improvements. Our AI tools for advertisers are also driving results with Advantage  shopping campaigns, reaching a  10 billion run rate and more than half of our advertisers using our Advantage  creative tools to optimize images and text in their ads creative.Business messaging also continues to grow across our services and I believe will be the next major pillar of our business. There are more than 600 million conversations between people and businesses every day on our platforms. To give you a sense of what this could look like when it's scaled globally, every week now, more than 60  of people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account. A revenue from click to message ads in India has doubled year-over-year. Now I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for our new business AIs that I talked about earlier that we hope will enable any business to easily set up an AI that people can message to help with commerce and support.Today, most commerce and messaging is in countries where the cost of labor is low enough that it makes sense for businesses to have people corresponding with customers over text. And in those countries like Thailand or Vietnam, there's a huge amount of commerce that happens in this way. But in lots of parts of the world, the cost of labor is too expensive for this to be viable. But with business AIs, we have the opportunity to bring down that cost and expand commerce and messaging into larger economies across the world. So making business AIs work for more businesses is going to be an important focus for us into 2024.I want to give a quick update on Threads. We're three months in now, and I'm very happy with the trajectory. There are just under 100 million monthly actives at this point. And we're now getting to the point where we're going to be focusing on growing the community further. From what we can tell, people love it so far. I've thought for a long time that there should be a billion person public conversations app that is a bit more positive. And I think that if we keep at this for a few more years, then I think we have a good chance of achieving our vision there.Fine. Now finally, in addition to AI, our other major long-term focus is the metaverse. And we just launched Quest 3, our most powerful headset yet, at a very competitive price. We packed a lot of improvements in there, including a next generation chipset with 2x the graphics performance, our best display as yet, and a form factor that's 40  thinner than Quest 2. But the most important breakthrough for Quest 3 is that it's the first mainstream mixed reality device. And that means that when you put on the device, you see your physical room around you, and you can bring digital objects and games into your physical space, whether that's a ping pong table, your workstation, a big screen TV to play Xbox games on, or your friends as holograms. The early reviews have been great, and it's been fun to see how people respond to this.We also launched the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. They're upgraded from the first generation in basically every way. Better camera, clearer audio, they're lighter, they have more styles, and you can now even live stream video from them. But most importantly, these are the first smart glasses shipping with Meta AI built in. So you can ask your glasses questions throughout the day. It'll answer them right in your ear. And in many ways, glasses are the ideal form factor for an AI device because they enable your AI assistant to see what you see and hear what you hear. Again, it's good to see the early reviews, they're so positive, and I'm looking forward to this space evolving quickly over the coming years.We are also making progress on software for the metaverse too. Horizon is now growing faster. There's more new worlds like Super Rumble and Citadel come online. We also started testing Horizon for phones, tablets, and PCs, which is going to be an important part of how we build out the metaverse across devices. And we've had a couple of important milestones with avatars as well, both for our expressive avatars and the latest codec avatars that I showed off recently.Now, as I said at Connect, I think one of the most interesting questions for our industry over the coming decades is going to be how we bring together our physical and digital worlds into a coherent and good experience. I think we're starting to see some of the building blocks come together between mixed reality for bringing digital objects into the physical world, our AI studio work for enabling interactions with all kinds of different AIs, and eventually smart glasses to bring all this together into a stylish form factor. So I am very excited about the roadmap ahead.All right. That is my update for today. This was a good quarter. I'm pleased with our progress on efficiency this year. We're a leaner organization, shipping faster and advancing the state-of-the-art in all of our long-term initiatives. And while investing heavily for the future, we also just recorded our highest operating margin in two years. So I'm looking forward to carrying this product momentum and operating discipline forward. As always, thank you to everyone on our team and all of you who are on this journey with us.And now, here's Susan.Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was  34.1 billion, up 23  or 21  on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were  20.4 billion, down 7  compared to last year.In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9 , as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lower content costs. R D increased 1 , as higher headcount-related costs from Family of Apps and Reality Labs were partially offset by lower non-headcount related Reality Labs operating expenses. Marketing   Sales decreased 24 , due primarily to lower marketing spend and headcount-related costs. G A decreased 39 , due primarily to lower legal-related expenses.We ended the quarter with over 66,100 employees, down 7  from the second quarter. Our third quarter headcount no longer included the substantial majority of the employees impacted by the previously announced layoffs.Third quarter operating income was  13.7 billion, representing a 40  operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17 . Net income was  11.6 billion or  4.39 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were  6.8 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Capital expenditures were below the prior year levels primarily due to lower server and data center construction spend as we prepared to shift to our new data center design, as well as payment timing.Free cash flow was  13.6 billion, benefitting from a deferral of income taxes which was paid in the fourth quarter. We repurchased  3.7 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and ended the quarter with  61.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and  18.4 billion in debt.Moving now to our segment results. I ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 3.14 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September, and that approximately 3.96 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis.Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. Facebook daily active users were 2.09 billion, up 5  or 101 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 68  of the 3.05 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by 91 million or 3  compared to last year.Q3 Total Family of Apps revenue was  33.9 billion, up 24  year-over-year. Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was  33.6 billion, up 24  or 21  on a constant currency basis.Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming. Online commerce and gaming benefited from strong spend among advertisers in China reaching customers in other markets. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 36  and 35 , respectively, followed by Asia Pacific at 19  and North America at 17 . Foreign currency was a tailwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions.In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 31  and the average price per ad decreased 6 . Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.Family of Apps other revenue was  293 million in Q3, up 53 , driven by strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were  16.4 billion, representing approximately 81  of our overall expenses. FoA expenses were down 9  as growth in infrastructure-related costs was more than offset by lower legal-related expenses, marketing, and headcount-related costs. Family of Apps operating income was  17.5 billion, representing a 52  operating margin.Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was  210 million, down 26  due primarily to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were  4.0 billion, flat year-over-year as higher headcount-related expenses were offset by lower non-headcount related operating expenses. Reality Labs operating loss was  3.7 billion.Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, overall engagement on Facebook and Instagram remains strong. Reels, and video content more broadly, continues to grow and drive incremental engagement. AI- recommended content from unconnected accounts in Feed continues to become increasingly incremental to engagement, including in the US   Canada. These gains are being driven by improvements to our recommendation systems and we see additional opportunities to advance our systems even further in the future as we deploy more advanced models.We re also developing entirely new experiences for our community. Our investments in AI capacity in recent years have enabled us to support leading Generative AI research and we re meaningfully accelerating the pace of bringing that research into our products. We launched our first consumer Gen AI experiences last month that are built on top of our foundation models and are excited to learn from how people use these tools to make them increasingly valuable over time. Aside from Generative AI, Threads also remains a compelling long-term opportunity and we re excited to build on the strong product momentum we have going into next year.Turning to the second driver, improving monetization. Here, our focus is on continuing to drive marketing performance for businesses, including through business messaging. There are four areas of this work, improving Reels monetization  creating engaging on-platform ad experiences  making it easier for advertisers to connect their marketing data, and increasingly leveraging AI across our ads systems and products.On Reels, we have continued to improve monetization and are now at a level where Reels is neutral to overall revenue. We ve made tremendous progress over the last year building and scaling Reels as a consumer product, and it has now become part of the core experience on Instagram and Facebook. As such, we don t anticipate quantifying the net revenue contribution from Reels going forward. We will still work to further improve Reels ads performance through ranking improvements and making Reels ads increasingly interactive, while also growing supply to give businesses more opportunities to get in front of people. We anticipate this ongoing work will help Reels be a modest tailwind to revenue in 2024 while we continue to strike the right balance between engagement and revenue growth. But our focus going forward will be on growing revenue and engagement on overall video, and more holistically across our product lines within Instagram and Facebook.Next, onsite experiences. We re seeing sustained momentum with Click-to-Message ads. Click-to-WhatsApp ad revenue continues to grow very quickly in particular and is already at a multi-billion dollar annual run-rate. We re progressing on our work to enable further down the funnel conversions, and longer-term, we re excited about the potential of AI to help businesses message with customers more efficiently at scale. We ve recently started testing AI capabilities with a few partners and will take our time to get the experience right, but we believe this will be a big unlock for business messaging in the future. We re also excited about the potential for paid messaging, which serves as a nice complement to click-to-messaging ads by helping businesses develop ongoing relationships with customers once they re in a messaging thread. Outside of business messaging, we re seeing good early traction with Shops ads and in the third quarter we announced expanded commerce integrations with third party services to make it easier for businesses to set up a Facebook or Instagram Shop and run Shops ads.The third piece of our work is making it easier for advertisers to connect their marketing data. We re investing in ways to make it easier for advertisers to adopt our Conversions API, understand its impact, and use it across a broader set of objectives. In addition to our existing support for AWS, in September, we announced the support of Google Cloud for the Conversions API Gateway. We ve also introduced enhanced reporting and rolled out Conversions API for Business Messaging so click-to-message advertisers can now better understand the value of WhatsApp and Messenger and improve their performance.Last, AI. We are leveraging AI across our ads systems and suite of products, which is driving improved performance for advertisers. We re increasingly adopting the use of larger, more advanced ads models and using AI to power ads products that provide increased automation to advertisers. We re seeing strong traction with our Advantage  Shopping solution, particularly around online commerce and CPG advertisers looking to drive online sales. And we re continuing to invest in several other products within our Meta Advantage  suite to help advertisers optimize and automate more of their campaigns.Before turning to our revenue outlook, I d like to provide color on our hiring plans as we look to 2024. One important point to note is that we are currently operating with a significant underrun against our 2023 budgeted headcount. For much of late 2022 and early 2023, we had instituted a broad-based hiring freeze as we undertook our restructuring efforts. In addition, as part of those restructuring efforts, many teams elected to make deeper headcount reductions in order to hire different skill sets that they need. We have since resumed hiring but expect that much of our hiring that was originally planned for and budgeted in 2023 will occur in 2024.As part of our 2024 budget, we plan to selectively allocate incremental headcount toward four key company priorities, AI, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and monetization as well as toward our regulatory and compliance needs. Of those areas, we expect AI to be the largest area of increased investment as we further invest in Generative AI across our core products, internal tooling, and research efforts. We aim to offset some of this growth by continuing our efficiency focus and reducing planned hiring in other areas across the company in 2024.The net effect of our efforts to close out our 2023 hiring underruns and our efficiency-focused 2024 budgeting process is that we expect to end next year with reported, in-seat headcount meaningfully higher than our current headcount, but to grow at a slower rate beyond that. We also expect a step-up in infrastructure-related expense growth next year as we recognize higher depreciation and operating costs from running an expanded infrastructure footprint.In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the FTC is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of  36.5 billion to  40 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 2  to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates.Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of  87 billion to  89 billion, lowered from our prior range of  88 billion to  91 billion. This outlook includes approximately  3.5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.We are also sharing a preliminary outlook for 2024 expenses, CapEx and our tax rate. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of  94 billion to  99 billion. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024. First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will continue to shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR VR and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.Turning now to the capex outlook. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of  27 billion to  29 billion, updated from our prior estimate of  27 billion to  30 billion. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of  30 billion to  35 billion, with growth driven by investments in servers, including both non-AI and AI hardware, and in data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with the new data center architecture we announced late last year.On to tax. Absent any changes to US tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2023 and full-year 2024 tax rates to be similar to the third quarter of 2023. Please note that our outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates. In the future, we expect to provide our forward -- our initial forward year expense, capex and tax rate outlooks on the fourth quarter call.In closing, this was a good quarter for our business as our efficiency efforts are translating into improved financial results and we re seeing momentum across our company priorities. We re excited to build on this work in 2024 as we invest in areas that have the potential to meaningfully transform how people engage with our services and each other in the years ahead.With that, Dave, let s open up the call for questions.Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.Great. Thanks for taking our questions. I have two. The first one, Mark, just wanted to ask you about the open source model strategy. You've been a leader in developing a lot of unique open source AI models. You've got some high-profile distribution partners now. How do you think about the strategic opportunity for Meta from the growing open source model adoption  And then the second one, Susan, just on the operating losses at Reality Labs. I understand there s product development and efforts to scale the ecosystem. Can you help us understand or give us examples of expenditure going on within Reality Labs that could also be ported and used over at Family of Apps perhaps over timeSure, okay. I can start with the AI models. We have a pretty long history of open sourcing parts of our infrastructure that are not kind of the direct product code. And a lot of the reason why we do this is because it increases adoption and creates a standard around the industry, which often drives forward innovation faster so we benefit, our products benefit, as well as there's more scrutiny on kind of security and safety-related things so we think that there's a benefit there. And sometimes, more companies running models or infrastructure can make it run more efficiently, which helps reduce our costs as well, which is something that we've seen with open compute. So I think there's a good chance that, that happens here over time. And obviously, our CapEx expenses are a big driver of our costs, so any aid in innovating on efficiency is sort of a big thing there.The other piece is just that over time with our AI efforts, we've tried to distinguish ourselves as being a place that does work that will be shared with the industry and that attracts a lot of the best people to come work here. So a lot of people want to go to the place to work where their work is going to touch most people. One way to do that is by building products that billions of people use. But if you're really a focused engineer or researcher in this area, you also want to build the thing that's going to be the standard for the industry. So I know that's pretty exciting and it helps us do leading work. While at the same time, a lot of the secret sauce that goes into our product has specific product logic on top of the model, and we're also able to further train the models with data that we have internally. So I think it's a good balance of improving the quality of what we do and improving the economics around it and improving recruiting while still enabling us to build a leading product.And Brian, I'll go ahead and take your second question, which is on the operating losses at Reality Labs and whether there's any benefit to Family of Apps from some of that work. So first, I should clarify, the majority of our Reality Labs costs are direct costs in headcount, operating expenses and product costs for the Reality Labs work. The remainder of the Reality Labs total costs are indirect costs such as facilities that get allocated based on our estimate of their benefit to Reality Labs. Now, as you alluded to, Reality Labs is working to build the future of online interactions. And we do expect you'll see some interesting ways that translate into work with the Family of Apps in the near term. For example, with avatars, you've already seen 1 billion avatars created so far. We expect that this will become increasingly important across the Family of Apps. And we're also starting to see how our hardware can help create unique content for Facebook and Instagram today with our Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses making it easier to capture and share to Family of Apps, including live-streaming, and we think that will obviously create more engaging content for the content ecosystem.Longer term, obviously, we think there's a lot of value from operating our Family of Apps experiences on top of a new computing platform that we helped develop, for example, having glasses on that enable you to have our Meta AI assistant with you at all times. And as glasses scale, they'll make it increasingly easy to capture compelling content from a first person point of view while you're staying in the moment or the activity that you're doing and sharing that content should enrich our content ecosystems even further. But again, the operating losses that are occurring within the Reality Labs segment are really driven by the Reality Labs work directly. And we think that over the sort of arc of the years ahead, there will be increasing shared benefits to our Family of Apps experiences.Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe on the business, I have two. One, when you see maybe a wider divergence than we thought in terms of some of the regional performance of the advertising businesses, anything to call out region by region in teams of either macroeconomic conditions or levels of product initiatives having been rolled out in different parts of the world that might led to a wider divergence in operating performance in the ad business across the globe would be number one  And then two, Susan, you introduced this concept a couple of quarters ago about data center architecture, and you said it's now being deployed in the way you're allocating capital into the business. Is there any update on how we should be thinking about that on a multiyear view in terms of achieving additional capital efficiencies and be able to deploy less CapEx but maybe with a higher throughput or output on those dollars spent  Thank you.Thanks, Eric. So your first question, I think, was about regional trends or regional themes in our ad revenue, which as you saw this quarter accelerated across all regions. To give you a little bit of color, in North America, we saw accelerate by 7 points due primarily to strong demand from China advertisers. Note that North America didn't experience the same currency tailwinds that drove acceleration in year-over-year growth for the other regions. In the EU or in our EU region, we saw that accelerate 21 points. There was a broad-based acceleration in the region, including demand from China advertisers and some benefit from currency tailwinds after facing currency headwinds in Q2. Asia Pacific accelerated 9 points. We benefited from stronger demand in Southeast Asian countries, and again, the flip to currency tailwinds versus headwinds in Q2. Rest of World accelerated 20 points. We saw both stronger pricing and the same currency dynamic there. Brazil was a strong contributor to the region's acceleration due in part to increased advertisers' demand from China advertisers targeting users in Brazil.Your second question was around the impact of the new data center architecture on our CapEx investments in the years to come. We are still relatively early on this. We had to pause some of our existing data center construction work to switch over to the new data center architecture that played through in some of our 2023 CapEx dynamics. And going forward, as I think we said when we introduced the concept of this architecture, we expect it to be more cost efficient for us. We expect it will give us greater fungibility in the way that we plan for CPU and GPU capacity. So we expect that we'll be realizing the cost benefits and efficiencies and the planning flexibility that the architecture gives us in the years to come.And your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. The first is, this month, you started to roll out some of those first kind of gen AI tools for ad creative. I'd love to hear a little bit about kind of how that's going. Are advertisers using this  And really, is it creating better ads on their behalf  And then secondly, as we kind of look ahead here to the fourth quarter, there's certainly been a lot of unfortunate geopolitical kind of activity around the globe. Would love to just understand some color on how that affects kind of Meta's ad business. Thank you.Hi, thanks, Mark. I can take both of those. So your first question was around gen AI tools, especially for advertisers and you'll see that we have been increasingly testing these in our AI sandbox. And then as they become more mature, we incorporate them into our ads manager directly. We've incorporated them into some of our Advantage  solutions. A few that I would highlight that we're rolling out this quarter are text variations, so generating multiple versions of ad text based on an advertiser's original copy that helps highlight the selling points of their products and services, giving them multiple text options to better reach their audience. Another one is image expansion, which helps adjust creative assets to fit different aspect ratios across multiple services like Feed or Reels. That allows advertisers to spend less time themselves trying to repurpose their creative assets in these different formats. Another one is background generation, creating multiple backgrounds to complement the advertisers' product images, allowing advertisers to tailor their creative assets for different audiences. And we're making this available actually through Advantage  catalog ads.And so we really feel like we've introduced quite a lot of new ads products and features. You asked about the gen AI one specifically. So those are the ones I highlighted. We've actually introduced a number of others that are related to other dimensions of the ad creation experience that we expect will help improve our advertising performance, will help advertisers drive sales, especially over the holidays and especially in the Advantage  shopping suite. So we're very excited about all of those upcoming launches, and we think that the early advertiser feedback has been very positive.Your second question was on looking ahead in Q4 and the impact of some of the geopolitical activity that we've seen around the world and how that might be affecting our business. So first, I think I should start by saying that our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the horrific violence in the Middle East, and we know that our services can be a vital tool for information and connection and expression at a moment like this. And we're continuing to monitor the situation and are doing everything we can to keep people safe and to keep our services secure.Now in terms of how this translates into impact on the Q4 business, first of all, I should say that coming into Q4, we've been seeing continued strong advertiser demand in key segments, including online commerce and gaming. But having said that, we are also seeing more volatility at the start of the quarter. That's in part why we widened our guidance range to capture that uncertainty. And so for instance, while we don't have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook.It's hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event. Historically, we have seen broader demand softness follow other regional conflicts in the past such as in the Ukraine war. So this is something that we're continuing to monitor. We've reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we've seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, we think, reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility in the landscape ahead. I want to add here, too, that we are pleased with the fundamentals of the business and with our execution. We've seen promising engagement trends. We're continuing to drive ad performance improvements. We're executing well on our company priorities. So we'll continue to stay focused in those areas, and we'll also remain disciplined with our investment approach as we navigate a volatile environment.Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.Thanks for taking the questions. One for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, I was hoping you could talk more about the gen AI-driven vertical chatbots and Meta AI assistant rolled out of Connect a few weeks ago. How do you think about the potential for these products to improve both engagement and monetization over time  And then Susan, I know it's early but I was hoping you could talk a little bit qualitatively about some of the puts and takes to 2024 revenue growth. And then in particular, whether you'd expect revenue to grow faster than expenses off a normalized revenue base backing out restructuring  Thanks.Sure. I could talk about some of the AI launches first. We launched Meta AI, which is sort of an AI assistant that you can ask different questions and get access to real-time information as well as generating images. And we also launched the first version of AI Studio with several initial AI characters that you can interact with. And part of the idea here is that we think that having a basic assistant is really important, but we think that people are going to -- there are going to be lots of different AIs that people interact with. We think ultimately, most creators are going to want one to help grow and engage their community. We think most businesses are going to want one to help support their customers and help drive commerce. So we think that there are going to be a lot of different AIs. In terms of engagement, the first order effect is, I think at scale, I think that this is going to be one of the ways that people use our messaging apps and communicate with, and you're going to talk to people and you'll talk to AIs. What the mix of that is, I think, will kind of shift over time and I don't think anyone can really predict that. But this is a new use case that doesn't take away from people interacting with people. If anything, it should -- we're designing these to make it so that they can help facilitate and encourage interactions between people and make things more fun by making it so you can drop in some of these AIs into group chats and things like that just to make the experiences more engaging. So this should be incremental and create additional engagement.The AIs also have profiles in Instagram and Facebook and can produce content, and over time, going to be able to interact with each other. And I think that's going to be an interesting dynamic and an interesting, almost a new kind of medium and art form. So I think that will be an interesting vector for increasing engagement and entertainment as well. So I'm excited about that. Of course, whenever there's more engagement in the apps, that creates the opportunity for more monetization, so there's that on the monetization side. And then the other big opportunity on monetization, which I talked about upfront is just business messaging. One of the big things that I think is a key unlock for making the business messaging -- for making that business model work around the globe is effectively making it so that businesses in countries where there's a higher cost of labor can have an AI that can respond to messages from people so that way, it's not cost prohibitive for them to engage in that type of interaction with customers. So I think that if we can -- as we are able to roll out the business AIs, I think that, that can really unlock and grow the business -- messaging business in a big way, but we have a lot of work to do to get there. So that's kind of a basic view on how I think this will affect the engagement in business.I'm happy to take the second question. Thanks, Doug. We obviously have not shared a 2024 revenue outlook yet. You asked about what are some of the significant puts and takes, and I'd maybe point back to what I said earlier about the Q4 outlook just to highlight what a volatile macro environment we believe we're in. I think that will obviously have a big impact on the advertising market next year, and it's something we'll be keeping a very close eye on. But ultimately, we're very subject to volatility in the macro landscape. Certainly, our own ads performance is an area where we have invested a lot, and we've seen a lot of increased value that we've been driving for marketers. We've been increasing the conversions we deliver, higher -- and offering higher return on their ad spend so we think that will be an important factor. We're continuing to enroll a lot of new features, both gen AI and not in our ads tool, and we're continuing to improve the ranking and delivery models that underlie our ads infrastructure. We'll also be obviously lapping stronger periods, especially in -- as you saw with this quarter's results. So all of those factors, I think, will play into the 2024 revenue outlook.You also asked about the kind of the expense philosophy next year, whether expense growth will be tied to revenue growth. Obviously, the revenue outlook is uncertain. We talked a little bit about the -- what's going into the preliminary expense guide for 2024. The big components there are around infrastructure expenses. We do expect, given the increased capital investments that we have made in recent years, that depreciation expenses in 2024 will increase by a larger amount than in 2023. And we expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.The second big driver is on payroll. We anticipate payroll growth driven by the spillover of hiring that we had intended for 2023 into 2024. And we do expect that Family of Apps will be a larger source of payroll expense growth than Reality Labs in 2024. Additionally, hiring will generally be concentrated in technical roles, which will continue to shift our workforce composition towards a higher cost basis. And of course, the final piece being Reality Labs operating losses, which we expect to increase in 2024 across both the expense growth from higher payroll costs as well as higher non-headcount cost to support the development of our next-gen VR and AR products.How the expense and revenue outlook come together  Obviously, as we get more information on the revenue outlook for next year, that will influence that. Ultimately, we have talked about the framework that we introduced in the past. We recognize that we have very ambitious investments on the horizon, including over a long-time horizon with our Reality Labs work and newer, equally ambitious investments we've added in the gen AI roadmap more recently. And we recognize that we have to earn the ability to invest in all of those things by delivering consolidated operating income growth over time. So that's something we're very much focused on.Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about the DSA and DMA and also press reports that there could be a subscription offering in Europe. Maybe, Mark, how do you think about subscription usage for Facebook  Maybe an update on how Meta Verified is going and how you're thinking about the evolution of the model in Europe. Maybe we'll start with that. And then for Susan, I know you've talked a lot about Chinese advertisers. How do you think that could affect the growth as you comp that next year  Thanks a lot.Hi, Justin. Thank you for the question. I think there are multiple parts there and I will do my best to address all of them, but of course, let me know if I miss anything. So the first question was sort of around operating in Europe, in particular, the legal basis for ads. So as we announced in August, we intend to evolve our legal basis for processing personal data for ads to a consent model in the EU, the EEA in Switzerland, given the recent regulatory developments in those regions. We don't have any further details to share on the exact implementation at this time. We're continuing to engage with the DPC and other regulatory authorities on our proposed consent model, but we're committed to making this move as soon as possible, and we will provide an update when we have it.The second question you asked was about Meta Verified. So we're still, I think, quite early here but we've rolled out Meta Verified for creators to most markets globally. We continue to hear positive feedback from creators as we've helped them more easily establish their presence on Facebook and Instagram. We also have recently begun testing Meta Verified for businesses on Facebook and Instagram in select countries, and we have plans to expand that to businesses on WhatsApp in the future. And this will allow businesses to more easily stand out on our apps and build confidence with their customers and let their customers know that they're chatting with the right business. So we're encouraged by the early signs that we're seeing there, but again, very early and not a lot more to share right now.The third part of your question was around Chinese advertisers. So spend from Chinese advertisers further accelerated for us in Q3. We have benefited from strong investments from a few of our larger clients. We've also seen generally broader-based strength from other China advertisers, and we believe factors such as lower shipping costs and easing regulations on the gaming industry have served as tailwinds here. But I think there has been a broader story of improved growth across all advertiser regions in Q3, and even excluding China advertisers, revenue growth has accelerated nicely. And you kind of alluded to whether there's -- the sustainability of the China advertising revenue. And even though we've seen particularly strong growth this year, I would say that there has been a longer-term trend of overall growth with this segment dating back to past years and also periods of volatility in the past, like in the last two years, we've seen periods with higher shipping costs with lockdowns, with regulation weighing on demand. So we recognize there's the potential for volatility in the future as well and especially given that there are so many macro factors at play that are quite hard to predict.Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist.Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me. First, can you share any early read into demand for Quest 3  It's been out for 10 days, but I think you've been taking orders from these last three weeks  And is it priced to be at least gross profit breakeven or not necessarily  And then second, Susan, for 2024 as we think about growth, can you speak maybe about political spend contribution that you've had back in 2020 and how that may inform how we should think about its contribution for 2024  Thank you.Sure. So the first part of your question was early sort of signals with Quest 3. We are not sharing any explicit expectations for Quest 3, either Q4 Reality Labs revenue, unit sales, et cetera. But we are very excited to have Quest 3 in market, in particular, during the holiday shopping period. We think early reviews have been great. And we're very excited to have a product out there that are going to introduce a lot of people to mixed reality experiences for the first time. So it's very early. I think we don't have very many more specifics. But again, we're quite excited to have it in the market and to have it in particular during the holiday marketing season.Your second question was about political spend. And so this is a place where I would say we saw acceleration in positive year-over-year growth in all verticals this quarter really except politics, which is lapping the lead-up to the 2022 US midterms last year. So I will say though that this is also just a very small vertical for us so there s not too much more to add there.Dave, we have time for one last question.Certainly. Thank you. That will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.Great. Hey, Mark, just going back to the AI agent theme. I know it s early but how would you rank the overall strategy here around these AI agents and AI Studio compared to other big initiatives that Meta has made in FoA over the years  Is this bigger than or as big as the Stories transition or the Reels transition  And any thoughts just kind of high level on that  And then the cost of serving up responses, especially stickers and images is a little bit more expensive than your core business of aggregating the News Feed. So how much more expensive, I guess, is the question  And are there things you can do to bring that cost down  Thanks a lot.Yeah, sure. In terms of how big this is going to be, it s hard to predict because I don t think that anyone has built what we re building here. I mean, there s some analogy is like what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT, but that s pretty different from what we re trying to do. Maybe the Meta AI part of what we re doing overlaps with the type of work that they re doing, but the AI characters piece, there s a consumer part of that, there s a business part, there s a creators part. I m just not sure that anyone else is doing this. And when we re working on things like Stories and Reels, there were some market precedents before that. Here, there s technology which is extremely exciting. But I think part of what leading in an area and developing a new thing means is that you don t quite know how big it s going to be.But what I predict is that I do think that the fundamental technology around Generative AI is going to transform meaningfully how people use each of the different apps that we build. I think for the Feed apps, I think that over time, more of the content that people consume is going to be either generated or edited by AI. Some of it will be creators will now have all these tools to make content more easily and more fun. And I think over time, maybe we'll even get to the point where we can just generate content directly for people based on what they might be interested in. I think that, that could be really compelling.On the messaging side, I think that the way that we're looking at these AIs kind of ties into that directly where you'll be able to message with Meta AI or any of these different AIs for whether it's for fun, you have a question about something, you want to help doing something, you want to play a game or you want to message with a business for commerce or you want to engage with your favorite creator and they wouldn't normally otherwise have time to message you back, but now they have an AI representing them that can. I think that will accrue to kind of to messaging behavior.It's going to change advertising in a big way. It's going to make it so much easier to run ads. Businesses that basically before would have had to create their own creative or images now won't have to do that. They'll be able to test more versions of creative, whether it's images or eventually video or text. That's really exciting, especially when paired with the recommendation AI.On the hardware side, I mean, obviously, the smart glasses that we just rolled out, we sort of thought were a precursor to eventually getting to displays and holograms for augmented reality, and I think we will eventually get there still. It's not that far off. But I think that now the ability to deliver AI through smart glasses may end up being a killer use case for that even before you get to the kind of augmented reality type of use cases. So I think you're basically seeing that there are going to be -- this is a very broad and exciting technology. And frankly, I think that this is partially why working in the technology industry is so awesome, right, is that every once in a while, something comes along like this, that like changes everything and just makes everything a lot better and your ability to just be creative and kind of rethink the things that you're doing to be better for all the people you serve. I mean, I just think that's a lot of what is energizing and fun around building companies like this.But yes, it's hard sitting here now to be able to predict like the metrics are going to be around, like what's the balance of messaging between AIs and people or what the balance and Feeds between AI content and people content or anything like that. But I mean, I'm highly confident that this is going to be a thing and I think it's worth investing in. To the question about efficiency and costs, I think initially, it's most important to focus on getting to product market fit. And we obviously care a lot about efficiency, right  I mean, the CapEx costs for our company are very significant, and it's one of the main things that weighs on the economic model of the company. So on the one hand, as we can improve the efficiency, we're able to do things like train bigger models and serve more people, which currently, right now, we're going to be bottlenecked on based on the amount of infrastructure that we have as this gets to the scales that we aspire to get to.So in the near term, the efficiency wins will primarily just be to deliver better products to more people. But over time, we're going to continue working on that. And I think we've been able to do pretty good work on efficiency on our hardware and compute. And over the long term, once we kind of have more of an understanding about what these products want to be, then we'll be able to drive the economic model based on that. But we'll work on that all throughout, but I think we're still in the pretty early part of that curve.Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",5,2023-10-24T05:35:00.000-04:00
Billionaire Ray Dalio Says '50% Chance Of World War' - How To Invest?,"Billionaire Hedge Fund tycoon Ray Dalio - in a recent LinkedIn  titled  Another Step Toward International War  - offered some sobering takeaways from the escalating geopolitical conflicts involving Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine. Dalio underscored that these are notIn this article, we will look further at his reasoning behind this stark assertion, evaluate the potential damage that such a conflict would cause to the global economy, and share how weMr. Dalio's thesis draws on parallels between the current geopolitical climate and the periods preceding the two World Wars in the 20th century. He emphasizes that the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts have transitioned from pre-hot-war conflicts to uncontained hot wars, which will likely be brutal and protracted until one side decisively triumphs over the other. Furthermore, Dalio warns that these conflicts have the potential to spread and escalate, involving more countries and potentially leading to a world war if major powers like the US and China are drawn into direct conflict with each other.He believes that the conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, Ukraine, and Russia are - just like in the periods preceding the past two world wars - symptomatic of larger great power conflicts that will significantly impact countries allied with these nations. He suggests that the US is already indirectly engaged in these conflicts, fighting proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East while also preparing for potential conflict in East Asia. The spreading of these wars will not only be costly but will also risk drawing non-combatant nations into the fray, thereby expanding the scope and scale of the conflicts.In terms of solutions, Dalio's idealistic  pipe dream  would be for world leaders to recognize the catastrophic potential of hot wars and collaboratively establish pathways and processes to minimize the chances of such conflicts developing. Apart from that increasingly unlikely solution materializing, however, it appears to be only a matter of time before hot conflict between the world's major military and economic powers breaks out.For stock market investors, the implications of a global war would likely be devastating. The escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the potential for them to spiral into a larger, more widespread war could introduce significant volatility and risk into global markets.While the death and destruction that such a global conflict would cause are reason enough to shudder at the idea that they are growing increasingly likely, the economic fallout would be catastrophic as well given how interconnected the global economy has become. A war pitting China against the United States  and undoubtedly involving Taiwan as well  is anticipated to unleash severe repercussions on the global economy and some  put the damage at a 5  contraction of the  23 trillion US economy, marking the worst decline since the Great Depression. The stock markets in the U.S. and around the world would undoubtedly crash, likely surpassing even the 50  drop in the S P 500  and Nasdaq  witnessed during the 2007-2009 Great Financial Crisis and recession. If the market capitalization of the S P 500 were to be halved, it would wipe out around  18 trillion in wealth, which is equivalent to roughly two-thirds of the United States' current GDP. Some  even put a 10  GDP decline as probable in this scenario, which equates to a  2.5 trillion hit to annual economic output, triggering mass layoffs and plummeting consumption rates.Of course, a significant casualty in this conflict that would drive much of the global economic chaos in its wake would be the semiconductor industry given that Taiwan is a critical player in global semiconductor production . A major disruption of Taiwan's semiconductor exports to the world's major economies is estimated to potentially eliminate  1.6 trillion in corporate annual revenue. Moreover, the supply chain restructuring required in response to a potential conflict like this would easily surpass the adjustments witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Apple , Caterpillar , GM , Ford , Tesla , and Starbucks , among others, deriving substantial revenues from China.On the other hand, the economic effects would be even more severe for China and its companies like Alibaba  and Nio  due to disrupted trade which would dramatically reduce its exports, cut off access to advanced Western technology and investment capital, and potentially lead to a crisis level shortage of key commodities such as energy, copper, food, and iron ore, exacerbating internal political instability.Overall, the conflict would likely trigger a global depression owing to the intertwined nature of the US and Chinese economies with the rest of the world's economies. Companies, regardless of their national origin, would suffer from supply chain disruptions, impacting consumer and business investments globally.With such scary scenarios becoming increasingly likely, how are investors supposed to position themselves  It may be prudent for some to take advantage of elevated interest rates and hunker down completely in safe havens like investment grade bonds , treasuries , land , gold , and perhaps for the bold, even Bitcoin . Maybe even a small short position  on the S P 500 might make sense given how overvalued the market is right now according to .However, as an investor who is able to take on a bit more risk in pursuit of higher long-term total returns, yet still wants my portfolio to not suffer a complete wipeout in the event of World War 3 breaking out this decade, I am investing increasingly in the following types of securitiesBy investing in these assets today, I believe that I am positioning my portfolio to deliver attractive current income and risk-adjusted total returns regardless if World War 3 ends up materializing in the near future or not.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we ll conduct a question-and-answer session.  Operator InstructionsI would now like to turn the conference over to Adam Minick. Please go ahead.Good morning. I hope you're all doing well today. We will be discussing CME Group s third quarter 2023 financial results. I ll start with the safe harbor language then I ll turn it over to Terry.Statements made on this call and in the other reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. Detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in the filings with the SEC, whichWith that, I ll turn the call over to Terry.Thanks, Adam, and thank you all for joining us thisWe released our executive commentary earlier today, which provides details on the third quarter of 2023. I'll make a few brief comments on the quarter and current outlook, and Lynne will summarize our financial results. In addition to Lynne, we have other members of our management team present to answer questions after the prepared remarks.Turning to the most recent quarter, average daily volume of 22.3 million contracts was less than 1  off the record Q3 high set in Q3 2022 while our revenue grew 9  to  1.34 billion, which is the highest Q3 revenue in CME Group's history. As we've mentioned throughout this year, we are operating in an environment that unquestionably requires risk management. With so much uncertainty in the world we live in, we're continuing to work closely with our clients to help them navigate uncertainty and manage their risks.This is particularly true in the interest rate markets today. We see divergent market views around inflation, unemployment, monetary policy and ongoing geopolitical tensions, all impacting future interest rate expectations.Regardless of whether rates rise, fall or hold steady, the shape of the yield curve and interest rate views continue to shift, and our customers need to manage that risk. As a result, we have continued to see growth on top of the record year end 2022 for our interest rate business. This was our highest Q3 for our interest rates complex, up 6  from the same quarter last year.We saw particular strength in the treasury complex, which was up 16  in the quarter and is off to a strong start in Q4 as well. Completing the successful migration of Eurodollars to SOFR, we continue to list other products to complement our interest rate complex today.Our European short-term rate or ESTR contracts traded a record 10,000 contracts per day in September. Our newly listed treasury bill futures launched on October 2, and we have traded over 15,000 contracts in the first three weeks. This is one of the most successful launches of a raised product ever.Our broad product offering and focus on capital efficiencies such as the enhanced cost margining agreement with DTCC going live in January of 2024 continue to enhance the value proposition for our customers using our products to manage their interest rate exposure.On the commodity side, third quarter 2023 volume was up 15  in total and included the highest ever Q3 volume for our agricultural products. Our energy complex also performed well with volume increasing 16  from last year. We believe the current environment for this asset class will continue to bring new clients as well as existing ones to manage their exposure in our global benchmark.We believe the strong macroenvironment, combined with our diverse set of asset classes and strategic execution across our growth initiatives, positions us well for continued growth in 2023 and beyond.With that, I'll turn it over to Lynne to cover the third quarter financial results.Thanks, Terry.During the third quarter, CME generated  1.34 billion in revenue, up 9  compared with a strong third quarter of last year. Clearing and transaction fees and market data revenue each grew 9  versus Q3 2022. Expenses continue to be very carefully managed and on an adjusted basis, were  448 million for the quarter and  369 million excluding license fees, both lower than the second quarter this year.This quarter, our investment in the cloud migration was approximately  13 million. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter expanded to 66.5 , up approximately 240 basis points compared with the same period last year. CME Group had an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.8 , which resulted in net income of  818 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of  2.25, each up 14  from the third quarter last year.Of the  110 million increase in revenues versus last year, we were able to drive 90  to the bottom-line with adjusted net income up  99 million. As a result of the strong expense discipline throughout the firm, we are lowering our core expense guidance, excluding license fees to  1.475 billion, a  15 million decrease from our original guidance of  1.49 billion.We are maintaining our guidance of  60 million for our cloud migration expense for a total expense guidance of  1.535 billion excluding license fees. We continue to manage our capital expenditures effectively with an eye towards our move to the cloud. As a result, we are lowering our CapEx guidance to  85 million.For the quarter, our capital expenditures were approximately  18 million. CME paid out  2.8 billion of dividends so far this year and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately  2.5 billion.Our strong financial results this quarter continued to build on the strength achieved in the first half of the year. This quarter, we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our global benchmarks, data and strong focus on innovation and execution continue to address the needs of our clients and deliver results for our shareholders. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.We'd now like to open up the call for your questions.  Operator Instructions  Thank you.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Our first question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Thanks. Good morning. Terry, a question for you on M A. You've been vocal about your financial capacity to do additional transactions. I was hoping you could talk about kind of the scope and what you're looking at. And also, in the context of the current environment, why now  Have valuations come in  Are your competitors distracted with other deals or other tasks  So curious about the current backdrop of what you're thinking about and really the scope and what that may look likeYes. Thanks, Dan. I think that's the reason why people sometimes need to read the whole story and not just the headline because if you read the whole story, I haven't said anything different than what I've said for several years is, I was only stating facts to the point where our capacity is much greater than everybody else's because we've stayed very disciplined and very focused as it relates to our M A transactions that we've done.I was only referring to our EBITDA being lower than one times compared to some of our competitors who were at multiples of that. When asked the question, if deals are to be offered, I made the reference to the comment that where else would you want to shop something but the CME  It doesn't mean that CME is interested, but that's all I was referencing.So my appetite for this hasn't changed a bit. We have not looked at anything that I -- to a point where I said, okay, we want to do a deal. I was only referencing what I've been saying for a number of years. And unfortunately, the headlines say what they're going to say. So there's not much more I can say about it than that, Dan. But again, nothing has changed from our discipline.And again, if I -- we see something and I said this publicly and I believe this, if we see something that benefits our users and benefits our shareholders, we will take a very strong look at it to build and grow this great company. That's all I was saying.Great. Thank you.Thanks, Dan.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Terry, I was hoping you can maybe just give us your updated thoughts on the outlook for volumes heading into year-end, just given some of the evolving yield curve dynamics we've seen in this kind of heightened geopolitical uncertainty. And then coming into this year, you talked a lot about how great the setup was for CME's business. So maybe if you could just talk about how that maybe compares now to -- or how it's played out relative to your expectations, and how it maybe compares to the setup we're now looking at heading into 2024  Thanks.Yes. I think the good -- and thank you, Patrick. I appreciate it. I think it's really hard to predict the future, and I try to be careful. But the setups that we saw in 2022, which you're referring to and 2023 were something so glaring that you had to call it out because of the geopolitical events, what was going on with inflation where people were calling a transitory versus you sprinkle  3 trillion into the American public's hands, you know that it's not going to be transitory.So I was only sprinkling out the favorable events that we were seeing fundamentally that I thought was good for every single one of our asset classes. And it was actually very good for us. As you know, with a record year in 2022 and an amazing quarter this quarter in 2023 and as Lynne said, our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. So those are all very impressive numbers.We will -- I don't think the setup has changed, Patrick, when you look at what's going on right now that's going to be much different for 2024. I think we're going to see a little bit of the same, but who knows. It's hard to predict what the volumes would be associated with that, but there is a massive amount of uncertainty out there.When we made comments like we did in 2022 and 2023, we also didn't have the unfortunate situation we're seeing in the Middle East today. So there's another added component going on to that. And then we also have other situations, as I said earlier as it relates to our energy complex, where people are looking for more production coming out of the U.S., and Derek can touch more about that throughout the Q A. But again, I think that bodes well for CME's products. But I'll -- beyond that, I'll be careful what I say.All right. Great color. Thank you.Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just quickly on the regulatory side, seems like the SEC is getting closer to mandating treasury clearing on the cash side. Obviously, you have your arrangement with DTCC now in place starting in January. So a good position there, I guess. But like more broadly, just wondering how you think treasury clearing would change the marketplace, both on the cash side and maybe even on the futures side, customer behavior, new customers  Anything -- I assume you have some thoughts on it. So anything would be helpful how market structure may change if that happens.Yes. No, thank you very much. And it's a great question because it's a great unknown too, what's going on out there. And what is being proposed and what may happen is still being hammered out. I'm going to ask Suzanne Sprague, who is the President of My Clearing House, to give you some comments on the reg side of it.She's working closely with her team as they're watching this. And then I'm going to turn it over to Tim McCourt from an opportunity perspective, what he's seeing as it relates to the complex if, in fact, some of these things happen or even if they don't. So maybe we'll give you a little two-part answer here, Alex, if you don't mind.Yes. Thanks, Terry. We do think generally the benefits of central clearing will bring the marketplace into a strong position for things like our cross margining program with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. So you are correct to put those dots together that it will potentially enable higher participation in that program. We do today have the program that's eligible for common clearing members.And so the enhancements will benefit those common clearing members within the program and therefore, increased activity through clearing of treasuries generally should translate to more eligible activity that could benefit from cross margining between CME and the Fixed Income Corporation.So we generally believe the benefits of central clearings plus those enhancements to the cross margin program will position us and the industry well for taking advantage of more capital efficiencies in this space. I'll turn it over to Tim McCourt to add anything else as well.Sure. And thanks, Alex, for the question. I think when we think about the opportunity why we remain excited and very optimistic that the cross margin agreement is finally coming online in January of next year is because this is something that we've seen before in our other markets. When you unlock the capital efficiencies of related products, it significantly increases the risk management capabilities of the marketplace and can lead to increased trading velocity in the product.While as Terry said, it's hard to predict the future. If we look at some of the other areas we've unlocked capital historically, portfolio margining of futures versus swaps is probably a pretty good analog to look at, and that's been in place since 2012. And since that's been put in place, the average daily savings have grown from 1 billion in 2013 to a little over 7.5 billion today in 2023.And at that same time, our rates volume grew 109 , and open interest doubled in the complex. And our cash market participation went from about 54  over 100 . So certainly unlocking capital is beneficial to the volume and the velocity of the complex, and we're optimistic about what we can do once this comes online early next year.Hopefully, that gives you a little color to your question, Alex.Very good. Thank you guys.I appreciate it.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So it's somehow related to the last question, but I think you talked about government budget deficit in the past leading to more treasury issuance, which could increase like more hedging activities. Could you please unpack a little bit more on that relationship  Are you saying when we see more treasury issuance that should like kind of induce higher trading activity  I think any more color would be helpful. Thanks.Yes. Owen, it's Terry Duffy here. And one of the things that we have said historically and if you recall some of the comments that our former colleague, Mr. Sean Tully made over the years that when the Fed no longer is acquiring some of these treasuries that the demand for them will have to go somewhere else. The Fed does not hedge their treasury portfolio, as you know.The other people that acquire the issuances coming out from the government need to hedge those. So it's hard to predict what the issuance is going to be. But again, those -- the parties that will be taking the issuance if it's not the Fed are traditionally people that hedge those in our marketplace. So that should benefit CME. So Tim, maybe you want to add anything more to thatYes. Sure. Thanks, Owen. When we look at the net issuance of treasury securities, they increased significantly in Q3 compared to Q2, up almost 80 . And that's not surprising if you remember, this is really looking at the replenishment of the Treasury General Account, which means a record low of just under  50 billion prior to the debt ceiling.And at the end of September, that balance stood about  672 billion. Now it's important to Terry's point to look at where that debt is being issued. And comments made previously, a lot of the issuance is going into T-bills on the short end of the curve. That's what we saw in Q1, Q2, and that pattern has not changed here in Q3.So with respect to how that can impact our complex in treasuries, one would assume that if we look back over historical distributions of how the treasury has looked to issue debt, there's only so much that can go into the front end of the curve. It was perhaps a little bit below the historical norms the last several years where the treasury has taken advantage of the lower rates further out the curve. So one can reasonably conclude going forward, they would look further out the curve to be more in line with their traditional or historical allocation where that's where our complex at CME has all the historical products.As Terry noted, the growing treasury complex from both a volume and an OI perspective, we would expect that issuance further out the curve in the coupons and bonds to increase the velocity as the marketplace looks to digest that issuance, hedge the related trading activity of it. And with the introduction of our T-bills earlier this year that's off to a great start, we now also have tradable products across the entirety of the curve and even better suited for that risk management needs of the marketplace as they find ways to absorb this increasing debt being issued to the market.Got it. Thank you very much.Thanks, Owen.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. I have a couple of questions. I'll get back in the queue for the second one. The first question I have is on just on the -- I guess there's some talk of more regulatory or potentially more regulatory scrutiny around basis trading within futures and treasuries. And just wanted to get your perspective on how you view any potential scrutiny there or the merits of that trade, and I don't know if you're able to potentially size the impact on volumes. I know it can be -- can change quite dramatically over cycles. So maybe it's tough to do, but just wanted to get a sense.Yes. And Brian, it's Terry. I'm going to turn it over to Tim, but sometimes there's problems looking for solutions as they say or solutions looking for problems. And this is government at its finest trying to introduce new legislation where there is no problem with the basis trade is something that will continue to move as well as it should, and the basis trade is actually what keeps the markets in line.So we feel very strongly that this is going to continue to keep the market efficient. And the more you explain that to regulators to show them what kind of potential chaos you could introduce if, in fact, you have additional regulation that takes people out of that trade which widens the basis, they may not like that outcome. So let me turn it over to Tim to give you a little bit more color. But I would be cautious to draw the conclusion that any kind of pending regulation is coming down the pike in the time zone. TimThat's correct. I think the one thing I would add is that the existence of basis between cash and futures market is not an isolated phenom to the treasury market. We see this in almost all of our asset classes here at CME. And the fact that you can independently trade the basis as a standalone risk parameter is an important key element to keep these markets aligned and arbitrage-free. It's something that we've seen is vital to the marketplace for this purpose. And it's something that we also see remaining in this market.It's not surprising with rates traversing the range that they have that you're going to see different behavior of the basis that we have in previous decades when we've seen similar activity. And it's something that we engage with the market.And the one thing I would note is that it's also important that CME also has the ability to trade cash treasuries on BrokerTec and the futures, which is also both leading price discovery mechanism. So we are the natural home for this trade to take place, and we continue to work with the marketplace.Now we can increase the efficiency of this trade going forward and work even more closely with market participants to make sure we unlock the value that still exists between bringing the BrokerTec and our futures business together at CME.Thank you, Brian.Thanks, Tim. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Thanks. Maybe just a question on expenses. Good to see the lower expense guide today, but given the slightly higher kind of inflationary environment and still relatively tight labor market, just wondering if you could remind us how you think about steady-state organic expense growth on a medium-term basis for this business within the current macro backdrop  And then second part of that question, as we're approaching the end of the year here, can you also just remind us how the Google-related expenses are expected to unfold into 2024 versus 2023 level  So I think there was spend for the first four years, but just maybe give us an update on where you stand with that spend today and when that starts to wind down.Thank you, Kyle. Lynne, do you want to address both of those issuesYes, sure. So overall expense guidance, if you look at our estimate for this year, that's up about 3.6  on our core expenses despite the inflationary environment. So I think what we've seen from us over the years is really tight expense discipline and expense control. We're always looking for ways to minimize the -- run the business expense to become more efficient so that we can have more of our expense base going through to growth initiatives and helping to grow the bottom-line.So I think we have a strong track record there. If you look back in history, it averaged between that 3  to 3.5  over the last several years. Certainly, as we look forward, we'll continue that same type of discipline, and we'll look to provide guidance as we get closer to year-end.On the Google front, we did guide that we would have four years of incremental cash costs in the range of  30 million per year on average. So our expense guidance for this year, this is our second year, is  60 million in expense, offset by  20 million in CapEx savings to get to a net  40 million. We had  30 million in net expenses last year. So we have two more years where we think there will be an incremental expense associated with the Google migration before we see -- start to see breakeven and ultimately cash flow positive.Great. Thank you very much.Thanks, Kyle.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Terry, in your comments, you talked about the kind of uncertain rate environment and ongoing need for participants to manage risk. Earlier in the year, you talked about the opportunity with regional banks. But maybe just at a high level, how do you see that opportunity more broadly  Is it kind of new participants that haven't been on CME's platform before  Is it more involved hedging from existing participants  How do you see kind of like the medium term TAM coming from that environmental need that you see  Thanks.Yes. I think it's hard for us to describe if it's the regional banks or the bigger banks hedging. I mean, Suzanne can help me with more color on that as who the exact participants are because they come in to one of the bigger banks anyway, even the smaller ones do. So we're not quite sure which one is laying off the risk.Yes. I would agree with that. It's generally appealing, I would say, for both of those groups of folks to engage with us on an ongoing basis, especially now with the uncertainty in the rate environment to think through the offerings that we have from a capital efficiency standpoint as well as a general risk management standpoint for ensuring that there aren't additional micro or macro events that will, I guess, circulate in the industrySVB is one example of a lot of engagement that we've had leading up to and afterwards with clients about the way that we provide services and clearing solutions to allow people to manage risk as well as the product side.So, I think it is hard to specifically identify what portion of those participants might be new and existing, but we have been engaging pretty broadly in the marketplace around those events to make sure that the products and services as well as the way that the clearinghouse offers risk management services are accounted for and available for market participants more broadly to get ahead of any other events that might be circulating in the industry.And just to add to that, Ben -- thank you, Suzanne, that's a great answer. But just to add to that, Ben, the duration risk that we saw take down SVB has not gone away. As we talked about earlier in our comments, the issuance that is coming out from the government seems quite large in order to run and pay our bills in this government, and the demand has been a little bit lighter. So in return, whether we like it or not, rates are continuing to be very stubborn regardless of what the Fed does or does not do.So I think that we're not suggesting there will be more duration risk. But what I am suggesting is that people are going to have to manage that. And so whether it's the biggest of banks or the mid-tier banks, the risk management associated with duration, not only is it not going away, in my opinion is increasing because of the fundamentals of the overall treasury market in general. So from our standpoint, we think that will lead to more people mitigating and managing risk through our treasury complex from all different sizes of the banking world. That useful BenNo. That was great. Thank you so much.Okay. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could provide color on the average collateral balances for cash, non-cash in the quarter and then with respect to the yields and then where they stand at presentLynneSure, Chris. Happy to. So if you look at quarter three, the average cash balances were  91 billion. The yield on that averaged 36 basis points. For non-cash, we averaged  137 billion, yielding 7 basis points. If you look at October to-date, the cash balance has trended down. We're seeing average cash balances of  71 billion and a shift into the non-cash collateral, which is up to  152 billion.I would point out that on the non-cash collateral side, we did announce a fee change that takes effect in January where the charge on the non-cash collateral will be increasing from a blended 7 basis points up to 10 basis points. Just to give that a little sizing, if you apply that change to this quarter's average volume, that would have added  10 million to the revenue associated with the non-cash collateral, which rolls through other revenue.Great. Thanks. Get back in queue.Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. As you go into year end, maybe could you talk about how you're thinking about price increases in data and trading for 2024, particularly in the context of the fairly sizable changes you made in 2023Okay. Ken, thank you. I'm going to ask Lynne to start and then Julie Winkler, who heads up our data organization as our Chief Commercial Officer, will participate as well. So LynneYes. So as you know, on the clearing and transaction fee side, we typically announce any changes there later in the year. It's typically around the late November timeframe. Our approach is the same as it's always been. It will be a bottoms-up approach, looking at all the different markets, looking at health of the market, the value we've created, the health of our customers and the total cost of trade, including not only clearing and transaction fees, market data fees, but also the cost of collateral and making sure that we don't do anything from a fee perspective that would impact volume or liquidity, given our high incremental margin.So as I mentioned, we have increased that non-cash collateral fee effective in January that runs through other revenue. And Julie has announced some market data fee changes, which take effect in January as well. Julie, do you want to walk through thoseYes. I mean, Q3 was another record quarter of  167 million in data revenue, so up another 9  year-on-year. And I think the strong growth also is something that as we look into 2024, yes, there will be some fee adjustments, but we also are looking for continued new product development, active sales efforts, continued education and also our enforcement efforts. So it should be noted even in this quarter, we saw about  4.9 million in non-recurring revenue that was reflective of both those prior period activities from subscriber adjustments as well as that audit revenue that we sometimes talk about.And so similarly with the transactions business that Lynne just referenced, we're continually evaluating the pricing of these data offerings. We have a very large and diverse set of offerings. So it's difficult to really specify a specific increase to forecast for 2024. Many of our data products, however, will see price increases next year ranging from 3  to 5  kind of reflecting that price-to-value approach. However, again, this is dependent on both subscribers as well as that non-recurring revenue that occurs in most quarters. So I hope that's helpful.That was great. Thank you very much.Thanks, Ken.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you can opine on some of the potential new competitive dynamics and developments and interest rate futures markets with FMX Futures potentially entering the space and partnering with LCH. Now we've seen this movie before, right, multiple times, and all these kind of attempts have been unsuccessful. So wonder whether or not this might feel different given LCH position as the largest pool of clearing in the swaps market. Maybe just a reminder of sort of the benefits that customers get by keeping everything in futures and the savings across the portfolio they can get versus the alternative of trying to kind of cross margin between futures and swaps  Thanks.Thanks, Alex. And I'm going to ask Tim and maybe so many of my other colleagues around the table to comment as well. But when we're looking at the FMX proposal, it's -- we haven't seen all their details. And I think it's really hard to comment on exactly what the competitive offering is going to be other than what you just referenced.I understand what you said. I think with the announcement of DTCC and the offsets that we are going to be able to supply to the users is going to be an extremely powerful benefit to the participants of the marketplace. And you also have to remember that FMX is coming from a position of zero futures trading today. And where we are sitting on, as Tim has referenced, record open interest in treasury complex listing new products and listing the benefits thereof.We are ready and able to compete with anybody. And competition is something that has made CME what it is today. But the benefits that we continue to work on, you've heard me say this for years that we are going to continue to look for capital efficiencies in each and every one of our asset classes. We are delivering on every one of those asset classes to deliver capital efficiencies.That does not go lost on the participants in a capital-intensive world. So when you're talking about new offerings with LSE and what they could potentially offer versus what we have, we think we have a massive compelling offering for our clients that saves them additional funds.So I like our position, and I think we are in a position of strength. Again, I think a lot of people, Alex, as you know very well, when the LIBOR was going away and everybody was going to convert from Eurodollars us to SOFR that people thought it was a jump ball. And we felt we were in a very strong position to transition 100  of that business into CME SOFR products, which we did because of efficiencies to everything we have to offer. And those go from the back office to my sales team right across the entire organization that creates those benefits. So I like our position.Again, I think you said it at the beginning of your question. We've seen this movie before. I don't want to quote you wrong, but I think that's what you said. And we will continue to take every party that wants to compete with us very seriously. But at the same breath, we think we have a very strong, powerful, compelling offering for our clients. Tim, do you want to add to thatSure. Thanks, Terry, and thanks, Alex. I think just to add a little more color on that picture is when we look at the gravity of the complex at CME, Terry's point is unmatched. And the one thing I want to further remind the marketplace about is you can unlock a tremendous amount of capital savings and efficiencies at CME today, and the marketplace is doing it. In addition to the  7.5 billion-plus margin savings from our portfolio marketing portfolio, let's look at some of the numbers with respect to the open interest.With record average daily open interest in our treasury complex of just under 19 million contracts for the third quarter, a record average daily open interest in our SOFR complex of about 11 million contracts and with a record large open interest holder population of 3,175 participants, that is an enormous amount of gravity that although LCH may be the leader with respect to their interest rate swap clearing offering, I like the gravity and the size of the complex that's going to be unmatched about the capital efficiency can tap into with CME, the sheer function of our position on the future side, which we expect to only be more and more important to the marketplace as we head into 2024.Hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we're thinking about it, Alex. But again, we take everything seriously and -- but I think, again, our offering, as Tim has said and I said, is very compelling.Yes. Very helpful, guys. Thank you.Thanks, Alex.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Great. Thank you. Good morning. Two-part question. Just following up on the capital efficiencies beyond the cross margining with DTCC. Just curious what other steps you might be able to take as you look out the next three years to further enhance that. And then the other part of the question is just around the regulators proposing new capital rules for banks that can make some bespoke off-exchange derivatives just more capital-intensive. Just curious of your take on that, where you see the biggest opportunity to bring derivatives from OTC to the exchange-traded marketplace.Michael, both really good questions. The latter one is we've dealt with in 2017. I'm assuming you're referring to the Basel III what's being proposed on the second part of your question.Yes.Okay. So on the first part, on the capital efficiencies, I'm going to turn it over again to Suzanne Sprague, and she can touch on both, but I'll give you my thought process on the Basel III as well.Yes. Thanks, Terry. So we do look forward to extending the enhanced cross margin program to the client level. We have had quite a bit of conversations with ourselves and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation as well as clients on the importance of continuing to broaden that program.So we don't have any timelines to commit to at this point in time, but it is a focus of ours jointly to be able to expand those enhancements to the end client level, which I think will help even more with things we've already covered on the treasury mandate and needing more capital efficiencies to address things like increased capital costs under the Basel proposal. I think, Terry, I'll hit at a high level the Basel proposal.Yes, let me just comment on the practicality, Michael, and I know that you've been there for a little while now at your firm and understand how this works. There is zero consensus amongst the regulators as it relates to some of these proposals in Basel III. Actually, there's really opposing views to that, which makes it very difficult to move something forward we have internally at a regulator not the same people supporting the proposal. The markets need to remain efficient.And I guess, again, another solution looking for a problem with Basel III, we have never had an issue under the margin that we're holding that needs to have a capital hit associated with it. We only think that would add to the lack of liquidity to the overall marketplace and make markets less efficient than they are today. And that's not healthy, especially as we laid out the fundamental places that we are in the world today and with the issuance coming forward.We need to manage this. There's risk in everything we do in this life, including the treasury issuance and who's using it or not. We think we have a very good platform, and we think that the rules that are in place right now makes sense for the users. And if you want to just continue to add capital charges to everything we do. I guess we can constrict it to zero, and we won't have any more risk in the system, but we won't have any economies around the world either. So I do think it gets to a certain point.Again, like I said earlier, this was proposed in 2017, and it was not agreed upon then, and so we'll see where this goes. We are meeting with people in Washington now. My Washington folks are trying to explain the detriment to such a proposal could bring to the overall marketplace.Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.Thanks, Mike.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning, everyone. So in the quarter, there was another instance of vertical integration between an exchange or actually secondly, a DCM and an FCM. So now, we have Coinbase MIAX with vertically integrated business model. So first, I want to get your perspective on what this means for the ecosystem. And then -- and also, CME already registered its FCM last year, I think partly in reaction to FTX's move. So what are your updated objectives for that business nowSo Craig, again, I've been also talking a lot about market structure and how market structures always have a shelf life, and we don't know what the next one is going to look like, but we all need to be prepared for, and that's what CME will always do. We'll be prepared for anything that comes our way. That's one of the reasons we filed for the FCM application, not just because of FTX. But not to say you're wrong because that was part of the reasons why, but it was again around market structure.I think with these vertically integrated models that is being proposed such as MIAX and I think Coinbase is the other one you referenced, the conflict of interest question for the clients is huge. And it would be big for us, too, if we decided to go ahead and deploy an FCM.So we would have to be very careful about that ourselves. But the same breath, I think that if they're going to go down this integrated model, they need to write rules associated with. This was my entire complaint around FTX that they were trying to make existing rules fit for their business proposal.So if, in fact, we're going to have integrated models of what MIAX is proposing today and go into business in the United States, you need to write rules with them because the Commodity Exchange Act clearly states in the year 2000 that those rules were written with intermediaries in mind, not on a direct model. So no saying you couldn't have intermediaries in the direct model, but the rules are not clear on that.So I think there's a long way to go. I think one of the reasons they're not getting much attention today on that is because of their size, which I think is wrong to look at it that way. It shouldn't matter their size. Who's to say they can't get bigger tomorrow, who's to say we can't do something different tomorrow as well.So I think there needs to always be rules and the rules of the road need to be applied so people understand that we do not need situations like 2008 and other ones that we could all describe because of people trying to advance businesses that they think is in their best interest without having the public's interest at heart.So again, we've always been a neutral facilitator of risk management. We will continue to do so. We like the intermediary model and again, but we don't know what the future is going to hold. But I do -- I am very concerned about some of these existing platforms. And the government needs to look at them and write rules for them if, in fact, they're going to allow them to stay in business.Thank you, Terry.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Bond with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thanks. Hi. Good morning One for Derek on the energy business. So energy markets, particularly natural gas markets, have experienced some structural shifts benefiting North American markets following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. More recently with the geopolitical events in the Middle East, are you seeing more of a continuation of these dynamics  And can you talk about the potential longer term impact of the geopolitical events of late on your marketsAndrew, thank you. We appreciate it. And DerekYes. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, I think this is kind of proof positive of what we've been talking about for the last couple of years that structurally, the U.S. is an incredibly strong position, given the position we have, both in crude oil as well as natural gas. As you know, we're currently exporting record amounts of oil from the U.S. at 4.6 million barrels a day.We're also exporting record levels of natural gas while based on Henry Hub pricing record levels from our U.S. capacity point of view. So as we've talked about, that structurally positions CME's WTI franchise as kind of the leader in that space and certainly positions WTI as a global benchmark as the U.S. continues to export the marginal barrel outside the U.S. with challenges everywhere else.Natural gas, as you pointed out, has been a really, really strong point for the energy franchise overall. When you look at what's going on from an uncertainty point of view, options continue to be a significant proportion of our customers' client behavior. So we like our position in both natural gas and crude oil, when you look at the volume and growth of the both futures and options, strong in Q3.More importantly, we continue to see that strength in October with our energy options up 81  overall, energy up 26  in October. So really strong year this year, continuing really strong year into Q4. And the position that we have as the swing producer, both in natural gas and crude oil, I think, positions us well long term in what we think is a potentially multigenerational energy shift.Thank you.Thanks, Andrew.Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Yes. Hello, again. Just a quick one on the interest rate business again. You guys, Terry mentioned the LIBOR, SOFR transition. Obviously, that's now behind us and successful. But just maybe looking back on that, I think early on, there were some concerns that SOFR would not be the best replacement for Eurodollar and that maybe it won't meet certain trading strategies. So now that we're sitting here, I don't know, six months after the real cutoff, is the marketplace different at all  Are you seeing certain strategies not being applied anymore  And is that still room for innovation for you or SOFR, Eurodollar basically now the same thing as it always was  Thank you.So I'm going to let Tim answer as well, Alex. But I will say the following that the reason why people believe that SOFR might not be as good as your Eurodollar is because of pure uncertainty. When you know a certain way for so many decades of how you're going to price short-term interest rates and all of a sudden, the governments say you have to change them, it's the uncertainty of the marketplace for starters.As far as it goes to the strategies, I think Tim already outlined the open interest in trade and SOFR. So you would have to say the answer to question number two, are people not doing certain strategies is no. So question number three is are -- is there opportunity for people, I think was the last thing you had asked for the SOFR versus what was not in the LIBOR, and I'll turn that to Tim.Yes. Thanks, Terry, and thanks, Alex, for the question. I think what's interesting is when we see several months after the transition, we look at the SOFR complex at CME year-to-date through Q3, I believe we're already about 14  above the best year in Eurodollar previously. And we still have a whole quarter to go, which is exciting. So certainly adopted, certainly being integrated. We're seeing similar strategies with respect to the various option strategies, the futures, the outrights, the spread. So we're really pleased with how the ecosystem is coming along.But the one thing I would add is we also have new additional short-term interest rate products that can be spread against SOFR. When we look at the introductions of T-bills, and as Terry said in his opening comments with respect to us leading and taking really strong roots in the ESTR market overseas, these are all new things that are additive to the ecosystem that didn't exist when Eurodollars are around.So very optimistic for the future and further buttressed by our efforts on the CME term SOFR front with respect to licensing and the IP and the gravity that we're lending to that complex. These are all great things that continue to position not only SOFR, but the rest of our rates complex, given the interrelatedness and the spread strategies that exist as we head into next year.Excellent. Good to hear. Thanks.Thanks, Alex.Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. It's on RPC. Just some of the drivers in the third quarter that you mentioned were member mix and product mix. I think that was mostly on the product mix side between asset classes. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about were there any outliers within the asset classes that significantly impacted the RPC  And then it looks like geography-wise or non-U.S. was actually up a little bit sequentially, and I thought that was -- usually it's typically the higher RPC. So maybe just some comments on that. And then also just on options versus futures if you can remind us on the differentials there. I think, Derek, you mentioned the options volumes in energy, in particular, were up nicely in OctoberYes, Brian, two parts to your question. So I'm going to ask Lynne to comment on the RPC and then ask Derek to comment on the international business, which you're correct, does carry a higher RPC than the traditional -- some of the stuff here in the U.S., but go ahead, Lynne.Yes. So if you look at the overall RPC of  0.707 versus the prior quarter of  0.724, so down  0.017. The drivers for that were really lower proportion coming from commodities products was about 18  this quarter, down from about 19.5  last quarter. We did also see a slight increase in member mix and the contribution from micros overall.In terms of the specific asset classes, I wouldn't call anything out as unusual per se. I would just point you to if you look at the year-over-year basis, on very similar volume, we saw a 12  uplift on RPC. That's driven by a couple of things. You do have a lower proportion coming from micro. You have an increase in the commodities as we've seen that rebound in this year, and you are seeing the impact of that pricing change rolling through.Thanks, Lynne. Derek, do you want to talk a little bit about the non-U.S. business as it relates to the RPCYes. Thanks, Brian. We've seen some continued really strong growth and building on the back of what was a record 2022 for non-U.S. business. We're building on that. Again, our Q3 international volume was up 7  this year, and that was led by some of the higher RPC products. Our ag non-U.S. business is up 32 , energy up 30 , rates were up 16 , metals up 10 .Also, what you saw and I think you might have mentioned this, our non-U.S. options continues to grow extremely strongly as well. So our non-U.S. options volumes up 31  and while the overall options is up 21 . So a good strong story within a good strong story. So we saw EMEA be a particular standout there relative to the volumes.And I think we're -- the efforts we put in the place, boots on the ground, you heard us talk about the investment we're making in the majority of our sales force now being outside the U.S. is accelerating both our new clients acquisition opportunities as well as reinforcing and cross-selling into our existing customer base. So our non-U.S. business continues to be a source of strength and new client growth for us. And I think we'll see that we're on track for another record year for that side of the business across asset classes, and we like our position going into 2024.So just to sum that up Brian, because I think, it's a really important question. Not a particular asset class where there's degradation in the RPC so much. It was more the mix of member versus non. And then we have some of these really outlier, not outliers, but some higher rate RPCs and some of the energies as Lynne referenced. And it's a very sensitive tool. So that can move it a little bit, and that's what you saw.That's great. And then just can you remind us on the RPC of options versus futures in generalYes.Yes. So the total RPC for options this quarter were  0.658.Got it. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much for that really complete answer. Thank you.Thanks, Brian.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thank you for taking my follow-up question. I think CME recently launched the WTI Crude Oil Monday and Wednesday Weekly options. I'm just wondering how much incremental opportunity and demand for these kind of 0DTE products, not just in energy but in the whole CME platform  Thank you.Thanks, Owen. DerekYes. So on the weekly stuff, yes, we have had really great success across the entire franchise of launching additional points on the maturity curve. We've recently launched Mondays and Wednesdays in energy, particularly in WTI. We've actually set a number of records there. We had an old day record ADV about 43,000 contracts on the first of September. And that was after the addition of the Mondays and Wednesdays, we set a single day record on the same day of about 15,000 contracts.When you look at that opportunity for us, we've talked about this before, certainly in a world with as much risk as we see on any given day on any particular asset class, adding additional maturity points and a granular levels of risk management have proven to be successful. We sort of -- we plumbed that path with equities. We've incrementally rolled out asset classes. And I think over time, we found our customers have adopted those more broadly. Those are additive to the OI pool.Those have created more opportunities for spreading across maturities, but I would also note that our record options growth is accelerating, not just on the front end of the curve but across the entire maturity curve. So we're seeing growth there where the short-dated pieces are additive to the growth, but it's actually being led by farther out across the curve. So we see those as additional tools and nice additive pieces of growth, but not the primary source of growth.Got it. Thank you very much.Thanks, Owen. Thank you, Derek.Thank you. The next question is a last question from -- a follow-up from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Hi. This is Eli from Craig's team. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if...Can you speak up just a little bit, Eli  I think it was Eli, not Craig on the phone.Yes. This is Eli from Craig's team. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the potential impact of approval of the spot crypto ETFs on your crypto complex. What proportion of volumes in the -- futures-based ETF managers contribute to that complex today  And if we see like a migration from the future-based vehicles to spot, would that threaten the viability of that complexYes. Good question, Eli. Thank you. TimThanks, Eli. Thanks, Terry. Certainly, a pressing question, given the recent moves that we've seen in Bitcoin. I think one thing to note is that before we dive into the nuances of the ETF, we've also seen tremendous volume in OI growth here in the third quarter for our crypto complex. Just this week, we saw over 130,000 contracts trade, worth about  7.6 billion. That's our largest day in the crypto complex since the wake of the FTX collapse in a little over a year ago. So when we saw also a record OI in our Bitcoin futures over 20,000 contracts, which is equivalent to more than 100,000 Bitcoin.And this really speaks to the fact that we are an institutional-grade offering for the crypto community. So it is not surprising that we're the underlying for a lot of the futures-based ETFs, which has done phenomenally well in terms of serving the marketplace to date. Certainly, there's a belief that some of the uploading of price to almost 35,000, 36,000 we've seen this week is on the belief of spot-based ETF approvals.I'm not necessarily here to comment on whether that's going to happen. But what I can tell you is that we do see the introduction of additional structured products, whether it be spot or other underlying base in the crypto community will be additive to our complex at CME on two fronts.One, these markets are highly interrelated, where futures will not only be the underlying for some of these products, they will also be the hedge mechanism for market makers as well as market participants looking to hedge their digital or ETF-based holdings. And the second thing to always keep in mind is we also have the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate, which is the underlying for a lot of these ETFs coming to market.So not only will be additive to our futures-based volume as we've seen in other asset classes such as equity, it's also to keep in mind as these products take root and grow in the market, there will be additional revenue generation opportunities from the licensing front as a function of AUM and derived license fees here at CME as the IP owner of the underlying index.Got it. Thanks guys.Thanks, Eli.Thank you. And there are no further questions. I'll turn it back over to management for closing remarks.I want to thank you all very much. Excellent questions today. We appreciate it very much and we wish you a good day, and everybody stay safe. Thank you.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day.",188,2023-10-16T08:00:53.000-04:00
Euronav's Solid Financials Coupled With Upside Potential Market Outlook Lead To A Bright Future,"Figure 1   EURN s leverage conditionFigure 2   EURN s liquidity conditionThe short to medium-term outlook for the tanker market is positive. Albeit OPEC  countries decided to expand their crude oil production cut by 2024 due to higher exports from the U.S., Guyana, Brazil, and Norway, the crude ton-mile is still high and is Figure 3   EURN s price return vs. S P 500The first and foremost risk related to the tanker market outlook, and thus Euronav s future outlook, is associated with how fast the global economic lackluster will be over. In other words, the central banks' policies regarding higher interest rates to combat high inflations due to the COVID-19 pandemic have brought fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The continuous of these fluctuations may adversely affect the company s financial strength. Moreover, apart from having a volatile and cyclical market, a significant portion of Euronav s revenue is derived from a limited number of customers. For instance, about 8  of their revenue was directly from their business with Valero Energy Corporation  in 2022. As a result, the loss of any of these main customers may adversely impact their revenue and cash flow. In addition, 56 vessels of Euronav are directly employed in the spot market, and 8 of their vessels are employed in long-term charters, with the average remaining of approximately four years. Therefore, the company is highly affected by the charter rates in the crude tanker sector, and when their existing charters expire, they need to enter into the spot charters in the future, while the spot charter market may fluctuate severely based on the tanker and oil supply and demand.Notwithstanding paramount risks related to Euronav s business and industry performance, the company s financials are solid, and the tanker market seems bright by the end of 2023 and 2024, which may help the company boost its liquidity condition. The company provided 100  of the payout ratio in the second quarter. This decision shows the company s strong liquidity and robust current market condition and is based on its current loan-to-value ratio of 30 . When all is said and done, I believe a buy rating is appropriate for Euronav shares.I appreciate your time and welcome your opinions.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Geopolitics And The Indifference Of Markets,"The financial world is full of timeless bits of advice veterans of the system give to those just coming on board. One such hoary old saw is to pay no attention to geopolitics.While wars, terroristThat s the advice, and there is some pretty solid historical data to support it. Consider this past week. Last Saturday, Israelis woke to the deadliest terrorist attack in their country s history, with a known death toll now exceeding 1,300.The brutal terrorist attack by Hamas, and Israel s subsequent declaration of war on the group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will likely reverberate throughout the Middle East for a longIt will be yet another major foreign policy headache for a world already dealing with the war in Ukraine, the ever-present threat of crisis in Taiwan, and unsteady domestic politics in much of the developed Western world.Yet, financial markets have barely registered any reaction at all to the events of October 7. US stock and bond markets have remained focused on their usual themes this week, with interest rates and Fedspeak at their customary top of the list.Bond yields fell significantly after some seemingly dovish comments by a few Fed officials suggested that the recent rise of intermediate and long-duration yields might be doing the Fed s work for them and thus reduce the urgency for another rate hike when the FOMC meets at the beginning of next month.A mostly in-line but slightly hotter than expected inflation report on Thursday took some of the enthusiasm out of that dovish narrative.The stock market this Friday is mixed, with optimism concentrated in the banking sector, where the first batch of third quarter earnings reports from heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase , Citi  and Wells Fargo  have received a warm welcome.Even oil markets, which could be expected to be much more reactive to events in the Middle East, have not gone crazy.Why are markets so blasé about geopolitics  There are two main reasons, one of which is perfectly rational and the other of which is potentially past its expiration date.First, the rational explanation. It is very hard to translate a geopolitical crisis into a set of known or highly probabilistic outcomes to which a tangible value can be attached.If we consider those three major flashpoints in today s world   Ukraine Russia, China Taiwan and Israel Hamas   there is much more fog than clarity about  A  how the conflicts might be resolved and  B  what the downstream knock-on effects of any such resolution might be.This is a vastly different problem from, say, mapping out valuation scenarios for growth equities in the technology sector following a one-percent change in interest rates.  When in doubt, leave it out  is another one of those old chestnuts shared around securities firm trading floors.The second reason for the market s usual indifference to world events stems from a longstanding, and by now in our opinion outdated, assumption that the background scenery of the global political order doesn t change at anything more than a glacial pace.This assumption is rooted in the so-called  Washington Consensus  that gained popularity back in the 1990s   the belief that free movement of capital, light-touch regulation, free trade and globalization-friendly political systems under the benevolent leadership of the United States was and would continue to be the way of the world. That assumption is no longer relevant, but it is entirely unclear what is going to replace it.Wall Streeters often talk of a  wall of worry  when listing things that, while individually perhaps not packing much of a punch, pose a threat to asset price trends when added together.We would add geopolitical uncertainty to whatever else is piling up on investors  wall of worry, and are not inclined to dismiss it as irrelevant.We remain comfortable with where our portfolio positioning is today, but at the same time we are prepared to expect more, rather than fewer, surprises in the year ahead. The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",7,2023-09-14T10:22:11.000-04:00
My Wall Street View: The Rubber Band Is Stretched,"Through September the economy remains solid, but there are formidable headwinds in the months ahead. Currently with the funds rate at 5.5  and the core CPI at 4.1  the real funds rate is 1.4 . ThatThe Fed can resume its fine-tuning operation later if the need arises, but the general feeling is the Fed does not have far to go. I'll agree that the bulk of the Fed's work is done, BUT I don't believe we can say there is clear sailing ahead onWhile a last-minute deal helped the US government avert a shutdown, the bad news is the threat of another shutdown has not fully receded. The first-ever removal of the Speaker of the House recently has thrown more uncertainty into the mix-raising the odds of a government shutdown in mid-November. While this situation won't affect the MACRO view it adds to the uncertainty of many issues that will.The political dysfunction is coming at a time when debt dynamics, fiscal spending, and an overwhelming amount of Treasury supply are creating worries for investors, rating agencies, and voters. Now to be fair, the government's deteriorating fiscal outlook should place some upward pressure on bond yields-the market's way of sending a message to Washington that they need to get their house in order. And, the longer the Fed keeps rates elevated to offset the government's out-of-control spending, the worse the situation will get.In an era of low inflation and zero low interest rates, Congress was able to spend freely with limited consequences. No so today with inflation still hanging on and with the 10-year Treasury yield now hovering around 4.9 . With debt servicing rising at an alarming rate, Congress is either going to have to change its spending habits or the US is going to experience more economic pain down the road. fiscal austerity would become a near-term headwind for growth which could ultimately place some downward pressure on interest rates. However, that assumes Inflation is down to or very close to the 2  target, so this growth inflation interest rate issue isn't going to be so easy to solve. However, as I will explain later, an era of fiscal responsibility can NEVER be achieved with the policies and agenda in place today. Now we are faced with other outside forces that are certain to stretch the US fiscal scene to levels never experienced before.The auto workers union is making  in my opinion  some outrageous demands. They are asking for a 40  increase in wages over 4 years, a 20  reduction in the workweek from 40.0 to 32.0 hours, and a guarantee of some job security during the transition to the production of all-electric vehicles. The fact that the administration tossed its full support behind the union and its demands, poisoned any good-faith negotiations between the UAW and the automobile manufacturers because union workers will now believe that their proposals might be attainable.At the moment anything less than their demands might be deemed unacceptable to rank-and-file union members. The auto manufacturers will probably feel that they are no longer bargaining in good faith because one side has the support of the President. Against this background, it is inconceivable to me that the strike can be settled quickly. As it progresses, the inventory of unsold vehicles will dwindle while sales and revenues slip. The negative impact on the economy will soon be apparent.While investors seem to be pricing a  soft landing,  history is not on their side. The Fed has raised rates at the fastest pace in modern history, and the market is still trying to absorb the impact. This likely will create higher dispersion between companies and asset classes alike, with the volatility offering investors the potential to find companies that are positioned well but negatively impacted by near-term macro events. As rates have spiked, so too have long-term yields.Yield spreads also bear monitoring. The spread, or difference, between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, has been negative all year, i.e., an inverted yield curve, but has narrowed from a record -110 basis-point inversion in March to only 30 basis points today-not positive, but it's progress. Dating back to 1990, when an inverted yield curve has gone positive it can spell trouble for equities. It is not until the curve goes positive by about 125 basis points, do equities form a bottom and a rally ensues. I suspect we are a very long way from a yield curve that will be that positive.The past two weeks investors were reminded that they are operating in a world full of turmoil. We spoke about the terrorist attack in Israel last week, and as I'll speak to later markets tend to eventually calm and overlook these situations. The MACRO scene, however, has been impacted, especially  No doubt the  to Israel in what is their  911  event. Add that to the ongoing Ukraine situation and the spending debt debacle in our economy, the  rubber band  gets stretched once again. The U.S. has pledged to Ukraine and now the administration plans to ask Congress for an  Israel that they will  get what they need  to defend themselves., but I am citing the facts and reality of the situation. These events along with the continuing overhang of the China Taiwan situation come at a time when the U.S. finds itself in the weakest fiscal situation since WWII. In the meantime, taxpayers continue to hear the same rhetoric regarding  spending , as Treasury Secretary Yellen announced . Perhaps that might be true if they were the only issues that require boatloads of money to process. However, they are not.There is a contingent, in which Ms. Yellen is a firm supporter, that wishes to spend trillions on  climate issues  and an  energy transition . While the economy is doing well, welfare spending is near or at all-time highs. In fiscal year , the federal  spent  1.19 trillion on more than 80 different  programs. That represents almost 20  of total federal spending and a quarter of tax revenues in 2022. That is for WELFARE in a supposedly economy that is  humming along  The pandemic is over but the country's food stamp program reached an all-time high in November 2022 and remains at that level.Then there are the 6-7 million immigrants that have arrived, and they also come with a huge cost to social services, welfare, etc. Finally, the cherry on top of this debt cake. The cost of  the  existing debt   not future debt  will be about the same as the existing Social Security program. In effect, we are soon going to be spending on TWO Social Security programs.Therefore it is a HUGE  stretch  to assume the U.S. can afford the two wars and will ever be able to enter a period of fiscal responsibility that is so desperately needed.It doesn't take a Wharton School graduate to realize that  other  spending must be curtailed. I realize I keep repeating that, but it is the lynchpin in this MACRO scene that will have the most impact. At some point, this notion that the climate is the BIGGEST threat to our economy has to be scrapped. If it isn't then you can kiss global economic growth goodbye. Given all of the other existential threats that are REAL, some will slowly come to realize what the common sense crowd has said from day ONE.  The climate ISN'T the biggest threat to our economy . The only question that remains is - is it already too lateBetween the  issues  at home and with events and threats presenting themselves on multiple fronts abroad, the geopolitical situation is as fragile as it has been in decades. For the U.S., the latter is a self-inflicted policy error that leaves the  That in turn will negatively impact the financial markets for what could turn out to be a period The 3Q23 earnings season ramped up this week with 11  of the S P 500 market cap reporting results, traders entered the scene with a wait-and-see approach. Financials started the EPS parade and investors liked what they saw and pushed all of the indices to gains of 1  respectively on Monday.Tuesday rolled around and a  HOT retail sales number tossed cold water on the enthusiasm as Treasury yields spiked to 52-week highs. The resiliency of this market came to light as the indices staged a complete reversal to wipe out the early-day losses to close flat for the day. The Russell 2000 bucked the selling trend all day and posted a 1  rally.Selling pressure was stepped up again on Wednesday in what turned out to be a complete wipeout with every index posting a 1  loss with the Russell giving back all of the previous day's gain, then adding another 1  to make it a 2  loss for the day. Thursday was a replay with across-the-board losses in every index and sector finishing in the red.A negative week ended on a negative note when the S P posted its fourth consecutive day of losses. For the week, the index dropped 2.4  and that could be considered a fairly mild drawdown considering the negative backdrop. Since the July highs, this S P pullback has now reached 7.9 .Every major index closed in the red for the week. The NASDAQ was down for the second week in a row and the Russell 2000 small caps made it three straight weeks of losses.The  fell 0.7  to 104.6 in September.  and follows the 0.5  slide to 105.3 in August. T That's the worst since the 24 straight months of contraction from April 2006 through March 2009. The components were mixed with six making negative contributions. Three components made positive contributions.Consumers showed their steadfast resilience and kept spending in September despite grappling with higher prices, interest rates, and a host of other headwinds piling up., more than twice what economists had expected, and close to a revised 0.8  bump in August. Retail sales in August were inflated after gasoline prices spiked, however. That was not the case in September when gas prices began to ease.A closely watched category of retail sales that excludes auto dealers, gas stations, and building materials and feeds into the gross domestic product jumped 0.6  last month compared to the prior month.September's uptick in retail sales, the sixth consecutive monthly gain, reflects how the U.S. economy has remained resilient despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to cool spending and hiring.In the good news is bad news backdrop, this number was considered a negative as it potentially keeps the Fed engaged in the rising rate scene.The  to -9.0 in October from -13.5, versus a 16-month high of 12.0 in August which was the only positive reading over the last year.

The indication that the FOMC could be sidelined by the rise in longer-term interest rates that are doing some of the Fed's heavy lifting was taken by the markets as a dovish stance and yields and the US Dollar tumbled, while Wall Street rallied.However, the markets shuddered at Powel's view that the economy's resilience could be because rates have not been high enough for long enough, suggesting a restrictive stance for a lot longer until the economy slows sufficiently to bring inflation to 2 .That is a message I sent a couple of months ago when we started to see the forecasts for a solid GDP forecast for Q3.--  - It's HIGHER for longer and investors better start believing that the longer part is going to be VERY long. Yet I hear analysts continue to forecast rate cuts next year. The dilemma the equity market is facing is twofold. Higher for Longer is scary and IF rates are indeed cut - then that means the economy is falling off a cliff. That is also frightening for equities.House Speaker Vote. It now appears there is no obvious path to 217 votes for Jordan, leaving some Republicans to wonder if they could elect current temporary Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry  R-NC . It's unclear if he can garner 217 votes either.The continuing resolution keeping the government open expires on 11 17, and besides the geo-political turmoil around the world that needs to be addressed, the longer the House goes without reaching an agreement on who to elect as speaker, the more likely it is that we reach that mid-November deadline without a budget agreement.Then there is the administration's emergency request to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine and Israel. With the slim Republican majority, they would need 98  of their contingent to back ONE candidate, and as we have seen that is an impossible task. An easy solution would be for the President to solve the issue by persuading a literal  handful  of Democrats to get behind a candidate  ALL have unanimously voted against any Republican nominee  and remove this obstacle.As far as the shutdown, as stated in earlier updates, it's a non-event for the markets. If the aid packages are deemed that important then the roadblock can be easily eliminated to approve the spending. With complete dysfunction in Washington, we're all suffering the consequences of politicians.After three years of overlapping crises, it is natural to wonder whether the surprise attack on Israel and its subsequent declaration of war poses another threat to the global economy and supply chains around the world. While these concerns are valid, I do not think the tensions in the Middle East will lead to any  Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Because of this, it is unlikely that the Israeli-Hamas war will disrupt supply chains or drag down economic confidence in the same way the Russia-Ukraine war or the pandemic did over the last few years. A major impact on supply chains could occur if there was an escalation in the war throughout the region.Fortunately, I think we have to view that as a LOW probability of occurrence. The only way the oil supply could be disrupted is if Iran were to enter the war. Iran has long been a financial backer of terrorist groups like Hamas, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that is very different from engaging in a direct military confrontation with Israel. As the leadership in Tehran knows very well, Israel is a nuclear-armed country and has the strongest air force in the Middle East. It would be downright suicidal for Iran to get involved. However, for a variety of other reasons, I do believe that the added uncertainty will hold oil prices near the  85- 90 barrel range. that are taking place in the Israeli conflict, but the war has not altered my asset class views or outlook for the US economy or earnings growth. First, from an economic perspective, Israel is a small country, with a GDP of  521 billion-making it the 29th largest country in the world, representing only 0.5  of world GDP. To put this into perspective, when measured by GDP, Israel would rank as the 13th largest state in the US  roughly the size of Virginia  and when compared to companies in the S P 500, Israel is roughly the same size as the 15th largest company  Eli Lilly .Additionally, Israel is not a significant trade partner of the US, making up only 0.7  of both US imports and exports  the 25th and 29th largest trade partner respectively . And because of this, Israel is not big enough to derail the US economy from its current path. From an earnings perspective, given that I don't expect a significant economic impact from the war, combined with the fact that the S P 500 receives only 0.2  and 2.8  of revenues from Israel and the Middle East region respectively, the conflict will not have a meaningful impact on earnings.Finally, it is worth noting that previous events in the region have not had a significant market impact. Unfortunately, conflict in this region is nothing new. Bespoke Investment Group notes that in the previous 11 major conflicts, the S P 500 was up  15  on average in the 12 months following the onset of the conflict and was positive 75  of the time.While this terrorist act may not change my economic views, it does highlight what is yet another global policy error that can have major MACRO consequences in the future.Iran did some saber-rattling this week by  The fact that Iran is in a position to make any 'calls' in this war is preposterous. The lack of global leadership in dealing with Iran is why there is a second global war being waged today. Shockingly the US continues to be the leading player in shirking responsibility by sending billions to what the  as a state sponsor of terror.If this terrorist attack isn't a wake-up call to impose economic sanctions that will  the Iranian economy once and for all then we can expect more of the same in the future. The FACTS, not opinion, rhetoric, or  spin , but FACTS, tell us the existing sanctions on Iran are NOT being enforced. Iranian oil exports have tripled in the last 2  years. Instead of crippling their economy, the country's coffers have been enriched in the last 2 years.If common sense doesn't prevail, this war is just the beginning of global turmoil. The U.S. received yet another reminder that 'policy' errors have consequences when a  headed for Israel. After missing the opportunity to buy oil at a cheaper price, the U.S. finally decided to begin   Strategic Petroleum Reserve . Energy Secretary Granholm has stated it may take up to two years to bring the reserve back up to prior levels. Combine this with U.S. Domestic issues that I'll present next, and it's easy to see why the price of crude oil will stay elevated and perhaps ratchet higher.There is  reason to abandon the energy trade.Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods announced that he struck a  59.5 billion deal to buy oil and gas explorer This deal can be read as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and a side-step against the US anti-fossil fuels policies. The acquisition comes at a time when the present hostile regulatory environment makes it more difficult to explore and develop new resources.This deal accomplishes quite a lot for Exxon  as the company becomes the biggest player in the rich  that spans Texas and New Mexico. In addition, the rising rate environment is making it more expensive to drill, and that should encourage more M  A activity.Being a low-cost producer with an enviable list of land assets, Pioneer Natural Resources is a  prize . Exxon will now have the luxury of bypassing the arduous and at times impossible task of acquiring new leases and permits. That means the newly combined entity will drill longer, more productive horizontal wells without wasting more time and money. Exxon has already stated that it can drill longer  laterals  Which means fewer wells which reduces the environmental impact.A the end of the day Exxon expects to double its current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. In a stroke of genius, Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale, while defraying costs, and in effect has outgamed the system that is at war with fossil fuels. In essence, this buyout of Pioneer makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.U.S. oil output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. However, that is about to end, as the number of those wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian in the last 2 years. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition.The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029-the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. That action sends large oil companies to move their operations The world will need fossil fuels for many decades, and at some point, the energy transition fraught with all of its issues will be   The costs associated with the transition run into the trillions and the money that has already been buried in this project has not produced anywhere near the solution that is required to run a productive economy.Finally, U.S. workers and the U.S. economy would be better off if production happened at home rather than overseas. The U.S. energy policy that I have warned about for the past two years is starting to show that 'policies' have consequences.The indices are all at a point where they could still go either way. Given all of the  outside  influences, the best scenario might be more sideways action. Plenty of starts and stops, with uncertainty sure seems like it will be part of the scene for a while. Perhaps for the entire 4th quarter. That tells me to stay diversified and look for  special situations .It's easy to see why I use technical analysis as part of my strategy. The S P 500 rallied to a resistance trend line and was turned away. The battle will now be waged at what is considered to be an important support area for the index.The ball is in the BULL's court and it will soon be time for them to step up and defend their position. A 'break' of support opens up a completely different set of circumstances on the technical front.Once sentiment sours, NOTHING is going to change that downward price action. Plenty is going on now that keeps the  and why the volatility is ramped up. Headlines out of Israel, Drone attacks in Iraq, Navy warship intercepts Iranian missiles  U.S. policy errors have consequences , D.C. dysfunction, and higher Treasury yields are all impacting short-term sentiment.I've come to find that in most cases market  reactions  were consistent with what the  charts  are implying. Simply because they are giving us the pulse of all of the emotions that are present. Any investor that isn't using the  technical aspects  of the investment landscape as part of their strategy is coming to the gunfight with a knife.

Is Opera A Wise Choice Amid Increasing World Geopolitical Uncertainty?,"Opera Limited  is a world-renowned technology company headquartered in Oslo, playing a key role in the modern world, providing services and products to hundreds of millions of users. The company's product portfolio consists of several browsersSince 1996, when Opera released its first browser, it has remained one of the key players in the global internet browser market. Its current browser products include Opera Mini, Opera Crypto Browser, Opera Browser, and Opera GX. Opera GX was launched in the second quarter of 2019 with many varied features tailored to the gaming community, which continues to grow significantly yearly. In the second quarter, the browser had  23.7 million monthly active users, an increase of 39.4  year-over-year.Moreover, , the company reported that Opera GX had more than 25 million monthly active users, increasing the likelihood that the Opera Gaming division's product will become a commercial success despite increased competition in the market.A few days after this press release, the company conducted a secondary public offering of 6.88 million American depositary shares at . Mr. Market reacted unfavorably to this event, which ultimately caused its share price to fall by more than 24  in less than a month.Despite the company's revenue growth from quarter to quarter, the  with a total share of 6.02  have long been such relatively small financial organizations as Greenhouse Funds, Marshall Wace, G2 Investment Partners Management, Arrowstreet Capital, and Millennium Management.On the other hand,  demonstrated mixed results, as Opera Limited's revenue exceeded analysts' expectations, but at the same time, it has been showing a decline in EPS for several quarters, thereby reducing interest from institutional investors. Additionally, Opera had approximately 316 million monthly active users, down 3.4  year-over-year., Opera Limited will publish its financial report for the third quarter of 2023. , Opera Limited's third-quarter 2023 revenue is expected to be  98 million to  101.39 million, up 16.8  year-over-year and 8.8  below analyst expectations for the prior quarter.At the same time, under our model, the company's total revenue will be within this range, amounting to  100.4 million. The key factors that will contribute to Opera Limited's revenue growth year-on-year and quarterly will be the growth in the number of users of the content platform called Opera News, the continued positive dynamics of advertising revenue, and the increase in the number of browser users in Western markets.We forecast that Opera Limited's operating income margin will continue to decline in the coming quarters, including due to the need to increase the amount of content, and will reach 12.5  for 2023. Meanwhile, in 2024, this financial indicator will increase to 14.2  due to a growth in the company's revenue, an increase in the number of Opera GX users, and our anticipation of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the second half of 2024. This event is essential for financial markets and will help accelerate the pace of the global economic recovery., Opera Limited's third-quarter EPS is expected to be  0.15- 0.2, which is 5.9  higher than the consensus estimate for Q2 2023. At the same time, according to our model, Opera Limited's EPS will be slightly higher and amount to  0.2.Furthermore, the company's Non-GAAP P E  TTM  is 16.22x, 10.32  lower than the sector average. On the contrary, Opera Limited's Non-GAAP P E  FWD  is 14.92x, which is 45.66  higher than the average over the past five years. As a result, this is one of the factors indicating its significant underestimation by Mr. Market during the period of stabilization of hydrocarbon prices, which also gives confidence that the Fed will be able to curb inflation in the future.Unlike many companies in the technology sector, Opera Limited's debt has remained extremely low in recent years, leaving its financial position less vulnerable in the event of another  hike in 2024.At the end of the second quarter of 2023, Opera Limited's total debt was about  8.1 million, down 40  from 2021. On the other hand, despite the low growth rate of the company's EBITDA from year to year, the total debt EBITDA ratio decreased from 1.96x to 0.13x.Opera Limited is a world-renowned technology company headquartered in Oslo, playing a key role in the modern world, providing services and products to hundreds of millions of users.Despite a decline in the company's gross margin and an increase in the number of its total shares outstanding, its share price has risen by more than 2  over the past six months.On the other hand, in the second quarter's quarterly report, despite the world's continued geopolitical tensions, Opera Limited raised its  for 2023 from  380-390 million to  373-390 million.At the same time, we believe that while there is a high probability of another rate increase by the Fed in the coming months, investors will not have a significant interest in investing in growth stocks, which include Opera Limited.We initiate our coverage of Opera Limited with a  hold  rating for the next 12 months.

Navigator Holdings: Celebrating Its First Dividend Payment,"Navigator Gas  is a small shipping company that is finally realizing the potential of its highly flexible handy-size vessels and ethylene export terminal. The company has been hitting several high notes recently with the announcement of aThe foundation for this small shipping company is centered in the flexibility of its assets, and the never-ending need for energy products which continue to be in high demand in markets such as Europe and Asia. The unique ability of its vessels to load multiple forms of cargo ensures its vessel remain in high demand and achieve high charter rates.To celebrate NVGS's newfound status as a cash-producing investment, I will evaluate how NVGS is deploying its excess cash flow toNavigator Gas is a growing shipping company that is expanding its fleet of handy-sized vessels while also expanding its land-based ethylene export terminal capabilities. The current fleet stands at a total of 56 vessels with a complementary export terminal with the capacity to export one million tons of ethylene per year.Handy-sized vessels are the Swiss army knife of the shipping industry being relatively small in size compared to VLGC vessels  Very Large Gas Carrier  but excelling in versatility. These vessels have the ability to carry a multitude of different product types. The most advanced handy-size vessels in NVGS's fleet can transport eight different product types that include ammonia, propane, ethylene, and propylene.These energy products are used in the agricultural, petrochemical, electrical power, and residential heating industries, and thus help support the building blocks of modern society. NVGS participates in the trade of these energy sources that is made possible through the large margin differential between the United States and the rest of the world.In the past, Navigator has been adamant that it would not pay dividends at the expense of its growth goals. At that time, it was financing multiple new vessels and an ethylene export terminal. Now, as we are approaching the completion of that growth phase, and previous projects are mature enough to be contributing to the company's bottom line, the management team has revisited this idea.A variable dividend program has been established that meshes well with the somewhat volatile shipping industry. The company has provided guidance going forward for what investors should expect and how it relates to company earnings. The program includes both a fixed and variable return program that targets a 25  return of net income to shareholders that will be allocated between dividends and share buybacks.Following Q2 earnings, NVGS reported EPS of  0.36 per share. The company has allocated  0.05 per share as the fixed dividend and elected to allocate the remainder  3 million  of the shareholder return package in the form of share repurchases. The  6.7 million scheduled to be returned during Q3 equates to an annualized return of  26.8 million or a combined 2.7 . While this is nothing to write home about, it is an important first step to take as a cash-generating asset.I expect the company to focus the variable component of the return package toward share buybacks. The company currently views its stock as being a significant discount to book value and therefore is a compelling return on investment for shareholders. The chart below compares the book value and market cap of NVGS and other energy shippers such as FLEX LNG  and Dorian LPG . You can see that NVGS does in fact trade at a discount while its peers tend to trade at a premium to their book value. The current book value is 11.6  higher than its market value.NVGS has three pillars of growth that will enable it to grow both its assets and the cash flow potential for shareholders.1. NVGS employs highly flexible vessels to optimize vessel utilization and fleet economics.2. Its ethylene export terminal located in Morgan's Point is being expanded to capture the growing demand for ethylene. The expansion of this terminal not only builds cash flows but builds demand for its shipping fleet, providing an uplift to charter rates.3. A focus on debt reduction is built into the company's cost structure, which will pave the way for higher free cash flow in the future.The flexibility of NVGS's fleet allows it to optimize trade routes by discharging a product and then subsequently loading a separate product for delivery to another location. This allows for triangular trade routes to efficiently transport energy products. This stands in contrast to that of VLGCs that often travel home empty-handed following a delivery voyage.The versatility of the company's target vessel type is shown below.The efficiencies created by this flexibility are also shown below where three different vessels are handling three different products. It is easy to see how this can translate into high utilization factors and superior economics for its handy-size fleet. As a result, the fleet has averaged a utilization factor of .Being able to support multiple products ensures that Navigator is not exposed to extreme sensitivity to any one commodity. For example, if a market disruption occurs in petrochemicals, those ships can be redeployed to transport ammonia or LPG. Navigator looks to continue to build on this strength by .Navigator's fleet is also diversified in its contract mix. The fleet is currently deployed either under long-term fix rate time charters or periodic spot charters. The fleet is currently deployed roughly 50 50 between fixed time charter contracts and the spot market. This allows for steady earnings while also allowing the company to capture premium rates in the spot market for petrochemicals and LPG.Navigator has not been quiet about its desire to continue to build a value chain for the molecules it transports. NVGS currently owns 50  of the ethylene export marine terminal at Morgan's Point, Texas. This terminal was placed into service in 2020 and is in such demand that it is .To capitalize on this demand, Navigator is currently in the process of expanding the capacity of this terminal. Final capacity is planned to increase by 50  at a minimum, with the maximum final rating at three times the original design  one million tons per year . This project is expected to cost  125 million. If the final capacity approaches the three-million-ton mark, this would be an extremely efficient use of capital as the original terminal .This terminal provides another form of reliable revenue and profitability. Being an infrastructure asset, this terminal generates revenue through processing fees, and as such, has been a consistent performer. This terminal has provided over  5 million in net income in six of the last seven quarters. Tripling the size of the terminal would obviously be a sizeable enhancement to NVGS's earnings potential. This project is slated to go into service in the second half of 2024.One possible negative for Navigator is that at times, the company has had elevated debt levels. Significant portions of this debt were taken on to finance growth projects such as building of new vessels and construction of the ethylene export terminal. Now that all of these assets are in service and generating revenue, it is time to turn the page and start reducing some of the long-term debt. The company has made some good headway but still has significant work ahead of it to do.One positive I can give NVGS is that it has a solid plan in place to improve its financial footing. With  290 million in maturities due in 2025, an actionable plan needs to be in place. The company has mapped out estimated quarterly payments to pay down these debt facilities prior to their maturities as is shown below. More importantly, the company has budgeted these payments in their cash-breakeven estimate for the fleet. This breakeven value of  19,470 day includes  5,500 day of revenue diverted toward debt retirement.Providing additional margin that this plan will be successful is the current rising trend of handy-size charter rates. Q2 continued to build on this momentum with rates reaching  27,241 day. In addition to the  140 million of cash on hand, this leaves significant discretionary cash for deployment to fund debt reductions, growth projects  ethylene terminal expansion , and paying shareholders.As shown above, a significant portion of the cash breakeven is associated to either retiring debt, or paying interest to service that debt. In fact, these expenses account for almost 45  of its cash breakeven. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that if the company is capable of conquering this hurdle, significant earnings potential can be unlocked.Over the next 3.5 years, the company projects to have over  400 million in debt repaid. Not only will this account for nearly two-thirds of the company's current debt profile, but also significantly lower the company's breakeven point. A new breakeven baseline could be as low as  12,000 day barring any changes to operating expenses or potential dry docks.Using the amortization plan for 2023, potential quarterly savings could exceed  35 million. After accounting for changes in taxable income, this would translate into an EPS boost of  0.30 to  0.35 per share. This also does not include any additional earnings associated with the ethylene terminal expansion or any increase in charter rates that may arise from that project.With a variable dividend program, there's no telling how the company will allocate the shareholder returns but I believe there is compelling evidence to see expansion in both the dividend and share buybacks. This transition will be long term, but patient investors will be rewarded with both rising dividends and share appreciation.The shipping industry has its fair share of volatility. The two main inputs to this volatility are demand for the shipped product and supply of the number of capable vessels for that product. In the 2017-2018 timeframe a significant number of newbuilds were brought into the marketplace. This dramatically increased the supply of transportation and charter rates dropped significantly. As it stands today, only three vessels are on order in the handy class segment and therefore should not meaningfully impact rates. This could however change in the future.Geopolitical events also can be a dramatic risk to energy supplies. NVGS has benefited significantly from the global trade disruption that occurred due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Europe has been forced to find alternative sources to meet the needs of its economy, this therefore has stimulated demand for ammonia and LPGs sourced from the United States.This increase in shipping demand has created an increase in shipping rates as shown above. Should this dynamic reverse, it could materially impact the demand for U.S. sourced energy products and in turn, reduce charter rates.Navigator has finally turned the corner from growth to cash generation. The next phase of its development still centers around improvements in its balance sheets and continuing to expand its terminal assets. Increasing its presence in terminal operations will provide increased earnings predictability.Significant value can be unlocked by redeeming debt while also dramatically reducing the company's breakeven value for its shipping business. As its earning potential increases, shareholder returns will elevate as less funds are required to fund and retire outstanding debt.Navigator Gas presents an interesting long-term dividend and total return growth investment option thanks to the initiation of the new dividend program. The company is valued at a discount to the book value of its assets and therefore also presents potential for share appreciation over the long term. I view NVGS as a buy under  14.00 per share for a dividend growth portfolio.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Geopolitical Shocks And Portfolio Construction,"After Hamas launched horrifying surprise attacks inside Israel s borders last weekend, theThis has been a week of escalating tragedy on one of the world s oldest and most violent political and geopolitical fault lines. It is the biggest military, intelligence and political shock for Israel in decades, and it comes on top of deepening internal divisions.Today, we consider how investors and asset allocators should think about and respond to events like these.Given the horror of the attacks, the intensity of the response, the rolling newsfeed and the history of the region, the muted impact onThe Arab-Israeli  Yom Kippur  War of 1973 has obvious and disturbing similarities to last week s events. Back then, initial stock market losses were recovered within a week, but the fallout, including an oil embargo and numerous policy mistakes worldwide, helped trigger stagflation and a multiyear bear market.Investors appear to recognize that broader Arab-Israeli relations are very different now than they were in 1973, that the world is much less reliant on the region s fossil fuels, and that Israel, while a much bigger and more advanced economy than it was 50 years ago, is still not large enough to roil global markets.The caveat to this view was ably provided by Admiral James Stavridis, NATO s 16th Supreme Allied Commander, the 15th Commander of the U.S. European Command and a member of the boards of the Neuberger Berman funds, in Admiral Stavridis thinks this conflict is likely to remain a one- or two-front war between Israel, Hamas and possibly Hezbollah. He noted that both Hamas and an  emboldened  Iran want to derail the potential rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but anticipates a tactical pause rather than a break in those talks. And he assigns a low probability to conflict between Israel and Iran, which would likely follow any proof of a  direct, causative, gave-the-order link  between Tehran and the Hamas attacks.But he added a stark warning   As an investor, that is the indicator to watch.Should Israel feel compelled to confront Iran,  the U.S. will be engaged,  Russia will  lean, in this instance, toward Iran,  and China, which has recently been trying to build a presence in the region, could find itself torn awkwardly between alliances.This is the key point for investors, in our view. The risk is that Arab-Israeli distrust of Iran may become a more prominent front in tensions among the U.S., China and Russia the global players involved in existing geopolitical standoffs and the increasing segmentation of the global trade ecosystem. Like one in a line of dominoes, it has the potential to feed upon and add momentum to existing negative economic and geopolitical trends.We ve been writing about the current environment as .In our view, an extended period of globalization, political and geopolitical consensus, and low inflation is giving way to an age of deglobalization, populist agitation, global tension and higher inflation. We ve described the , starting with the Global Financial Crisis, followed by the 2016 Brexit and U.S. Presidential votes, COVID-19 and the invasion of Ukraine.We believe those trends are heightening the role of governments in the economy and making economic actors prioritize security over efficiency and prosperity. Companies are shortening, localizing and simplifying their supply chains where possible.That is likely to sustain a higher baseline for inflation and make business cycles and markets more volatile, all other things being equal. We saw further evidence of this with Thursday s U.S. inflation data, which showed prices still rising twice as fast as the pre-pandemic average not to mention twice as fast as the central bank s target.From this  dominoes  perspective, the events in Gaza sit alongside other recent headlines, such as the success of the populist Alternative für Deutschland  AfD  party in last week s German state elections, the unseating of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives the week before, and signs of cracks in some Central and Eastern European states in their solidarity with Ukraine.The results of Poland s critical parliamentary election will be coming in as this post appears, and next year s packed election calendar is likely to provide many more examples of rising populism, domestic political division and geopolitical flashpoints, starting with Taiwan in January and ending with the U.S. and possibly the U.K. Next year also has elections in Russia, India, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea and for the European Parliament.What are the implications for asset allocationAsking how to position a portfolio in response to these events is the wrong question, in our view. Instead, we believe investors should step back and ask how to position for the deeper trends of inflation and increased global segmentation.Those trends have helped push bond yields up at these levels, bonds can once again act as portfolio diversifiers in growth shocks but they remain vulnerable to inflation shocks. In our view that makes for some exposure to real assets and commodities important in the new environment, alongside bonds.Genuinely uncorrelated markets and strategies can also help to absorb some of the volatility that arises when bonds and riskier assets trade in lockstep a more common tendency when inflation is structurally higher. In addition, a  may enable you to position for the short-term market moves that often accompany headline events, without allowing them to whipsaw your long-term strategic portfolio.Finally, it is important not to overcompensate.As already suggested, that goes for the individual events  Let s reiterate Admiral Stavridis  view that serious escalation of the current conflict is unlikely, and that recent Arab-Israeli accords are encouraging and unlikely to be derailed.But it also goes for the apparently deeper trends.Yes, the trend toward a more fragmented, fragile and inflationary world is strong. A strategic asset allocation should acknowledge these important structural headwinds. But, as we wrote in our  a few weeks ago, it would be unwise to implement an unbalanced bet against the power of human ingenuity and innovation to offset some of the forces of structural inflation and indeed, to create a better long-term environment for economic growth and for peace.

4 Reasons I'm Shorting The VIX Despite Geopolitical Risks,"The unexpected attack on Israel reminds us thatBut as investors, we must look at the implications for markets, and despite the shock, I think Israel's military dominance is ultimately unshaken by these attacks. The blow was psychological and tactical, not strategic. Israel is a mighty country, and I think her military prowess gives potential regional state adversaries pause, which limits the potential for a regional conflagration. Of course, the last two significant eventsWe should all be praying for the victims and their families, and we should all be asking ourselves stark questions about the future of the Middle East. Still, we should also remember that financial volatility, while redolent of physical volatility, is not the same thing. We must remember that the market's collective wisdom shrugs off our individual emotional experiences.The Hamas attack was deadly, and it will have profound implications. However, it does not look like the type of state-versus-state implications on trade from the Yom Kippur War in 1973 will materialize. Furthermore, the history of fighting in the Arab-Israeli conflict has typically been marked by short duration rather than the type of resource-intensive stalemate that is going on in Ukraine.However, war and the deterioration of foreign relations raise prices  there's often no way around it. So, if this issue expands and intensifies, it certainly could raise inflationary pressure, so I will keep a close eye on this risk as the events' momentum becomes more apparent in the coming days and weeks. I'm assuming that despite the shock factor of the Hamas attack, the effect on markets will be broadly similar to other high-intensity periods in the Arab-Israeli Conflict during the 21st century.While the relatively low-intensity conflict between Arabs and Palestinians slowly rumbles through time, it doesn't have the same profound economic effects as when a conflict interrupts food production in one of the world's largest grain producers. So, I think as devastating and sickening as these attacks were, the ultimate effect on global commerce will be much less than Russia's Invasion of Ukraine.Indeed, the market has sent two overwhelmingly bullish messages in less than a week.Anecdotally, when markets rally on bad news, I'm typically heartily encouraged. I have found this indicative of turning points in the post-COVID markets. These two events alone make me very bullish on the disposition of the market into year-end, but there are four significant reasons why I will be shorting volatility into the end of the year.I have written extensively before on why I believe have led to the VIX being a somewhat obsolete instrument for catching volatility and why many who expect spikes of levels similar to those seen in COVID-19 and the Global Financial will likely be . This is the primary reason why many investors have been fretting about a suppressed VIX. To sum up a key conclusion of my prior workOf course, a crucial distinction must be made when talking about why the VIX has been suppressed. In my past two articles on the VIX, I mainly focused on the structural reasons why volatility was relatively more suppressed while navigating an ominous group of post-COVID-19 risks than in previous periods when the market faced similar risks.You can see this at play during the recent VIX spike on interest rate fears and volatility that appeared to peak last week. The VIX briefly got above  20, but I think it will continue to retreat into year-end, given several factors. While I am still convinced the structural and market efficiency factors contribute to a more suppressed VIX, I think many factors that will work with them to contribute to a suppressed VIX for the rest of the year are also fundamental and seasonal. Here are four reasons why I think the VIX will remain suppressed until the end of 2023.1. The soft landing thesis appears intact. The jobs market is proliferating, but these aren't high-paying jobs that drive inflationary spending. Furthermore, upward wage pressure has come down, meaning the job market strength is not exacerbating inflation. The economic strength will likely lead to strength in Q3 earnings. One positive sign is that companies are issuing guidance at the highest clip in five years, and all else being equal, more visibility means less price volatility, particularly during earnings season.We often have a unique combination of robust economic data and consumer sentiment already at recessionary levels. Recessions are usually preceded by exuberance and confidence, not the perpetual fear and anxiety that leads to more conservative and rational economic decision-making in many cases. In other words, if you cut costs in anticipation of a recession, but demand stays the same or increases, you have likely just increased your margins. This appears to be going on widely in the US economy.2. The Q3 Earnings season is upon us. When markets enter an earnings season, the focus tends to shift from macro drivers and the Fed to the earnings report of respective companies. And believe it or not, despite all the hollering and moaning from bears about term premiums, earnings estimates have ticked back up after declining in a wave of pessimistic sentiment earlier in the year. But, particularly after recent data showing better than forecast economic strength, I'm VERY optimistic about the upcoming earnings season.But there is another underappreciated factor in how earnings season affects the VIX, even if it is a highly volatile one. The VIX measures volatility at the index level. Still, during an earnings season,  at the index level as it increases at the level of individual stocks, so long as an all-correlations-go-to-one sell-off does not occur. In other words, the fact that we are entering an earnings season in itself means that the VIX should naturally be suppressed.3. Seasonal factors have flipped mainly from negative to positive. The remainder of the year tends to see gains for the stock market. Little factors like a slight bump from late tax returns should prove a countervailing force on the weakening bottom four quartiles of US consumers. Yet, the top quintile unlimited purse is somewhat of a countercyclical buoy. Furthermore, standard seasonal factors generally converge to produce good gains in the Fourth Quarter.In addition to the regular monthly seasonal strength, another minor feather in the bullish cap is that this seasonality is augmented in odd years versus even years. So, many positive seasonal factors should converge in the market's favor. There is always the possibility that abnormal events derail the seasonal trends, but historical data is better than none in most instances.4. The macroeconomic impact of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, was multiplied by two factors  The Cold War magnifying and intensifying the consequences of the conflict and the developed world's dependence on foreign-produced oil. Both of these items have changed. The world is still far more globalized now than it was then, despite recent and apparent setbacks to globalization. The first significant change is that the US economy has become far less reliant on oil and is far more efficient in its use than when the Arab-Oil Embargo roiled global markets and the US economy in particular.The other significant change is that the US is now one of the world's largest energy producers. We consume a lot of our oil, and even though the current administration has made some missteps on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, America's energy dominance means that any interruption in oil markets will affect our economy less. US Energy exports hit a record in 2022.It will also affect the global economy less. While the energy sector has been a polarizing political issue, if push came to shove and the United States faced economic ruin or dramatically increasing production, it would likely choose the latter. This is a different dynamic in the global economy than when Arab-Israeli issues badly affected prices and caused recession through energy shocks. Thus, one of the primary mechanisms through which volatility could affect markets is mitigated, and I think energy prices will ultimately be more affected by .The other reasons why I think continued VIX suppression is likely are all still intact, and I think those more secular reasons will converge with the seasonal to produce a low fear index for the remainder of the year. The most significant factor driving the suppression of the VIX is a matter of simple supply and demand. There has been a mass proliferation of more precise and even more liquid alternatives to hedge against tail risk or single-stock risks.I think you should use more precise tools that will give you more upside. For instance, the Limit Up, Limit Down  LULD  rules for individual stocks will give you more upside than the market-wide circuit-breaker rules. These rules have effectively diminished the kurtosis of the VIX or chopped off the tail colloquially.Still, despite these structural factors, there is a massive demand for VIX calls, implying that quite a few market participants disagree with my take. Many risks could get worse than markets already know about. I would include this as a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of the known risks currently stalking the market.I would also point out that my assumption of declining volatility into the end of the year largely rests upon an economic soft-landing coming to fruition. If economic activity declines rapidly or the lag effects of monetary policy cause a significant credit event, then the VIX will spike and make this article look spectacularly wrong. Nonetheless, I think this is a low-probability outcome.The reason you want to buy VIX options instead of just using put options on your SPX position is because the VIX has more convexity. The underlying is the implied volatility of the S P 500, not a security, and implied volatility can spike quickly in a way that usually outpaces asset price moves. But the post-COVID markets have been of a different character than usual.The Fed has guarded financial stability more than consensus thought possible, and the US consumer has proven remarkably resilient. Now that seasonal factors are favorable, I don't think these realities will turn around on a dime. The VIX also tends to decrease after inversion and briefly inverted on recent rate fears.Of course, the main risk of shorting the VIX is getting blown out of the water by an unknown risk. The Black Swan risks we can't know, anticipate, or sometimes even imagine will always be one of the most significant risks to shorting the VIX. People often equate it to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. But in addition to seasonal factors being on your side, shorting the VIX in the wake of inversions has an excellent track record.Still, if you think about the physical limitations of this metaphorical task, it is quite doable, just like shorting the VIX. However, I think the data is mainly sending the all-clear, and survey and sentiment data show that people are in a frightful Halloween spirit. This is a perfect condition for shorting the VIX, in my estimation.They say markets climb a wall of worry and fall on a slope of hope. When the inflation report came in white hot and Hamas attacked unprecedentedly, markets sold off. But then they climbed the wall of worry and closed the day higher. While two anecdotal market occurrences don't make a trend, I think they hint at how markets will respond into year-end, aided by seasonal factors. They will climb a wall of worry, and the VIX will likely remain suppressed. I am betting the recent spike just north of  20 was a local high until the end of the year.So, let's finish on ways to implement a short VIX. There are a few options I will provide for folks with different skill levels, risk tolerances, and time horizons. I'll also tell you which contracts I've used will be using. One of the points I've made about VIX suppression involved the proliferation of more precise tools. One tool that is a pretty easy way to short the VIX is a popular short short-term VIX ETF offered by ProShares .There are a lot of risks involved with this ETF, and it won't perform like the VIX, but if you're not used to trading options, it is a good way to capitalize on a collapse of SPX Implied Volatility. It is a highly short-term instrument, and you should monitor it daily. Carefully consult the prospectus before using this tool, and really do your homework. Don't use it if you don't understand itMy preferred way of shorting the VIX is through VIX options. I think you have a lot more control here with regard to theta decay and implied volatility. As I've mentioned, the proliferation of 0DTE options has increased the agility of investors and enables you to squeeze a lot of alpha out of short periods. So, for me, I'll experiment with a trade comprising both short-term VIX options, only eight days out complimented with longer duration options whose value is more supported by time value. These guys can really pop if you catch the proverbial wind right  of course, the rapid time decay can also quickly vaporize capital.For this higher-risk leg of my trade, I purchased the . These options were very cheap, around the close at . However, this part of the position is negligible compared to the October 18th puts. The theta decay is a double-edged sword because, of course, if it goes against you, your contract will quickly go to zero. But, on the other hand, you have a very pure exposure to price movement. This can serve its purpose, but it's like flying a helicopter in a hurricane.Thus, I like to balance my ultra-risky positions with little time to expiry with a longer-dated option that is near or at the money. For this particular trade, given the recent spike in fear and negative sentiment, I will purchase the . These last traded at, respectively. I will put tight stops on my riskier positions and looser ones with more time value. This way, I will prevent a total loss of capital if the VIX moves to higher levels.

Downgrading Apple On Rising China Geopolitical Risk: The Supply Chain Threat,"Apple  has seen investors grow fearful amidst rising geopolitical tensions with China. With China ordering government agencies to ban the use of iPhones at work, investors may be wondering if the company s Chinese revenues are at risk. Investors may be overlookingAAPL has been one of the biggest large-cap winners over the past two decades. The first decade was marked by innovation, and the rally in this most recent decade was spurred by an aggressive share repurchase program. The rally of the last five years has arguably been driven by multiple expansion, as investors began to give the stock respect for its loyal ecosystem.I  AAPL in July where I explained why I was rating the stock a buy in spite of the premium valuation. The stock is down since then and I have come to realize that I have underestimated the geopolitical tension risk. Amidst a period in which American investors seemingly want nothing to do with Chinese stocks  just  , it is curious to see AAPL continue to command premium valuations in spite of being highly exposed to the consequences of a breakdown in US-China relationships. The strong name-brand and cash generation potential are likely to keep this story going for the long term, but I expect the stock to experience unusual downward pressure over the near and medium term.In its most recent quarter, AAPL saw revenues decline marginally YoY but gross profits increased due to strong growth in Services.AAPL was able to keep operating expenses steady, with 9.5  growth in R D being partially offset by a slight decline in SG A expenses. Together with a reduction in the income tax rate from 15.7  to 12.5 , the company was able to deliver a 2.3  YoY gain in net income.AAPL continued to lap tough comparables on Mac and iPad sales and only saw meaningful growth in Services, which grew at an 8.2  clip. The high margin and recurring nature of Services revenue has been a typical bullish focal point, and these views are being validated amidst a tough macro environment.AAPL ended the quarter with  166.6 billion of cash and investments versus  109.3 billion in debt, representing a bulletproof net cash balance sheet position. The company repurchased  18 billion worth of stock in the quarter - I expect share repurchases to remain elevated in the near term as the company continues working towards its goal of a leverage neutral position.Looking forward, management is guiding for headwinds to persist in the third quarter. Unlike some other tech peers who are projecting foreign exchange tailwinds, AAPL expects foreign exchange to further negatively impact growth by over 2 percentage points.On the , management stated expectations for Mac and iPad sales to sustain similar weakness, but iPhone and Services to see some sequential acceleration in growth. Management highlighted increasing affordability as one of their tactics to increase market share, as they noted that over 50  of iPhones are sold  using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.  I wouldn t be surprised to see AAPL lean on promotional activity a bit more amidst this tough macro environment and if conditions worsen.With regards to generative AI, management simply stated that they have been doing research  across a wide range of AI technologies  for years, but that they do not intend to discuss future products in the pipeline until they are ready to be released. It is fair to say that AAPL may be aiming to play the slow game here, similar to how it has with building its ecosystem.After the recent dip from highs, AAPL traded hands at around 29x earnings.That earnings multiple may look richly valued if not outright expensive relative to consensus estimates of mid to high single digit revenue growth moving forward. However, the idea here is that AAPL has earned a premium valuation akin to consumer staple stocks. AAPL has a loyal and growing user base - that loyalty not only helps to increase customer retention upon device replacement but also increases their Services revenue stream.The real kicker is that AAPL may be able to add additional products and services to offer to that loyal ecosystem. AAPL has already seen success in its entrance into consumer banking, with management noting that customers have already made more than  10 billion in deposits. Apple Pay is rapidly taking market share and recently accounted .AAPL recently unveiled their upcoming Vision Pro product, though the hefty  3,500 price tag may keep adoption modest for the first release.The strength and visibility of this growth story, even if the growth rates are modest, have historically justified the premium multiple. But the story has changed.In early September, a report surfaced stating that . Such a measure is unlikely to be due to anything that AAPL did and instead due to general escalation of US-China tensions, but the explanations for it do not matter from the perspective of AAPL shareholders. AAPL suddenly has potential fallout from escalating US-China geopolitical tensions. China made up 19  of revenue in the latest quarter, or up to 30  of operating income in the worst case. Perhaps AAPL may be forced to lose all of its Chinese revenues. Its earnings multiple might jump as high as 42x, a hefty multiple in this higher interest rate environment. But investors may rightly point out that AAPL can grow into its valuation with time, lessening the potential impact due to the forward-looking nature of Wall Street.But the real issues isn t in potential lost revenues, but instead in the supply chain impact. As noted in the company s ,  substantially all of the Company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.  Notice that China is listed first, as expert estimates indicate that the . Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that it would take , indicating just how catastrophic this apocalyptic scenario might be. This shouldn t come as a surprise, however, as AAPL had been deepening its production capabilities in China in order to boost unit-level margins. At the time, there was little reason to believe that geopolitical tensions could escalate so much as to put this mutually beneficial relationship at risk. But after the Russia-Ukraine war and this latest announcement by the Chinese government, suddenly everything is on the table. In the event that AAPL is suddenly required to move all of its manufacturing out of China immediately, it isn t clear if this is a problem that money could solve. Even if it was, AAPL would likely need to pay dearly for such a transition. Investors may point out  again rightly so  that the possibility of this scenario seems very unlikely. But that misses the point  stocks are not bid based on mathematical realities but can be swayed by fear and negative sentiment. The very possibility of negative impact may present a valuation overhang on the stock, which may be disastrous given the rich valuation of the stock today. Given the higher interest rate environment, many recurring-revenue businesses are trading at low valuations today, including around 11x-14x earnings in the net lease REIT sector, 12x-14x earnings in health insurance, 8x-10x earnings for midstream pipelines and many other examples. It wouldn t be out of the question to see the stock re-rate downwards to 20x-25x earnings in order to work in a Chinese discount. Even at the upper end of that range, AAPL would potentially be dead money over the coming years, and that isn t even incorporating the potential hit to earnings from the supply chain disruption.Because I no longer have faith that AAPL can sustain let alone grow upon its premium multiple, I expect the stock to underperform the broader market in the near to medium term. Some readers may point out that we mustn t allow fear to dictate our investment decisions, but I d point out that when the stock trades at 30x earnings and a 3x PEG ratio, this isn t irrational fear, it s discipline. I am downgrading AAPL stock to underperform.Julian Lin is a financial analyst. He finds undervalued companies with secular growth that appreciate over time.

Colgate-Palmolive: A Healthy 7% Return With A Safe Dividend For Investors In A Post-Pandemic World,"I'm attracted to the Colgate-Palmolive Company  for the following reasons. First, the company's ability to adjust selling prices showcases its strong brand and competitive edge. Second, its global operations diversify risks and balance economic shifts. Third, a 2.5  forward annual dividendColgate-Palmolive, a household name synonymous with oral care products, is more than just a toothpaste company that we are all aware of. It is a global conglomerate with a diverse portfolio of products that extend beyond oral care to personal and home care, as well as pet nutrition. The company's commitment to sustainable growth, innovation, and its stable business model make it a compelling investment opportunity in the current market scenario.Colgate-Palmolive'sColgate-Palmolive's ability to maintain or increase selling prices, even in the face of inflationary pressures, is a testament to its strong brand and pricing power. In my opinion, this is a significant competitive advantage that not all companies possess, and it speaks to the strength and resilience of Colgate-Palmolive's business model.When we consider the financial data. Despite the challenging economic environment, Colgate-Palmolive has demonstrated robust financial performance. The company's revenue for the I also believe the quality of Colgate-Palmolive products also supports its pricing power. The company owns a portfolio of well-known and trusted brands, including Colgate, Palmolive, and Hill's, among others. These brands have a strong presence in households worldwide, and consumers are often willing to pay a premium for products they trust and value. This brand strength is a key factor that enables Colgate-Palmolive to increase prices without losing market share.Furthermore, Colgate-Palmolive's extensive global distribution network is another factor that contributes to its pricing power. The company's products are available in over 200 countries and territories, providing it with a broad and diversified customer base. This global reach allows the company to balance out regional economic fluctuations and maintain stable pricing.In addition, Colgate-Palmolive's continued investment in research and development  R D  and marketing helps to reinforce its brand strength and pricing power. By continually innovating and improving its products, the company can justify price increases and I believe it will help to maintain or potentially improve customer loyalty. At the same time, effective marketing campaigns will continue to help enhance brand awareness and perception, further supporting the company's pricing strategy.Colgate-Palmolive's extensive global presence, with subsidiaries in numerous countries indicates a diversified risk profile. This international diversification not only provides the company with a broad and varied customer base but has historically helped to mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations in any single market as seen during the global financial crisis of the late 2000s where the company continued to grow earnings per share  EPS  at a double digit rate unlike other S P 500 companies.In North America, the company's net sales for Oral, Personal and Home Care were . For Pet Nutrition, the net sales in the U.S. were  2,432 million in the same year. This indicates a strong market presence in the U.S., which is one of the largest consumer markets globally. The company also has a strong market presence in large consumer markets in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, France and Italy in addition to other major emerging markets across Asia, Africa and South America such as India, Brazil and Kenya.This geographical diversification of revenue streams allows Colgate-Palmolive to mitigate risks associated with economic downturns or other adverse conditions in any single country or region. It also provides the company with the opportunity to benefit from growth in emerging markets. The IMF projects that emerging markets are expected to grow by 4.1  in 2024, as opposed to 1.4  growth for advanced economies. This is driven by factors such as a younger population, increasing urbanization, and rising middle-class consumption in these markets. By already being established in many of these emerging markets, I believe this positions Colgate-Palmolive perfectly to capitalize on this growth.Moreover, the company's ability to adapt its product offerings to cater to local tastes and preferences in different countries is an underrated aspect which further strengthens its global position. This adaptability, combined with the company's strong brand recognition and extensive distribution network, contributes to its robust financial performance on a global scale.Colgate-Palmolive is one of the most remarkable dividend paying companies I have come across. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1895, demonstrating over a century of commitment to its shareholders. What I think is even more impressive, is that Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend payments for the past 60 consecutive years.Despite the impressive history, I wanted to check to make sure the dividend Colgate-Palmolive pay is sustainable, so I have assessed the safety of the by examining its payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. The business produced net income for the last twelve months  LTM  as of . Since Colgate-Palmolive's payout ratio is 64.19 , this indicates that it returned over half of its earnings to shareholders, while still retaining a significant portion for reinvestment.A review of the company's balance sheet further underscores the safety of its dividend. The company's cash and cash equivalents have increased from . This increase in cash reserves provides the company with additional financial flexibility and further supports its ability to meet its short-term obligations, including dividend payments. The company's long-term debt stands at  7,699 million and as of Q1 2023, Colgate-Palmolive's current ratio is 1.1, indicating that it has enough assets to cover its short-term liabilities.As I mentioned, Colgate-Palmolive has a reasonably solid balance sheet with an impressive dividend history. The rest of the company's financials, like the CL's dividend have also been solid over the past five 5 years. Its revenue has shown steady growth, The stability of CL's business model is well reflected in its Free Cash Flow  FCF , with LTM FCF being  2.356 million, which is roughly in line with the FCF from 2018 of  2.620 million, which is a testament to the company's ability to generate FCF despite the challenging economic conditions we have experienced over the last few years. The robust nature of Colgate-Palmolive's FCF during difficult economic environments give me confidence the company will continue to generate an impressive amount of FCF into the future.Regarding the short term of Colgate-Palmolive, particularly their upcoming quarterly earnings results, I anticipate the company will continue to improve on the 3 priorities which they outlined for the year, being increasing sales growth, increasing brand investment and improving earnings. I expect that this will be reflected in improving margins, increased revenue and accelerating EPS growth. Given that the most recent earnings release was promising in my opinion and management felt confident in improving their outlook for 2023, I fully expect the company to deliver on their 2023 outlook. I will be particularly eager to see management deliver on their  given that this saw significant declines resulting from inflation.As of August 2023, Colgate-Palmolive stock has underperformed the S P 500 having declined 2.8  year to date compared to the 17.0  returned by the S P 500, suggesting that CL stock may be undervalued compared to the rest of the market due to recent price action.When considering valuation, I always consider what we are paying for the business  the market capitalization  versus what we are getting  the underlying business fundamentals and future earnings . I believe a reliable way of measuring what you get versus what you pay is by conducting a discounted cash flow analysis of the business as seen below.First, I looked at the company's historical growth rates. I analyzed the company's free cash flow over the past several years to understand the trend and the rate at which it has been growing. This gave me a sense of how the company has been performing and what kind of growth it has been able to achieve in the past. I also factored in  per annum for the next five years.I am aware that both historical growth rates and analyst estimates have their limitations and generally use them as an upper limit when determining the growth rate to apply.I also wanted to ensure that I was using a reasonable starting point for the company's free cash flow when doing my DCF. I decided to take a different approach than I typically do for DCF models by normalizing free cash flow  FCF  to a number which better reflects typical cash flow of the past ten years.Instead of using the FCF from FY2022, I chose to use a normalized free cash flow per share of  2.50 per share. By using a normalized figure, I aimed to smooth out one-time events that have affected the company's free cash flow in FY2022 such as the merger and restructuring charges and asset write downs.In my view, using this normalized free cash flow per share of  2.50 provides a more accurate and conservative starting point for projecting the company's future cash flows. It's more in line with the company's historical performance and, I believe, provides a more realistic basis for estimating the company's intrinsic value.After conducting my discounted cash flow  DCF  analysis on Colgate-Palmolive, I arrived at a buy price of  73.25 per share. Based on the 7  growth rate and the 7  discount rate applied to this valuation, this would imply a share price of  102.73 per share in 5 years. The current share price is  76.90, therefore investors can expect to achieve an annual compounded growth rate of 7  based on this DCF analysis given the company's projected cash flows and long-term stability and resilience.As seen below, when conducting a peer comparison of Price Free Cash Flow ratio trends between Colgate-Palmolive and Procter   Gamble of which each are competitors in the consumer staples industry, it is clear that both businesses have historically traded at similar valuations. Currently, Colgate- Palmolive is trading at a slightly higher multiple, however this is likely due to one-time events that have affected the company's free cash flow in FY2022 such as the Merger and Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Downs. Once these one-time expenses have been accounted for, both businesses trade at very similar valuations and offer a comparable risk reward profile.Large multinational competitors such as Johnson   Johnson, Unilever and Oral-B  much like Colgate-Palmolive  have extensive financial resources, broad product portfolios, and established distribution networks. As a result, I believe there to be a risk of them leveraging their scale and operational efficiencies to potentially undercut Colgate-Palmolive on price, invest heavily in marketing and product development, or negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and retailers.On the other hand, the rise of digital marketing and e-commerce has lowered the barriers to entry allowing smaller players to reach consumers more directly and cost-effectively. These smaller scale companies often have a deeper understanding of local consumers, enabling them to tailor their products more effectively. They also tend to be more agile and innovative, therefore enabling them to quickly adapt to changing market trends and consumer behaviors.This competitive landscape could exert pressure on Colgate-Palmolive's market share. If competitors are able to offer similar products at lower prices, or if they are more successful in innovating and meeting consumer needs, Colgate-Palmolive could lose market share.Colgate-Palmolive, like many companies in the consumer goods industry, relies heavily on a variety of raw materials such as calcium carbonate, fluoride, plastic, and cardboard to manufacture its products. We have seen in the past, the prices of these materials fluctuate due to factors, including changes in supply and demand, geopolitical events, natural disasters, or shifts in global trade policies.When commodity prices rise, it increases the cost of goods sold for Colgate-Palmolive. If the company is unable to pass these increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, it could result in a squeeze on the company's gross margins. This could subsequently impact the company's profitability and its ability to invest in other areas of the business such as research and development, marketing, or capital expenditures. Even if the company is able to pass on some or all of the increased costs to consumers, it may still face a lag between the time the costs are incurred and when the price increases take effect. This could temporarily impact the company's margins and cash flows.Another risk is currency exchange rate risk. . Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the value of these revenues and profits in U.S. dollar terms would decrease, potentially impacting the company's reported financial performance. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar could inflate the U.S. dollar value of foreign revenues and profits. While the company may use financial instruments to hedge against some of this risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely.I'm drawn to Colgate-Palmolive for several compelling reasons. Firstly, I'm impressed by the company's ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, a clear testament to its strong brand and pricing power. This ability is a significant competitive advantage that speaks volumes about the robustness of Colgate-Palmolive's business model. Secondly, I appreciate the company's extensive global presence. With operations in numerous countries, Colgate-Palmolive has a diversified risk profile that allows it to balance regional economic fluctuations. Thirdly, I value the company's robust dividend history. With a forward annual dividend yield of 2.53  and a payout ratio of 64.19 , it's clear that Colgate-Palmolive is committed to returning capital to its shareholders. Lastly, based on my conservative discounted cash flow analysis, I believe that the current stock price of Colgate-Palmolive offers a 7  annual return over the next five years.

First BanCorp. (FBP) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"First BanCorp.  Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2023 11 00 AM ETRamon Rodriguez - IR OfficerAurelio Alemán-Bermudez - President and CEOOrlando Berges-González - EVP and CFOAlex Twerdahl - Piper SandlerHello, everyone, and welcome to the First BanCorp Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results. My name is Bruno and I'll be operating your call today.  Operator InstructionsI will now hand over to your host, Ramon Rodriguez, Investor Relations Officer.Thank you, Bruno. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining First BanCorp.'s conference call and webcast to discuss the company's financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Joining you today from First BanCorp are Aurelio Alemán, President and Chief Executive Officer  Orlando Berges, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin today's call, it is my responsibility to inform you that this call may involve certain forward-looking statements, such as projections of revenue, earnings and capital structure as well as statements on the plans and objectives of the company's business. The company's actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements made due to the important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings.The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. If anyone does not already have a copy of the webcast presentation or press release, you can access them at our website at fbpinvestor.com.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Aurelio Alemán.Thank you, Ramon. Good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining the call today.Please let's turn to Page 4 to go over the financial highlights. We posted another good quarter with  82 million in net income or  0.46 per share, which translated into a fairly strong returnNet interest income registered a slight decrease during the quarter, mainly due to the expected upward pressure on deposit pricing and increase in the mix of interest-bearing deposits to total deposits.Expenses were quite in line with guidance at  160 million, and the efficiencyNotwithstanding NPA levels remain at multiyear lows and now represent just 70 basis points of total asset. As anticipated, we believe excess liquidity in the market has continued to taper off, and we're starting to see normalization in delinquency trends. However, they are still way below pre-pandemic levels.On the capital front, we continue the repurchase plan, and we repurchased  75 million in common shares during the quarter. That finalizes the remaining of the authorization under the '22 capital plan. And given strong capital position, liquidity, and outlook for the remainder of the year, we do expect to continue repurchasing shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, but now under the 2023 capital plan authorization.Please let's move to Slide 5 to go over the portfolio. This quarter, we were really pleased with the loan production activity that we experienced across the three regions. Total loan increased by 6  on a linked quarter annualized basis and reached  12 billion, healthy levels of both commercial and consumer loan origination.The loan portfolio has been expanding since the third quarter of 2022, reflecting organic growth of over  150 million or 8  increase during this period. Again, our loan growth strategy is supported by the increased business activity and economic activity that we see in the island, particularly in this market, coupled with timely focused execution of the sales teams across the three regions.Going forward, we expect loan growth to remain in line with our mid-single-digit growth guidance as we continue to redeploy a portion of the investment portfolio cash flows into higher-yielding assets in the loan portfolio. Also, we do expect the facilities of the construction loan that were approved this year begin to accelerate into disbursements.Let's go over to Page 6 to go over the funding. We're moving in line with industry trends. The recently released deposit market assessment of the FDIC as of June shows an overall contraction in total deposit in Puerto Rico as of June 2023. And our refers are basically reflecting that we are retaining our market share. So we're basically remaining flat to the market.This quarter, other than broker and government deposits, it decreased  159 million or 1.2 . Again, this reduction primarily driven by erosion of liquidity in the overall market and migration to -- of retail customer to higher rate options actually outside the traditional banking sector, I would say, particularly credit unions and the U.S. treasury market.On the other hand, that was offset by stabilization in commercial deposit balances. It's still representing 34  of our deposit base in non-interest-bearing deposits. Again, we remain focused on retaining our market share in this segment we serve, pricing our products competitively.Again, it's a function of the market environment and the rates and definitely retaining our most valuable relationships is key to the strategy. Funding profile of the institution do remain very attractive. It's a very well-diversified deposit base, composed of a balanced mix of core and retail customers.When we combine average balances of these accounts, it's really -- it's around  19,000. So it's fairly granular. And again, we have ample liquidity available to various funding options that allow us to continue to strategically manage our balance sheet growth plans.Just move to Page 7 to go over the macro. We continue to see the Puerto Rico economy, very stable, performing fairly well considering the interest rate environment and the emerging geopolitical events. Economic activity index of Puerto Rico reached its highest level in eight-years during the third quarter.Passenger traffic at the main airport continues to hit all-time highs. Consumers continue to be adapting to the rising rates and prices as evident by retail sales, household spending, auto sales. And more importantly, labor market remained stable with unemployment around 6.2 .The pace of this disaster relief funding for the first eight months of the year, it's 72  above the same period last year, which is definitely driving construction activity in the island. We started to see additional number of low-income housing projects and obviously, rebuilding of important infrastructure. In addition, we continue to see private investors continue to allocate support to the island.There is a recently announced transactions where private investor, a concession of South Expressway on the P3 structure total concession, which a recent investor allocated  2.9 billion, plus there would be an additional  2.4 billion in improvements. That's -- I think that is a good example of what are we seeing.We said in the past, we have the experience to continue operating under this challenging market and changing market, and we continue to leverage our proven risk framework and franchise to supporting the customers through the cycle.Now I will turn the call to Orlando to go over the financials in more detail. Thanks to all.Thanks, Aurelio, and good morning, everyone.As you saw in the release, the results for the third quarter show an increase of  11.4 million in net income, which is primarily associated with the lower provision and a lower effective tax rate. We earned  82 million for the third quarter or  0.46 a share, which compares to  70.7 million in the third -- in the second quarter or  0.39 per share. Adjusted pretax pre-provision did come down by  4.6 million to  113.4 million.The provision for credit losses in the quarter decreased to  4.4 million, which compares to the  22.2 million we had in the second quarter. When we look at the components, the projected macroeconomic variables last quarter deteriorated, especially in the commercial real estate side and some on the unemployment side, which resulted in additional provisioning mix in the quarter.This quarter, the projection still shows a deterioration on the longer term. But current values of some of these variables are more favorable than they were originally estimated, which led to a lower pace -- slower pace of deterioration and thus a lower reserve impact.Also, this quarter, we booked  1.4 million in recoveries on a commercial loan that was previously charged off a few years ago and was collected. And there was -- we did a refinancing of municipal bond that we sold in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio, which resulted in some reserve releases since the new structure is that of a commercial loan, which has a much shorter timeframe.The estimated tax rate for the quarter came down -- estimated tax rate for the year, but impact in the quarter came down to 28.2  from 30.1  as a result of a higher proportion of tax-exempt income to total income and additional business activities we did under tax advantages under the Puerto Rico code. Looking at that interest income for the quarter was  199.7 million, relatively flat when we compare it to prior quarter.As we have discussed in prior calls, deposit pricing pressures, especially on the public sector have offset the improvement in interest income resulting from loan growth and loan repricing. Total interest income for the quarter grew  11.2 million for 12 basis points improvement in yields on interest-earning assets.But interest expense grew  11.3 million, representing 28 basis points increase in cost, offsetting the growth in interest income. On the commercial loans, interest income grew  6.1 million, which reflected loan repricing based on rate changes, higher yielding new loans as well as an increase of  104.5 million in average balances. The increase also includes  1.2 million in interest collected on the previously charged-off loan that I mentioned before.Commercial loan yields for the quarter are up 24 basis points compared to last quarter. In the case of consumer loans, interest income was up  4 million, again, higher yields on new loans and we grew the portfolio on average  94.5 million. Overall, yields on the consumer portfolio increased 6 basis points during the quarter.On the other hand, interest expense on interest-bearing deposits, it's  12.7 million higher this quarter than last quarter. Most of this increase is driven by a combination of higher rates paid on checking and savings accounts, mostly public sector deposits, migration that we have been facing over the last few quarters from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, especially on time deposits. And if we exclude broker deposits, the average cost of deposits increased 37 basis points this quarter.However, the average cost of interest-bearing checking and savings accounts other than public deposits increased by only 7 basis points. Time deposits did increase by 41 basis points, overall time deposits from the prior quarter. This -- the portfolio -- the time deposit portfolio, it's now on average  197 million more than we had in the second quarter.The -- on the chart on the top right hand, you can see the cumulative betas on deposits since September of '22. However, due to the repricing lags, public sector deposits had a much higher betas this quarter than what we had in overall cumulative period since September of '22. Net interest margin for the quarter was down to 4.15  from 4.23  last quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect somewhat normalization in the margin towards the beginning of '24 based on the expectation that our interest rate increases will stabilize, thus normalizing some of the deposit pricing pressures we've had.Also, we continue to redeploy the cash flows from the investment portfolio into either higher yielding loan growth or in some cases, reduction of wholesale funding. We project that investment portfolio cash flows over the next quarter will be approximately  160 million and looking through the middle of 2025, let's say, about 1.5 years more, it's about  1.6 billion more.Look, what this is going to do is we have a yield of  133 million in the investment portfolio. In essence, we would be replacing through these cash flows either into loans that are going to yield around 600 basis points more or reductions in wholesale funding or cash -- keep it in cash, which would yield around 400 basis points more than we have on the investment portfolio. So that would offset any impact we had on migration to the time deposit side.In terms of other income, this quarter we had  6 million less in other income, but that was mostly related to certain nonrecurring gains we had in the second quarter, amounted to  5.2 million that were on legal settlements and a couple of other items. If we exclude these gains on a non-GAAP basis, net interest income decreased  700,000 in the quarter.Expenses increased in the quarter by  3.7 million. It was mostly driven by  2.2 million in additional payroll expenses as we implemented our merit increases and salary adjustments in July of this year.We did -- you can see that we did continue to achieve some gains on the disposition of OREO properties, but we include these gains, operating expenses for the quarter were  118.8 million, which fall within the guidance of  118 million to  120 million we have provided.The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 50.7 , slightly higher as expenses grew and some of the other income came down, which compares to 47.8  in the last quarter. However, the second quarter efficiency ratio was actually 48.9  if we exclude those nonrecurring gains that I mentioned. Again, as we have mentioned, we continue to maintain a very disciplined expense management framework and our target is to remain close to that 50  efficiency ratio in the near term.In terms of credit quality, as Aurelio mentioned, NPAs increased  9.1 million during the quarter, and that was primarily  9.5 million commercial case, one case that went into nonperforming this quarter. On the consumer side, we had  2.9 million increase in NPAs, but that was offset by  3 million reduction in OREOs and lower residential mortgage NPLs. Even with this increase, our NPA levels remain at 70 basis points of total assets.In terms of inflows, they're up  15.6 million compared to the prior quarter, which includes  1 million increase in commercial, which is the case I just mentioned, and  6 million increase in consumer.Also, early delinquency in the quarter, which is defined as 30 to 89 days for this purpose, increased  18.5 million, mostly it's consumer. However, I'd like to point out that September 30 was, the last day of third quarter, fell on a weekend and effects collections, and approximately  11.5 million of this delinquency had been collected by October 2. So the increase was much less than reflected.We have mentioned on prior calls that we anticipate delinquency levels in consumer should eventually start behaving more like historical trends, obviously, as excess liquidity from the pandemic-related funds decreased. However, so far, delinquency -- consumer delinquency as a percentage of loans remains below pre-pandemic levels.In terms of the allowance, we get about  271 million, a decrease of  10 million from prior quarter.  6 million of the reduction relates to lower reserve from HTM, of held-to-maturity securities due to the refinancing of the  46 million long-term municipal bond I mentioned, went into a shorter-term loan structure and also, there were significant improvement or there were improvements in the underlying financials of certain Puerto Rico government municipalities that are held in the held-to-maturity portfolio.Looking at the reserve on just loans and leases, was down  3.5 million, which mostly reflect that projected a slower deterioration on the macroeconomic variables, as I previously mentioned. The reserve stands at 2.21  of the portfolio compared to 2.28 , still a healthy reserve coverage in our portfolio.In terms of capital, regulatory capital ratios continue to be significantly above, well capitalized, at the end of the quarter. The tangible common equity ratio did decrease in the quarter to 6.74 , and the tangible book value per share decreased to  7.16. That was driven by the  79 million decrease in the fair value available for sale securities, but also the repurchase of  75 million in common shares we did during the quarter and the payment of  25 million in dividends, obviously, all compensated -- partially compensated by the earnings in the quarter.At the end of the quarter, the net unrealized securities losses, including capital, were  151 million, which is about  4.88 in tangible book value per share and also represents a reduction in the TCE ratio of approximately 409 basis points. As we have said in the past, we believe these unrealized losses are temporary in nature since we have the ability to hold the securities. The investment portfolio had a duration of 3.2 at the end of September, so it's a manageable timeframe on the portfolio.With that, operator, I would like to open the call for questions.Operator Instructions  We do have our first question. It comes from Alex Twerdahl from Piper Sandler. Alex, your line is now open. Please proceed.Hi, good morning.Good morning, Alex.Good morning, Alex.First, I just want to, I guess, start on the last comment that you made, Orlando, on the securities portfolio. I'm just curious, I think we're going to see a lot more companies look at restructuring their securities portfolios into the next quarter, just given what's happened with rates. And obviously, the new outlook out there and I think one of the big factors is how much capital companies have with whether or not they're going to be looking at that more seriously. You guys clearly have a lot of regulatory capital. And as you think about the uses of that regulatory capital, is restructuring of the securities portfolio in these small pieces of it on that radar at allWell, we -- obviously, we have looked into it, but in reality, we have concluded, Alex, that once you consider the tax benefit nature of the portfolio, the immediate impact, the timeframe where we feel that this is going to affect, we don't feel there is a pressure to do that immediately, and we are not considering it at this point because of that.And then on deposits, is it safe to say now that the government deposit piece is pretty close to having fully repriced now that the Fed is presumably doneI think it is safe to say that, yes.And then as you think about sort of the expectations for the remaining portfolio, which has been much lower beta, maybe you can walk through some of the expectations over the next couple of quarters in terms of how you're thinking about how those betas might trend, I guess, as you see excess deposits and excess liquidity come out of the systemYes. We don't -- the betas on the other deposits, we feel they are going to be pretty stable of what we have seen so far. There is obviously the component of the migration still into -- there could be still some migration into time deposits. And there is the component of maturing time deposits that we have that obviously are going to reprice at slightly higher rates. The average cost was about 291, the cost, obviously, it's a little bit higher now as we have repriced others.But when you look at a 1-year CDs, might be close to 3.75  to 4 . So there should be some impact in there. But that's why we mentioned that assuming your first statement that we agree that there is some stability on the government -- the public sector side in terms of cost based on where rates are, that those cash flows coming in from the portfolio, the investment portfolio, would be able to be used to generate better deals that would offset a large chunk of that. So that's why we see that stability and the margin coming in and starting on '24.And that's important. Yes, I just want to add, that's very important. I think the expectation of the cash flow from the investment portfolio are going to be increasing as we go forward. And obviously, the pressure of the betas on the government was significant. So we do expect to see some of that benefit of converting those cashflows to much higher dealing portfolio, loan portfolio to benefit of 2024 to mitigate what we have seen in the NIM and the NII.So I guess, just boiling it down, do you expect this to sort of be the inflection point on NII and the NIM  And starting in the fourth quarter, we could start to see both of those go higherWe feel that we see the inflection point starting next year, early next year, in the first quarter where we'll see a little bit still the repricing on the time deposit side happening this quarter -- this fourth quarter of the year. So it -- again, going back to statements we have done in the past that the growth on the portfolio, on the investment portfolio could be a factor to offset some of that, helping keep that net interest income going up a bit from where we are or staying at the levels where we are.Okay. And then just final question from me. Just the highway deal that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, can you just talk about how that -- I'm not sure if it's been disclosed how big the bank financing piece is exactly, but just how that might actually impact your balance sheet, both in the fourth quarter when that deal is expected to close as well as if there's a piece of it that might be sort of a go-forward pieceYes. Well, it was publicly announced this week, on Tuesday, by the government and the winner of the bid. They're working together to close it close to the end of the year. So most of the benefit will come in the balance sheet for really 2024, some this year, but mostly 2024. Banks, local banks, it was publicly in the statement that local banks contributed around  600 million of the financing required of the initial payment of 2.850. Our position, we contributed -- we committed  150 million to the transaction which will be disbursed at closing, yes.Thanks for the comment on that. Thank you for taking my questions.Thank you.Operator Instructions  We currently have no further questions registered. So I would like to hand the call back to Ramon Rodriguez for closing remarks. Ramon, over to you.Thanks to everyone for participating in today's call. We will be attending Hovde's financial services conference in Palm Beach on November 2 and Piper Sandler's conference in Miami, November 16. We look forward to seeing a number of you at these events, and we greatly appreciate your continued support. Have a great day. Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",0,2023-10-20T23:52:08.000-04:00
The InMode Rollercoaster: Navigating The Revenue Adjustment,"After closely examining the   business model and financials last July, I  an investment in the company, believing it to be a solid BUY. On October 12th, InMode's shares plungedTo grasp the essence of this update, I'd suggest revisiting my initial assessment. There, you'll find a comprehensive breakdown of InMode's business model, its product line, the company's competitive standing, and what sets it apart from other medical laser manufacturers. The heart of that piece was a DCF  Discounted Cash Flow  model crafted from the data available at the time. This new analysis hinges on the DCF as well, but updated with the fresh data we now have atIn light of the new calculations, I believe the recent dramatic decline in InMode's share price, particularly the slump on October 12th, is excessively harsh. While there have been some unfavorable developments, in my opinion, they are nowhere near dire enough to justify such a significant drop. On the contrary, I now see InMode's stocks as a STRONG BUY, making the current dip a golden opportunity for investors.InMode is an Israeli firm specializing in laser machinery for cosmetic medicine. The demand for laser treatments has skyrocketed in recent years. Compared to plastic surgery, laser treatments are quicker to administer, have shorter recovery times, don't require anesthesia, leave no scars, and are more affordable. However, traditional lasers typically yield results markedly inferior to plastic surgery, and not every patient reacts positively to the treatments.For the over-40 demographic in particular, traditional lasers often yield hardly noticeable effects. This puts patients in a dilemma  Should they endure a lengthy, painful, and costly surgical procedure for superior results, or opt for a cheaper and simpler laser treatment, knowing the outcomes might be underwhelmingInMode has risen to the challenge, creating a product line that bridges this gap. Their  minimally invasive  lasers stand at the intersection between surgical procedures and standard laser treatments. While their recovery time is slightly longer than that of traditional lasers, it's considerably shorter than surgical recovery times. Plus, there are no scars, the treatment duration is akin to standard lasers, and the results  Somewhere in between traditional laser treatments and surgery.This innovative approach has carved a unique niche for InMode in the market, distinctly setting their offerings apart from typical cosmetic medical laser providers. Their devices are assembled by an OEM, which is paid a fixed sum per machine. These devices are then either sold or leased to cosmetic doctors and plastic surgeons. The company's cost structure ensures predictable margins, while InMode's level of innovation and technology ensures these margins remain lucrative.Since my initial assessment, two significant variables have shifted. First, there were the unfortunate recent events in Israel, which directly impact any enterprise based in the country. Thankfully, InMode swiftly  reassuring the safety of its employees and confirming no disruptions or delays in their production line due to the current events.Naturally, these events have shaken investor confidence. Over the past five trading days, the shekel has depreciated by 3.45  against the dollar, and despite this currency devaluation, the Tel Aviv 35 index has also shed almost 10  of its value. However, it seems that Israeli forces have now regained full control of their territory, suggesting the gravest threats to InMode are behind them.The second update comes from a  that precedes the official quarterly data release, scheduled for November 2nd. The statement indicates that FY 2023 results will fall below expectations, primarily due to a slower-than-anticipated growth rate during the third quarter.In its latest press release, the company informed its investors about a downward revision of its FY 2023 revenues. The highlights were four-fold, which I'll encapsulate below as they appeared in the statementNowhere in the text did InMode reference the prevailing geopolitical climate. From the information provided by the management, this downward revision seems to stem from the slowing economic activity and rising interest rates in its key markets, namely the United States and Europe.The company points to stricter leasing conditions, a cautious approach by banks, and heightened checks that have bottlenecked loan approval processes. This seems in line with the present scenario, considering that on October 10th, mortgage rates in the US hit a 23-year high.What's pivotal for me, and for long-term shareholders, is what isn t mentioned  there's no sudden upsurge in competition, no emergent and significant alternative technologies, and no change in consumer trends. There's no tangible reason to believe that there's any major factor behind this contraction in 2023 growth predictions. I'd also like to highlight that we're looking at a 5  revenue dip, with no corresponding dip in sales margins, yet the stock took a 20  hit in a single trading session.My immediate hunch was that the markets were already on edge with any stock related to the ongoing events in Israel, and InMode s latest press release merely triggered a panic selloff.Approaching this analytically and methodically, I revisited the numbers to gauge the company's prospects based on the current data.I chose to model an extremely bearish scenario where InMode's growth rate doesn't bounce back in the coming years, especially as monetary policies inevitably ease up. I simply used this year's projected growth rate, adjusted in light of the revised revenue outlook, and gradually tapered it over 6 years to conclude at a final growth rate of 4 .Regarding margins and capex, I made no adjustments  margins mentioned in the recent press release are perfectly aligned with previous quarters and the DCF I highlighted in my first analysis. Capex wasn t addressed in the press release, but we can afford some wiggle room given its historically minimal imprint on InMode s finances.Here are the pivotal assumptions I leaned on to update the DCFGiven this backdrop, my WACC calculation used to discount the cash flows stands as follows  Data in   million, sourced from Seeking AlphaMoving on to the projections of the coming years, here is what we haveBy summing all the discounted cash flows from now until 2029, we arrive at a total of  1.628 billion. We then move on to the calculation of the terminal value, remembering that I used a multiplier of 14x compared to the net income of 2029We are now ready to put everything together in the calculation of InMode's intrinsic valueNow, let's relate all of this to the share price and the company's current valuationEven though I strived to use pessimistic forecasts and a very conservative multiplier for the terminal value, InMode Ltd. stock still appears more undervalued today than it was when I wrote my initial analysis at the end of July.As often happens, a moment of market uncertainty can turn into a wave of panic. I believe this is precisely what happened in this case, and I am ready to double down on my position to take advantage of it. As long as the product is a winner and the margins are so high, I am more than happy to endure a downturn  if it means buying at current prices, I would even say I am excited.A 5  drop in forecasted revenues for this year cannot justify a 20  drop in stock value. One doesn't need a detailed DCF to understand that. However, the detailed DCF served to understand that even in the face of a severe and prolonged deterioration in the growth rate over the next few years, InMode would still remain an excellent stock to invest in.Like all analyses, mine is exposed to the risk of unforeseen events. Specifically, of course, I am currently concerned about what's happening in Israel. However, my opinion is that the Israeli military will in no way allow such attacks to repeat and that the alert level has never been higher. Just as with the 9 11 events in the U.S., I believe that all security measures from now on will be even stronger and will make InMode safer than ever.Another uncertainty for the coming years concerns the advent of new technologies, even if there is currently no specific contender that threatens InMode's specific market niche. All competitors are significantly smaller, and InMode has well-protected its intellectual property with patents, so I don't see any new competitors emerging in the minimally invasive laser niche.I believe that the current risks are not enough to change my position on InMode Ltd. stock, and that the current circumstances offer a great opportunity to buy the shares at a discount.

Why Gold Is A Bad Investment,"The age-old debate over whether gold is a worthy investment has continued to occupy the minds of investors even decades after the  was abandoned in 1971. The debate is a rather extensive one, encompassing multiple aspects of gold as aAs the investment environment enters a new age marked by monetary policy normalization and escalating geopolitical risks, it may be worthwhile to reassess gold's potential as an investment not just on its own but also within the context of a diversified portfolio.In this article, we shall explore popular arguments both in favour of and against gold as an investment. Crucially, we shall attempt to debunk some of theBefore we begin, it is crucial that we first separate investing from speculation. While it is quite common to see investors actively managing their exposure to gold in response to changing macroeconomic fundamentals, some firmly believe that gold deserves a permanent allocation within their portfolios.Generally, we identify an investor as someone who intends to maintain a strategic allocation to gold over the entire investment horizon. This means that gold is considered a permanent allocation within their portfolios over time, while active tactical positioning to moderately increase reduce exposure to gold is acceptable for enhancing returns.In contrast, we associate speculation with the intention to profit from short-term price action or momentum in gold prices. Another tell-tale sign of speculative behaviour is  all-or-nothing  trades, where a position in gold is bought and sold in its entirety, usually in an attempt to profit from a temporary view on prices. Below is a table summarising other key differences between the two approaches.Let us first explore the reasons why gold may be a good investment. Arguments that are in favour of investing in gold typically focus on its ability to provide some form of risk mitigation rather than its ability to generate returns over time. These risks include the loss of purchasing power  inflation , fluctuations in the value of other asset classes  diversification , and the potential loss of accumulated wealth as a consequence of war  geopolitics .One of the most popular arguments in favour of investing in gold is that the value of the precious metal has held up well over time relative to inflation.The chart below shows how gold in U.S. dollar terms has performed versus the US CPI Index since 1970. Gold has gained by a staggering 5,151  to date, while the US CPI Index has risen by only 716 . We have also added data on the Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity CRB Indesince 1994, which shows that broader commodities prices have risen by a modest 140  to date.Clearly, gold has demonstrated its value in outperforming inflation over long periods of time.In the next chart below we have highlighted periods in which the US economy experienced high inflation  specifically when US CPI is above 5 . We plotted the same set of data on a logarithmic scale to better visualise the magnitude of changes during those periods. These include the  of the 1970-1980 which saw inflation peak at 14  in 1980, and the most recent episode when inflation peaked at 9.1  in 2022.Here, the evidence of gold as an effective hedge against inflation in the short-to-medium term is mixed. As we can see, gold prices actually declined during the period between 1990 to 1992 when inflation averaged around 6 , and gold has seen only modest gains from 2021 to date.Overall, it seems to us that gold's widely touted quality of being an effective hedge against inflation is nothing more than a myth. We can certainly make the argument that gold prices have simply risen over time, and therefore gold has historically outperformed inflation by a wide margin. But this says nothing about gold being endowed with certain qualities that would make it especially effective as a hedge against inflation. The evidence we have presented also supports our long-held suspicions that tactical advice encouraging investors to invest in gold as a way to manage inflation risk is nothing more than speculation.Even if gold isn't a reliable hedge against inflation, many analysts argue that investing in gold will nonetheless provide some form of portfolio diversification. This is theoretically true as long as returns on gold are not highly correlated to other asset classes. In practice, however, investors are subjected to various trade-offs and will need to balance between other factors that impact the overall performance of a portfolio besides diversification.To better visualise these trade-offs, we shall perform a backtest  portfoliovisualizer.com  and compare the historical performance of three different portfoliosBelow is a chart demonstrating the performance of the three portfolios beginning with  10,000 in 1972, with no rebalancing.In the above example, Portfolio B with a 60  allocation to equities and 40  to gold performed almost identically to that of the standard 60 40 Equity Bond allocation for Portfolio A. Portfolio C, which represents a 100  investment in gold underperformed both A and B. At first glance, allocating to gold does not seem to provide any real benefit to investors.Comparing the performance statistics of the portfolios provided in the table above, we acknowledge that Portfolio B did indeed improve returns by delivering a slightly higher annualized return  CAGR  of 9.55  versus 9.43  for Portfolio A. However, this additional boost in performance by allocating to gold came at the cost of much higher volatility in returns  higher standard deviation . Overall, this resulted in a lower Sharpe Ratio of 0.39, a popular measure for risk-adjusted returns.We also note that gold did not perform consistently over the backtest period. Gold performed extremely well during the hyperinflationary decade of 1970 to 1980, but suffered a prolonged bear market that lasted for almost two decades from 1981 to 2000. Gold then suffered yet another prolonged bear market in 2012 and only bottomed out by 2015.Prolonged periods of drawdown for gold present serious challenges for investors as performance could be volatile and unpredictable. The fact that gold also does not produce any income in the form of dividends or interests during the investment period, only makes the asset even more risky for retirees, or middle-aged investors planning for their retirement needs.Ultimately, what truly holds up as a valid argument in favour of investing in gold is the asset's ability to preserve wealth during periods of economic turmoil particularly hyperinflation, or catastrophic events such as war.Gold's true advantage lies in its long tradition and historical role as money and its impeccable track record of having survived multiple wars and economic crises. Without diving into the seemingly endless history detailing gold's widespread adoption and influence through the ages, it is suffice to say that gold is truly a time-tested asset for the preservation of wealth having survived countless conflicts, revolutions, and wars to date.Gold has preserved wealth over countless wars because it has always been readily accepted and exchangeable for any other currency in the world. In contrast fiat money, which includes any government-issued currencies that are not backed by a commodity, depends entirely on the faith of its users. Thus, there have been many occasions in history when fiat money was devalued during war, political upheaval, and economic turmoil. Even ownership of land and property are subjected to the risk of being expropriated and destroyed in the event of war or political upheavals.In terms of wealth preservation, it is quite clear that there are few assets, if any, that can match gold's enduring status through the ages.Now, let us explore reasons why we think gold may be a bad investment. The arguments against gold are usually much more direct and grounded in economic reality, rather than driven by beliefs and traditions. As we have already highlighted the mixed evidence of gold being an effective hedge against inflation, as well as its subpar risk-reward profile, we will look at other qualitative factors that make gold a bad investment.Gold is commonly used in the manufacturing of electronics, aerospace equipment, and medical devices, due to its properties of being a good conductor of electricity and the least reactive metal. However, due to its scarcity and high price relative to other metals, gold is used in limited quantities and mostly reserved for applications where there is simply no better alternative to gold.Thus, gold is primarily considered as an asset that is a  buy-to-hold  investment rather than productive assets like equities, debt, or real estate. Because gold does not produce any income in the form of dividends, interests, or rent during the investment period, investors only generate returns if they are able to sell it at a much higher price. This, however, makes gold an unsuitable investment for retirees who require periodic income. Gold may also be unsuitable for investors with a short investment horizon since we have demonstrated that drawdowns in gold prices can be extremely long.In contrast, bond investors earn interest in the form of coupons while waiting for those bonds to mature. Equity investors may also earn dividends indefinitely as long as they remain shareholders of a corporation. Even if a stock does not pay dividends, shareholders ultimately own a share of the corporation and will gain from any growth in the intrinsic value of the corporation over time.Being a non-productive asset, it is not possible to use gold to create and grow value on its own. Unlike corporations that can reinvest profits to grow revenues, or real estate that can be redeveloped and enhanced to grow rental income.Gold's potential as an investment should not be determined as a standalone asset class, but within the context of a diversified portfolio. Doing so provides a more holistic view of the inherent risk-reward trade-offs associated with constructing a portfolio of assets. To keep the analysis simple and only at the asset class level, below is the efficient frontier for major asset classes since 1994 generated using portfoliovisualizer.com.The efficient frontier graph essentially allows investors to compare the historical performance of all assets in question with standard deviation representing volatility on the X-axis and expected returns on the Y-axis. The efficient frontier then represents the most efficient risk-return profiles that an investor can achieve by combining these assets with varying weights when constructing a portfolio. Such analysis can be done not just for asset classes but also at a much more granular level by comparing individual assets. For our purposes, we will only look at major asset classes and consider gold as a unique asset class on its own.To compare the assets in the graph, start by thinking in terms of risk-return trade-off  for each unit of additional risk that an investor takes on, how much in additional returns can the investor expectAs the efficient frontier graph shows, gold has generated returns averaging 6.14  over the test period, with a standard deviation of 15.5 . Meanwhile, the asset with the closest level of risk is U.S large-cap stocks  S P 500 Index , which generated returns averaging 10.5  and a standard deviation of 15.2 . So clearly, by taking on almost the same amount of risk investing in gold, the investor is much better off investing in the S P 500 Index. Returns from REITs are quite close to the S P 500 Index but would require investors to take on excessive risk. On the other extreme, short-term investment grade bonds are the least risky but also provide the lowest returns.The efficient frontier also considers the benefits of diversification by combining different assets based on the correlation between those assets to achieve an efficient portfolio. Based on our simulation, despite the diversification benefits of adding gold, none of the efficient portfolios on our efficient frontier hold greater than 17  weight in gold. In fact, by adding more asset classes with superior risk-return profiles compared to gold, we can further reduce or even do entirely without gold when building an efficient portfolio.We were unable to include other major asset classes including hedge funds and private equity due to limitations in data availability. However, various  have shown that adding alternative assets can help further improve the efficient frontier.Our discussion thus far has largely focused on the long-term considerations of investing in gold as an asset class. However, even in the short-to-medium term, we expect gold to underperform other major asset classes.We note that gold prices are near all-time highs as a result of two key forces that have been driving capital flows towards safe-haven assets including gold.First is inflation, which drove investors and even  to buy gold in 2022 partly due to fears that inflation would remain stubborn and that the world economy would descend into a hyperinflationary environment. Of course, those fears did not materialize and inflation has since cooled to within reach of the Federal Reserve's target of 2 . However, gold prices did not follow the downward path of inflation. We suspect that this could potentially be increased speculative buying that is simply chasing returns on gold and propping up prices.Secondly, geopolitical risks around the world have clearly escalated recently in addition to a drawn-out war in Ukraine. So it is understandable that some investors may be thinking of hedging geopolitical risks by buying gold. Although we acknowledge that geopolitical risks have escalated meaningfully, there is little reason to believe that the world is inching towards large-scale war. Instead, we are seeing consistent dialogue among major world leaders for restraint and de-escalation. More often than not, geopolitical risks have a limited and fleeting impact on risky assets, and we think this time is no different.Given our view that neither inflation nor geopolitical risks present a serious threat to the global economy, for now, we see little reason to be bullish on gold. Instead, we believe that the rally in gold may be overdone and that we are more likely to see prices fall as the economic and geopolitical outlooks gradually improve.We hope we have provided a comprehensive overview of the major arguments in favour of and against gold as an investment. Overall, we conclude that there is little merit in holding gold in one's portfolio unless one is reasonably confident that the U.S. is headed for some kind of catastrophic crisis in the next few years. The subpar historical performance of gold versus other asset classes should, at the very least, encourage investors to seriously reconsider the purported benefits of investing in gold.

Cheniere Energy Set To Ride The LNG Wave Higher,"In the realm of energy investments, few stories appear as compelling as that of Cheniere Energy . Over the past few years, this liquefied natural gas producer has been there ready to respond toOver the past five years shareholders have been rewarded with a 150  rise in share price, but in the past year the share price has only risen 1.7 . With dividends, share buybacks and impressive earnings reports, let me explain why I believe Cheniere Energy is a strong buy.Founded in 1996,  is a Houston based energy company at the forefront of the global liquefied natural gas  LNG  industry. It has rapidly emerged as a dominant player in the LNG industry beingIt operates two LNG facilities in the United States  Sabine Pass in Louisiana which opened in 2016 and Corpus Christi in Texas. With nine liquefaction units in operation, the company has the potential to produce approximately 45 million tonnes per annum of LNG.Liquefied Natural Gas has become an indispensable part of the global energy landscape, and Cheniere Energy is strategically positioned to ride this wave of soaring demand. The LNG map is truly global, with multiple markets developing new LNG import capacity.In Europe, demanding is growing as they urgently replace gas previously transferred through pipelines from Russia. Here, gas is also seen as a transition fuel as they move away from coal to renewable energy solutions.Across Asia, a parallel narrative unfolds. As the region's economy continues to grow, demand for energy is only increasing. LNG is seen as the emerging fuel of choice to meet this surging appetite for energy, and as such, there has been a substantial uptick in long-term contracts for LNG to meet this demand.The global LNG landscape is on the cusp of a significant expansion. From 2022 to 2024, the number of markets with LNG import capacity is projected to rise from 46 to 55. This expansion entails the development of over 380 megatons of regasification capacity across the world. It is a testament to the growing recognition of LNG's role in achieving energy security, sustainability, and economic growth. The trajectory of LNG demand is undeniably upwards and Cheniere Energy stands ready to meet and drive the surging demand for LNG.Cheniere's strategic assets include the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, with a production capacity exceeding 25 million tons per annum  mtpa . Currently, three trains at this facility are operational, with contracts in place with long-term buyers. Simultaneously, the Sabine Pass Liquefaction Terminal, with a total production capacity of around 30 mtpa, plays a pivotal role in Cheniere's strategy with 6 trains operational and most contracts with long-term buyers have already commenced.To meet the anticipated demand, Cheniere's strategy extends beyond its existing infrastructure. Currently, the company is in the process of expanding the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, which, when complete, will add over 10 mtpa to its production capacity. There are also plans to expand Sabine Pass with up to 20 mtpa additional capacity but this plan is still very much in the early stages.Cheniere Energy delivered an exceptional performance in the  of 2023, exceeding expectations, despite a lower price for LNG. Net income leaped to  1.37 billion from  741 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, but it is important to note that this leap is largely due to a gain of  782 million on the company's derivatives portfolio.Despite the growth in earnings, second quarter revenues did decline compared to the previous year, with a reduction of nearly 50  to  4.1 billion. This was driven by a fall in volumes of 5  attributed in part to maintenance outages and a fall in the US average natural gas price by 63  year-on-year the quarter.Despite the challenges faced during the second quarter, management raised its guidance for the year. Adjusted EBITDA is now forecast to be between  8.3 billion and  8.8 billion, up from  8.2 billion to  8.7 billion. Additionally, distributable free cash flow for the year is estimated to be  5.8 billion to  6.3 billion, compared to the previous range of  5.7 billion to  6.2 billion. These optimistic projections underscore the company's robust financial position and strong outlook.To value Cheniere Energy, I employed an EV EBITDA method for the period to 2027. I used managements midpoints in their forecast for EBITDA this year. We assume Cheniere continues buying back its shares at a rate of 2.5  of shares a year, reducing the share count from 241 million currently to 218 million shares. We assume that debt is paid down at a rate of  1.25 Billion annually with cash amounts remaining constant.Deciding on an EV EBITDA multiple to use was difficult but I settled on a multiple of 11.5, which is just below the company's average multiple over the previous five years.For future revenue I used analyst estimates found on Seeking Alpha and for calculating EBITDA, used an EBITDA margin of 33  which is the average margin over the years 2017 to 2023.Performing the calculations, implies a market cap of  58 billion at the end of 2027. With an estimated 218 million shares outstanding, this corresponds to a price target of  267, an upside of 65.83  from current prices, resulting in a CAGR of 12.7  in 51 months.When investing in Cheniere Energy, I have two main risks I believe it is important to consider.Firstly, the weather. Cheniere Energy's operations remain vulnerable to weather related disruptions, particularly from hurricanes impacting its two facilities on the Gulf Coast. A hurricane could lead to a weather related shut down as it passes or a longer shut down if significant damage occurs. In both scenarios there would be disruption to LNG production and additional costs for the company both from repairing damage and the need to ensure it still meets its contractual commitments.Secondly, the price of LNG. Although the long-term outlook appears to be positive, the price of LNG is extremely volatile, influenced by global energy demand, geopolitical events and supply dynamics. Cheniere Energy is protected somewhat from these price fluctuations by long term contracts that provide revenue stability, however a drop in prices on the spot market could impact its earnings on any sales to the spot market. It could also influence the prices it charges for long term contracts as they come up for renewal.Cheniere Energy stands at the forefront of the LNG industry with demand only set to grow. The company's extensive portfolio of long-term contracts provides a secure revenue stream, laying the groundwork for continued expansion and profitability.Cheniere's commitment to meeting growing demand is evident through its ongoing expansion projects and infrastructure investments. This proactive approach ensures the company's readiness to serve the escalating global need for LNG.In addition to its strong outlook, Cheniere boasts attractive earnings and robust free cash flow, making it an enticing investment opportunity. As the world's energy landscape evolves, Cheniere Energy is well-poised to play a pivotal role, making it a strong buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Earnings Will Eventually Win Out Despite Geopolitical Risks And Rising Interest Rates,"It's currently hard to see the market through a lens that is not tainted by geopolitical risks. Conflict is noisy, it dominates the headlines, and it creates a mood of fear in risk assets like stocks. At the same time, it appears thatBetween the issuance of new debt and the trimming of Treasuries on the Fed s balance sheet, we still have an imbalance of too much supply coming to market that's outstripping demand and driving interest rates higher. Between the combination of rising interest rates  when they should be falling  and the fog of war, we have had a double-whammy against the stock market for theAs you can see from the chart below, the Fed has been actively trimming its balance sheet since early 2022. The holdings ballooned during COVID-19, and they still have a lot to trim.In addition to the trimming of the balance sheet, as illustrated in the chart below, see the big spike of issuance in new debt in August of 2023. This is needed to cover the excessive spending being made by our government. This big spike in issuance coincides with the recent run higher in interest rates and the correction in the market.So, it's easy to see that between the fog of war and the big spike in interest rates, the current favorable earnings outlook for the market is hard to see. It's still my firm belief that as the noise of war quiets down and the big run higher in interest rates moderates, the market will again return to earnings as its main focus.Despite the conflict in Israel and the recent spike in interest rates, as you can see from the chart below, the earnings picture for the market has not changed at all. We're still expecting record earnings this year  2023 , next year  2024 , and the year after that  2025 .These earnings estimates are subject to change going forward, but the market will eventually return its focus on these earnings projections despite all the other  that is out there right now.Here's a look at the impact that the war and the sudden spike in interest rates have had on the S P 500. It has halted the rally that we have had in 2023 for the time being. I still believe strongly, however, that the market will eventually focus on earnings once again. This will probably happen sooner, rather than later.Here's a look at the impact that this  double whammy  has had on the Nasdaq. Its torrid run in 2023 has been halted for now, but the index is still up 24.4  year-to-date, however.Here's a current look  below  at this recent big spike in the interest rate of the 10-year Treasury. How much higher can they go  If they do not halt here at a major round number of 5.0 , then the next level of resistance is at 5.25  as you will see in the next chart.Believe it or not, rates were up a whopping 29 basis points last week after moderating during the prior week. No wonder the market was so bad last week. Is 5.25  the next stop, or will we hold 5.0Now, let s turn our focus to earnings. Even more importantly, future earnings expectations.With Q3 2023 earnings now being reported and just nine weeks left until year-end, we're expecting a record  222 per share in S P 500 earnings this year. Our estimates are currently at a record  248 per share next year, and  275 for 2025. The 2025 number is the one that the market is now looking ahead to.Those earnings estimates  2025  probably deserve an 18X multiple in this current interest rate environment. That gives us a 12-month target price of just under 5,000 or the S P 500. This currently represents just over 16  upside potential over the next twelve months. This is now an above-average risk-to-reward ratio.What are the risks to our current target priceInterest rates continuing to rise above 5  or more would continue to cause that 18X multiple to shrink into the 16-17X range.An expansion of the current conflict in Israel that would include more countries would also have a big negative impact on the market.Shrinkage in earnings expectation going forward. This could be caused by a recession, continued inflation, or a slowdown in the global and domestic economy.We remain bullish on the overall market and we continue to favor U.S. large-cap growth stocks.

GGN: Reasonable Discount Available On This High-Yielding CEF Makes It Appealing,"During my last  almost a year back, I said that a series of geopolitical events such as unfavorable weather, Covid-19 pandemic-related disruptions, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine had resulted in a shortageThus, I was hopeful about a prosperous year for gold and natural resources-based funds like  . A year later, I want to reassess the growth prospect of this basic materials   energy fund.GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust is a closed ended equity mutual fund launched by GAMCO Investors, Inc. The fund is managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC. It invests in stocks of companies principally engaged in extracting and supplying gold and natural resources. In addition to investing in common equities, GGN implements covered call strategy, through which GGN writes  sells  call options and earns a premium on it. This enables GGN to offer strong pay-outs. Currently, GGN s short position in call options is a little over  of its total portfolio, while the long position in equities stands at almost 85 percent. 51 percent of such long positions were in overseas equity markets. Cash component is in excess of 17 percent of the entire fund.The fund benchmarks the performance of its portfolio against the Philadelphia Gold   Silver Index, Barclays Government Credit Bond Index, CBOE S P 500 Buy Write Index and Energy Select Sector Index. GGN has an asset under management of  630 million and a high expense ratio of 1.31 percent. This high expense ratio is a result of an excessively high  of 126 percent. Turnover ratio is high because GGN writes call options on a significant portion of its portfolio. This is an unusual fund, and may seem quite risky to certain investors. But it has been able to deliver strong annual average total return despite pandemic, high interest rate, and geo-political challenges arising out of Russia s invasion of Ukraine. Since 2019, the fund s average  was almost 14 percent CAGR, which is exceptionally high.During my last coverage, I also found that GGN's portfolio had a high cash component, which I believed would be beneficial for this fund, as GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust would be able to take advantage of better values of various stocks. This high cash phenomenon became a trend among the fund operators at that point, as the inflation stood high and there was a prospect of economic recession. As GGN was not undervalued one year back, I was skeptical about an enormous price growth  like what was broadly witnessed in the case of commodity and energy funds .However, its double-digit yields and an extremely low price of  3.66 were good enough reasons for recommending this stock to income-seeking investors. I also found such a strong yield to be sustainable despite there being a recession looming over the U.S. market. The fund didn t disappoint me as it generated a trailing-12-month  of 9.63 percent, and its price went up by 6.75 percent thus resulting in a total return of almost . This is almost 70 percent higher than the total return of S P 500, which stood at little over 10 percent. Moreover, GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust offers monthly pay-outs on a consistent basis. The fund was formed during June 2005, and it has been paying a  dividend since then.A year back, GGN had a reported turnover of 96 percent, and now it has gone up to 126 percent. However, as discussed earlier, that happened primarily due to trading on call options. One year ago, 57 percent of its equity investments were in basic materials, that included gold, and the remaining 43 percent were in stocks from the energy sector. I expected most of the basic material stocks to generate strong positive returns, and thus enable GGN to sustain a double-digit yield. These stocks didn t disappoint me as all those stocks generated positive price growth during the past twelve months. For obvious reasons, the fund managers of GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust increased their allocation in basic material stocks to 62 percent.A year earlier, GGN s top 60 percent portfolio included 12 mining companies like Newmont Corporation , Franco-Nevada Corp , Barrick Gold Corp , etc. During the past twelve months, barring NEM and BTG, all other stocks generated positive price growth and half of them delivered double-digit price growth. The fund has kept all these stocks in its portfolio and further added stocks of SSR Mining Inc and a few others. This signifies this fund s increased emphasis on gold and basic material stocks.A year ago, GGN also invested significantly in most renowned energy stocks such as Chevron Corporation, Exxon Mobil Corp, and others. Half of those stocks  COP, BP, HAL, EOG, PXD and KMI  no longer count among the top 60 percent of GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust. As expected, most of the energy stocks failed to attain strong price growth this year, due to supply chain bottlenecks and availability of discounted Russian energy supplies. Only MPC, SLB and SHEL were able to record double-digit price rise during 2023. However, the price growth of most energy stocks is still on the positive side.GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust invests in stocks of companies principally engaged in extracting and supplying gold, basic metals and energy resources. In addition to equity investments, GGN earns premium on writing call options on such equities. This enables this fund to offer strong payouts. It generated a close to double-digit trailing-12-month yield and a total return of almost 17.5 percent. This is almost 1.7 times of total return of S P 500.The fund is also available at a decent discount to its net asset value. GGN has delivered market-beating returns since the Covid-19 pandemic has jeopardized the overall market. Thus, under current market conditions, GGN becomes a highly lucrative option especially for income-seeking investors.One year ago, positive impacts of increasing commodity prices were already reflected in price growth for energy and commodity stocks. However, gold mining and basic metal companies were yet to enjoy the fruits. Within the past one year, the price of basic metal stocks went up, while energy stocks failed to replicate their market-beating returns. One year later, I can observe that GGN has increased its allocation to stocks of gold mining and basic metal companies, and reduced its allocation in energy stocks. A number of energy stocks among its top 60 percent investments has been halved, while the number of gold and basic metal stocks have increased by 50 percent. This suggests that the asset managers have been able to rightly assess the market sentiments. All these factors makes me further hopeful regarding making fresh investments in GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources   Income Trust.Thanks for reading.

Why Petrobras Is A Great Alternative To Other Oil Majors,"Petrobras, officially known as   , is a  90-billion market cap Brazilian oil and gas company with operations both domestically and internationally. Petrobras is involved in various aspects of the energy industry, including exploration, production, refining, transportation, marketing, andIt is one of the world's  oil producers and one of the top 5 exporters of crude oil. Petrobras plays a dominant role in the Brazilian energy market,  of the country's oil and gas production. The firm is divided into  Exploration and Production, Refining, Transportation and Marketing, and Gas and Power  Corporate excluded . Petrobras released its Q2 FY2023 financial results, and theyIn addition, Petrobras achieved a net profit of  5.8 billion and generated an FCF of  6.7 billion. The company's distribution of dividends totaling  6.2 billion amid a comfortable OCF of  9.6 billion underscores PBR's financial strength, in my view.Operationally, Petrobras reported growth in production, especially in the pre-salt region, which now accounts for 78  of their overall production. Key projects like the FPSO Almirante Barroso and the acquisition of new exploration blocks highlight their determination to expand production capacity. In downstream activities, Petrobras showcased its refinery modernization efforts, including revamping projects, carbon footprint reduction initiatives, and technological innovations.On October 2nd, 2023, we found out that Petrobras  by Brazil's top environmental agency, Ibama, to conduct research in the Potiguar basin, part of the Equatorial Margin offshore region in Brazil's Northeast. This comes after months of negotiations and setbacks. Petrobras now plans to begin drilling in the area next month to assess the economic viability and extent of oil discoveries made in 2013 at the Pitu well. is a promising oil exploration opportunity in Brazil, potentially holding reserves similar to those in Guyana, where Exxon Mobil  is developing multibillion-barrel discoveries. Ibama  Petrobras from drilling in the Foz do Amazonas basin due to environmental concerns, leading to this alternative exploration plan.Petrobras now plans to drill 16 exploratory wells between 2023-2027 with an estimated investment of 15 billion reais  3 billion dollars  in sedimentary basins such as Foz do Amazonas, Pará-Maranhão, Barreirinhas, and Potiguar.In addition, PBR has other projects that will be put into operation very soonPerhaps the only thing that has kept PBR stock from impressive growth in recent months - besides the falling oil price - is geopolitics. But in my opinion, the fears surrounding Petrobras related to the election of Brazilian President Lula now appear to be exaggerated. Petrobras  nationalized or forced to cut dividends entirely. Since Lula's presidency began, there has been less aggressive intervention in the company's affairs than many people thought. The change in dividend policy, reducing the distribution to 45  of FCF, as we may see now, does not significantly impact Petrobras's dividend attractiveness, in my view, especially when compared to other international oil and gas majors.In late September, Goldman Sachs analysts slightly improved Brazil's real GDP growth expectations  proprietary source  for FY2023 due to a higher-than-expected Q2 2023 print, with a projection of 2.92 . Expectations for FY2024 GDP growth stand at 1.50 . So in general, the macro situation in Brazil looks good - it should create a favorable background for the future growth of the Brazilian stock market, where PBR should be one of the market leaders.On the global macro front, taking into account recent events in Israel, another group of Goldman Sachs analysts sees two potential impacts that could affect global oil supplies over time  proprietary source, paraphrased by the authorThe issue of high oil prices in the world market is a major concern for inflation expectations, but not for energy companies like PBR - recent events are clearly bullish for the company.Thanks to the still current rumors of a possible nationalization of the company, as well as a number of other risks related to the region in which it operates, Petrobras is, in my opinion, one of the most favorable alternatives to Western oil and gas companies such as Exxon or Chevron . PBR currently trades at 2.2 times next year's EV EBITDA, 43  less than the peer group averageMoreover, Petrobras' return on capital employed  ROCE  and EBITDA margin  TTM  are significantly better than those of the peer groupOf course, my thesis is full of different risks that I may underestimate  but you shouldn't . Many investors have concerns including neglected cost management, unclear pricing policies, and potentially unprofitable investments  recall the most recent news of more drillings anticipated for the next few years . Petrobras is considering offshore wind, which is fraught with regulatory and financial uncertainties, and critics  that the company should focus on its core activities. The new dividend policy could also lead to dividend cuts, which are currently priced in and explain the company's cheap valuation levels.However, taking into account recent events  both geopolitical and microeconomic , I believe that the PBR stock today has more upside potential than downside risks. Of course, anything can happen - no one is immune to equity market risk, certainly not especially so in an emerging market. But when an asset is trading so cheaply and its valuation is based in part on years of fears that still haven't been borne out, that's food for thought for me personally. And unlike Chinese stocks, the Brazilian stock market, oddly enough, seems more understandable to me.That's why I rate PBR stock as a  Buy  this time around.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

EFA Vs. HEFA: Hedging International Exposure Still Working,"I just doubled the assets in my traditional IRA by transferring funds from my Pre-tax 401k plan. With funds to invest and my only international exposure in that account being the 33  allocation the With the additional risk an investor takes on when investing outside their home country, as EFA would do for any investor in different increments, is you take on currency risk. For USD-based investors, owning the   instead of the EFA ETF helps eliminate that risk. When the USDI use the term risk in the sense that there is an extra variable to consider as hedging should cut both ways. That said, results since 2014 clearly show that owning HEFA was the better choice.This article builds on and updates this same comparison I did last winter . I chose to be more focused this time so reading the prior article next is suggested.The only difference with the indices used by these two ETFs is one is USD-hedged, the other is not. MSCI provides this description and facts on the Index.Source  Currently, the index includes the following 21 countries  notice EM ones are excluded.As of the end of July, the Index sector allocations and top country weights were, and these are reflected in both ETFs reviewed.Seeking Alpha describes this ETF asEFA has  9.4b in AUM and has 33bps in fees. The TTM Yield is 2.2 .Since the ETF holds the Index in the same allocations, I chose not to repeat what is shown in the above pie charts  only include additional details. The Index Country allocations shown above does not reveal the currency risk EFA holders have. Since all currencies do not move the same against the USD, this information could be important to some investors.The EURO and Japanese Yen account for over half the currency exposure, with the British Pound and Swiss Franc accounting for another 26 . The USD represents both cash and ADR holdings.With over 800 positions, the Top 20 stocks still account for 23  of the portfolio. The 400 smallest positions come in at 14  of the weight, little but still somewhat meaningful.Seeking Alpha Quant grades EFA's distribution history as a  C . The EFA ETF shows no pattern of growing its distributions over the past decade. With a yield near 2 , this might not be a concern as income-needing investors would look elsewhere for that goal.Seeking Alpha describes this ETF asHEFA has  3.5b in AUM and the fees are 35bps, only two more than EFA. The large year-end payout makes the current TTM Yield meaningless. A more typical yield is between 2-4 . While it should have payouts close to EFA, plus minus hedging income, we see later that is not always the case.With the goal to hedge the MSCI EFA Index, the only equity holding HEFA has is owning the other ETF reviewed here  that accounts for 98  of the portfolio weight. All the other assets are designed to provide for the hedging strategy, which has 2 positions for each of these currencies.When you compare the hedging weights to the currency weights shown for EFA, they are not 100  aligned. I assume there are reasons for that that a hedging expert could explain. HEFA also has several futures contracts.I will compare the two payout levels later, but one difference is HEFA has a history of making year-end  mostly  additional payments sourced from ST   LT Capital Gains, as was the case last year. Since the only real difference is the hedging strategy, these must come from those profits.Since HEFA owns the EFA ETF, except for hedging-generated income, I would have thought the regular payouts would match up well  they do not. I lined up the payments dates as best I could to ease the comparisons.Picking a yield for the HEFA is tough as the TTM yield, thanks to the large CG payment, is shown as 21  not realistic going forward. iShares lists the SEC yield for HEFA as 1.8  versus 2.1  for the EFA ETF. Not counting 2022, HEFA's income distributions were more each year than for EFA, but not by enough to make a real difference or reason to own HEFA over EFA.The next chart includes income and CAGR results for each year back to 2014 when HEFA started. The last column is an index that measures the USD against a basket of other currencies.Except for 2021, as expected, owning HEFA benefited investors when the USD was strong against foreign currencies  EFA in years with a weak USD.First, I will show the returns only since the review last February.Over the past six months, the better performer has changed several times, with HEFA currently ahead.Since I mentioned that I might sell my ACWI for one of these ETFs, I included that ETF in the next chart and data points.As indicated above, hedging has been a positive for international investors. What was somewhat of a surprise was HEFA outperforming ACWI with its large US holdings. Translation  Take away the currency effect and international stocks are performing as well as their US counterparts. Risk wise, as measured by Beta, HEFA is .70  EFA .84, and ACWI .91, which results in HEFA having the best Sharpe and Sortino ratios among these ETFs.With most major companies drawing revenue across the globe, the concept of assigning a stock to a country based on incorporation or headquarters location  standard practice  seems archaic. This can be seen in the fact that international stocks have a closer correlation to US stocks over the past 20 years than over the past 50 years. That said, stocks like those in the MSCI EAFE Index still provide some diversification benefit as they are still below a 90  correlation rate. That might be enough justification to have an international allocation despite their underperformance compared to US stocks. Hedging has greatly reduced that difference as shown above.The above is the past  as for deciding between EFA and HEFA now, the question becomes,  Where is the USD heading . The next chart shows some history.Recently, the USD reached levels last seen over Y2K concerns, and has been trending downward recently. Various experts listed factors that influence the direction of the USD, those beingThis  contains what various expects are predicting for several major currencies.The easy part is the HEFA ETF deserves a Buy rating and EFA a Sell rating for investors determining where to hold their international equity allocation. It also appears that a 60 40, US INTL ETF like ACWI allows for some international exposure without the need to hedge.My international exposure is 14  of my equity allocation. I already own two hedged international ETFs that have focused strategies, not more widespread ones like HEFA, and they account for 37  of that exposure. One of those was reviewed here  . My next step is to compare HEFA against IHDG or other diverse hedged ETFs to see which I might want to switch my ACWI ETF into or maybe use unallocated cash. Once I decided, I will submit an article on the process and decision I made.Almost a decade of history indicates hedging definitely works as expected and across different equity groupings or factor strategies. Despite talk concern that the USD will lose its status as the world s reserve currency, neither the Euro or Chinese Yuan seemed poised to replace it. That gives the USD special demand no other currency has.For more thoughts on the USD, see Seeking Alpha articles about the I  m proud to have asked to be one of the original Seeking Alpha Contributors to the 11 21 launch of the Hoya Capital Income Builder Market Place.This is how HCIB sees its place in the investment universeWhether your focus is high yield or dividend growth, we ve got you covered with high-quality, actionable investment research and an all-encompassing suite of tools and models to help build portfolios that fit your unique investment objectives.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note, this event is being recorded.At this time, I would now like to turn the floor over to Jordan Darrow, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Thank you, operator, and welcome to the Data I O Corporation third quarter 2023 financial results conference call. With me today are the company s President and CEO, Anthony Ambrose, and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Ng.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that statements made in this conference call concerning future revenues, results from operations, financial position, markets, economic conditions, supply chain expectations, estimated impact of tax and other regulatory reform, product releases, new industry partnerships and any other statements that may be construed as a prediction of future performance or events are forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.These factors include uncertainties as to the impact from global and geopolitical events, international trade regulations, order levels for the company, and the activity level of the automotive and semiconductor industry overall, ability to record revenues based on the timing of product deliveries and installations, market acceptance of new products, changes in economic conditions and market demand, part shortages, pricing and other activities by competitors and other risks, including those described from time-to-timeThe accuracy and completeness of forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Data I O is under no duty to update anyAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Anthony Ambrose, President and CEO of Data I O.Thank you very much, Jordan. I'd begin my formal remarks by addressing our 2023 third quarter financial and operational performance and then I ll turn it over to Gerry Ng for a more detailed look at our numbers.We have a strong year-over-year revenue growth of 25  through the first three quarters of the year and more recent challenging business conditions in Q3. As I mentioned in the release, the third quarter was mixed. We won some very exciting deals and saw strength in adapter bookings, but system bookings were soft as customers deferred capital purchasing decisions into the fourth quarter.We also saw customers move delivery dates from Q3 to early Q4, which we do not normally see. For whatever reason, whether it be the strike in North America, interest rates, people coming back for vacation, it appeared that customers wanted to take another look at their capital purchase decisions and did so by pushing from September into Q4.Now, what's interesting is Q4 is starting out extremely well as we booked five systems already in October. Several of these systems originally were planned for Q3 bookings actually had the bookings occur in October.I was also happy this morning to see the news that Ford and UAW have reached a tentative agreement likely ending their strike. This will remove some uncertainty in North American market.When we look at Q4, given all the puts and takes, we have a strong sales funnel that supports a much stronger bookings than we saw in Q3 and operations that support stronger revenue than we saw in Q3, provided we get the orders in time to ship this year.Despite the short-term gyrations, the driving forces and long-term growth thesis for Data I O remain intact. Advanced semiconductors and microcontrollers are finding their way into more products and impacting virtually every business in a measurable ways. Programming is becoming more complex and the amount of code is continuously increasing. Our plan is to grow revenues in growing markets, including automotive and industrial, continue to drive more revenue from consumables, software, and service  and deliver 40  operating leverage on that revenue growth.Automotive represented about 63  of the bookings in the third quarter, consistent with our year-to-date numbers. Within automotive, we continue to see strength in EVs globally. And we like EVs, not just because they're electric vehicles, but because the platforms are newer and they tend to have more electronics per car as they have comprehensive IVI, ADAS, and other features.With this content and EVs is estimated to be about two to three times that of semiconductor content and other vehicles, and the programming requirements continue to require -- continue to grow in these EVs.Regionally, we continue to see strength in North America. We have seen softness in EMEA. China is recovering from a soft first half, recovering slowly and steadily, which we believe will continue based on our channel checks.In the third quarter, we added four new customers, which now brings us to 19 for the first nine months of the year compared to 20 of all last year and the prior year.Within those four new wins, we had two new EV factories internationally. And one of the new customers in the third quarter represents a major win for us on SentriX. We're excited to move further into expanding the SentriX market by winning our first major solar energy customer on our SentriX security deployment platform.This continues to make progress for SentriX as a leading technology platform, now including AI, EV, data center utilities, industrial, and now solar markets.That's a nice bridge here as we go from solar to sustainability and ESG. Green Power, ESG and climate disclosures are becoming increasingly important for public companies like Data I O.For us, we see three basic requirements for our environmental strategies. First, as a leading supplier to the automotive industry, we must comply with purchasing requirements set forth by our largest customers. Many of our large EMEA-based Tier 1 automotive customers and many industrial customers have put forth their own ESG plans, calling for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from their suppliers.Second, as a public reporting company, we must comply with appropriate rules and regulations set forth by the SEC and NASDAQ. There are new disclosures required for companies starting next year. As a smaller reporting company, these will become effective for us starting next year and continue to increase in disclosure requirements over the next several years.And finally, as a good corporate citizen, we need to look at smart ways to be more environmentally friendly, consistent with the good use of cash.The importance of ESG and how it impacts our business operations will be the first subject in our next fireside chat series. The session will be entitled sustainability strategies for the auto industry and will be released and available for viewing later this month.In that session, you'll hear how we've made outstanding progress in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions well ahead of regulatory and supply chain requirements and are in the programming industry and sustainability.In the months that follow, we plan to release five additional fireside chat sessions covering global perspectives on critical topics and emerging market trends from automotive to semiconductor growth opportunities.In addition to the fireside chats, we've expanded our investor communications content and channels with new technology discussions on LinkedIn and we also recently joined the Weebo Corporate Connect Service platform to enhance our communications with tech-savvy retail investors. Weebo will provide us direct exposure to the second largest app-based investment and trading platform.As you can tell, we're excited for the future growth of Data I O and look forward to sharing our progress in perspective with you and also with these new channels. This will include some fresh ideas from Jerry that goes well beyond our operational spending discipline that he demonstrated in the third quarter. He's focused on our ability to drive margins, improve cash flow and invest in future growth.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry for a little bit more detail on the numbers. JerryThank you, Anthony and good day to everyone. I look forward to my first and future earnings update have been taken over as CFO on August 16. I will start with the balance sheet and then move to the income statement.My commentary today will focus on specific points of interest and allow you to review the earnings release for a more detailed understanding of our Q3 financials.Data I O's financial condition remains strong at the end of Q3 was  11.9 million in cash, up  357,000 from  11.5 million at the beginning of the year. Cash and working capital at  18 million had a comparable increase of  520,000 and from  17.6 million at the beginning of the year. Receivables at  4.9 million increased  175,000 from the previous quarter.Day sales outstanding, or DSO, was at 39 days at the end of Q3. Past due receivable balances greater than 30 days remain very low at less than  30,000 on September 30th. Payables at  1.1 million decreased by  468,000 from the previous quarter.Moving on to inventory. We finished at  6.4 million, a decline of  476,000 from the previous quarter. Inventory had been intentionally elevated in 2020 to address potential shortage risk. Earlier this year, we went to a more neutral supply chain strategy, improving supply chain conditions, disposition a material for end-of-life products and our lean operational initiatives contributed to our overall reduction. Optimizing inventory levels remain a top priority, while balancing anticipated customer demands going forward.Moving to the income statement. Revenue at  6.6 million declined  651,000 from the prior year on lower bookings performance in the current quarter and strong shipment recovery in Q3 of the prior year due to the supply chain disruption that occurred in the first half of the prior year.Revenue through the first months of this year was  21.2 million, up  4.2 million or a 25  increase from the prior period. Our Q3 ending backlog was  2.5 million, down from  3.8 million from the previous quarter.As Anthony indicated, automotive electronics continues to be our primary addressable market at 63  of year-to-date bookings. Gross margin at 54  in Q3 was down from 59  in Q2, due primarily to lower sales volume, lower inventory levels, and related absorption of relatively fixed cost for our manufacturing and service operations. Good news is direct material and other variable costs declined in line with revenue change.Operational expenses at  3.6 million increased 5  from the prior year, with R D representing the majority of the increase, while G A remained relatively flat.Rate strides were made in reducing our Q3 costs with a decline of  626,000 from the prior quarter. A critical review of spending was performed, non-critical cost reduced or eliminated, and of course, operational efficiencies increase.Excluding costs related to sales volume changes, we expect to maintain this strong operational discipline in Q4 and 2024. Currency transaction impact was minimal in Q3 was  15,000 loss compared to a  307,000 gain in the prior year from, of course, a strengthening dollar.Net loss of  53,000 in Q3 compared to a net income of  847,000 for Q3 of 2022 was due largely to the change in revenue and lower FX gain from the prior year. Net income remains positive, however, at  342,000 through nine months compared to a net loss of  1.6 million for the similar period in 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was  400,000 in Q3 and increased to  1.8 million through nine months of this year. This represents a year-over-year improvement of  1.3 million. Overall, we remain very strong financially with no debt and in a good position to navigate market dynamics.We have return to profitability on a consolidated basis, but we will be able to take advantage of our NOLs, which stood at  15 million on September 30th. I am excited to be part of the Data I O team and look forward to working and partnering with Anthony and our global team to continue improving our operational and financial performance.This concludes my remarks for the third quarter of 2023. Operator, would you please start the Q A processLadies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator InstructionsOur first question today comes from Kevin Garrigan from WestPark Capital. Please go ahead with your question.Yes. Hey good afterbody and thanks for letting me ask a question. On the EV front, and congrats on the new EV factory customers, not saying that you'll supply every factory out there, but is it a safe assumption that you'd supply kind of one system per factory  Or is there a possibility that multiple factories would use one system like a programming center or something like thatYes. So, Kevin, good to hear from you. In general, I would say, on average, we supply more than one system per factory in the automotive space. And that's just based on an analysis. I mean, it ranges from -- we have a number of customers with one factory or one system per factory. I've been in places that have 10 systems in a factory. So, the average is certainly going to be more than one.For us, we see the growth in automotive coming from -- again, the focus on new factory acquisition. As customers expand in certain areas of the world, we want to be their choice as they put programming capacity in place in those new factories. We think that's a good predictor of what their future demand will be in that factory. And then, of course, people that have been with us for years are placing additional capacity orders as again, they have more and more electronics going into their cars, and they need to add capacity. So, it's really a combination of both.Okay. Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then are you getting a lot of prior customers that already have a PSV system that are asking to add SentriX capabilitiesThe customers -- the short answer there is most of our SentriX demand today continues to come from people that have the system already. That includes our programming center partners and a handful of nonprogramming center customers.Okay, perfect. And then just one last quick question. So, looking at your customer additions, you had started out the year adding 10 customers in Q1, and then that number has kind of come down as we've gone through the year, but you're still on pace to surpass your 2022 customer additions. Are -- what is kind of keeping some potential customers on the sidelineI think the numbers in any quarter are going to have some lumpiness to it, that's the nature of our business. That's why we give you the data on the quarter and then also try and provide some context with the year-to-date numbers as well.For us in Q3, we probably would have had more new customers if people have bought more systems. As I mentioned, it seemed like people just didn't want to place any orders towards the end of the quarter. And then once the quarter flipped over, it's like the spigot turned back on.I don't know whether they didn't want to have it on their books. I don't know whether it was the uncertainty created by the factors I described earlier, strikes, other stuff as well, interest rates. But at the end of the day, we believe that there'll be more capacity demand because there's more silicon going into cars and it needs to get programmed. It's not really any more complicated than that.Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.Thanks, Kevin.Our next question comes from David Marsh from Singular Research. Please go ahead with your question.Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I'm just trying to -- Anthony, I'm just trying to read the tea leaves here a little bit on your comments on China. It sounds like there is some sort of recovery taking place, but it doesn't sound like it's a robust and fast taste recovery. I was just hoping that you could provide us a little bit more granularity there  And just help us understand--David, I think tea leaves is probably an appropriate metaphor for the future forecasting there. I think you nailed it. That's exactly what I'm trying to say. We've had continuous improvement throughout the year, but it's at a level of business that's lower than last year. We still haven't gotten to that level. I think it will -- you're going to continue to see more recovery there. And consistent with the fact that China produces and consumes an awful lot of cars and 30  of them are EVs.Right, right. That's -- yes, that's helpful. I guess it's just it'd be really it'd be really helpful to get a better sense of what that pace is going to look like going forward. But I guess it's really very difficult to predict.Yes, I think there's a lot of third-party information there. I mean you can sort of pick the forecast you want. A lot of people are nervous about the property market in China. A lot of people are nervous about are people continuing to still build there. We just had a trade show there, very well attended, probably the best attendance in three or four years. And as I said, I would expect a continuous steady improvement. I don't think you're going to get a massive sudden uptick, but I think it will be better as we go forward.Got it. Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as my follow-up, I guess one of the things that took me be a bit by surprise, and I think you addressed it a little bit, but I just kind of wanted to pull the thread on it. Your backlog is down from 3.8  at the end of Q2 to 2.5  at the end of Q3, but based on your commentary, it actually sounds like bookings have picked up as we've entered the new quarter. So, just with all of that information, I mean, I'm reading into your commentary that Q4 could be sequentially better, but I just was wondering if you might just help us with the information that you have today just kind of get a better understanding around that.Yes, I think the tough thing for us is we don't give the quarterly guidance. But as I indicated in my remarks, I certainly think the bookings will be better Q4 and Q3 and the revenue, given our sales funnel that we still have in the funnel that have not yet booked, we have an opportunity to have a strong revenue quarter as well, provided the timing is such that we can book and ship some of those systems. So, the funnel looks good. We just have to deliver on it and we're off to a good start.Great. That's helpful. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.Thanks a lot Dave.Our next question comes from David Kanen from Kanen Wealth Management. Please go ahead with your question.Hi thanks for taking my questions. I've got a few. So, if it's okay to bend the rules a little bit, I'd appreciate that. The first one is in regards to -- you said five system orders so far in the quarter. What are ASPs on systemsNot going to get into that Dave. They're consistent and typical with prior quarters, nothing strange either way.Okay. And for the quarter, what were adapter salesThe exact number we'll put in the Q, but I know the things were up pretty well quarter-on-quarter. Jerry, do we have the exact adapter numbers  Jerry will take a look at that and we'll let you know. What's the next questionOkay. On operating expenses, we're up year-over-year. Revenues are down year-over-year. Gross margins are down. It seems like an unsustainable posture going forward. Can you talk about opportunities to trim costs and to be more efficient so that when we do report good revenues, we can get some leverage to the bottom-line and if possible, quantify that  I'm assuming this is in the works. But if not, I would be quite disappointed.I think Jerry has clearly got some ideas on spending and he started implementing those in Q3. I'll let him talk about that in a moment. But I just want to clarify some things. The revenue is actually up 25  year-over-year through the first nine months.So, yes, spending is up. Frankly, spending is up more than we would like it to be up. And the focus on spending control is something that Jerry is clearly digging into and has already got that started in Q3. But the whole concept is we want to -- we're delivering on our operating leverage, we're about 40 , pretty close to that, but we clearly want to do better. And I think your comments are how can we continue to get more efficient and deliver even better operating leverage to the bottom-line, that will be better.So, I think, Jerry, what was our revenue on the adapters in Q31.8 million.1.8 million.Okay. And then last question. This seems like inconsequential item, but it makes me question the seriousness and stewardship that you're approaching the business at the current time. Interest income for the quarter was  41,000. Now, this may seem trivial, but what it tells me if I annualize that, on average, you're getting about 1.4 , a three-month T-bill is at 5.3 , a six-month bills is at almost 5.6 . You can get a multitude of money markets paying 5.25 . Why is thatAnd going forward, is that something you're going to pay attention to  Because on an annualized basis, we're talking about giving away according to my math, like  400,000, am I wrong  If so, please correct me, but if you can give an explanation on what we're doing going forward.Yes, David, I can highlight that. As you know we do have a fairly strong cash position, however, we do have option operational needs, both in the US, in our Shanghai manufacturing facility, and in Germany.We do have a very active method of deploying unneeded cash to maximize the interest earnings. But it's not clearly the case where we deploy everything 100 . We are obviously looking at that and balancing operational needs as well as the earnings opportunity.So, Jerry, we're clearly looking at that, but also my understanding is that if you look outside the US, the interest rates available on cash deposits may not be the same as the current high rates that we enjoy in the US.Correct.So, on a blended basis, we probably can't get 5 . But I think to Dave's point, we're certainly looking at it and--Yes. And we are currently using nightly sweeps. We are also deploying some of our money into short-term investments. So, we are obviously looking at it and on continuing to maximize the opportunity where we can.How much of the  11.9 million is in the USApproximately half.Yes. So, even on that, we're not maximizing it. I mean, you can put your money in the money market and get 5.25 . I'm sure it's better than 1.4  in Europe and in China  I mean across the globe, there have been numerous interest rate hikes. So, just pointing it out, it would make me feel better if you guys were maximizing that and also taking a look at every line item on the expense sheet.Understood Dave. Thanks.Thank you.Our next question comes from Chris -- Actually, our next question comes from Michael Cooper. Please go ahead with your question.Good afternoon. Anthony, can you talk a little bit more about the SentriX funnel. I've been watching the sales progression of SentriX over the past few years as you improve the product and then learned about the market a little bit more. And I think you've changed where you're going into the market, maybe more on the design side of things.But I'm still -- each quarter comes and goes, and I'm waiting for a nice big uptick in revenue from SentriX , and I'm not exactly seeing it. But what I'm hoping is that in the background, you guys are very active maybe and have been over the last three or four quarters on the design side and maybe that is progressing through the funnel. I know that takes some time. But can you give us some metrics around that kind of dynamic so that we can understand how the market opportunity on SentriX is performingSure. I'll start, Michael, by saying we don't break out SentriX separately. But in my comments, our pay-per-use revenue this year from units running through machines that are under that type of contract is up pretty close to 100  year-over-year. So, that's a good indicator on the revenue side.On the designing side, I didn't give you a size estimate of the win here in the solar market, but it's a pretty hefty win. Channel partner believes it's mid-six digits, okay, which would be a very, very nice volume run rate for us on the SentriX platform.Having said that, we continue to refine our marketing to better tailor our message and focus and we have customers that we're engaged with now on SentriX opportunities in automotive, industrial, and other markets. The key thing for us is to find the right person in the company to talk to about SentriX.And we've learned over the years that person is not the person we usually talk to for data programming. And so part of the problem and the strategy is, okay, if we have these relationships, how do we use them to find the right people in the company and talk about SentriX. And that's what we're doing on the marketing side.Okay. Excellent. Thank you. And that  0.5 million potential number on your solar contract is very encouraging.Yes, I guess a mid-six digits.Sure. Understood.And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.Well, operator, thank you very much. I'd like to thank everyone who joined the call and ask questions today. We look forward to sharing the developments with you as we go through Q4, and we'll be at the Productronica trade show in Germany in November in Munich.We also have an Investor Summit Group's Virtual Conference and the Singular Research Best of the Uncovered Conference in San Francisco in December and we'd love to see you there. If you have any questions on that, please send a note to Jordan Darrow.With that, I'd like to conclude today's call. Thank you very much.Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-26T22:40:03.000-04:00
Israel-Hamas War Brings Geopolitical Risks To The Forefront,"When I wrote my commentary last week, we were breathing a sigh of relief because the United States was able to avoid a government shutdown. But today, the near-shutdown is far in the rearview mirror - the Israel-Hamas War has shocked the worldOver the weekend, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing civilians and taking hostages, in what seems to be a reaction to the Israel-Saudi peace plan that is in the works. Israel has declared war and appears to be preparing for a wide-scale invasion of Gaza. Part of the Israel-Saudi peace deal was a pre-condition of Israeli concessions to Palestinians. This seems unlikely to happen in the current environment, which suggests the peace deal may be derailed. The There are many possible ways this crisis can evolve from here, but for the purposes of simplicity, I would suggest two possible paths for macro market observers to consider  1  the situation remains contained, or 2  other countries join the conflict.Now, Treasury yields could rise if we see a significant resurgence in inflation caused by the events in the Middle East, but it seems unlikely that we would see a major impact to global inflation. First, the real price of oil is already elevated, and it is hard to imagine anything like a tripling from today s level  in 1973, prior to the Yom Kippur War, West Texas Intermediate oil was around  28 a barrel in today s prices. The global economy is far less oil-intensive than it was at that time, suggesting the inflationary impact of any oil price rise is now proportionately less.In other news, the further rise of long bond yields is also worrying investors. The  from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  triggered fears that the US Federal Reserve would keep interest rates  higher for longer,  which in turn placed upward pressure on long bond yields. Recent better-than-expected US economic data has added to that upward pressure on yields, resulting in downward pressure on stocks.However, as I have said before, it appears markets are overreacting to the dot plot and the data. That s becauseFinally, I take comfort from comments made by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly last week. She conceded to the reality that the rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield is doing the Fed s work for it, which suggests the Fed can now be more dovish   the need for us to take further action is diminished because financial markets are already moving in that direction and they've done the work. We don't need to do it more.Investors are also concerned about the health of various economies in the face of a global central bank-induced slowdownLooking ahead, some of the most-watched data points this week will be the US Consumer Price Index  CPI , German industrial production, and German CPI. I will also be interested in the FOMC minutes, which will be released later this week.

The Present Geopolitical Situation Is Impossible To Predict,"Just as the stock market was trying to shake off spiking bond yields, Hamas decided to attack Israeli civilians and Israel understandably has retaliated. This situation is moving oil, bonds and stocks, as the worst-case scenario is a massive oil price spike, whichIf this war remains contained to Gaza and Israel, and if Hezbollah doesn t attack from Lebanon, and if Israel does not bomb Iranian targets, making this a broad regional conflict - that s too many  ifs  - then a fourth quarter rally may still be in the cards.But we went from worrying about bonds to worrying about a war that just 10 days ago no intelligence agency had any idea was coming.Is it possible that Hamas s objective from the beginning was to trigger just such a regional war, based on the expected Israeli response  This is my biggest worry, at the moment, as a prolonged war will surely impact global financial markets, starting with a spike in the oil price.A worst-case scenario would be bullish for bonds, no matter what happens to the price of oil, as it will cause a deflationary shock. I think we saw some of that action last Friday, when the bond market rebounded quite significantly from its Thursday selloff and the stock market sold off notably.The strong correlation we had for most of September and October - where weak Treasury futures meant weak stock index futures - completely disappeared last Friday.Some commentators tried to pin the stock market action on weak consumer confidence and higher inflation expectations, based on economic releases that came out at 10am that day.I don t believe that for a second. It was the stock market being worried about what might happen over the weekend in this explosive geopolitical situation.A lot will be decided this week. It will be a big positive if the S P 500 holds its October lows. It will be an even bigger positive if we make further progress to the upside, but I fear that this will all be contingent on whether or not the Israeli situation escalates past Gaza.When the stock market bottomed last October and began to rally, it held its key 10- and 20-day moving averages all the way until December. Investors bought stocks on every pullback. After the sharp selloff at the end of last week, the S P 500 is sitting on those key moving averages - as of this writing  Sunday . After I wrote this, I saw the U.S. index futures open rather strong on Sunday night with oil and bonds marginally down. It looks like the unwinding of the fear trade from Friday. I think as long as this war lasts, there will be many twists and turns, but avoiding a worst-case scenario can lead to the fourth quarter rally.

International Seaways: Smooth And Profitable Sailing,"This report delves into the company's operations, financial stability, profitability, competitive edge, risks, and a strategic trade proposition for investors. We believe that the low oil inventories around the world will allow Oil Tankers and specifically International Seaways International Seaways, Inc., a titan in the global tanker industry, offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. The company's operations span both the spot market and fixed-rate time charter contracts, providing a diversified business model that caters to the dynamic needs of the global shipping market.In the spot market, INSW operates through single voyage charters, where the charterer pays a one-time freight rate for a specified voyage. The shipowner, in this case INSW, bears the vessel's operatingConversely, under a time charter contract, the charterer leases the vessel for a predetermined period, assuming the costs of fuel and port charges. The shipowner, however, continues to manage the vessel's operating expenses. This arrangement offers the shipowner a consistent and predictable revenue stream, as the charter rate remains fixed throughout the contract duration. While time charters provide fixed revenues they do limit the upside if spots prices are higher than booked time charters.As of July 31, 2023, INSW's fleet boasted 75 vessels, including 13 Very Large Crude Carriers  VLCCs , 13 Suezmaxes, 5 Aframaxes LR2s, 7 Panamaxes LR1s, and 37 Medium Range  MR  tankers. These vessels serve the crude oil and petroleum product shipping markets. The larger VLCC and Suezmax vessels primarily transport crude oil, while the LR1, LR2, and MR tankers carry refined petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Aframax vessels, due to their size, offer the flexibility of transporting either crude oil or refined products.INSW's strategic focus lies in owning and operating a diversified fleet of crude and product tankers under medium to long-term charters, supplemented by spot tanker market trading. The company leverages its scale, customer relationships, and industry knowledge to generate stable cash flows and deliver competitive long-term returns for shareholders.INSW has demonstrated resilience and adaptability. The company's Q2 2023 results indicate a significant improvement over the previous year with revenue jumping from  188.2 Million to  292.2 Million with a fleet utilization rate of 99.5 . The company projects a strengthening product tanker market in the second half of 2023, driven by increased oil consumption, normalization of oil inventories, limited fleet growth, and the potential return of Iranian barrels. Think of the fleet as an arbitrage market mover, where significant geographic price differences incentive higher prices for those products to be shipped globally.INSW's strengths come from their ability to have high degrees of operational leverage allowing them to benefit from the current elevated spot market prices of Oil Charters. This leverage allows them to generate strong cash flows to not only pay off their debts but also to deleverage, purchase back shares and issue special dividends all while maintaining a solid balance sheet.INSW's financial stability and profitability are further underscored by its breakeven analysis. The  All-in 12 Month  estimate of breakeven costs represents the average daily revenue that the company needs to cover all its expenses, including operating expenses, administrative costs, interest expenses, and capital expenditures. The  Effect of Fixed Revenue  represents the contribution from fixed-rate time charter contracts to the company's overall revenue. These contracts provide a steady and predictable revenue stream, regardless of market conditions.Subtracting the  Effect of Fixed Revenue  from the  All-in 12 Month  breakeven costs results in a lower breakeven point. The guaranteed revenue from fixed-rate contracts reduces the amount of revenue that the company needs to generate from other sources  like spot market charters  to cover its costs. In simple terms, the fixed revenue acts as a  safety net,  lowering the company's breakeven point.However, it's crucial to note that this is a simplified explanation and calculation. The actual profits can vary based on several factors like fluctuating spot rates, the specific route and cargo, and various costs such as fuel prices, maintenance, and administrative expenses. Another key point is that not all the company's vessels may be available to charter on the spot market at all times due to existing time charter contracts or necessary maintenance and repairs. Therefore, the company's actual profits could be higher or lower than this calculation suggests.INSW's competitive edge or  moat  comes from the regional imbalances of crude oil and refined products and limited fleet growth. The company's market is protected by low worldwide inventories and oil reserves which causes an increasing distance between oil producers, refineries, and end-user oil demand. In addition, the order book for oil ships stands at less than 4  of the current fleet, with asset prices at 15-year highs and shipyards at capacity with other shipping sector.However, the company faces some significant risks. The oil tanker industry is highly competitive, similar to airlines, with many players vying for business. This competition can lead to price wars and thin profit margins, especially during oversupply periods. The industry also faces high fixed costs, including vessels, maintenance, crew, and fuel, and heavy regulations to ensure safety and environmental protection.Oil tanker industries are sensitive to global economic conditions and events. For oil tankers, fluctuations in oil prices, changes in global oil demand, and geopolitical events can significantly impact business. Around 64  of the company's interest is fixed or hedged, leaving 35  on a floating rate, adding another layer of risk. However, Oil tankers hold significant inherent value as hard assets, providing a floor for asset values even in a worst-case scenario. In addition, the current trading rates for tankers are in elevated territory relative to a few years ago. The oil tanker industry operates in a cyclical market, which provides opportunities for companies like INSW that can effectively manage these cycles. Additionally, oil tanker companies often have a mix of long-term charter contracts and spot market operations, allowing them to capture upside during periods of high rates.Other risks include global fleet expansion and geopolitical risks. With this said fleet growth is limited to 4  due to shipyards being full and high interest rates causing some concern around the breakeven analysis of these capital intensive ships.Investors seeking to hedge their bets in the volatile crude oil shipping industry might consider a strategic position that involves going long on International Seaways while simultaneously shorting DHT Holdings . This strategy could offer a protective shield against potential downside risks in the crude market, while still leaving room to capitalize on the upside potential of INSW.Currently, DHT is trading at a forward price-to-earnings  P E  ratio of 8.6X, which is more than twice the forward P E ratio of INSW, which stands at 4.0X. This disparity is intriguing, given that both companies operate in the same industry and exhibit similar financial ratios and metrics.However, a closer look reveals that INSW outperforms DHT on several efficiency and valuation metrics. For instance, INSW's operating margin and return on equity have consistently outpaced those of DHT, indicating superior operational efficiency and profitability. Furthermore, INSW's lower P E ratio suggests that its stock is undervalued relative to its earnings, making it a potentially attractive investment.By going long on INSW, investors can take advantage of this undervaluation and the company's strong performance metrics. At the same time, shorting DHT allows investors to profit from any potential overvaluation of the stock, thereby creating a hedge against industry-wide risks.This spread trade strategy-long INSW, short DHT-could provide a balanced approach to navigating the crude oil shipping industry. It offers protection against downside risks while maintaining exposure to the upside potential of a company that has demonstrated robust efficiency and attractive valuation metrics.In summary, International Seaways, Inc. presents a compelling investment proposition in the global tanker industry. The company's diversified business model, robust operational track record, and strategic focus on owning and operating a diversified fleet of crude and product tankers under medium to long-term charters, supplemented by spot tanker market trading, make it a strong player in the industry. In addition, their balance sheet allows them flexibility to the downside as well as to the upside. Despite the risks associated with the highly competitive and regulated industry, INSW's financial stability, profitability, and strategic trade proposition offer a balanced approach for investors to navigate the crude oil shipping industry.

Managing Risk: How Geopolitical Concerns Could Impact Markets,"Greg Bonnell  Well, the conflict involving Israel and Hamas has some assessing how to manage risks in the current market. We also have bond yields sitting at around 16-year highs. So there's a lot going on.For more on how to view these markets, joined now by Alexandra Gorwitz, vice president and director of active fixed income portfolio management at TD Asset Management. Alex, great to have you back on the program.Alexandra Gorewicz  Thanks, Greg. Great to be here.Greg Bonnell  All right, so heading into this weekend, you and I actually had a conversation about whatAlexandra Gorewicz  That there's a lot of uncertainty. And how we price that uncertainty is a big unknown, right  If we think about what happened in September with the huge rise in bond yields, and then we had jobs numbers come out, both in Canada and the US in early October, and is just showing a lot of resilience. This tightening of financial conditions, this tightening of monetary policy just doesn't seem to be having an impact on the real economy.And so investors are saying, look, the future is really uncertain, and the things that I thought would happen by this point are not happening. The slowdown of the economy is not really coming through. So maybe we need to charge more risk premia for the uncertainty, and that's manifesting in higher bond yields, particularly at the long end of the yield curve, 10-year and 30-year government bonds.Greg Bonnell  Now, when you see a geopolitical risk event of this magnitude, you do see the move into gold. You see the move into bonds. We saw that play out. But at the same time, we got some dovish comments from Fed speakers talking about that dramatic bond sell-off, the rise in rates and saying, well, maybe now -Alexandra Gorewicz  Right.Greg Bonnell  The bond market has done our work for us.Alexandra Gorewicz  Correct. So you have these multiple narratives right now that are making it difficult to say with any kind of conviction what is actually driving these moves in markets. Obviously, the conflict in the Middle East is still very early - too soon to tell whether it becomes more of a regional conflict. If it does, I think that has the potential to generate a risk-off sentiment globally across financial markets, across asset classes.But in the US specifically, those call it dovish comments that you were referring to when I said that bond yields have risen, that investors are demanding higher risk premium, or more yield to hold government bonds with longer durations, what Fed members are interpreting that to be is what we call the term premium. In other words, demanding more compensation for holding longer duration risk.And for them, that does translate ultimately into a tightening of financial conditions or a tightening of credit conditions for the real economy, whether it's corporations that have been delaying issuing new debt or refinancing because they kept expecting interest rates to come down.Or whether it's households that have delayed those home purchases in the expectation that mortgage rates would come down. Well, now that longer bond yields are higher, the probability of both of those segments of the economy seeing an alleviation from higher yields is a lot lower. And so from the Fed's perspective, that means that really the bond market, it's doing its work for them.Greg Bonnell  So after a year and a half of aggressive central bank rate hikes and then a bond sell-off that pushed yields in the bond market to 16-year highs, are we at a point now where we could say perhaps we have over tightened  This has gone too far.Alexandra Gorewicz  Even before this move in the last several weeks, one could have made the argument that there was already over tightening. And again, like I mentioned, you would never know that there was over tightening if you just looked at the labor market, although the details, even within the labor space, are not strong, per se. Headline numbers are strong, but not necessarily the details underneath them.That said, when you think about the Fed and having to conduct monetary policy or any central bank and having to conduct monetary policy to address future conditions, one of the things that they latch on to a lot is this concept of, well, what is the appropriate policy rate in the long run for our economy to be in equilibriumAnd there's so many things that impact how our economy can grow. It could be population and demographic characteristics. It could be government policymaking. It could be geopolitical conflicts. It could be indebtedness, innovation. There's way too many factors to determine what that appropriate policy rate is.But while some people say, well, that rate is probably higher today than it was before the pandemic, I think there would be very few who would say that rate should be higher than where it was, let's say, 40 years ago.And the reason I latch on to that period of time is if you compare where the Fed policy rate is today relative to that abstract concept of a neutral rate, it's actually - the policy rate today is higher relative to that neutral rate than where we would have been 40 years ago.That's really relevant because it could actually suggest that although, you know, the Fed's sitting at just under 6 , the policy settings may be a lot more restrictive today than where they were when the Fed policy rate was double digits back in the '80s.So again, depends on how you think through policy, monetary policy settings. But one could make the argument that financial conditions, or rather the Fed policy tightening, is a lot more today than it would have been back -Greg Bonnell  So clearly there's a lot going on. We mentioned jobs. Have we talked about inflation yet  There would have been a time where we would have led this discussion with inflation.Alexandra Gorewicz  Correct.Greg Bonnell  Obviously, headline has been coming down. It hasn't been a straight path. Do we get a sense now with everything that's happening in the economy with all the market reaction that perhaps inflation is returning to two  At some point, I mean, probably not tomorrow, but at some point.Alexandra Gorewicz  Yeah, so if you ask bond investors, right - and we have various instruments in bond land that we could proxy what bond investors think about inflation - they haven't - they haven't been worried that inflation will be somehow persistently above the Fed's 2  target. And what we've seen actually over the last couple of weeks with rising bond yields, this was not driven by an increase in inflation expectations.So for that narrative, that, oh, you know, somehow a strong labor market is going to feed into more persistent inflation, and then that's going to lead investors to demand higher bond yields. That's not what's driven interest rates higher. So it's funny that you said, like, we would have led with inflation. This has not been an inflation-driven move.And in fact, even when we look at what the Fed did, right, they gave us their updated economic projections, everybody latched on to the fact that their growth forecast is higher, right - the soft landing narrative.But what about the fact that they've actually reduced their inflation forecast for this year, and then more or less left it unchanged for the coming years where they're showing a gradual return to 2 .The Fed clearly doesn't see the risks to inflation to be skewed to the upside anymore. Now it's either balanced, and if anything - and if I mentioned that the policy settings might actually be a lot more restrictive than where they were four decades ago, it's possible that there could be some downside surprises to inflation in the coming months and quarters.

Devon Energy: Love Is In The Air,"Devon Energy's  stock has been beaten down this year as earnings have declined. We believe that the selloff is overdone. The company is trading at an attractive valuation and is set for positive earnings momentum going in H2 thanksFor those unfamiliar with the company, Devon Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the United States. Devon's operations are located in five geographic areas  the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin, Powder River Basin and Williston Basin.Assets located in the Delaware Basin are Devon's most valuable assets, andThis year Devon has been punished by the market and their stock is down much more than similar firms. A potential reason the market may be discounting Devon is  about the quality of their assets and outlook for growth, and fears about where we are in the cycle. The market may view competitors as being in a stronger position than Devon, but we believe even if that is the case the current discount is too wide.In their most recent quarter Devon earned  690 million down from  1.932 billion in the year ago period. This comparison is a little misleading as commodity prices spiked hard in the year ago period and were at relative lows during Q2 2023. This pattern of lower earnings is common among all oil and gas exposed companies. Thanks to higher commodity prices, the outlook for Devon's operating profitability is looking much better for the second half of this year than it did in the first. Analyst estimates are calling for  5.80 in earnings over the next twelve months. We will be referencing this  5.80 earnings estimate when talking about forward PE for valuation purposes.The decline in Devon's earnings does not warrant such poor year to date performance and the stock should be tracking their peers more closely.Devon's valuation has continued to get more attractive relative to peers and now trades at an attractive forward PE of 8.47. Most notable is their discount to Pioneer  as Pioneer is set to be acquired by Exxon . This sets the standard for what sector valuation multiples should trend towards, and it is likely that Devon's valuation trends higher to narrow that gap. Their valuation discount could make Devon an acquisition target. In the event of an acquisition it seems reasonable to assume that this discount would narrow considerably. could open the door to more M A in the oil and gas sector. Chevron  has been looking to get active in M A and apparently  acquiring Occidental . These two events are a sign that activity is set to heat up in the sector and company managements are looking to make moves from a position of strength. Now that Exxon has officially made their move, it puts pressure on other supermajors and midsized firms to strengthen their asset base or risk getting outcompeted. These competitive forces are even stronger in commodity markets than other areas of the economy, and as a result deal activity can spread like wildfire.Devon's assets are complementary to many US oil and natural gas operators as there is a bit of infrastructure overlap in the industry. Due to their discount to peers and attractive Delaware Basin assets, Devon is no doubt looking like an attractive acquisition target. This could help to put somewhat of a floor on the stock, and could stoke investor appetite for the sector. For Devon investors, the main benefit of M A activity heating up is that it adds optionality to what is already an attractive investment. In this way M A can be a rising tide that lifts all boats.Our bullish thesis on Devon isn't reliant on M A, and the possibility of M A is merely a bonus. We believe that Devon represents an attractive buying opportunity for a few reasons. The company is fundamentally undervalued relative to their peers. The outlook for oil and gas is improving into the end of the year. M A activity in the sector could favor Devon due to the nature of their assets and discounted valuation. At worst this could put a floor on the stock, and at best they get bought out at a premium to where the stock currently trades. Lastly, investing into Devon provides exposure to US-based oil and gas production, which can serve as a hedge against both geopolitical risks and inflation risks, helping to further diversify a portfolio.As we covered earlier, the price action for Devon has been lackluster this year. We believe that the price action will improve going into year-end as commodity prices firm up and M A speculation builds.Devon is trading at an attractive forward PE of 8.43. As we all know, this forward PE is a bit misleading due to the nature of the industry. Their actual earnings over the next 12 months could be much lower if commodity prices decline again, but they could also be much higher. The important thing investors should ask themselves is this  Does an investment in Devon help to diversify my portfolio and or meet my investment objectives  The variable component of the dividend means that Devon may not be the best choice for income investors. On the other hand, Devon provides more leverage to oil and gas prices than some other investments in the sector, and is a great way to act on a bullish thesis regarding oil and gas. We believe that Devon is a fundamentally attractive investment at these prices and can be a way for even the most tech focused investors to hedge their portfolio against geopolitical and inflation risks.We believe that Devon should trade at a forward PE of 10.8, which is 90  of Pioneer's forward PE of 12. This is based on our opinion that Pioneer has slightly better assets.Devon's free cash flow leaves a bit to be desired, but the company is planning to cut back on capital expenditures in the second half of the year. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry capital expenditures can be somewhat lumpy. We aren't too concerned about the relatively elevated price to free cash flow ratio.Looking at Devon's balance sheet we can see the company has done well to limit their debt levels. While we would prefer for the company to de-leverage further their long term debt is only about 1 year's worth of normalized profits, which is more than manageable. Considering the capital intensive nature of their business this is a reasonably conservative level of financial leverage.Devon is fundamentally undervalued, has earnings momentum going into H2 2023, and a clean balance sheet. There are multiple catalysts on the horizon that could help to bridge the gap between price and value, including possible M A. We believe that bullish investors can feel good about accumulating shares at these levels.A risk to the bullish thesis is the potential for oil and gas prices to decline to 2020 levels and remain at those prices for an extended period of time. This would financially challenge the entire sector and damage the fundamental thesis for Devon. That being said, we have a long-term outlook on oil and gas that calls for stable or increasing prices as global economic activity increases and debt begins to be monetized by governments around the world. Even in a worst-case scenario we think Devon would be fine over the long-term as their cost base can support much lower pricing, but in such a scenario the variable dividend would be much lower.We view the risk reward as being attractive. Investors should understand that there are always risks to investing in commodity sectors. Investments into commodity sectors are not suitable for all investors due to the inherent volatility.Devon is fundamentally undervalued and the stock could end up getting a boost into year end from improving earnings and M A speculation. We believe that current prices represent an attractive buying opportunity for investors who are bullish on oil and gas. Devon can be a long-term buy and hold regardless of what ultimately happens regarding M A.  UFD Capital Value Fund, LP has long exposure to DVN and XOM.

Consol Energy: Coal Rebounds As A Hedge Against Geopolitical Strife,"Global energy markets are the most sensitive to changes in the geopolitical environment. In light of the renewed Middle Eastern crises, we're seeing bullish strains on oil and a more significant rebound in Eurasian After years of poor performance, investors have also become very attracted to coal mining stocks. One notable example is CONSOL Energy , historically a leading producer of US thermal coal. CEIX has risen by around 91  this year and is stupendously  30 times higher than it was in its 2020 lows. CONSOLThe stock's performance has defied the general trend in coal prices. As seen in the coal mining producer price index, coal miner profit margins have likely declined in 2023. CONSOL's EPS has remained high, probably due to price contracts. However, its stock price has risen dramatically in recent months despite stagnation in its EPS trend. See belowGiven the situation, I believe it is an excellent time to take a closer look at CONSOL and the US thermal coal market to determine whether or not CEIX is in a price bubble or is simply rising toward its fair value after being undervalued for too long.For the past two decades, thermal coal has been the  ugly duckling,  a much disliked energy-producing commodity due to its less clean nature. Most Western countries have aggressively shifted toward natural gas, which produces less CO2 and other byproducts than coal. In 2020, it was generally viewed that Asian countries would quickly follow suit, causing thermal coal to become a relic of the past. However, as global instability rose with the lockdowns and subsequent geopolitical conflicts, coal has returned as a more viable commodity. Compared to natural gas, coal is far more abundant, , and, most importantly, is not exposed to the immense conflict risks of natural gas, as gas pipelines become a primary geopolitical target , .As Europe has lowered its Russian gas imports, it has dramatically increased US LNG imports, causing far less US LNG to flow toward Asia. As such, Asian countries have significantly increased coal imports to offset lost LNG,  be record years for global coal consumption. Unsurprisingly, CEIX has risen in response to the Israel-Hamas war, up around 9  since October 6th. Fundamentally, any threats to the European-Middle East natural gas trade will create upward pressure on Asian coal demand as  toward Europe  instead of Asia .Of course, with CEIX being so expensive today compared to its 5-year range, we must consider whether or not it is reasonably priced to that response. For one, coal prices are still far below 2022 levels. The company is producing around the Appalachia-Illinois area, which has seen coal prices drop by over 70  since the 2022 peak. See belowThere is a vast difference between CONSOL's EPS and the coal miner PPI and spot coal prices because most coal miners use fixed-price contracts and derivatives to minimize income volatility. CONSOL also directly exports around two-thirds of its production abroad, so its sales are often at European and Asian prices, are around  70 ton higher, typically holding the same pattern as US spot prices. Since it owns a central marine terminal, it also earns around  100M in quarterly sales  1 6th of the total  from fees from other coal miners using its infrastructure. Thus, while the general trend in coal spot prices is essential, CONSOL is diversified and has a significant edge against most US competitors.As the  mentioned, all of its 2023 production was contracted, while 17.6M of its 2024 production  or  65-75  of the total  was contracted. For the most part, we can expect that CONSOL will earn income in any given quarter based roughly on prices one year prior. , the company realized an average price of  81.27 ton at a cash cost of  36.33 per ton, both in line with guidance figures. The company also mentioned that its 2024 pricing was in the  but has not given specific price points since it was still making contracts. Its contracts will likely be around that level since coal prices have not changed dramatically in recent months.Assuming cash costs rise by  1.5 ton, as they  to 2023, to  37.8  due to inflation , I expect its cash margins per ton will be around  27 ton based on a  65 ton expected realized price. An expected 25M annual production for 2024 should result in   690M in total mining EBITDA. On top of that, I will project its marine terminal EBITDA at  96M, based on its Q2 performance. Together, that gives us a 2024 EBITDA projection of  786M.Against that, I will project its depreciation   amortization at  248M  twice its Q1   Q2 2023 level  and its interest expense at  28M  four times its Q2 level due to recent debt reductions . That gives us a pre-tax income estimate of  414M, or  331M, given its typical 20  effective tax rate. That translates to an EPS of  10.35. The current 2024 EPS projection by the analyst consensus is a , but only two analysts are making such a projection, and those figures likely do not account for the more recent coal price changes.Based on my assumptions, I believe CONSOL's 2024 forward  P E  is around 10.6X but potentially as low as 6.6X based on other analyst projections. Over the , CEIX has traded at an average  P E  ratio of 4.3X and an average  EV EBITDA  of 4.85X. In my view, these lower valuation metrics are very reasonable because CONSOL's EPS is extremely sensitive to changes in commodity prices. If coal eventually returned to pre-2021 levels, the company's income would likely become chronically negative again. Of course, should geopolitical turmoil continue to mount, then there is some reason to believe coal could rise much higher by 2024.Overall, my view regarding CEIX is similar to my  . On an immediate basis, projecting current prices into the future, CEIX is likely overvalued by around 30  to 110 , meaning it could fall by 25  to  54  for its price to fall to a 5X  P E  based on 2024 EPS projections. The price of coal and global volumes have been relatively stable during the past two quarters, so it is not unreasonable to assume coal could remain in this range in the long run, likely making CEIX overvalued today. CEIX has risen quickly this year despite negative action in coal spot prices, indicating that it is increasing due to retail investor speculation and not improving fundamentals.Still, I am not bearish on CEIX and am neutral because there is considerable potential that we see coal prices return to 2022 peak levels. CEIX never fully benefited from the price spike last year because it had lower-level price contracts. Thus, should coal rise again as last year, we could easily see CONSOL's EPS rise into the  20- 40  range. Such an action would require geopolitical pressures on the global natural gas market, as the Russia-Europe natural gas crisis fundamentally triggered last year's coal rally. I obviously do not know that could occur again, but considering most stocks will lose in this scenario, CEIX may be an excellent hedge to own, being among the few that would benefit.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Faces Disappointment: Prepare For More Struggles In Sight,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  is one of the key players in the healthcare industry and one of the world's largest retail pharmacies, headquartered in Deerfield, serving millions of people each year.The company provides its customers with numerousAt the same time, due to Walgreens' financial difficulties in recent years, its management continues to reduce its healthcare-focused investment portfolio. So, , Walgreens sold its stake in the Chinese company Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals for about  150 million. But more critical ones followed a little earlier. On August 18, 2022, Walgreens sold 11 million Option CareWhile euphoria reigns in financial markets in recent months, caused by a sharp increase in investment interest in technology and commodity companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance continues to have a dark streak in its history.We believe the major problems began after the company entered into agreements to pay billions of dollars to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid crisis. A few months after these events, , who served as the Chief Executive Officer, and , the Chief Information Officer, left the company. Moreover, Walgreens Boots Alliance's share price continued to decline after it was  from the S P 100 index in early September 2023.Additionally, we believe that Walgreens will have to reconsider its dividend policy, which has been in place for the past decades due to the sharp decline in its margins in the post-COVID-19 era, with the ultimate goal of keeping it from going bankrupt. One of the first steps in this direction was the announcement , that its board of directors left its quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share unchanged. This decision shocked financial market participants since the company usually announced an increase in dividend payments in July of previous years.Nevertheless, despite a significant decline in the company's gross margin in recent quarters and the suspension of dividend increases, , accounting for 27.09  of the company's total stake, still include Wall Street giants such as Vanguard Group, State Street, Charles Schwab Investment Management, Geode Capital Management, and Blackrock.The third quarter of fiscal 2023 showed mixed results since, on the one hand, Walgreens Boots Alliance's revenue was able to exceed analysts' expectations, but on the other hand, it has been showing a decrease in EPS for several quarters. Moreover, the  lowered its expectations for adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 from  4.45- 4.65 to  4.00- 4.05 due in part to the continued slowdown in consumer spending growth in the United States., Walgreens will publish a report for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which, in our opinion, will again upset investors. , the company's revenue is expected to be  33.97- 35.76 billion, up 8.2  year-on-year and 2.1  higher than analysts' expectations for the previous quarter. At the same time, our model projects Walgreens' fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue to fall at the lower boundary of this range, amounting to  34 billion.Walgreens Boots Alliance's revenue decline relative to the previous quarter will be due to lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, a strengthening of the US dollar against other foreign currencies, and a weaker-than-expected number of  in recent months.We forecast the company's operating income margin to reach 0.1  for fiscal 2023. At the same time, for the 2024 financial year, this metric will drop to -0.2 . We expect this to happen due to a decline in consumer spending, which is also caused by the continuing trend of rising U.S. household debt. In addition, the continued increase in selling and administrative expenses due to the VillageMD clinic expansion will also negatively impact the company's margins., Walgreens Boots Alliance's EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is expected to be  0.66- 0.72, 35.5  lower than the consensus estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. At the same time, according to our model, we are more pessimistic than Wall Street analysts and expect the company's EPS to be  0.6.Furthermore, the company's Non-GAAP P E  TTM  is 5.29x, 68.51  lower than the sector average and 40.44  lower than the average over the past five years. On the other hand, Walgreens' Non-GAAP P E  FWD  is 5.45x, which is one of the factors indicating its significant undervaluation by Mr. Market during a period of rising geopolitical tensions in the world.However, one of the key risks for the company remains its increase in debt from year to year, which also negatively affects its net income. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Walgreens Boots Alliance's total debt was about  37.4 billion, an increase of  2.99 billion over 2021. Moreover, due to the continued decline in EBITDA in recent quarters, the company's total debt EBITDA ratio increased from 6.19x to 13.1x.Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the key players in the healthcare industry and one of the world's largest retail pharmacies, headquartered in Deerfield, serving millions of people each year.Despite the company's revenue growth yearly, its operating income margin continues to decline. Additionally, the obligation to pay billions of dollars in settlements reached to resolve thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid crisis threatens Walgreens's financial stability. As a result, the company's share price has fallen more than 41  since the beginning of the year.We expect the company to have difficulty repaying its USD, GBP, and EUR-denominated senior notes with a maturity date between 2024 and 2026. As a result, Walgreens Boots Alliance's management will have to resort to painful steps, which may include mass layoffs and reductions in the number of its stores.On the other hand, Walgreens' extremely high dividend yield, which exceeds 8 , and our anticipation of the Fed's interest rate cuts next year will contribute to maintaining optimism among some investors regarding the company's future. Additionally, given the technical analysis, we believe that the price level at which the risk reward profile would be attractive is  18- 18.5 per share.We initiate our coverage of Walgreens Boots Alliance with a  hold  rating for the next 12 months.

Treasury yield’s 5% reach is bad for the stock market – Jefferies,"On Monday, the 10-year yield  reached the 5  threshold, and this could have significant consequences for equities. Treasury yields are at a 16-year high.The trade-off between stocks and bonds continues to be the most significant driver for equitiesWhen comparing the 10-year Treasury yields with the S P 500 s  trailing 12-month earnings yields, the S P 500 does not outyield the 10-year note  and performance declines.The best results were  when the Fed was pursuing a zero-interest rate policy,  Greenebaum said in his report,  and when the 10-year yield  was much higher, showing no real relationship to the earnings yield.",19,2023-10-23T10:30:35.000-04:00

"Stock Market: We Ain't Crashing, And Here's Why","Market commentators, including some writers on Seeking Alpha, are stepping up quantity and intensity of crash predictions. I understand analysts like to point at concerning 1  signals in technical analysis, 2  events in the Middle East and broader global geopolitical tensions, 3  inflationTechnical analysis is a methodology that involves studying historical stock price and volume data, with the goal of predicting future price movements. With that said, a look at the S P 500 chart reveals a concerning situationIgnore technical analysis if you want to make money with stocks. That's right, go ahead, close those charts, wave goodbye to those oscillators, and toss those Fibonacci lines into the trash. As I see it  and you may of course agree , technical analysis doesn't predict future events or factors that may affect stock prices, such as economic developments or company performance. I have a feeling that technical analysis predicted 78 out of the past 3 crashes. Moreover, technical interpretation of charts and patterns can vary between analysts, leading to very subjective judgments. Whatever I argued above on a monthly, weekly and daily basis is likely not be echoed by another student of charts.As a key argument for a stock market crash, market commentators like to point to the risk brought about by the recent outbreak of fighting in Israel and Hamas. Reasons for concern include potential for geopolitical tensions, as well as a probable oil price rally on supply chain disruptions. However, most of the concerns relate to a broader conflict in the Middle East, beyond Israel and Hamas, that engages the U.S and Iran in a proxy war. As I see it, this consideration is more of a tail-risk, rather than reasonable future projections. And pre-maturely responding to this with a stock market crash would be nothing short of  stupid .Moreover, while the conflict in the Middle East is very unfortunate, from a market perspective there is little argument for concern. In a previous article, I have  what happened to U.S. equities during major Middle East conflicts, covering 1  the Six-Day War of 1967  2  the Gulf War, 1990-1991  3  the Iraq War, 2003-2011  and 4  the Arab Spring, 2010-2011. The takeaway was quite consistent  Stocks are do not show a tendency to go bearish on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In fact, following an initial period of elevated market volatility, U.S. equities like to make new highs within 12-18 months from the conflict outbreak.Markets are forward looking. Markets are rarely interested in trends that happened in the past. What is interesting to markets is the rate of change. And as I observe it, the rate of change in both inflation and interest rates is favorable. Latest data points on core inflation show the CPI trending towards 3  YoY growth. Meanwhile, wage growth is dropping towards the 50-year historical average of 4  YoY. These easing pressure points on pricing contribute to a favorable rates outlook, as by JP Morgan .With this context, investors should consider that if the aggressive,  past hiking path in interest rates didn't crash the markets  although it did in 2021 , then the next leg in the path forward, namely rates going down, won't do it either.Admittedly, even though inflationary headwinds and rates pressure are easing, the high implied time value of money is still a concern to many investors. However, investors concern on rates will likely be a headwind to upside  it won't be a catalyst for downside. And what I am saying in this article is not that we are rallying, but that we ain't crashing.Finally, investors are concerned about the valuation of the S P 500, citing an implied 2024 P E of close to 18x. But I have a very hard time buying the valuation story. First, I point out that on an aggregate level, the valuation of U.S. equities is relatively in line with historical metrics.In that context, the graph below provides a comparative assessment of major asset classes and styles in relation to their historical averages over a twenty-five-year period, expressed as z-scores. Z-scores are a statistical metric indicating the number of standard deviations a data point deviates from the mean of a distribution. This calculation is represented asZ    X - μ    σHere, Z signifies the z-score, X represents the individual data point, μ denotes the mean of the dataset, and σ signifies the standard deviation of the dataset. A low z-score suggests that the data point is below the mean, and the magnitude of the z-score quantifies the extent to which the data point deviates from the mean in terms of standard deviations.As you see, the stocks appear to be reasonably priced - with growth trading at a slight premium being offset by a discount in small cap and value.Related to valuation, market commentators also like to point out that the top-heavy S P 500 index, comprised of the Magnificent Seven, renders the market vulnerable to a rerating. However, I think this argument is quite ludicrous. Investors should note the most recent earnings reports of the Magnificent Seven.For the group, weighted by dollar value, operating earnings are up more than 20  YoY, outpacing the gain of the 11  gain of the S P 500. The strong earnings growth should also arguments about the inflation and rates headwind argued in the previous section of this article. Against such a backdrop, how can anybody argue that U.S. equities are setting up for a crashCertainly, investing in equities comes with its inherent risks that should not be underestimated, especially considering the persistent economic challenges. It's crucial to keep the following four key risk factors in mind  First, there is just a general level of noise and market volatility as equities are prone to sentiment-induced price swings  Second, there remains a notable level of economic Uncertainty with estimates for a U.S. recession in 2024 varying between 25-40  depending on the analyst. Although a recession will likely not cause a crash, a recession may pressure equities' valuation on earnings headwinds  Third, I see sector-specific vulnerabilities that can impact the performance of certain industries within the S P 500 more than other industries  Finally, there is time risk, as the realization of returns from S P 500 investments typically requires a long-term commitment.Overall, I believe quite strongly in my assessment that technical analysis is little helpful, that the Middle East conflict is not a crash catalyst, that inflation and interest rates have peaked, and that stocks are not expensive. I may be wrong, however, in my assessment of how other market participants view these pressure points. Specifically, the stock market remains a sentiment-driven collective of people  and thus, it is worth pointing out that sentiment is  shaky, and prone to react excessively to the downside  but also on the upside . Investors should keep this in mind.Personally, I will closely watch inflation and interest rate dynamics. Any surprising, strong uptick in CPI numbers would definitely be alarming -- and lead to a revision in my thesis.Despite a growing chorus of predictions about an impending stock market crash, there are more compelling reasons to view these concerns with skepticism. The arguments put forth by some analysts are centered on technical analysis, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, inflation, interest rates, and general overvaluation of the market. However, a closer look reveals that these risks may not be as severe as they appear. First, technical analysis, often used to predict market movements, is subjective and has a mixed track record. The consistent uptrend in the S P 500 suggests that, despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term trajectory remains positive  Second, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East historically haven't led to prolonged market downturns. In fact, U.S. equities have typically rebounded within 12-18 months after such conflicts  Third, concerns about inflation and interest rates may be easing, with favorable trends in core inflation and wage growth. Even if rates rise, they are unlikely to trigger a market crash  Fourth, the argument of general overvaluation in the stock market is mitigated by historical metrics, and the top-heavy S P 500 is still supported by strong earnings growth among the  Magnificent Seven  tech companies.To conclude, I continue to like investing in stocks. And I am knowingly and happily betting against anybody who is taking a bearish view on markets. Thank you for reading.

"The Fed Is Done Hiking, And The Holidays Are About To Begin","Last week, Jay Powell gave a critical speech where he got pretty frank about monetary policy. One of the simplest things he said that anyone can understand is that the Fed  takes the economy as it comes.  Stating it another way, he affirmed that theyHowever, the economic strength seen so far has mainly been positive and the strength of the consumer has been impressive. Particularly since productivity and participation have trended in a good direction, too. The conversation Powell had was primarily received as a bearish development by the market, but IThe probability of the next meeting of a hike is technically  by some measures. Of course, these are always implied probabilities that should be taken with a grain of salt, though. Furthermore, something has cropped up on many Fed-watching tools that haven't been there for a while. The probability of easing has started to filter back into the models.So, while the Fed has maintained a dedication to vanquishing inflation if it crops back up, the data has shown the fight has largely been one. The core inflation crucial to Fed decision-making is under 3  now at the 3-month and 6-month intervals, as  in his speech. But the reaction function has begun to evolve. As you can see below, by May 2024, the expectation shifts to a more significant probability of cuts than hikes.So, the Fed has maintained the tough talk, and if you think about it had to. One of the things Powell mentioned in his speech at the Economic Club of New York was that 50 years ago, when Milton Friedman came up with the phrase the relationship between the Fed and the market was fundamentally different. But based on what the market is currently saying and how inflation is currently trending, this hiking cycle is likely over.Not only that, but the economy has proven  to high rates, which is also a further implication. If the economy faces a significant risk, the Fed has plenty of bazooka rounds to help cushion the economic impact of it. This was not the case for much of the last couple of decades. Higher rates, specifically higher rates driven by the term premium rather than economic strength, are helping the Fed ensure inflation doesn't pop back up without another hike.The market essentially responded to Fed open market operations after their occurrence instead of anticipating them in the past. When you think of the consequences from the vantage point of the Fed Chair, you'll want to wear your pistol where people can see it, lest their behavior gets too far away from where you want it to be. In my last piece about the Fed, I mentioned some other ways the economy had changed and why that might explain how some people have very different thoughts about how prevalent inflation is vs. .There's a famous quote by contrarian investor John Templeton   I consider myself a contrarian investor, and I greatly respect the distinguished and honorable Mr. Templeton and the critical insight he was trying to convey. I would summarize the critical insight from this quote as always being cognizant of how the perennial driver of human psychology will repeatedly lead to maniacal thinking concerning investments.But it's also important to consider other things that will be consistent, like seasonal factors. The fact that there will likely be seasonal relief on gasoline should mitigate the chances of a problematic spike in inflation expectations, for instance.And Powell has said clearly that the evidence so far is that financial conditions do not appear overly tight. I agree with what Fed President ,  Absent a stark turn in what I see in the data and hear from contacts...I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are.  All indications are that American consumers and businesses have been strong enough to weather these financial conditions. Countervailing forces of government spending should help mitigate the depth of a typical cyclical slowdown.Of course, a monetary policy lag could sucker punch the economy, but I don't think other data suggest that is likely. If it happens, we would likely have a bit of warning. So, if you look at past data, you might think,  But it would do you well to ask yourself what is different. One major difference that gave Powell confidence in his speech was that US corporations have broadly termed out debt to a much greater degree than in previous economic cycles.When analyzing the economy at a macro level, as we must when trying to ascertain how the Fed will affect the economy, I think it's more important to focus on how the economy has changed and how the current situation is unique. If you listen thoroughly to what Powell said during his speech, it seems clear that he believes the primary driving factor of inflation was robust demand. While aware of flare-ups, that primary driver seems to have eased in a convincing and hopefully sustainable fashion.As a reminder, I have covered this Fed hiking cycle extensivelyNow, I'm stating that I think the fight against inflation is primarily done. I think a lot of the sentiment, particularly of Wall Street, is sending the wrong message and has been confused by how different this cycle is. One of the strengths that Wall Street and institutional participants tend to have over others is their ability to orient themselves in the cycle. COVID was such a substantial economic shock that this advantage has been mitigated.For two years in a row, bonds and stocks have gotten clobbered mainly in unison, and this will likely ultimately converge in an excellent catch-up trade, converging with seasonal factors into the end of the year. Institutions will have a lot of incentive to chase prices higher. I think this recent sell-off has probably climaxed, and we will see both diminishing volatility, falling rates, and falling inflation at the end of the year.The bears certainly have a lot of compelling points, and this is mainly behind the market dropping a couple hundred points over the past weeks. Nonetheless, I think there are a lot of compelling long-term positives that should ultimately carry the rest of the year for the bulls. Still, this is based on the following risks not flaring up in a way that catches markets by surprise or significantly impedes economic activity.Furthermore, US borrowing costs are soaring, and US treasury demand insurance is up. There has been a lot of upward pressure on rates, mainly from an expanding term premium. At the end of the day, markets are about confidence. If US debt continues losing buyers' confidence, even due to building geopolitical tensions and not genuine economic concerns, this could be a significant risk to our economy and global markets.Of course, one of the most significant risks is that geopolitical interruptions of trade and commerce or considerable economic strength in the US economy reignite inflation. If this occurs, then all bets are off, and the Fed very well may have to break the back of economic activity in a Volcker-esque fashion. The crux of my thesis and bullish call on the market from these levels is that inflation has primarily been vanquished.The term soft landing has gotten away from itself. It's important to remember that a soft landing never meant all unicorns and rainbows. It's a definitive slowing of economic activity. Still, given the highly volatile events of the past two decades, expectations for an economy with wild swings in prices and spikes in volatility may be partially due to recency bias. These mornings, the Fed's favorite, Personal Consumption Expenditures, came in as expected and showed measurable progress.But there's something different this time, building on my earlier thoughts on the Templeton quote, that I think increases the chances of a soft landing even beyond the favorable data we're seeing across different areas of the economy about inflation. The first thing I'll mention is that it would strike me as peculiar if we had a recession next quarter after this GDP report. Consumers are hanging in there, businesses are maintaining strength, and a massive amount of government spending is helping float the economy's boat.But other than this, something more fundamental has changed. Something that nearly always precedes recessions and might be considered an essential ingredient is excessive optimism, irrational exuberance, and over-investment. A piece on sentiment by prolific financial commentator and wealth management titan  cited this chart from a 2019 study entitled  Prevalence of Emotional Payload in Headline.  As you can see, over the past two decadesThe implications of this are profound. One of Seeking Alpha's most popular contributors focuses on the importance of sentiment to prices and markets, but it's also fundamentally important to the economy itself. Recessions and booms, at their core, are collective behavior. Collective exuberance and collective pessimism. Suppose there is one positive effect of polarization and fear-driven media.In that case, it may make the collective behavior necessary for manias and the inevitable crashes less intense, frequent, or even likely. As distasteful as many of the ways our world has become different may be, they also may make fluctuations in collective economic behavior less extreme or encourage a softer landing with less labor market dislocation that would have occurred in a less polarized environment where ebullience and economic confidence were more behaviorally significant.In other words, what's different in our current economy from our economy 50 years ago should converge nicely with the traditional end-of-the-year strength that typically occurs in November and December.

Peter willAfter our prepared remarks, Peter and Mary Ann will be joined by Evan Russo, Chief Executive Officer of Asset Management, as they open the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Peter.Thanks, Ale, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my first earnings call as CEO of Lazard by expressing my thanks to my predecessor, Ken Jacobs. We are thrilled that Ken, 1 of the world's premier bankers is now our Executive Chairman and has shifted his focus to advising clients. I also want to thank our Board of Directors for entrusting me with this role. It is a privilege to work with such exceptionally talented colleagues across the firm, and I look forward to serving and supporting them, our clients and our shareholders.Lazard is one of the world's preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms with one of the most powerful brands in the financial services industry, and I am excited about our prospects to further elevate our relevance, revenue and returns. I'll provide more on our outlook and plans for Lazard later, but now let's turn the call over to Mary Ann to discuss our third quarter and 9-month results.Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported operating revenue of  532 million for the third quarter of 2023, a 27  decrease from the third quarter of 2022. Operating revenue for the first 9 months was  1.7 billion compared to  2.1 billion in the first 9 months of the prior year. In Financial Advisory, we reported third quarter revenue of  261 million and  879 million for the first 9 months of the year. Advisory operating revenue continues to be impacted by the ongoing slowdown in M A and this quarter's results reflect the lagged state of M A announcements from several quarters ago.Looking ahead, we believe the M A cycle is turning, and we are well positioned as the market recovers to advise on a variety of transactions, including those associated with private capital as well as large cross-border and complex transactions.Outside of M A, we see continued momentum in several areas of the advisory business. Private Capital Advisory, our primary and secondary capital raising group, continues to see significant demand for its services, especially in the secondaries business, building on its strong second quarter and year-to-date results.Lazard's Global Restructuring and Liability Management Group also had a strong quarter, with operating revenue increasing both sequentially and year-over-year. The pickup in restructuring activity is accelerating, and the team is currently advising on a number of significant transactions for a wide range of debtor and creditor clients.Our Software and Advisory business also continues to perform well and advised a number of governments during the quarter, including prominent assignments for Srilanka and Greece. Lastly, 1 year after its launch, client demand continues to increase for our geopolitical advisory services amid the growing demand from corporate leaders for advice concerning global risks.In Asset Management, third quarter operating revenue was  262 million, flat compared to the third quarter last year, and down 2  sequentially. The management fees and other revenue for the third quarter were up 8  compared to the third quarter of 2022 and flat compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the first 9 months of the year, management fees and other revenue declined 1  compared to the same period in 2022.Asset Management revenue was  794 million in the first 9 months of 2023, 5  lower than the prior year period, reflecting lower incentive fees.As of September 30, we reported AUM of  228 billion, 5  lower than June 30, 2023, and 15  higher than September 30, 2022. The sequential decrease was driven by market depreciation of  5.8 billion, foreign exchange depreciation of  3.3 billion and net outflows of  2 billion.Average AUM for the third quarter was  236 billion, increasing 11  from a year earlier, and flat on a sequential basis. Average AUM for the first 9 months of 2023 was  233 billion, level with the first 9 months of the prior year.Now turning to expenses. For the third quarter, adjusted compensation expense was  364 million. This equates to a 68.4  adjusted ratio during the third quarter, which reflects our current best estimate for the remainder of the year. Our non-compensation expense was  137 million in the third quarter, 7  higher than the third quarter last year related to increased occupancy costs as well as higher technology and professional services expenses.We are progressing on our cost saving initiatives announced in April to reduce our count rate by 10  by the first quarter of 2024. Our goal to reduce overall costs includes a reduction in reprioritization of long-term projects. These changes reflect our commitment to return to our target expense ratios as revenues normalize. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter as adjusted was 8.4 , which compares to 25.1  in the prior year quarter. Our current estimate for the full year tax rate is projected to be in the low to mid-teens. Our estimate, as always, is dependent on the level and location of earnings as well as the impact of discrete items in the fourth quarter.Turning to capital allocation. In the third quarter of 2023, we returned  52 million to shareholders, primarily reflecting our quarterly dividend. During the first 9 months of the year, we returned  285 million to shareholders, including  129 million in dividends,  102 million in share repurchases and  54 million in satisfaction of employee tax obligations.Additionally, yesterday, we declared a quarterly dividend of  0.50 per share.I will now turn it back over to Peter for comments on the outlook.Thank you, Mary Ann. Today's results underscore the lagged effect of the slowdown in M A announcements from several quarters ago. However, our Asset Management business and part of our Advisory business, including restructuring and private capital secondaries fundraising, are offsetting some of the overall market weakness in M A.Looking forward, and as we have previously stated, we believe that the worst of the M A slowdown is behind us. We continue to see signs that the market is bottoming out and stabilizing with the quarters ahead poised for a rebound in deal activity. We are already seeing significant M A activity in financial institutions, health care and energy transition among other sectors. We are also seeing early signs of an increase in cross-border M A activity, which, with our global presence and expertise, we are well positioned to capture.This bottoming out reflects the interplay between the catalyst of activity, including ongoing technological innovation, shifts in global supply chains, the life sciences revolution and the energy transition and the headwinds, which include a divergence in expectations between buyers and sellers because of the impact on valuations from the sharp increase in interest rates, the uncertainty in financing markets and regulatory concerns. As higher interest rates remain in place for a longer period, as monetary policy tightening likely nears its end, and as some companies have won court victories on regulatory matters, the headwinds have generally been easing in recent months.One of the strong indications of this changing balance between catalyst and headwinds comes from the tenor of our client discussions, which are growing more constructive. There are 2 important lags between such a constructive shift in client discussions and revenue though. First, there is a lag between active discussions and an increase in announcements, which, for the market as a whole, have now stabilized, but are not yet increasing meaningfully. After a pickup in announcements, another lag then occurs to completions, at which time the revenue impact of the rebound in activity begins to be felt. In addition, as the M A market begins to rebound, we are also seeing non-M A revenue opportunities within our capital solutions and restructuring businesses both of which are seeing client activity accelerate.In Asset Management, despite volatility in the market, the challenging interest rate environment and another surge in growth, mainly attributable to a select group of technology companies, we saw strong performance across many of our investment strategies and groups, including emerging markets, thematic and local strategies. While new money is being put to work, the appeal of short-term investments, T-bills and money market funds remain significant. As such, investor appetite to allocate cash to equities and risk assets remain subdued.Nonetheless, institutional investors are showing interest in our global quant and thematic strategies.Let's now turn to our future outlook for Lazard. In addition to our world-class brand, Lazard today has the potential to combine high-return future growth with a significant underlying degree of stability. Our growth will be built on a foundation of a resilient model that spans across businesses, products and regions and a structure that is more secure than one focused solely on M A in a specific geography.Last month, I outlined our objectives between now and 2030. Our growth will come from proactively leveraging our brand into new and expanded areas through talent development, lateral hires and inorganic additions, while concurrently managing our existing business even more efficiently. One important step on this path involves elevating our relevance through more involvement in top deals in Advisory, winning important mandates in Asset Management and leveraging our global insights with increased thought leadership and content-rich convening.Our Lazard 2030 vision also includes 2 specific and concrete goals for the firm to accomplish by the end of this decade. The first is to double revenue firm-wide by 2030, with the increases split roughly evenly between Asset Management and Financial Advisory, implying double-digit revenue growth annually on average. The second goal is for Lazard's total shareholder return to average 10  to 15  per year through 2030.Let me share a few more details on some of the specific actions we will take to reach these goals. Looking first at the Asset Management business, we have opportunities in both the core business and in adjacencies, and we intend to pursue these opportunities aggressively through both organic and targeted inorganic growth. Private asset managers with some degree of established track record, but that are still relatively early in their AUM progression are of particular interest in any programmatic M A for us over the coming years.We believe opportunities of this kind will combine the strength of our brand and distribution with the benefits from a fund manager's established investment performance, while optimizing shareholder value relative to the acquisition costs. We also see potential for Asset Management growth by investing in and expanding our distribution capabilities. Evan has been implementing a strategic plan to maximize the value of our global distribution platform, which includes increasing our client reach worldwide with a particular focus on financial intermediaries in the U.S. and Europe and regional expansion in Asia as well as engaging more effectively with our clients. Additionally, we have continued to develop a group of recently launched strategies with strong investment track records that are poised for growth, and we will continue to launch new ancillary products and vehicles to build upon our current investment capabilities and offerings.Turning to Financial Advisory. Multiple pathways will contribute to doubling our revenue over the next 7 years, including an expanded private capital efforts spanning our capital raising business, our new Lazard Capital Solutions practice, and more expensive M A fees from private equity. Among our M A clients, we see potential for growth in both the United States and Europe.One key differentiator is that Lazard has long been known for its exceptional insight into geopolitical events, and our ability to combine our business advice with an awareness of the geopolitical forces that could affect outcomes. That's all the more valuable to clients today, and our capabilities in this area have been reinforced by our outstanding geopolitical advisory team.Turning to specific sectors. Opportunities for us exist across many areas in North America, with particular growth potential in technology, industrials, power and energy and health care, while we continue to build on our historically strong positions in sectors such as financial institutions and real estate. We also see significant additional revenue opportunities in Europe, which would be accentuated by an expansion of U.S., Europe M A trade given our uniquely strong position in both continents. We are seeing increased interest among European companies seeking to acquire U.S. assets, and Lazard is well positioned to advise these clients.All of this will require Lazard to expand its ranks of managing directors. Some will come from internal promotions. We are unique among the independent advisory firms in having an established track record of being able to develop our own productive bankers. Part of the expansion will also come from more aggressive lateral hiring than Lazard has historically done in the past. One question may naturally be whether we can maintain our historical margin target as the market normalizes, which we expect to do, if we are also going to undertake a significant increase in our number of managing directors  The answer lies partially in our potential to raise productivity per MD. More specifically, if each of our Advisory MDs generates an additional  1 million in revenue, the effect is to free up more than  50 million in total each year to invest in new lateral hires without any adverse impact on our compensation margin.We are confident that with increased intensity, targeting of market opportunities, being paid appropriately for the exceptional work we do, expanded use of cutting-edge technology and more significant annual trimming of less productive MDs, we can substantially raise productivity over time. We also expect to benefit from the embedded growth in the disproportionately high share of our current MDs who are newly hired or newly promoted. Such a high productivity growth path is the best way to combine our traditional emphasis on excellence with our expanded revenue opportunities and ambitions. None of this will occur overnight, but with consistent effort, we are confident that we can achieve our 2030 goals.As we expand our business across asset management and financial advisory in the years ahead, I look forward to updating you on our progress over time. We will also find the right moment to provide you with more detailed plans and targets for between now and 2030 to help you measure how we are doing along the way.Over recent months, I've been traveling extensively to meet with Lazard investors and hear their thoughts about the firm. One of the clearest messages that has come through during this listening exercise is a widespread desire to see our corporate structure simplify. For that reason, we are announcing today that Lazard intends to convert its current structure to a new status as a U.S. corporation or C-Corp. We believe conversion to a C-Corp will simplify tax reporting, may act as a catalyst for enhanced shareholder ownership, and therefore, provide liquidity benefits for our stock. One significant change relative to our previous evaluations of such a conversion is that the tax benefit of our current structure is declining materially due to changes in global tax laws.Given the smaller tax impact than in the past, we believe that the benefits of conversion now outweigh those costs. We expect the conversion to take place on January 1, 2024, subject to compliance with global regulatory requirements.Lastly, as our 175th anniversary enters its final months, we are proud of our history and confident in our future. For the better part of 2 centuries, we have served as trusted advisers for our clients, providing an unparalleled level of expertise, insight and global reach. We have attracted and developed extraordinary talent, and we have evolved and adapted into a stronger and more resilient institution. It is our heritage, resilience and commitment to excellence that make the Lazard brand so extraordinary, and we now have an opportunity to combine that resilience in excellence with significant growth going forward. In the years ahead, we will leverage our brand, our global business model, the investments we are making and expect to make and the extraordinary calibre and commitment of our people to expand our business and take Lazard to new heights.Now let's open the call to questions.Operator Instructions  We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.I'd like to -- Peter, you laid out a lot there, and I'd love to drill down on some of it. I'd say since you've sort of announced your ambition to double revenue by 2030, which is roughly 7 years, I'd say the part where there's the most pushback is on the Asset Management side. In covering the industry, there's a lot of pressure, right  And the big example that people point to when thinking about your plans, which seem to combine both organic and inorganic opportunities as you referenced in your comments, would be Invesco. Over the past 7 years, Invesco has nearly doubled AUM. AUM is up 90 . So just about in line with your doubling ambition. But the problem is, is the revenue translation hasn't been there. Revenue is only up 30  over that time frame.So how are you thinking about the ways in which you can double the revenue over that timeframe despite the persistent fee rate pressure on this businessSure. Well, the way I would put it is we're not interested in growth for growth's sake, and we're not interested in AUM accumulation for the sake of accumulating AUM. Our goals here are to grow in a high-return way and in a way that enhances shareholder value. So the objectives are exactly the ones that you put forward. That having been said, we see significant opportunity within the existing business to continue to upgrade our performance in distribution, which will be helpful in maintaining our revenue and earnings streams. A good example is we're doing this call from the U.K., where we just held our Board meeting, both on the investment teams located here and on the distribution within the U.K., we've seen changes that have been occurring under Evan's leadership that's going to improve performance in both distribution and performance. So there's a lot that can be done there.And then on the inorganic side, we are interested in adjacencies where we see promise for revenue growth and for earnings growth over time. And so areas such as private credit, real estate and infrastructure are areas that we think will continue to attract capital allocation and -- because they are less liquid, continue to have a healthy degree of fee associated with them.The valuation delta, though, is a bit challenging here. So if you're going to be particularly looking to acquire and add teams and capabilities within some of those private credit and more alternative structures, how are you planning to finance that  Is the idea going to be, you said in your comments, lift-outs and smaller teams that don't have -- that have the good capabilities on the investment side, but don't have the other capabilities that you can add like distribution and scale and whatnot. So that seems clear, but is that going to be largely just cash deals that have earn-outs and so you're going to change maybe a capital return structure to be more embedded to allocating capital to growing some of these businesses  Or are you going to be adding leverage  Like what's your plan as far as financing these lift-outsSure. Well, first, I think in terms of the sweet spot of the kind of target zone, you have it basically right, which is we're looking for a salvage track records, but earlier in the AUM progression so that we can optimize shareholder value even post the acquisition cost because we think that's the right part of the growth trajectory to get maximum benefit from our brand and our distribution while also benefiting from the historical track record that target will have accumulated.With regard to the financing options, obviously, that's going to depend deal by deal. What I would say is we have 2 -- in normalized conditions, we have 2 very cash-generative businesses. One indicator of that is if you look at the buybacks that we've done beyond what's required, take the dividend out beyond that and then take out what's required to offset the dilution from our deferred compensation packages, we have bought back  1 billion of stock in additional buybacks over the past 4 years. So that's an indication of the firepower that would be available. We obviously also have equity. There are lots of options, earn-outs, et cetera. So I don't want to pin down exactly how we will finance the inorganic options other than to highlight that we have 2 very cash-generative businesses, and we can deploy our cash flow, at least in part towards value-enhancing inorganic growth.We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.So wanted to start off with a question on the C-Corp conversion. Peter, as you noted, prior management was reluctant to convert to a C-Corp, citing a significant potential increase in the tax rate. You noted some upcoming changes in the tax code would result in a more modest increase. I was hoping you could unpack what some of those changes were in the tax code that resulted in a more modest impact  How you determine that the benefits might outweigh the cost here  And what's the pro forma tax rate for the company following conversionSure. I'm going to do part of this and then Mary Ann will do another part. Stepping back here, as I laid out their pros and costs. We view the benefit of this is that it is something that investors and potential investors raise as something that would make the current structure being in a tenement toning Lazard and the conversion being a catalyst behind owning Lazard. So I think that's the benefit and there may be increased liquidity in our shares to the extent that there's expanded ownership and increased interest.The cost is primarily -- I mean there's some minor legal and administrative and other changes. But the cost is primarily a change in the effective tax rate. And that cost has come down. The impact on the effective tax rate is now in the low single digits as we move forward into a more normalized environment. And before I turn it over to Mary Ann for a little bit more detail, what I would also say, in addition to our judgment that the benefits now outweigh the cost, we also hope that this shows that we are increasingly listening to our shareholders. This came up repeatedly in my discussions with them, and also acting decisively to pursue the shareholder value that we've articulated we want to achieve over time. But why don't I turn it over to Mary Ann for any additional comments.Sure. So I mean as you can imagine, this stuff is incredibly complicated. So I'll try to sort of keep it high level. But generally, one of the things that's changed since we put the structure in place is that the U.S. tax rate has come down. And so if you think about sort of the incremental costs of becoming a U.S. corporation, the U.S. tax rate is one of the factors. Additionally, the sort of global alignment of tax regimes and the global minimum tax that's going to be coming online in various places over the next couple of years makes that delta even smaller. And so as we looked at that and we did sort of a range of scenario analyses, looking at different earnings mix and levels of pretax earnings over the next few years, we were able to determine that, that estimated range was really in the low single digits. And as Peter said, that's where we determined that, that was the time to act.And it looks like I have a similar problem to brunt in. I have a load of questions I want to ask to limit it to just one on the comment you made, Peter, regarding milestones or checkpoints that you're going to offer along the way ahead of the 2030 bogey or targets that you had outlined. I was hoping you can give us some context in terms of what are some of the milestones that you're hoping to lay out that we can hold management accountable toWell, we'll find the right time to do that. We want to do that when there are some stepping stones and proof points already in hand. And so it's not just plans, but you're starting to see the beginning of action also. But I think you should expect the normal things that 1 would look to in terms of monitoring how the business is operating. So beyond revenue and earnings things like how we're expanding in the growth areas that we see, and on the Asset Management side of the business, how we're doing on improving performance within the existing business and moving into adjacencies.Any numbers you can put behind it, PeterAt the right moment, yes, and now is not the right moment.We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Capital -- Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Peter, just on your comments around funding future MD headcount growth with improved productivity, can you kind of discuss kind of what your analysis was to kind of feel comfortable that whether it's  1 million or more in terms of per MD improvement  You feel comfortable that's achievable relative to whether it's competitor analysis or how you're thinking about itSure. Let me start with, I think, a really important point, which I also briefly mentioned, which is, we have a significant amount of embedded growth and also productivity enhancement that will come from the disproportionate share of Managing Directors today who are just ramping up the productivity curve. So in normal years, historically going back, we've had about 30  or so of our managing directors being in that kind of new category, either lateral or newly promoted. Today, it's 40 . That 10  differential is a very large change. Those people, the newer people are disproportionately in areas that we see as exciting opportunities going forward, our Lazard Capital Solutions group, a revamped effort in Germany, expanded coverage of private capital, large investments in biotech and energy, our new team in the Middle East and then also our geopolitical team, which is best-in-class on Wall Street and is leading -- it is reinforcing Lazard's historical dominance in firms that are looking for the combination of business and geopolitical insight.And I think in today's world, that's an extremely valuable thing. So the first part is just depreciation for the embedded growth and productivity pop, if you will, that we have as they move forward in their ramp. The second is the -- all the various things that I mentioned. It's not going to be 1 thing, but many different things from the fees that we charge to more aggressive culling of less productive tenured MDs. So actually, just to return to the former topic. One of the reasons why we have that different mix today, part of it is the investments that I just mentioned, the new lateral hires and also newly promoted managing directors in those areas. But partly, it's also we have started earlier this year, and we will continue to do this to be extremely rigorous about culling lower productivity managing directors each year. After a sufficiently sufficient period of time, if a banker is not -- I've talked about being commercial and collegial. Both of those are super important. And if we have some who's not living up to either end of that, Lazard is not going to be the right place for them.So multiple different pathways, but mostly, it comes back to excited about the areas that we're investing in. Some embedded growth already that may not be apparent above the surface, and then really active management and being very committed to achieving the productivity improvement that will create the flywheel of reinforcement -- reinforcing resources that allow us to do another round of investments. Maybe just on the follow-up on -- I know it's not an easy question or one you can put a hard number on. But I think everyone is struggling with the timing of the revenue rebound if we get it and comp ratios and you guys are cutting 10  of your headcount. Is there a way for us to box around next year in terms of whether it's an absolute dollar amount of comp that needs to be accrued or just how to think about the parameters for the comp ratioLet me give you a little bit on the outlook and then maybe Mary Ann will do something on the comp ratio. As you note, you asked an impossible question, so thank you for acknowledging that. What I would say is we do expect -- just based on the constructive dialogue among clients, we expect '24 to be better than '23. The question becomes how much, and that's very difficult to predict right now. I do think there are reasons that we believe Lazard has some advantages relative to the market. So one way of thinking about it is whatever your view is of the market, why could Lazard potentially perform better than that without taking a view on exactly when the market completions pick up. And I'd point to a few. One is the investment in our coverage of private capital at large, especially our Lazard Capital Solutions, which is getting a significant amount of demand and creating the positive flywheel effect that we were hoping for from creating that group. The second is our excellence in geopolitical. In today's world, I think it's clear that it's impossible to make a significant business decision without insight into geopolitics. Lazard is always -- it's part of our DNA to stand out along that domain and all the more so with our first-in-class geopolitical advisory team.The third is that to the extent that the Europe, U.S. M A trade does pick up, that's something that Lazard has, given that we're strong in both continents, we'll naturally benefit from. And then the fourth is what I mentioned with regard to the elevated share of newer MDs. So those are some reasons why you may see different performance from Lazard relative to the market. But with regard to the market as a whole, it's, as you pointed out, almost impossible to know. I would just go back to what I said earlier, which is there clearly is a shift in the tone of client discussions that are more constructive today than they were 6 or 9 months ago. Mary Ann, you want to commentYes. I'll take the invitation of the comp ratio. So I mean you're seeing this year the effects not only of lower revenues but also of the sort of lagged deferrals that we had in '21 and '22, '21 being a record year of revenue. So we have sort of elevated comp that's deferred into this year, and we'll continue to see some of that in '24 as well. But I really do think it's going to come down to the revenues in that, as Peter laid out, we're hopeful but there's uncertainty there. So the cuts that we designed earlier this year were really meant to create the room, not only to invest in areas where we see growth, but also to allow us to get back to our target ranges when the revenues have normalized. And so that's sort of still how we're thinking about it, and we're going to see how revenues -- how quickly revenues come back.We'll take our next question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks. Just wanted to follow up on that comp ratio commentary. So you mentioned that a component of the revenue growth plan is to expand MD count partially from promotions, partially from lateral hires. Can you just give us an update on what the recruiting environment is like  I know earlier in the year, we've been hearing from the peer group that it was a strong recruiting environment. Does recent optimism on M A rebound may get harder to recruit  And could that put more pressure on the comp ratio near termSo we're in the midst of active discussions -- well, first, I'd note we have, again, the embedded growth that I mentioned before from the MDs in key areas that are ramping up. But with regard to the new lateral hires, active discussions. We've been adding, for example, in restructuring. We just had a new restructuring MD join start in Europe and there're others coming. The issue is that we're very -- we're selective in making sure that our lateral hires are a good cultural fit and also in the areas where obviously we want to expand. And then also in areas -- and productive in those areas, clearly. And then also at the right expectation with regard to their compensation. And so I won't comment on what other people are doing, that's their business. But with regard to ours, we're very comfortable with the tenor of the discussions we're having, the attractiveness of the Lazard platform going forward. There's a lot of interest in joining Lazard from a wide array of different bankers, and we are going to be selective in the matching function to make sure that we wind up maximizing the chances that the fit is a good one. And I think we can do that in a shareholder-friendly and growth-enhancing way.Only other thing I'd finally say is I want to really emphasize the point I made about our ability to grow our own talent and to create productive bankers through internal promotion. We stand out in having a long history of being able to do that. While you should expect going forward from us is that continued excellence in internal talent development, coupled with more aggressive lateral hiring than we may have done during some historical periods.And just on the comment of eventually getting back to target range on the comp ratio once revenue environment normalizes. Is that still mid to high 50sYes, it is.We'll take our next question from James Yaro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.I just want to start first with the impact of the U.S. elections next year, and what that could mean for both of your businessesLook, I'd say the U.S. election at this point is something that comes up in the first 5 minutes of client discussions before you turn to the actual matter that you're discussing. I expect that as we move into 2024 more fully, the time allocated to that topic will increase a bit. But again, when I said the tone of client discussions have turned more constructive, that's the dominant factor. And obviously, as we move into 2024, the U.S. election, I think, will be another thing that generates demand for our geopolitical insights, but we don't see it right now having a massive effect on the trajectory that we're looking at in either business.That's very constructive. Maybe just turning to the asset management business again. I just wanted to touch on the financing for potential acquisitions once more. How are you thinking about your leverage levels today  And would you contemplate adding to these to fund any potential dealsWell, we're comfortable that we have 2 very cash-generative businesses. The number I gave you, for example, on the amount of buybacks that we've done above the dilution offset over the past 4 years is indicative of that. And so that provides some perspective on the cash flow that we have available. That having been said, I don't want to rule out any options. It will depend on the particular target. If we were to hypothetically finance part of an acquisition through additional debt, obviously, we would be motivated to reduce that leverage quickly over time as 1 would expect in any M A transaction. But I think we've got lots of options available to us moving forward.We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Just want to start kind of first big picture question. Lazard, founded in 1848. Most of your independent peers were founded over the past couple of decades. I think many of them would argue that they built their firms off of a blank piece of paper and so that allows for a much more efficient cost structure just as you go. And so I just want to talk a little bit about kind of the expense structure. So obviously, you have expense initiatives underway, and I hear you on kind of getting back to more normalized margins. But when you think about the overall infrastructure of Lazard today, the whole global footprint or even mix of kind of where you have offices, do you see, over time, kind of more opportunity to get more efficient around the expense structure or even maybe more dynamic on expenses as you move forward hereLet me say a couple of things. First, there were significant adjustments that we've made, not all of which have been fully implemented yet because it takes a while sometimes to close offices in other countries. But we did take a very careful look at places that we didn't think would meet our productivity hurdles, and we'll continue to do that. Now I think, at its core, Lazard has always been harkening back to that. History has always been deep in Europe and the U.S., and that defines Lazard in some way, and that will continue. But we're going to be aggressive about making sure that we're only in places where we think we can expand in a high productivity way because I think that's what leads to a model that works over time on behalf of our bankers and our shareholders, and allows us to serve our clients with excellence that they have come to expect from Lazard.The only other thing I'd say about expenses is we will the laser -- we are going to be aggressively pursuing an agenda of making sure that we're as lean as possible because we see that as a -- and delayering. It's one reason why I didn't replace myself as Head of Advisory. We see an opportunity for not only lower cost ratios from leaner teams, but also better experiences for our people. We have extremely talented people, and we believe that with more running room for each participant on a mandate, the talent development and experience is better on behalf of our clients.So we are continuing to take -- just to return to your question, continue to take a careful look at each office and each geography. At its core Lazard has always been strong in Europe and the U.S., don't expect that to change, and we're committed to being as lean as possible moving forward.And Peter, I guess another one for you. So you've been CEO here for just a few weeks now, but already some pretty marked changes around, I think, both communications, but also shareholder matters like the C-Corp structure announced today and something that many of us have been talking to our clients about and running about for years. So obviously, in a few weeks, a lot changing. From a cultural perspective, what do you want your legacy to be both kind of inside and outside Lazard  And what, if anything, do you see changing around the brand or culture as you implement some of these changesClearly, you have a firm that has effectively hundreds of years of history, but at the same time, these are big changes and things that are relatively dynamic. So just want to get a sense from you how you're thinking about kind of your legacy as well.Appreciate the question. I would say, look, what we are trying to do here as we pursue these Lazar 2030 goals is pursue growth in an ambitious and aggressive way, but also in a way that is high return and high productivity and to act decisively when it's clear that something is shareholder enhancing. So that's really what we hope we're starting to demonstrate, but it's obviously early days, and we plan to continue to demonstrate that.With regard to internal culture, I've really emphasized the combination of being commercial and collegial. Both parts of that are super important to the pathway forward. And that means being aggressive on behalf of our clients and ambitious on behalf of our clients, but it also means acting like a team and treating one another with respect. And I think that's what I would hope the legacy will be.And our next questions will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.I was just so excited to get my follow-up questions in. Here we go. So the -- how should we think about MD -- Advisory MD headcount by year-end  You have announced plans to make some reductions. But so far versus year-end, year-end was, I believe, the numbers we have out of the filings, 212 at year-end last year. And now in the Q -- for 2Q it was 227. So maybe where do we stand on advisory MDs now  Where do you expect by year-end  And then what -- how should we be thinking about the trajectory of that MD count given your plans for productivity enhancementSure. First, let me say, we are -- before I turn to MDs, we are on target to hit our goal of reducing headcount by 10  measured from the first quarter of 2020 the to the first quarter of 2020. Overall, that's not specific to MD. Second, before I get -- actually answer your question, just a little bit of framing, which is, again, really focused on in the year-end process, having high bars on being commercial and collegial or higher bars so that following the pandemic went for natural reasons. There might have been a bit more of a generous policy with regard to remaining at Lazard. We are very focused on raising productivity and making sure that people are collaborative moving forward.Then with regard to your specific question, you'll see in the Q, for this quarter, a number of 15, that will come down already with regard -- that includes some people who will be departing, but they are still counted in the Q. And by year-end, it will be down from that, again, consistent with our overall goal of a 10  headcount adjustment.And then you -- part of your plans, Peter, include internal development and so -- and enhancing productivity, right  So what I'd be curious about, have you gone through the exercise of breaking down that MD count, right, a little over 200 by like strata. In other words, x percent produce,  8 plus million or  10-plus million, right, whereas -- and then there's the middle strata and then there's a lower strata. And so I guess the 10  reduction is going to be very heavily focused on that lower strata. And then also, have you looked at of the promotes how many are able to get into that top tier. And what can you learn about their journey in order to ensure the promotions are as effective as possibleExcellent question. So a few comments. Again, just a reminder about the 40  that are not -- that are still ramping, which is an extra roughly 20 managing directors with embedded productivity kind of ahead. You won't be surprised to know that we do exhaustive analysis of productivity at the individual level by quintile, by quartile, et cetera. I don't think it's appropriate to share those numbers here. But like in any organization, you're going to have a skew to that distribution. And we are, therefore, really focused on giving people some time to become productive. And everyone can have -- everyone from time to time will have an off year. If over a prolonged period of time, a matter of several years, either the collegiality or the productivity is not there, we're going to part company with the managing directors.That was a core kind of filter for the adjustments that we did make earlier in the year, and it will be a core filter going forward. Then with regard to the kind of the productivity ramp, if you will, and what we can learn from past experience on people who are promoted and also lateral hires, we have invested in a significant amount of analysis around that question. I think we are getting better. There's always going to be some degree of uncertainty because until someone is actually in a seat, it's always a little bit hard. There's always some uncertainty around that. But we feel confident that we have some of the markers for what ups the odds or makes it less likely for someone to be productive on our platform.Thank you. And this now concludes Lazard's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T12:06:04.000-04:00
A Resurgence Of Nuclear Energy?,"As of 2022, nuclear power wasPer the International Energy Agency  IEA , in the last 50 years, nuclear energy has averted over 60 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions - approximately equal to two years  worth of total energy-related emissions worldwide.Nuclear energy s consistent power output offers an efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuels and a solution to escalating energy demands, especially in rural regions where access to electricity remains sparse.Moreover, nuclear plants, unlike intermittent renewables such as wind and solar, maintain nearly full capacity operations. This ensures power delivery even during extreme weather conditions - anSource  Energy Institute. Data as of December 2022.The world's nuclear infrastructure is aging, with many reactors nearing their design end-of-life. The premature decommissioning of these reactors might disrupt energy transition plans, potentially leading to an additional 4 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions, per the IEA.Substituting nuclear capacity with renewables like wind or solar would demand an unparalleled deployment pace. The decline in nuclear power could also require an extra  1.6 trillion in investments from advanced economies, translating to higher consumer electricity prices.Importantly, in many scenarios   on a levelized cost basis over several decades   prolonging a reactor's lifespan is estimated to be more economical than constructing new renewable energy infrastructures.The nuclear sector is far from static  it's evolving. The spotlight on technology development in the space is currently on Small Modular Reactors  SMRs  which promise heightened efficiency, affordability, and flexibility.Their compact size and enhanced safety attributes make them highly adaptable, even holding the potential to replace older fossil fuel units.The market for SMRs, at present, is projected to grow to around  6.8 billion by 2030  around a 2.3  compound annual growth rate , with companies like NuScale Power  and BWX Technologies  at the forefront.Certain SMR designs have the capability to recycle existing nuclear waste as fuel. Additionally, nuclear fusion, the energy source of the sun and stars, is undergoing intensive research.Companies like Helion Energy and Nucor  are collaborating to harness this immense power. And on the tech frontier, giants like Microsoft  are exploring nuclear energy to power energy-intensive operations like artificial intelligence.Uranium prices have seen considerable fluctuations recently. Factors like long lead times for mining projects, reduced capital expenditure on new sources, existing supply deficits, and geopolitical tensions, notably in Europe, have driven prices upward.These dynamics are influencing the broader industry. Utility companies are grappling with escalating costs, whereas uranium miners are poised to gain, attracting increased investor interest.Source  S P Global Market Intelligence. Data as of October 2022.Source  S P Global Market Intelligence. Data as of October 2022.A glance at Japan provides a lens into the evolving nuclear narrative. After the Fukushima disaster, Japan curtailed its nuclear operations. However, faced with the global energy crisis and geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Japan is reviving its nuclear reactors, marking a significant policy pivot.Other nations like Germany, Belgium, and India are also re-evaluating their nuclear strategies. As countries grapple with energy security and decarbonization, nuclear energy, with its promise of reliability and zero emissions, is regaining prominence.The drive towards decarbonization, coupled with geopolitical shifts, has elevated nuclear energy's significance in the energy transition narrative.

Warren Buffett's Simple Path To Wealth: 'Just Sit And Think',"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway  once He also These quotes are very relevant to investors today given the current rhetoric and volatility gripping markets right now. In this article, we will look more closely at the meaning and implications of Mr. Buffett's quotes and then share how it is impacting our investment decision-making process right now.The two aforementioned WarrenWith the AI boom, rising interest rates, uncertainty about the future direction of inflation, a wall of corporate and commercial real estate debt maturing in the coming years, signs of cracks beginning to form in the economy, and two ongoing major regional conflicts in Ukraine and Israel that are threatening to expand into much broader conflicts, there is plenty to get crazy about in today's stock market. As a result, many investors are tempted to react impulsively to these trends by selling their plummeting REITs , utilities , and other high-yielding dividend growth stocks and instead put it all into the soaring technology stocks that are benefiting from the AI boom like NVIDIA , Palantir , and Meta However, Buffett's quote reminds us that such emotional reactions can be detrimental to one's long-term financial success.Instead, the Oracle of Omaha urges investors to adopt a calm and rational approach by ignoring the market's maniacal behavior, driven by a myriad of factors such as news events, emotions, and speculation. Instead of constantly chasing the hot stock or sector of the moment, Buffett suggests that investors should keep their emotions in check and stay focused on their long-term investment goals. Many times, this involves simply doing nothing even when our greatest emotional urges tell us to sell all of our losers and chase the market's recent winners.'Sitting and thinking' can also help an investor not succumb to impulsive decisions and instead stick to a well-thought-out investment strategy with the long-term in view. Successful stock market investing is not about outperforming the market every day, week, month, or even every year. It is about buying good businesses at discounts to their intrinsic value and then being willing to sit back and wait patiently until the market gives you an attractive offer for your business.As a high-yield dividend investor, this approach is even psychologically easier for me since I can keep my focus on the passive income stream rather than the daily market value of my portfolio. Since I view my portfolio as a cash flow machine, at the end of the day I crave market volatility since it often provides me with opportunities to separate myself from the pack by behaving in a contrarian manner and accelerating the growth of my passive income snowball.Rather than changing my investment strategy with each new bubble - which would have required me to be a Bitcoin maniac  in 2018-2019, a disruptive technology  maniac in 2020-2021, and an AI bull in 2022-2023  - and risk buying the top and selling the bottom each time, I have chosen the simpler and more boring path of buying highly profitable businesses that pay out attractive dividends to shareholders whenever they fall out of favor with Mr. Market. This approach requires me to  do nothing  through the ever-shifting cycles of market manias and panics and instead reinvest my dividends into whatever the most attractively priced dividend stocks are at the time. For me - and Mr. Buffett - time in the market is far more important than timing the market. As my passive income snowball grows ever larger, its rate of growth also accelerates due to having more passive income to reinvest each quarter, resulting in an exponential growth curve for my income stream.So how is that translating into my investment decisions today  Well, given that the majority of my portfolio is invested in utilities, yield cos, REITs, midstream, and other infrastructure - almost all of whom have traded down in recent weeks and months while tech stocks  have been mostly soaring - my focus is on  doing nothing  to my long-term investing approach of building a passive income snowball. Instead, I am rejoicing in the opportunity that the market is giving me to buy high-quality dividend stocks on sale, accelerating my passive income snowball's growth in the process.Some of my favorite opportunities of the moment includeAs the market becomes increasingly bifurcated by the day between the soaring AI stocks and the crashing value and dividend stocks, and geopolitical tensions mount, economic pressures increase, investors are facing growing temptation to give in to the market's maniacal behavior and be swept away by their emotions. However, I believe it is more prudent to listen to the sage wisdom of Warren Buffett and  do nothing  instead and continue to snatch up attractively priced, quality dividend stocks at deep discounts. Time spent remaining patiently compounding one's passive income stream in the market is a much sounder path to wealth than constantly trying to time the market.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Here is why the Middle East conflict is increasing market risk for the oil industry,"Peter Tchir, Academy Securities  head of Macro Strategy wrote in a report published on Wednesday that he is increasing the market risk assessment on the issues caused by the Middle East conflict.He highlighted three pointsFirst, Tchir said that AcademyA  blind eye  on that belief would allow Iran to continue to sell oil despite sanctions, and energy production and transportation issues would be expected.Secondly, Saudi Arabia would not increase oil production at this time, he wrote.They could likely increase production when the barrel is priced above  100, Tchir said,  but only after they have seen how the Israeli response develops.And thirdly, when it comes to the war between the State of Isarel and Hamas, he said that the risk of  something bad occurring  during operations is higher than he would admit.The Geopolitical Intelligence Group said that  we need to be prepared for the risk of some event that creates a new uproar of anger towards Israel,  Tchir said.  The market is somewhat aware of this, but I continue to believe that we are all downplaying this risk.Crude Oil Futures  are up 9.93  year-to-date.Oil ETFs are also generally up",7,2023-10-18T14:08:35.000-04:00
Carpenter Technology Corporation (CRS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Carpenter Technology Corporation  Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 10 00 AM ETJohn Huyette - VP of IR and Corporate DevelopmentTony Thene - President and CEOTimothy Lain - SVP and CFOElizabeth Huseynov - TD CowenJosh Sullivan - The Benchmark CompanyChris Olin - Northcoast ResearchMichael Leshock - KeyBanc Capital MarketsGood day, and welcome to the Carpenter Technology Corporation First Quarter 2024 Fiscal Year Financial Results Conference Call.  Operator Instructions  Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Huyette, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Carpenter Technology earnings conference call for the fiscal 2024 first quarter ended September 30, 2023. This call is also being broadcast over the Internet, along with presentation slides. Please note, for those of you listening by phone you may experience a time delay in slide movement. Speakers on the call today are Tony Thene, President and Chief Executive Officer  and Tim Lain, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Statements made by management during this earnings presentation that are forward-looking statements are based on current expectations. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements can be found in Carpenter Technology's most recent SEC filings, including the company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 and the exhibits attached to that filing.Please note, that in the following discussion, unless otherwise noted, when management discuss the sales or revenue that reference excludes surcharge. When referring to operating margins that is based on adjusted operating income, excluding special items and sales excluding surcharge.I will now turn the callThank you, John. And good morning to everyone on the call today.I will begin on Slide 4 with a review of our safety performance. For the first quarter fiscal year 2024, our total case incident rate was 2.1. This rate has been elevated over the last severalNow let's turn to Slide 5, and a review of the first quarter. On our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and signaled operating income was expected to be flat or slightly up sequentially, even though we outperformed the fourth quarter expectations.At first quarter guidance represented a meaningful improvement compared to the historical trend of a sequential decline in profits, in the first quarter of a fiscal year. Building on our operating momentum, we exceeded that guidance and reported first quarter operating income of  69 million, a 10  increase sequentially.Most notably, the SAO segment exceeded expectations for the quarter, delivering  80.8 million in operating income, above the outlook we provided of  72 million to  77 million. Further, SAO realized an adjusted operating margin of 19.4 , growing from 16.8  in the previous quarter. This impressive margin expansion came as a result of targeted improvement in product mix, higher realized prices and continued focus on productivity.We continue to realize price gains on both contractual and transactional business. As evidenced at the beginning of October, we announced another price increase of 7  to 12  on our SAO transactional business.We also generated  7.4 million of cash from operations during the quarter, maintaining a healthy liquidity of  366.4 million. Finally, we are positioned at a strong demand environment across our end use markets where our material solutions are valued by our customers.Now let's take a closer look at our demand outlook on Slide 6. Carpenter Technology produces specialized highly engineered products that are essential to the functioning of critical applications across the aerospace, defense, medical and other end use markets.Our unique collection of assets and capabilities to produce these products are not easily replicated. And it required decades of experience to generate the high quality needed to meet stringent industry standards. Demand for our difficult to manufacture products is exceeding industry supply and we see tangible evidence of this.Our backlog continues to grow, setting new records every quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, our backlog was up 5  sequentially and 32  year-over-year. We continue to raise prices with our most recent announcement earlier this month of a 7  to 12  increase on our SAO transactional business.Lead times remain at record levels and could be even longer as we are actively managing incoming orders and customers continue to tell us their primary concern is surety of supply, asking when they can book more with us. We expect this demand environment to remain strong.In aerospace, OEMs continue to work to increase build rates, targeting levels exceeding pre-pandemic highs. Defense demand, already growing is projected to accelerate due to geopolitical events. Medical demand continues on a steady climb due to strong trends such as aging population and focus on patient outcomes. And demand for our premium products in our other markets is also projected to remain high due to ongoing energy investment needs, light duty vehicle builds and semiconductor capacity expansion.As always, there is active discussion in the general marketplace about near-term demand. For example, even most recently this week, some aerospace OEMs discussing build rate target adjustments and ongoing delivery challenges within the supply chain, or the impact of disruption to vehicle manufacturing associated with workers strikes.What we can affirm is that these issues are not affecting our general demand levels. We remain oversubscribed in terms of demand with customers generally wanting more than we can produce. We have a substantial backlog of orders with material wanted sooner, even as we work to increase output. We also see unexpected emergency demand from areas like medical and defense associated with current world events, are from aerospace associated with spares need.What you are hearing from the marketplace is an affirmation of the strong demand in the near term and the long-term. Beyond the near term, our customers also continue to partner with us on our strategic growth efforts.Medical innovations, next generation defense platforms and electrification are examples of areas where customers are partnering with us to develop their next-generation products. In this demand environment, we are well positioned to continue to drive topline growth while expanding our margins through productivity improvements, product mix optimization and higher prices.Now let's review first quarter sales performance. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, sales decreased sequentially and increased significantly year-over-year. The year-over-year performance reflects our significant productivity gains. As anticipated, volumes decreased sequentially due to fewer operating days, planned preventive maintenance activity and most importantly targeted mix management.Importantly, profitability improved in the quarter, resulting in a sequential increase in our operating income on lower sales. Notably, SAO's adjusted operating margin was 19.4  in the quarter, up from 16.8  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The profit margin expanded through a combination of productivity efforts, price increases and strategic mix management. This means we are actively allocating capacity to the areas where we add the most value.We serve critical applications across all of our end use markets, and apply ongoing strategic mix management and how we serve them to capitalize on the higher margin products. Our profitability has been increasing over the previous quarters and will continue to improve with higher pricing, product mix optimization and continued productivity improvements.Now, I will turn it over to Tim for the financial summary.Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone.I'll start on Slide 9, the income statement summary. Net sales in the first quarter were  651.9 million net sales excluding surcharge totaling  492.8 million. Sales excluding surcharge increased 31  from the same period a year ago on 12  higher volume. Sequentially, sales were down 12  on 18  lower volume. The year-over-year increase was driven by significant productivity gains to meet growing demand.As Tony mentioned earlier, the lower sales and volumes sequentially were primarily the result of fewer operating days and planned preventative maintenance activities, necessary to ensure our equipment continues to perform at high levels. Gross profit was  124.1 million in the current quarter compared to  54.8 million in the same quarter of last year and  119 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gross profit in the current quarter is up 126  compared to the same quarter last year and up 4  sequentially.SG A expenses were  55.1 million in the first quarter, up about  9 million from the same period a year ago, and roughly  1 million lower sequentially. The increase in SG A expenses versus the same quarter last year is primarily driven by headcount and higher variable compensation accruals. The SG A line includes corporate costs, which totaled  20.9 million in the recent first quarter.As we look ahead to the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect corporate costs to be similar to the first quarter at about  21 million. Operating income was  69 million in the current quarter compared to  8.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and  62.9 million in our recent fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.The sequential improvement in operating income, up 10  was driven by our productivity efforts, actions we took to manage product mix, as well as the benefits realized from higher base prices. As a result of these actions, we continue to see profit margin improve with total company adjusted operating margin reaching 14  up from 11.2  in the previous quarter.Moving onto our effective tax rate. For the recent first quarter our effective tax rate was 16.1  which is below our expected full year effective tax rate of roughly 22  to 24 . The lower effective tax rate was driven by tax benefits recognized in the current quarter related to certain share-based compensation awards. Note, that tax benefits were worth approximately  0.07 per share relative to the guidance we provided.As we look ahead to the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect the effective tax rate to return to a more normalized rate of about 24 . We affect our full year effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 to be in line with the range we previously communicated of 22  to 24 . Earnings per share for the current quarter was  0.88 per share. The results demonstrate our continued momentum supported by improving profitability and a strong demand environment.Now turning to Slide 10 and our SAO segment results. Net sales for the first quarter were  570.1 million, were  417.3 million excluding surcharge. Compared to the same period last year net sales excluding surcharge increased 37  on 12  higher volumes. Sequentially, net sales excluding surcharge decreased 13  on 19  lower volumes.The year-over-year improvement in net sales was driven by higher shipment volumes due to productivity gains, the impacts of higher prices and an improving product mix across our key end use markets, as Tony reviewed on the market slide. Sequentially, lower volumes as anticipated were impacted by the planned preventative maintenance, fewer operating days and the deliberate actions to improve product mix.Moving to operating results. SAO reported operating income of  80.8 million in our recent first quarter which outpaced our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, SAO operating income improvement of  61 million is largely due to higher sales, driven by strong demand, higher prices and increased production levels.On a sequential basis, operating income improved by about  1 million. Again, our operating income results improved despite the lower volumes. This improvement was largely the result of the positive impact of targeted mix improvements, higher prices and realized production efficiencies. The improvements in productivity, product mix and pricing are evident in the adjusted operating margin, which has increased to 19.4  in the current period as compared with 6.5  in the same period a year ago and 16.8  sequentially.Looking ahead, the SAO team remains focused on executing actions to further increase production levels and production flow and to actively manage the product mix to maximize the capacity for high-value products. Based on current expectations, we anticipate SAO will generate operating income in the range of  78 million to  82 million in the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024.Now turning to Slide 11 and our PEP segment results. Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were  101.8 million or  93.1 million excluding surcharge revenue. Net sales excluding surcharge increased 6  from the same quarter last year and decreased 13  sequentially.The year-over-year growth in net sales was driven by strong demand conditions, primarily in our Dynamet Titanium business. More specifically in our Dynamet Titanium business, the growth in net sales from the same quarter a year ago was driven by materials used in medical applications.In the current quarter, PEP reported operating income of  9.1 million. This compares to operating income of  6.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and operating income of  5.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The increase in operating income in the current quarter is primarily the result of improving profitability in our Dynamet business.Similar to SAO, Dynamet continues to focus on improving productivity to meet strong demand in the aerospace and defense and medical end use markets for our titanium products. We currently anticipate that the PEP segment will deliver operating income in the range of  9.5 million to  10.5 million for the upcoming second quarter of fiscal year 2024.Now turning to Slide 12 and a review of adjusted free cash flow. In the current quarter, we generated  7.4 million of cash from operating activities, compared to  174.9 million in our recent fourth quarter and cash used for operating activities of  78 million in the same quarter last year.On a year-over-year basis, the cash from operations was significantly influenced by higher profitability and less pronounced inventory build as we continue to improve productivity and product flow across our operations. In the first quarter of last year, we built  121 million of inventory as compared with  68 million of inventory built in the current first quarter.In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we spent  22 million on capital expenditures. We continue to expect to spend a total of about  125 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024. With those details in mind, we reported negative adjusted free cash flow of  15 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our liquidity remains healthy and we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of  366 million including  18 million of cash and  348 million of available borrowings under our credit facility.With that, I'll turn the call back to Tony.Thanks, Tim.Now let's review the key takeaways from today's call. We realized 10  sequential growth in operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. This was a meaningful improvement compared to the historical trend of a sequential decline in profits, in the first quarter as a fiscal year. And we outperformed our previous guidance.The strong quarterly performance is indicative of the demand environment and our ongoing operating momentum. The SAO segment exceeded expectations with operating income of  80.8 million and adjusted operating margin of 19.4  in the first quarter. SAO continues to build momentum with increased productivity, higher prices and improved product mix.We are operating in a strong demand environment for our material solutions with positive near and long-term outlooks in our end use markets. This is demonstrated in our record backlogs. Long lead times and customer focus on a security of supply.Our strong first quarter financial performance combined with the second quarter guidance would result in one of the two highest first half financial results in the history of the company. Building on that first half momentum, we project second half fiscal year 2024 operating income to be 28  to 35  higher in the first half.Let's take a closer look at the second half outlook on the next slide. As evidenced by our recent performance, we've seen meaningful increases in our productivity over the last several quarters, especially in SAO. However, we still have plenty of runway, as we have yet to return to our pre-COVID operating rates in some of our key work centers. We continue to invest in training and mentoring programs for our shop-floor employees to safely drive productivity gains, while maintaining our high quality standards.But most importantly, we have certain key work centers, which have not been running at their full potential as our mix continues to shift to more difficult to manufacture products. We expect meaningful increases in productivity at these specific units in the second half of this fiscal year. This next level increase in productivity, combined with continued realization of higher pricing and improvement in product mix should drive operating margins even higher in the second half of fiscal year 2024.Now let's take a look at how this fits in with the longer-term earnings growth projections. As I've detailed in previous calls, our goal is to double fiscal year 2019 operating income by fiscal year 2027. These figures imply a 40  compounded annual growth rate on the operating income from fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027, a very strong growth target. I've also noted that this growth was not going to be back-end loaded and that we expected to make significant progress towards our goal in fiscal year 2024.As you can see with what we expect for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are setting ourselves up to take a meaningful step towards our longer-term goal. With estimated fiscal year 2024 operating income in the range of  310 million to  330 million, we expect to realize approximately 50  of the opportunity in fiscal year 2024.This level of performance, would be the highest annual profitability in the history of the company and we are working to accelerate productivity gains and capacity to push earnings even higher. This is an exciting time for Carpenter Technology. The near-term and long-term demand outlook is strong across our end use markets for our broad portfolio of specialized solutions.We have leading capabilities with a difficult to replicate system of assets and we continue to drive improved productivity to unlock additional capacity to capture demand. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue to drive growth and achieve our long-term operating income goal.Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to the operator.Operator Instructions  The first question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Good morning. This is Liz Huseynov on for Gotham. And I was just wondering if you can provide any detail about order trends in the quarter by aero end market for instance fasteners versus engine versus other structuresYes. Good morning. I'll take that question. Aerospace engine sales were up 43  year-over-year, down 8  sequentially. So, even though down 8  sequentially due to the items that we noted in our prepared remarks, the quarterly shipments are about 90  of pre-pandemic engine ship rate.So, bottom line is that engine sales remain strong and were oversubscribed and the ramp pushed -- as the ramp pushes demand even higher, well beyond pre-pandemic levels. On fasteners, sales up 7.7  year-over-year and down sequentially about 13  same story there as engines. So, hopefully that's helpful.Yes, thank you. And then, is there any incremental weakness to demand in non-aero markets given the macroWell, certainly, you've heard, you know, commentary out there in the market around the general industrial market and I can comment on that. That is a, that's a limited portion of our sales. That's used to support that general industrial activity. Those trends are not material meaningful to our bottom line as our focus is really on high value difficult to manufacture products, where demand is currently outstripping supply by quite a bit. So, as you know our portfolio consists of premium high value products and you know any type of weakness in those submarkets will not impact our bottom line materially in the short-term or the near term.Okay. Thank you. And then just one more. Can you give any color on which work centers have the most opportunity for productivity gainsYes, it's a good question. It's a really good question. The biggest driver certainly is on the front end of our, our process, which is the primary melting areas, there's a lot more productivity and output we can get from those. So, that's the major driver, but also on the back end and finishing, if you think outside of that sale and look at Dynamet, for example, their biggest increase in productivity is on the back end, and some of the finishing pieces.And in fact, we've got a couple of pieces of equipment that will be installed here in the near-term that could see Dynamet's profitability, our operating income much like SAO, will go up as close to 50  higher quarterly in the second half versus the first half.So, there's a lot of areas that we're working on. I think the good news is, that we're able to achieve these very high levels of operating income knowing that our business is still not operating at 100 . So, from a shareholder standpoint, there's a lot more that we can do to drive profits even higher.Okay. Great. Thank you.Thank you.The next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning, Tony, John.Good morning, Josh.Congratulations on the quarter here. Just on the base price increase on the non-contract alloys. Is there a way to think of percentage your capacity that's available for that transactional business at this point  And then, in previous cycles, where aerospace was consuming more capacity, what does that mix shift look like for the non-aerospace markets  And I'm just curious to hear how those non-aerospace markets are responding in this cycle versus historical cyclesLet me see if I can tackle that question for you. Certainly, in this cycle here, aerospace and medical are the ones, driving the quickest for us and that makes up, you know, well over 75  of our revenue. Some of the other markets, for example, like energy is single digits for us in terms of percent of revenue.But again for them to get time on the mill, we're seeing prices move up significantly in the energy side where they challenge aerospace type prices and that's what it takes for us to be really interested in those types of products. So obviously, our main focus is on the aerospace and medical, Josh. And I would say if you compare, you asked to prior cycles, the amplitude of this ramp is significantly greater than in prior cycles.Got it. And then, Tony, you spent some time there, just talking about the fiscal '27 targets and the front-end loaded nature of how the guidance is put together. But as far as the back-end of those targets, you know, is there any reason we would think to plateau there or is it just conservatism on your natureWell, we've heard that as that was, I thought, I did a question on this, Josh. And if you let me kind of go on for a little bit to kind of put all that in context and then come back to your question. I spent some time, last night, and I was thinking about what we've really said over the last couple of quarters, and as you well know, you were there, this all started in May of 2023 when we had our Investor Day, right where we said we were going to double operating income FY '19 versus FY '27, which is one of our most profitable years by the way, 40  CAGR from '23 to '27.As you mentioned, we said it wasn't going to be back-end loaded. It was going to have a meaningful cash generation and we didn't need to make any large scale capital expenditures for capacity or M A to get there. We come out with the fourth quarter, and we actually exceed our target of getting into FY '19 run rate profitability. So, that's a big, that's a big checkmarks.During that fourth quarter so, about three months ago, we said that this first quarter was going to be slightly down to flat and it was going to, you know bust through the normal seasonality where you see the first quarter being sequentially down. And as you all know, we had a lot of people doubt us and say that you couldn't do that.Well, we actually exceeded that number. And now we come in and say that the second quarter is going to be another impressive quarter, just like Q1 even though we'll continue to do our planned maintenance even though its got two major holidays in there, we're still going to operate at that level.And then, what you're getting to the new piece of information that we came out with today. We said that even after those two quarters, put those together and we're going to do another 28  to 35  on top of that, it's, it's very impressive growth and that's why we took the time Josh to talk to you about that some of these work centers are still not running at the rates that we know they can run at. That's how we have line of sight to that second half.Again, we said, it wasn't going to be back-end loaded, but we never said that we were going to get 50  in year one or four. And I think your question is that, that's an awfully strong comment, we've heard -- now does that mean that years two, three and four could be even more and is there some conservatism put in there. You might have a point, maybe there probably, there probably is a little conservatism in there and we have the ability to even push that higher.That's right. Good. No. Thank you. Thank you for that. And just one on the productivity side of that, you think Carpenter is doing anything different on the labor side and those works centers or do you think it's just a natural factor of timing experienced that they're getting betterI don't know if we do anything differently. I mean we have to be very, I'll use the word cautious right, because we are producing products that can never fail. A very high quality standards. So, we just don't take chances, if an operator is not ready, they're not ready. And we don't push them to put them in a situation where we could sacrifice the quality of our product that's just, that's just unacceptable.I'll give you a couple of numbers that are interesting. If you think about a new employee that's been with us two years or less. And if you look at our SAO operation. Our plants range anywhere from 30  to 60  of our shop floor workers have been there two years or less. And our Dynamet facility, we have one facility that's 50  are new in the last two years. The other is almost 30 .That is a big influx of new employees highly qualified. I mean, the level of employee that we're, that we're attracting is very high, but it's a complex, very sophisticated equipment that we're going to make sure that they can operate it, number one, safely and always within the quality standards that we hold ourselves, doing that the industry requires. So, you've seen some nice improvement over the last couple of quarters. The good news is there's still, there's still more improvement to come. Hopefully that answers your question.Yes. Yes. Great, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. And thank you for the time.Thank you.Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Chris Olin with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning and congrats on the quarter, guys.Hi, Chris. Good morning.I was just wondering on the near term. Has there been any type of negative volume impact associated with the drop in the commodity nickel market  Just wondering, if some customers will delay orders. Are you seeing any of that because of the surcharges visibility or are we at a point where like the long-term behavior has kind of changed when your customers are worried about supplyI think, the ladder right and I think, I know we're not having any customers delay orders because of where the nickel prices or where they think it's going to go. I mean we have, we have all of our customers, trying to get into the order book earlier. Right  As you know we've closed the order book, a couple times. So, that comment that you just made in this type of environment does not, it's never made, it's never, it's never discussed, that's not a factor.Okay. I may have missed it, I apologize if I had, but I was just thinking about the pricing dynamics and your comments about the increases. I was just wondering if there are contract renewals on the horizon, yet  I can't recall from the last quarter.Yes, there are. I mean over the last couple of years, obviously, by our results, you can tell that we've had contracts that have renewed and now you're seeing that, that higher price come through and there are a couple more that are in the works as well. So, it seems like at any point in time, we have one or two that we're, that we're working through. And there's a couple significant ones that we're working through, as we speak.Is it safe to assume something like, you know, 20 , 30  renews price each year for the modelLet me make sure I understand your question. Are you saying that 20  or 30  of contracts renew every yearYes. Will you renew at a higher price. So, I could put that in my--Well, all contracts renewing at a higher price, that's something that's significant, that's consistent across the industry, you can, you can take, you can take that with a high level of confidence that all contract renewals, will be at a much higher price.Okay. Just last one of the shift quickly back to at Dynamet and guess, I'm thinking a bit about the Boeing 707 and the A350 build rate increases kind of the peak outlook and I can't recall if Dynamet is levered to one platform more than the other. And you know, would you benefit kind of significantly from a doubling of the production targets  And I just lastly, do you have enough capacity to satisfy that if you doWell, to answer your last piece of your question first. No, there's not enough capacity in the system across multiple sub-markets. For us, we sell to every one of the fastener company. So, whether it's Boeing or Airbus it's on top of demand environment when demand is so much higher than supply. That's just not, that's just not a factor. We're oversubscribed and we anticipate that being like that for several years to come regardless of the split between widebody and single-aisle and Boeing or Airbus.Would a, would a capital investment be on the horizon for that to addressPossibly, I mean Dynamet, just like SAO is working to get up to rate as well. We're not running in Dynamet at the level we need to run at. And I want to, previous question from Cowen. I said that in fact we have a couple of pieces of equipment that are coming in here in the near term into Dynamet that will increase our finishing capacity. So, that will help as well.Okay. Great, thanks so much.Yes. Thank you, sir.The next question comes from Michael Leshock with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask here on volumes that we saw a decline in the quarter given the less shipping days. But looking forward, how do you see volumes increasing relative to price and mix  So, if your long-term guidance incorporates a 15  to 20  increase in volumes above fiscal '19, do you expect that volume uptick to be largely in fiscal '24 or is the big step up this year more so, a function of price and the volume piece is more linear over the course of your long-term guidanceWell, the volume is going to follow our productivity for the most part, I mean, as you've seen now in this quarter into next, a big part of our strategic mix management is, is moving that volume around, because some of the products as we moved to different types of products, they take longer to process through the system. Right  Especially, like in a primary mill product, it could be noted three times that just takes longer to go through the system much higher margins on that, but it takes longer. But as you see our productivity continue to increase as we've talked about as some of these other pieces come online certainly volume will be higher in the second half than the first half.And then, on maintenance, were you able to get all your normal seasonal maintenance spending done just given the lower CapEx spend sequentially and maybe running your assets above normal seasonal utilization levels  Or do you see any spilling into the second quarterWell, we're in perpetual preventive maintenance. The days of shutting your plant down for three weeks and turning everything off and sending everyone home and doing all your preventive maintenance all over, right, that just doesn't, that's not the most efficient way. We are always in a cycle of preventative maintenance.And you know, what, I think, I've been asked why do I talk about this and you know, when you're in a situation where supply can meet demand, you know certainly no one really talks about preventive maintenance but when you're in a sold-out environment, where any amount of downtime, any amount of downtime will translate to customer impact. As a matter of product you could ship within that, that's why it makes it important. That's why it's important to say at any point in time, we're going to be doing that.Secondly, I would say it's really important to remember Mike, we have really exclusive highly sought after assets and it's our job as skilled operators to protect that equipment, obviously, over the long term. So, we're aiming for a 40  CAGR, annual CAGR over the next four years. That's our goal.Our goal is not to run, you know, run the equipment to failure simply to earn a couple more million dollars on top of already a record quarter. Right  So, I mean that that would be unprofessional. So, it's not about trying to -- let's run it more to try to get out another couple of million. We're in for the long haul. We're going to, you know, double operating income versus FY '19 over four years. So, we got to protect our equipment and treat it the right way.Got it. Appreciate all the detail.Thank you.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Huyette for any closing remarks.Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for joining us today for our fiscal year 2024 first quarter conference call. Have a great rest of your day.The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T22:04:14.000-04:00
UVXY: Potential Middle East War Is A Tail Event (Ratings Upgrade),"In my most recent  on the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF , I recommended investors avoid the UVXY ETF because of its extreme value decay in the long run.However, I did note that during timesWith an escalating Israel Gaza war potentially morphing into a tail event, I am raising my prior sell rating in the UVXY ETF to a  rating, as I believe the near-term upside and downside risks are more balanced at the moment. Historically, warsWhile I do not recommend long-term investors get involved in the UVXY ETF, short-term speculators can consider a long position in the UVXY ETF provided they understand the bet they are making. Furthermore, the UVXY ETF may be useful as a short-term hedge for investors with long equity exposure.One of the most leveraged investments to short-term volatility is the UVXY ETF. The ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF invests in short-dated VIX futures with a weighted average maturity of 1 month to provide 1.5x exposure to short-term VIX futures. Currently, the UVXY ETF holds a 135  weight in VIX November futures and a 15  weight in October futures  Figure 2 .As time passes and the VIX futures get closer to maturity, the UVXY ETF will sell the nearest term future and redeploy the proceeds into the second-month future, to maintain 1.5x exposure to the weighted average maturity of 1 month.The constant selling and buying of near-term futures to maintain its 1.5x leverage cause the UVXY ETF to suffer from 'volatility decay'. Furthermore, since the VIX futures curve is generally in contango  i.e. futures further out the curve are priced higher, see Figure 3 , that means in general, the UVXY ETF must sell lower-priced expiring contracts to buy higher-priced futures farther out in maturity, losing money in the process.The combination of these two effects, contango, and volatility, explains why the UVXY ETF has compounded at -82.8  p.a. since inception  Figure 4 .The UVXY ETF is definitely not a buy-and-hold investment. A million dollars invested at UVXY's inception would be worth less than  1. In fact, most of the time, I recommend investors stay as far away from the UVXY ETF as possible.However, as we noted at the beginning of this article, during tail-risk events, the UVXY ETF can deliver phenomenal returns in a short period of time and some investors may wish to take advantage of UVXY's properties to hedge their portfolios. The ongoing Israel-Gaza war could be one such tail event.To preface, I am not a geopolitical expert and this article is not meant to support either side in this war. I am merely analyzing the developing war from the perspective of financial markets.The latest phase in the long-standing Israel-Gaza conflict began in the early hours of October 7th, 2023, when the Hamas militant group  a surprise attack on Israel, killing and kidnapping thousands of civilians. Israel retaliated against the attack by bombing and laying siege to the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is based.After a week of bombings, speculation is that Israel will soon  a ground-based invasion of Gaza to 'wipe out' Hamas. However, Iran  of 'far-reaching consequences' if Israel proceeds with its invasion. Furthermore, Israel has  Syria's Aleppo airport, potentially escalating this war into a regional conflict with multiple opponents.Aside from the humanitarian disaster, an escalation of the Israel Gaza war threatens regional stability in the Middle East and oil prices. Recall, that the OPEC oil embargo in 1973 was  by OPEC in response to the United States siding with Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Oil prices quadrupled in the aftermath of the embargo, sparking a recession in the U.S.  Figure 5 .Even without an oil embargo, oil prices can still spike on wars. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil prices spiked to over  120   barrel  25  increase  and the VIX Index rallied to over 36  Figure 6 .Similarly, during the first Gulf War, the S P 500 declined by 20  when oil prices more than doubled to  40   barrel and the VIX index spiked to over 36  Figure 7 .A recent Bloomberg  laid out what its analysts believe could be three possible scenarios for the Israel-Gaza War. While these scenarios are speculation and nobody really knows how the war will develop, it does provide an analytical framework for investors to think about the possible risks and opportunities in volatility markets.First, if the war is confined to the Gaza strip, Bloomberg expects lower Iranian crude oil output as the nascent un-thawing of U.S.-Iran relations is put back into the freezer. However, OPEC should have sufficient spare capacity to replace lost Iranian barrels and there should be minimal impact on volatility and the economy  Figure 8 .In the second scenario, Bloomberg sees a proxy war between Iran and Israel fought in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria. Unrest spreads in the Middle East, and a modest 'war premium' may be built into the price of oil and VIX. This should modestly reduce global economic output as well.Finally, in the most dire scenario, Bloomberg sees Israel and Iran in direct conflict, potentially disrupting oil in multiple countries in the Middle East. If Iran shuts the Strait of Hormuz  where 25  of the world's oil consumption must pass through , oil could spike to over  150   barrel and cause a global recession. In this scenario, Bloomberg sees VIX adding 16 pts.With two out of the three possible scenarios cited by Bloomberg potentially causing oil and volatility to spike, a case can be made for the UVXY ETF to be used as a short-term hedge for investors or as a swing trade by speculators.For example, assuming current VIX levels of  18, an 8-pt increase in VIX would imply a 44  increase in the VIX Index. For the UVXY ETF, this could translate into a  66  gain, assuming it maintains its 1.5x leverage. In reality, the gain on UVXY may be even greater than 66  because leveraged ETFs like the UVXY have convexity in the direction of their bet. Similarly, a 16-pt increase in the VIX implies an 89  increase in the VIX index or more than 133  increase in UVXY.On the other hand, if the conflict can be resolved without escalation or confined to just the Gaza strip, then as Bloomberg suggested in scenario 1, we may not see any spike in oil and VIX. In that case, the UVXY's normal decay would resume and the ETF would lose value.Furthermore, prior to the Hamas attack, VIX had trended to a recent low of 13 and normal seasonality suggests volatility compression into year-end  Figure 9 . If volatility compression were to occur, then the UVXY ETF could see significant losses as short-term VIX futures may decline in value consistent with a fall in the VIX Index.With significant tail risks on the short-term horizon from the developing Israel-Gaza war, I am raising my rating on the UVXY ETF from a  to a  as I believe the near-term upside and downside risks are more balanced. While I would not recommend long-term investors buy the UVXY due to its structural decay, aggressive traders may consider a long position in the UVXY ETF as a hedge for their long portfolios or as a speculative play on a potential spike in volatility if the war devolves into a regional conflict.

"Chevron Buys Low, Exxon Buys High","Major consolidation in the shale patch continued with Exxon's  recent announcement to buy tier-1 Permian producer Pioneer Resources  in a  60 billion . As shown in the graphic below, Exxon was arguablyNote  Red Annotations By The AuthorChevron closed the  6.3 billion all-stock  on Aug. 7. Including the assumption of debt, the enterprise value of the transaction was  7.6 billion. Using Chevron stockWhat Chevron got for its money also was impressiveWhile PDC Energy owned 25,000 net acres and 28,000 boe d of production in the Permian Basin, this deal was primarily a consolidation of the two companies' Denver-Julesburg acreage  i.e. the  DJ BasinThe graphic above was taken the Chevron's  and shows the extremely complimentary footprints of the two companies' DJ Basin leaseholds. As can be seen in the graphic, PDC held 275,000 net acres in the play and had 216,000 boe d of low-carbon intensity production  zero flaring  in Q1, of which  60  was liquids. On the , Chevron's CEO Mike Wirth saidIt also was noted on that conference call that PDC had a very front-end loaded capital program this year - meaning the PDC assets will be spinning off significant free-cash-flow for Chevron during the second half of the year.Bottom line  PDC Energy was an extremely attractive deal for Chevron shareholders and gives the company a diversified and strong runway for growth in the DJ Basin in addition to the company's tier-1 position in the Permian Basin.Since the PDC deal closed on Aug. 7, almost two thirds of PDC's quarterly production will have been on Chevron's books for Q3. Per , current earnings estimates for Chevron's Q3 results are shown belowFor Q3, the average earnings estimate is for  3.56 share. That would be down considerably from the  5.56 Chevron earned in Q3 last year when oil and gas prices were significantly higher due to the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting breaking of the global energy supply chain. However, it would be an improvement from the  3.20 share Chevron earned in  when the company generated  2.5 billion in free cash flow.With the addition of PDC production, I suspect Chevron will announce Q3 production was well over 3 million boe d. As far as I know, this will be the first time Chevron has quarterly production of over 3 million boe d.For full-year 2023, the above earnings estimate of  13.89 share obviously bodes well for shareholders in comparison with Chevron's current  6.04 share dividend obligation. That is, I suspect shareholders will - at a minimum - receive at least the  that Chevron announced last January  along with its  75 billion stock buyback plan .Note that Chevron has delivered superior dividend growth as compared to Exxon over the past five yearsThat's likely due to Chevron's arguably superior management team and the fact that CVX has consistently held a much stronger balance sheet as compared to Exxon. That balance sheet strength enabled Chevron to raise its dividend in 2020 and make a well-timed acquisition at pandemic lows while Exxon was borrowing money just to pay its existing dividend. Over the past few years, Chevron has also proved itself to be a much more efficient operator as compared to Exxon.In addition, Chevron has been much more timely when it comes to making acquisitions. Exxon's ill-fated XTO debacle cost its shareholders dearly when the bottom fell out of natural gas prices and the XTO assets could not even cover the dividend obligation on the Exxon shares the company had issued to fund the XTO transaction. That transaction was a primary reason that Exxon's total returns for an entire decade were negative and led to institutional investors and money managers to support three Engine  1 nominees to Exxon's Board of Directors  see .More recently, note that Exxon paid a rich price for PioneerThe  25 boe Exxon paid for Pioneer's proven reserves is more than 3x what Chevron paid for PDC Energy and 5x what Chevron paid for the proven reserves of Noble Energy  less than . In my opinion, EOG Resources  would have been a much better choice.Chevron remains my top pick among global super-major oil and gas companies. The company maintains a rock-solid balance sheet, has excellent growth prospects in the Eastern Mediterranean, Permian Basin, DJ Basin, and the Gulf of Mexico, is generating very strong free cash flow, and is shareholder friendly with excellent dividend growth and a massive share buyback program.According to the EPS estimates shown above, Chevron is expected to earn  14.77 share next year. A 14x multiple equates to a stock price of  200-plus  18  from the current  169 . Add in Chevron's 3.6  yield and investors can expect a strong 20 -plus return over the next 12 months while also protecting their portfolios from inflation and geopolitical turmoil.Chevron is a buy.I'll end with a three-year chart that shows Chevron stock consolidating a base around the  160 level. I would argue the stock is on the cusp of a breakout that will easily  and likely quite quickly ...  take the stock to  200 share. That is especially the case given the current geopolitical environment and the fact that, combined, Russia and Saudi Arabia are still holding millions of bbls of crude oil off the global market.

Tesla Q3 Earnings Drop: Toyota Trumps Tesla Again,"The month-long United Automobile Workers  UAW  strike should be music to Tesla  and Toyota s  ears, according to Ford  executive chairman Bill Ford. The strike has resulted in headwinds for the auto industry asWhere Tesla should be capturing market share, the stock experienced a  in early trading after poor third-quarter earnings results. I wrote an article earlier this year titled Competition in the electric vehicle space continues to heat up. Morgan Stanley Tesla earlier this year from Overweight to an Equal Weight rating when it was trading at  256.60, and the stock continues to experience declines, falling nearly 9  on Thursday to  221.88 per share following missed earnings.Although the popularity of Tesla remains, as shown in its year-to-date price performance of  105 , as I stated in my last article, Tesla s price run-up may be history. Tesla stock is rated a Hold by Seeking Alpha s Quant ratings. A Hold does not mean sell. Typically a Hold indicates that the stock is trading in line with its sector and may result from one of the stock s core factors not ranking as high as when it was rated a Strong Buy. For instance, Tesla has a premium valuation, evidenced by an  F  grade and 10 downward Wall Street analyst revisions over the last 90 days.Severely overvalued, Tesla, whose market capitalization is  770.26B  as of 10 19 23 , continues to have uphill battles after disappointing earnings. Tesla s Q3 EPS of  0.66 was missed by  0.07, and revenue of  23.35B missed by  794.43M. Currently ranked  9 out of 31 in its industry compared to Toyota s  1 rank, Toyota shares have continued their gradual uptrend this year since announcing plans and  for an all-solid-state battery to cut charging times and the delivery of  1.5M EVs by 2026 and 3.5M by 2030.Toyota s vision continues to evolve, and its lower cost and unique designs rival that of Tesla, whose Morgan Stanley downgrade was followed by , citing that shares of Tesla stock would likely cool. As we see, Toyota s future looks bright as the seasoned Japanese carmaker gives Tesla and its investors a run for their money.One of Seeking Alpha s , Toyota Motor Company maintains strong financials. It continues to crush its competition despite global macro and geopolitical concerns. In September, the carmaker s U.S. sales were up nearly 14 , with an  of  82 . Maintaining a strong balance sheet and enviable fundamentals compared to Tesla and other auto manufacturers, Toyota wants to bring the next-gen of vehicles and performance to your portfolio.The Japanese auto manufacturer is the largest automaker in the world. Extremely profitable and focused on quality and innovation, Toyota s design and sale of passenger and commercial vehicles, parts, and accessories is a force to reckon with. Although Toyota has faced economic challenges, its growth, bullish momentum, and discounted valuation make it a more attractive consideration for upside potential, especially as it prepares for the first phase of mass production of solid-state EV batteries.Toyota trades at an extreme discount. Unlike Tesla, whose  are nearly all  Fs,  Toyota s overall valuation grade is C , supported by a forward P E ratio of 9.19x vs. the sector s 14.30x, a 35  discount. Toyota s Price Book  TTM  is more than a 41  discount to the sector, and the stock is trading just above its mid-52-week range and has rallied nearly 30  over the past six months.In addition to bullish momentum and diversified product offerings, Toyota s growth and profitability have been tremendous.

"IWM: Long Small Caps, Short Mega Caps As The 'Concentration Bubble' Unwinds","Over the past decade, stock market performance has been substantially skewed toward larger capitalization companies. The current ten-year total return for the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF  is 227 , while it is only 99  for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF Clearly, some trend is pushing Mega Cap performance that is not impacting smaller equities. The discrepancy is not apparent in their fundamentals. The Mega Cap ETF MGC currently has a TTM weighted-average  P E  of  24XFurther, from a discounted cash-flow standpoint, MGC is subject to greater cash-flow discounting devaluation due to the rise in interest rates, more so than IWM. As we saw in 2022, higher interest rates usually upset the prices of high-valuation stocks much more than low-valuation ones, such as those in IWM. However, both ETFs had a negative performance of around 20  in 2022  however, IWM has maintained its discount while MGC has recovered despite the continued increase in interest rates.Those who follow my research likely know I am extremely bearish on mega-cap stocks,, due to their immense valuation growth. Since small caps and large caps have been in a  see-saw  relationship for some time, the bearish potential for the most expensive stocks may finally lift the valuations for smaller capitalization firms. Of course, while IWM appears extremely cheap, negative economic trends could weigh on its fundamentals. So, we must gauge the macroeconomic outlook and IWM's exposures to discern if it is appropriately discounted for potential earnings trends.To me, it appears that these companies  such as Apple  are rising due to momentum created from excess ETF concentration. Essentially, because almost all ETFs are market-capitalization weighted, stocks with high market capitalizations will naturally see more significant inflows from ETFs as they rebalance, creating a positive feedback loop that can push valuations to extremes. Today, this trend has reached such an extreme that half of the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  is just two stocks, Apple  and Microsoft . Of course, while this trend may continue for some time, I expect it will end very poorly for many investors because, should the mega-caps begin to fall, the opposite pattern should arise as ETFs automatically rebalance away from these firms, creating an adverse feedback loop.Going back at least 30 years, we can see a very interesting pattern between large caps in the S P 500 and small caps in the Russell 2000. During the end of the 1990s, when the first technology bubble occurred, small caps underperformed dramatically. As the bubble popped and value stocks returned in vogue in the 2000s, small caps' total performance was strong enough to erase all underperformance created in the 1990s. Since  2012, the market has looked more like it did in the 1990s, with larger companies seeing massive inflows while small caps fall by the wayside.Today, most of the  recovery  in small caps from the 2000s has reversed, with the total performance ratio nearing 2000 minimum levels  or when the  Dot.com  bubble peaked . Assuming this pattern will continue, we can expect around 40-60  in outperformance from IWM compared to the S P 500 over the coming five to ten years. Of course, that is merely based on the total return pattern. That said, it seems reasonable, considering IWM is trading at a  50  valuation discount to mega-caps. If the  three-year forward  valuation in IWM equaled that of MGC, IWM would need to outperform by  100 . However, if we account for the fact that IWM's constituents naturally have greater negative EPS exposure to the economic cycle, it is reasonable that it should trade at a lower valuation than MGC and the S P 500  however, a 50  discount is, to me, entirely unreasonable.In general, the largest companies in the US stock market are multinational firms such as Apple, Amazon , Microsoft, Google , Tesla , and others. The direct, cyclical exposure of these firms' EPS to the GDP growth rate is vague, but we can generally assume it to be lower than that of firms in the Russell 2000. The largest sectors in IWM are industrials  17 , financials  16 , and healthcare  15 . In MGC, it is technology  36 , consumer discretionary  14.4 , and healthcare  13.1 . MGC's exposure to financials  9.3  and industrials  10.7  is lower, while its technology exposure is much higher than IWM's  13 . Both funds have ample exposure to cyclical and less cyclical market sectors.To me, the most significant three companies  Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia  in MGC are cyclical despite being technology stocks. Those three firms generate substantial income from consumer hardware sales, the prices of which are generally higher than they were years ago. Further, many people are replacing technology hardware at a lower rate than in the 2010s when there was a massive acceleration in hardware performance. Today, newer smartphone models and processors are only  seen in the 2010s. Therefore, I believe investors may significantly underestimate the impact a recession could have on the EPS of most of the most expensive stocks today.Of course, overvaluation in the S P 500 does not necessarily imply undervaluation for the Russell 2000. The small-cap indices are more exposed to historically riskier sectors, such as financials and industrials. Further, specifically for financials, regional banks, and similar medium-to-small financial companies constitute a significant portion of the Russell 2000. In my view, smaller financials are much more cyclically exposed than their larger peers because they have less access to market capital and, most importantly, they're  too big to fail,  as seen in the various bank failures this year. Bank of America  and Wells Fargo  have banks. Still, they can expect direct or indirect government aid if needed due to their substantial market scope. For related reasons, larger financial stocks benefit from the failures of their smaller peers  discount.At any rate, there is a robust relationship between changes in the manufacturing PMI and IWM's total one-year performance. See belowThe manufacturing PMI measures surveyed changes in business activity from industrial firms in the US, making it a tremendous forward GDP indicator and highly relevant to estimating EPS changes in most of IWM's constituents. Today, the manufacturing PMI is very low, indicating a negative profit trend for most industrial firms  also impacting all other cyclical firms . The Russell 2000's one-year total returns are technically positive but generally low due to the EPS slowdown. Of course, the S P 500's total one-year returns is  16 , so its performance gap is quite large compared to its larger peer.Based on the  Mishkin-Estrella  recession probability indicator, which uses various interest rate data, the odds of a US recession in 2024 are  60  today. Notably, that is much higher than in all four previous recessions. Historically, recessions usually occur when the yield curve begins to steepen back above 0 . It remains highly inverted today, indicating no 2023 recession  however, that is  most likely to occur once the yield curve inevitably rebounds. See belowBased on this model, supported by recent , , and  trend changes, the odds of a significant 2024 economic slowdown appear incredibly high. To be clear, I am not stating a 2024 recession is guaranteed, only that many strong historical data points indicate it is more likely than ever  at least since the 1980s . Opinions on this point differ, but the data is what it is, which is what I base my outlook on.Of course, historical models can become less useful if the environment differs too dramatically. Since 2020, various US and global government actions, such as lockdowns, stimulus, and geopolitical events, have had enormous positive and negative economic consequences, mainly leading to the current inflation debacle. I am basing my outlook on data patterns during the  great moderation  period of  1985 to  2015, which saw low inflation. Thus, because inflation is a major factor today, it can push interest rate trends around sufficiently that these models may not be as powerful as they used to be. However, from a risk standpoint, equity investors would likely be wiser to expect a recession since the downside risk in recessions is usually much larger than the upside reward without one.Overall, I am neutral on IWM because I believe its low valuation appropriately discounts it for the higher probability that its constituents will see negative EPS changes over the coming one to three years. However, there is a night and day difference between IWM and the S P 500 for the Mega Cap ETF MGC. While IWM appears fairly valued, the large and mega-cap indices appear highly overvalued compared to small caps. Even if IWM's constituents have higher EPS exposure to a recession, which is not necessarily true today, I doubt the valuation gap between them is sensibly based on any sound fundamental basis - particularly considering the minor EPS growth differences between them.Thus, while I would not buy IWM outright, I believe it is an excellent pair trade against the S P 500, particularly the Mega Cap ETF MGC. To me, that is a great opportunity today because it largely hedges against changes in the economic environment. I expect IWM to outperform its larger peers with or without a recession, so the pair trade hedges that risk and substantially lower portfolio volatility. Over a five-year horizon, I expect IWM to perform at least 40  better. Even on a six-month basis, I believe IWM should outperform because its price ratio with the S P 500 is at the low end of its channel, creating a decent technical setup for the pair trade. Further, IWM, SPY, or MGC are highly liquid with no material borrowing cost, making for an easier pair trade to manage.Of course, this pair trade defies the trend that has persisted since 2012, so it is not a riskless opportunity. In stocks, what goes up can often continue to do so, mainly once investors sufficiently disregard fundamentals. In other words, irrational exuberance can negate any potential  gravity  impacting high-momentum stocks. I believe the momentum behind mega-caps has faded enough that I doubt they'll continue to outperform  however, it is a bit early to state that the mega-cap bubble has ended definitively.

Apple: Red Flags Everywhere,"My  about Apple's  stock worked well since the stock declined more than 6  since the article went live, compared to -1  for the broader stock market. Today, I would like to downgrade myA lot has happened since I wroteA lot has already been written about the latest earnings, so I will highlight critical metrics dynamics to underline some red flags. Product sales were down YoY by 4 , which is substantial given the company's scale. Inside product categories, iPad sales dropped YoY by a massive 20 . While the iPad contributed less than 10  to the total product quarterly sales, Apple earns its service revenues from all devices it sells. That said, a substantial decrease in iPad sales will negatively affect the service sales to iPad users. The same is true with Mac sales, which declined YoY by a notable 7 . Weakness in product sales was mostly offset in full by services, but it is essential to understand that service revenue growth was driven by the fee increases. While Apple's ability to exercise strong pricing power is impressive, it is not infinite, and exercising it frequently will highly likely undermine Apple's brand loyalty.Apart from softening product sales last quarter, I see other red flags for Apple investors. The bearish trend in the global smartphone market will likely continue by the end of this year as the International Data Corporation  IDC  forecast this year to demonstrate the lowest volume of smartphone shipments . It is crucial to mention that IDC's recent revision of a 4.7  drop in global shipments is downward of the original forecast of a 3.2  decline. Personal computer shipments are expected to return to growth in 2024, but shipment volume will still be  than the pre-pandemic level. The reasons for the demand softness are on the surface  sticky inflation and high-interest rates, which weigh on the intensity of economic activity. In his recent press conference, Jerome Powell left the door open for one more hike this year, and his rhetoric was . A tight monetary policy will continue to weigh on the labor market, which also does not add optimism regarding consumer spending on discretionary electronics like smartphones.The upcoming quarter's earnings release is scheduled for October 25. Quarterly revenue is expected by consensus at  89.3 billion, which indicates a solid 1  YoY decline. Despite the expected revenue decline, the bottom line is expected to show resilience with a slight EPS expansion.While governmental officials  regarding iPhone bans in China, complicated relationships between the world's two largest economies are another red flag for investors. Apple has massive exposure to the Chinese market and crucial production facilities there. That said, the company faces significant geopolitical risks amid the current state geopolitical situation. It is also important to remember the good British proverb   Where there's smoke, there's fire . This means that an iPhone ban in China for key officials might eventually turn out to be true, given the political and industrial espionage concerns.The recent Apple  event also did not add optimism to me. At this event, the company unveiled the iPhone 15 family and a new Watch series and processors. Once again, new products were built on past proficiency rather than introducing new jaw-dropping features. While the iPhone's fan base is vast, and so is Apple's brand loyalty, the company's approach of subtle improvements to its flagship products might not last infinitely. The technological landscape is evolving, and Chinese smartphone manufacturers seem to soon become strong competitors for Apple, especially given the latest unveiling of . Let me remind readers that the iPhone ended Nokia's era sixteen years ago because the latter failed to innovate and recognize secular shifts before the Finnish giant was disrupted. With every new iPhone series looking pretty much the same as the previous one, it seems that Apple now faces substantial technological disruption risks.The stock rallied almost 41  year-to-date, significantly outperforming the broader stock market.  assigns APPL the lowest possible  F  grade because its multiples are substantially higher than the sector median. I am okay with the premium in comparison to the sector's multiples since Apple is a cash machine with an unmatched ecosystem. But the comparison to Apple's historical average valuation multiples is a much more warning sign. The current multiples are double digits higher than the five year's averages across the board, which indicates overvaluation to me.I have to proceed with the discounted cash flow  DCF  approach to ensure that my conclusions from the analysis of the valuation ratios were correct. I use a 10  WACC for discounting. Consensus  forecast a 9  CAGR for the next decade, which I consider fair enough to use in my calculations. I use a 20.9  TTM FCF ex-SBC margin for the whole decade. I do not expect a notable expansion of this metric due to the challenges described in the previous section of my article.According to my DCF simulation, the business's fair value is approximately  2.4 trillion, which is 12  below the current market cap. That said, the stock is overvalued with double-digit downside potential. Unattractive valuation is another big red flag to me.Apple is the world's largest company with a vast ecosystem, which allows the company to introduce new revenue streams with no customer acquisition costs. That said, for Apple bears, there is always a big risk that the company might introduce a new appealing feature that will unlock new solid revenue streams with almost no incremental costs. This will lead to the improvement of the consensus revenue growth estimates and will make my DCF calculations irrelevant. On the other hand, the effect of any new feature will unlikely be significant compared to the company's above  2 trillion valuation.As a growth stock, AAPL's fair share price highly depends on the discount rate. The higher the Federal Funds rates are, the higher the discount rate, which weighs on the present value of future cash flows. But it works the other way around as well. Any slight hints regarding the potential pivot in the Fed's monetary policy can be a huge positive catalyst for the stock market, especially for growth stocks. But I consider this risk low given the rising crude oil price and the U.S. unemployment rate still close to historical minimums.To conclude, AAPL is a  Sell . The current valuation does not reflect the fundamental challenges the company is facing. I admit that some of the challenges are related to the cyclicality of the broader economy. Therefore, red flags related to the softening demand for smartphones and PCs are temporary. However, the lack of innovation is a huge secular problem for Apple, and the company can repeat  if it does not start addressing the evolving technological landscape.

Undervalued And Underrated: How Qifu Technology Is A Compelling Story Of Profitable Growth,"Qifu Technology , a leading Credit-Tech player in China, presents a hidden gem amidst the fears of geopolitical tensions and regulatory challenges. Despite being undervalued by Wall Street, this company boasts a compelling growth story fueled by its highly advancedFounded in 2016, Qifu Technology has emerged as a leading Chinese Credit-Tech platform, empowering financial institutions, consumers, and SMEs with a comprehensive suite of technology services throughout the loan lifecycle. From borrower acquisition to credit assessment, fund matching, and post-facilitation services, Qifu Technology leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning models to cater to the diverse needs of its clients. The company's business can be categorized into two main segments   and , each playing a vital role in their success.In the  segment, Qifu Technology generates revenue by facilitating connections between prospective borrowers and financial institutions, providing robust support in borrower acquisition, credit assessment, and post-facilitation services through a capital-heavy model. Moreover, they charge borrowers interest fees for loans funded by Fuzhou Microcredit, a subsidiary under their variable interest entity. Additionally, they offer contractual guarantee arrangements against potential defaults, showcasing their commitment to managing credit risks effectively. To safeguard against risks, prudent provisions are made to ensure their assets remain resilient even during challenging times.On the other hand, the  segment serves as a source of consistent income. Here, Qifu Technology charges pre-negotiated terms to financial institution partners for providing loan facilitation and post-facilitation services through their innovative capital-light model and intelligent marketing services powered by the Intelligence Credit Engine  ICE . Furthermore, they refer prospecting users to other online lending companies if they fail to meet certain lending criteria, expanding their network and creating valuable partnerships. This segment does not assume credit risk, resulting in less working capital requirements while generating substantial revenue.In the fiscal year 2022, Qifu Technology generated 11,586 million RMB and 4,968 million RMB from its credit-driven services and platform services, respectively. Although the platform services experienced a temporary decline of -22.94  due to COVID-related lockdowns and temporary effect from loan repricing, it had been growing impressively at a CAGR of 42.45  for the past four years until then. Meanwhile, the credit-driven services maintained steady growth, with a CAGR of 9.66  over the past four years. Looking ahead, I believe Qifu Technology is envisioning an even brighter future as it strives to generate a larger share of its revenue from platform services. In my view, this prudent strategic move is a very positive catalyst since the future business model will require less working capital and pose lower credit risks, thus providing a solid foundation for sustained growth and success in the dynamic Credit-Tech industry.According to the, issued by the People's Bank of China  PBoC  in January 2022, they have outlined crucial strategies for advancing the fintech industry in China. From my perspective, it is advantageous for the People's Republic of China  PRC  to persist in facilitating their comprehensive economic progress by enhancing the accessibility of credit to all citizens within their nation. The recent report to the, which emphasizes the need to  cultivate new growth engines such as next-generation information technology  and  accelerate the development of the digital economy,  reinforces my belief that fintech is a prioritized area for development in the country. This is especially encouraging given the,, and.Out of these three events, the one that seems most impactful to Qifu s business fundamentals is the last one because the outstanding balance of loans with an IRR exceeding 24  had dropped from RMB 62.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, to RMB 5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, which caused the overall facilitation fee to go down significantly. However, I was encouraged to hear from management in their that  future pricing will maintain at a stable level compared to the current level.  Despite the impact of the consumer finance lending rate cap on Qifu's fundamentals, the management's commitment to maintaining future pricing at a stable level is a reassuring sign. As the regulatory environment stabilizes, the company s focus on maintaining stable pricing may position them well to navigate potential challenges while continuing to offer competitive services to borrowers.Despite past regulatory scrutiny, the Fintech Development Plan demonstrates that China remains supportive of the fintech domain. The plan's objective to achieve improvement in the sector's core competitiveness by 2025 indicates the government's determination to foster fintech innovation in a regulated, balanced, and high-quality manner. Therefore, I believe fintech-based companies such as Qifu will play a crucial role in facilitating efficient financial resource allocation and propelling overall economic growth. The government's commitment to building internationally competitive digital industry clusters underscores its dedication to driving innovation and technology-driven development., the Chinese central bank's decision to fine Ant Group and Tencent's TenPay indicates a shift in the regulatory approach towards major players in China's technology and finance sectors. In my opinion, this move signals a potential end to the previous crackdown, as Beijing aims to foster a more supportive environment for the private sector in tackling various economic and geopolitical challenges, which include post-COVID-19 recovery efforts, boosting consumer spending, addressing youth unemployment, and navigating tensions with the United States. The government's approach is likely to be determined yet balanced, seeking to rally the private sector for sustainable growth and innovation.According to, GlobalData forecasts a Compound Annual Growth Rate  CAGR  of 9.1  for total China consumer loan balances outstanding from 2021 to 2025. This aligns closely with iResearch Report's expectation of 9.2 , as mentioned in. These projections indicate a promising future for the fintech industry in China, suggesting continuous growth and transformation. With the government's unwavering support and a balanced regulatory approach, I am confident that we will witness a flourishing fintech ecosystem in China. This industry not only propels economic progress but also ensures stability and sustainable development. As the company continues to solidify its leading position in the consumer finance sector, leveraging enhanced technological capabilities and offering viable solutions, I am convinced that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing SME credit-tech market. In light of these developments, I anticipate double-digit revenue growth for Qifu Technology, and I believe the company has the potential to achieve at least a 12.5  revenue growth over the coming years. As the fintech landscape evolves, Qifu Technology's innovative approach and commitment to excellence will undoubtedly contribute to its continued success in the dynamic Chinese market.Since its inception, Qifu Technology has shown an outstanding track record of growth in loan origination volume, expanding from  30.99 billion RMB to a 412.36 billion RMB in just 5 years, thus representing a CAGR of 67.81  over the said period. Notably, the loans originated under the capital-light business model have been a standout success, growing over 8 times in a span of only 3 years.In my view, the management team's strategic direction to reduce exposure to the capital-heavy business model is a prudent and forward-thinking move as this segment often involves credit risks and requires a substantial amount of working capital to support loan origination and expansion. By shifting towards a capital-light model, the company can effectively lower the level of risk it assumes and optimize its use of resources. Under the capital-heavy business model, the company may be required to provide back-to-back guarantees for loans in case of defaults. This model operates within a legal loophole to bypass the restrictions of Circular 141, as it does not directly offer guarantees to banking financial institutions but requires the company to cover losses for third-party companies that provide guarantee services to financial institutions. Additionally, taking loans onto their balance sheet can tie up capital, limiting the company's ability to invest in other growth opportunities.On the contrary, loans originated under the capital-light model do not carry the burden of back-to-back guarantees or the need to take loans onto their balance sheet. Instead, the company acts as a facilitator, connecting borrowers and lenders through its technology platform. This approach allows the company to reduce its exposure to credit risk, as the actual lending is conducted by external financial institutions. By embracing the capital-light model, I believe the company can effectively mitigate risks and potential losses, providing a more stable and resilient financial foundation.In my view, one of Qifu's competitive advantages lies in its highly advanced technological capabilities that can provide continuous improvement in loan writing and a reduction in delinquency rates. The chart above illustrates the company's impressive track record of sequentially declining D1 delinquency rates over the past 3 years, even amidst challenging times for Chinese consumers during the COVID lockdown. This achievement is a testament to the tremendous effort, technological expertise, and data-driven approach behind the firm s exceptional loan writing. As the company's profiling of users and loan pricing techniques continue to evolve, it gains a unique edge that is hard to replicate. As a result of this proficiency, I expect Qifu to continue attracting financial institutions keen on embracing the digital landscape and recognizing the value of leveraging advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance their own loan pricing strategies. This trend has been evident in the company's explosive growth in partnerships with financial institutions, expanding from 24 in 2018 to a substantial 150 as of Q1 2023.Next, the majority of the growth in loan origination can be attributed to the company's highly effective marketing campaigns, which have led to a significant increase in cumulative users. Over the past five years, the number of cumulative users with approved credit lines on the platform has grown from a modest 3.3 million to 44.5 million  and now stands at 46.0 million as per, representing a remarkable 13.5x expansion. Regarding the conversion rate of users approved with credit lines to those who ultimately complete successful drawdowns, it has been gradually declining, currently standing at approximately 60 , down from 69  previously. The management team addressed this situation during the and shared their proactive approach to enhance user engagement and risk managementIn other words, management's proactive efforts are centered around enhancing user engagement and refining risk models, with a special focus on understanding diverse user profiles, especially within the SME segment, to create long-term value. As an investor, there's no need to be overly concerned about the decline in the conversion rate as the company is taking strategic steps to leverage the power of WeChat and capitalize on the lucrative SME market to sustain growth effectively. In my view, these strategic initiatives are likely to yield positive outcomes and foster strong customer loyalty.One notable aspect of Qifu's platform is its stickiness for borrowers, as evidenced by the steady climb in repeat borrower contribution over the past five years. The chart illustrates a clear trend, with repeat borrower contribution reaching 88.70  in 2022  most recent data from  suggests that this number has reached 91.9 , highlighting the platform's ability to retain customers effectively. This sustained high retention rate is a testament to the value customers find in Qifu's offerings, indicating their satisfaction with the platform's services. The fact that borrowers return for additional loans highlights the trust they have developed in Qifu.As time goes on, I anticipate this figure to consistently remain above the 90  level as more satisfied users continue utilizing the platform for borrowing needs. Additionally, the likelihood of these contented customers recommending Qifu's services to others can potentially drive organic growth through word-of-mouth referrals. Overall, the increase in repeat borrower contribution is a positive signal for the company, as it not only leads to a more stable and predictable revenue stream but also speaks volumes about the company s ability to deliver value and maintain customer loyalty in the competitive fintech landscape.Based on my analysis, I have projected a steady increase in the loan origination volume per borrower, with an average growth rate of 3.50 . This projection is conservative, as it is below the estimated China's GDP growth rate of between 5  and 6  reported by reputable sources like and. The growth in loan origination volume per borrower is supported by factors such as the consistent rise in repeat borrower contribution over time, as discussed previously, and the increasing consumer budget and higher standard of living, which contribute to the demand for loans.This trend is expected to have a positive impact on the overall loan volume originated by the company, as each borrower contributes higher loan amounts. Consequently, revenue growth is likely to closely follow this expansion in loan origination volume. The primary drivers of this growth are the increasing number of cumulative borrowers with successful drawdown and the growth in loan origination volume per borrower. Overall, I believe that Qifu Technology is well-positioned to capitalize on these favorable market conditions and achieve sustained revenue growth, particularly if loan pricing remains stable and is not affected by regulatory changes.Amid the gradual easing of COVID restrictions, the PBoC s recent decision to is a welcome move for consumer finance borrowers, as it is expected to encourage increased consumer spending. While some analysts may be fixated on, I remain steadfast in my optimistic outlook for the long-term growth prospects of the Chinese economy. As an investor, it is vital to maintain patience and refrain from being swayed by short-term market fluctuations, instead focusing on the broader and more enduring trends. Inspired by the timeless wisdom of Howard Marks' ,  a favorite quote of mine resonates deeplyIn the current scenario, the investing sentiment towards China appears to lean towards the latter, signaling a unique opportunity for astute investors to capitalize on undervalued assets.While short-term challenges and uncertainties are inevitable in any market, I firmly believe that China's long-term potential remains robust and promising. Rather than being swayed by transient sentiment, a prudent investor would evaluate opportunities based on a comprehensive analysis of the economic landscape, the financial health of specific companies, and their long-term growth prospects. China's investing environment today presents an intriguing juxtaposition of undervalued assets amid prevailing negative sentiment.China's market valuation, depicted in the P E chart from, currently appears near an all-time low, primarily influenced by concerns over regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical tensions, and trade war with the US. While acknowledging these genuine risks, the current valuation offers an appealing opportunity for contrarian investors. Analyzing QFIN's valuation, taking into account its net cash balance of 5.214 billion RMB, the EV EBITDA remains below past averages, even with the stock price rebounding from its 52-week low in November 2022. Adding to the allure, management recently announced plans to worth of its American depositary shares or Class A ordinary shares over the next 12 months, starting from June 20, 2023.In my view, this represents a rare window of opportunity for those with a contrarian mindset, recognizing the long-term potential and seizing the moment to position themselves strategically for potential gains in the future. Additionally, I believe there is ample room for multiple expansion as positive sentiment strengthens and growth resumes. The current market sentiment in China may be pessimistic, but astute investors can navigate this landscape skillfully to uncover value and capitalize on opportunities such as QFIN.When it comes to financial valuation, there are several key factors that will remain consistent across all three scenarios of my discounted cash flow  DCF  model. Firstly, I won't overly emphasize the impact of the buyback on the number of shares outstanding, as predicting QFIN's stock price movement over the next twelve months is inherently uncertain. Secondly, the growth in loan origination volume per borrower will maintain a steady rate of 3.50  in all three scenarios, as mentioned earlier, along with a consistent tax rate of 18 . While I acknowledge the potential for improvement in the conversion rate between users with credit lines and borrowers, I conservatively assume a stable conversion rate of 60 .The total shares outstanding used in my calculation are approximately 336.11 million, taking into consideration potential dilution from restricted stocks and options. These robust assumptions provide a stable foundation for the valuation analysis, allowing us to focus on other important variables to assess Qifu Technology's financial outlook with greater accuracy.Based on my analysis for the bear case scenario, I estimate QFIN's intrinsic value to be in the range of  19.60 to  27.48, considering an exchange rate of 7.50 for the CNY USD and a discount rate of 17.50 . The utilization of such an elevated discount rate underscores the considerable returns that both myself and fellow investors should demand in order to counterbalance the prevailing risks in the Chinese market.In this scenario, the growth trajectory of cumulative users with approved credit is expected to follow a low-teen percentage increase for the initial three years, which gradually tapers off as market competition intensifies. My forecasts indicate an average growth rate of approximately 13.51  for the total loan origination volume across both the capital-heavy and capital-light segments over the subsequent five years, which surpasses industry averages due to Qifu's technologically advanced approach to facilitate more efficient loan origination processes. Based on the recent interest rate cap, a fee percentage of around 1.30  is assumed to reflect additional decline attributed to loan repricing. Additionally, it's anticipated that the growth of outstanding loans on the balance sheet, as compared to those off the balance sheet, will parallel the facilitation volume growth from the capital-heavy model. This alignment is expected to lead to increased financing income for the company, tied to the growth of outstanding loans on its balance sheet.While there may be a slight revenue dip in 2023 due to loan repricing and a decrease in take rates compared to 2022, growth is projected to rebound in 2024. Notably, the growth of platform services, under the capital-light model, is expected to outpace the growth of credit-driven services linked to the capital-heavy model. Combining both revenue streams, an average revenue growth of approximately 11  is projected to commence from 2024 onwards. Although a short-term dip in EBITDA margin is expected due to loan repricing, a recovery to around 28  is anticipated over time. It's worth highlighting that Qifu has historically achieved EBITDA margins close to 33 . My conservative estimate allows for a significant margin of safety, providing a cushion for potential investors. Despite the bear case scenario, the current share price continues to offer attractive potential returns, driven by multiple expansion and the gradual stabilization of market sentiment.Transitioning to a more normalized base case scenario, I have estimated QFIN's intrinsic value to fall within the range of  25.66 to  36.85, considering an exchange rate of 7.25 for the CNY USD and a discount rate of 17.50 . In this scenario, I anticipate cumulative users with approved credit to experience mid to low-teen growth over the next five years, as the company steadily expands its reach and reputation to attract more borrowers. Forecasts indicate an average growth rate of approximately 15.58  for the total loan origination volume over the next five years. While revenue growth may not appear remarkable initially, I expect a modest upturn starting in 2024, driven by the company's efforts to refine its loan pricing to closer to 1.40  and enhance customer engagement. As for the EBITDA margin, I foresee gradual improvement, returning closer to the more normalized historical level of 33 . This will be facilitated by a reduction in general and administrative expenses as the company optimizes its operations and cost structure. Additionally, I believe Qifu's marketing initiatives will become more effective in driving customer acquisition, contributing to the improvement in EBITDA margin.My approach aligns closely with current Wall Street estimates , and I am confident in providing investors with a margin of safety through these reasonable projections. The conservative assumptions in the base case scenario provide a prudent outlook, taking into account potential challenges and risks in the market environment. Even without accounting for multiple expansion, investors have the potential to achieve approximately 40  returns on their investment, in addition to the 17.5  discount rate, given that the share price has recently been trading around  18.In the bull case scenario, I have derived a more optimistic price target range for QFIN, projected to be within  32.93 to  48.21, taking into account a discount rate of 17.50  and an exchange rate of 7.00 for the CNY USD. However, I urge investors to approach this scenario with caution, as it assumes a highly optimistic outlook on several key factors, including the growth of cumulative users with approved credit lines, the stability of the loan servicing fee percentage, and huge potential from margin expansion. In this scenario, the number of growing users is projected to maintain its current pace throughout the entire year, continuing into 2024, driven by the allure of lower interest rates, which incentivize Chinese consumers to borrow more money. This trend is expected to make platforms like Qifu more appealing to the country's citizens. Forecasts indicate an average growth rate of approximately 17.64  for the total loan origination volume over the subsequent five years as the company resumes its historical growth level after COVID lockdown has been over. Additionally, the stabilization of loan pricing of 1.50  eliminates the need for continuous adjustments of the take rate to attract financial institutions and borrowers. According to my estimate, the company achieved an EBITDA margin of 37.06  in 2019 and 41.19  in 2021. I have a positive outlook that Qifu can achieve these high margins again in the future, assuming management optimizes the cost structure and utilizes operational leverage as it achieves economies of scale.Considering the above assumptions materialize, the potential returns from this bull case scenario could be significant, possibly leading to a multi-bagger investment opportunity, especially given the current trading price of the stock. However, it is essential to exercise caution and recognize that such optimistic projections entail higher levels of risk and uncertainty.Qifu Technology currently employs a unique approach to provide guarantee services, leveraging a back-to-back guarantee model in conjunction with third-party guarantee companies. However, it is essential to note that if this loophole were to be closed in the future, it could have a material impact on Qifu's top line, although the bottom line effect may be relatively small as contingent liabilities provision could be eliminated.Moreover, the Fintech sector and VIE structure in China are subject to high-level uncertainties and potential regulatory changes. Past crackdowns on major companies like Alibaba and the suspension of Ant Group's IPO have led to global investor concerns, contributing to an undervaluation of assets in the region. Additionally, some investors may find the VIE structure unattractive, as it doesn't provide real ownership within the company. At last, geopolitical risks surrounding China, such as a potential invasion of Taiwan or the imposition of U.S. sanctions, can pose a threat to U.S. investors' portfolios, leading to potential permanent losses.In light of these risks, it is crucial for investors to exercise caution and carefully evaluate their risk appetite when considering investments in Qifu Technology. While the company shows promising growth potential and competitive advantages in the fintech domain, regulatory uncertainties and geopolitical events warrant a thorough assessment of potential risks and rewards.In conclusion, I recommend an overweight rating on QFIN's stock, with a target share price of  31.26 based on a discount rate of 17.50  and an exit EV EBITDA multiple of 3.5x, considering reasonable future growth expectations in my base case scenario. Qifu's competitive advantage in advanced technological capabilities positions it to attract financial institutions eager to embrace the digital landscape and optimize loan pricing through cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence. The notable increase in repeat borrower contribution bodes well for the company, indicating both a steady revenue stream and a testament to its ability to cultivate customer loyalty in a competitive fintech landscape. While short-term challenges and market uncertainties may arise, China's long-term potential remains robust and promising, presenting a unique opportunity to acquire undervalued assets amidst prevailing negative sentiment. Though risks associated with Qifu's equity price exist, I believe they are already factored into the current valuation, leaving investors with a generous margin of safety against potential losses. As we look ahead, I remain optimistic about Qifu's prospects and encourage investors to seize this opportune moment to participate in the thriving fintech industry of China.

"Nvidia Stock At A Make-Or-Break Level: Buy, Sell, Or Hold? (Technical Analysis)","Amid a rising interest rate environment,   and its big tech peers have served as a very profitable hiding spotMajor U.S. equity indices ,  have reconnected with key technical levels such as the 200-DMA  or are close to doing so , with the rapid run-up in long-duration treasury yields finally taking some wind out of big tech sails. However, I think the stock-bond dynamic has shifted or is shifting rightIn recent months, I have issued multiple warnings about unwarranted valuation premiums in the big tech arena  especially in leaders - Apple  and Microsoft  -  and outlined the top-heavy nature of this market as a significant risk to major equity indicesA big chunk of this year's rally in tech has been attributed to breakthroughs in Generative AI  argued by bulls  or the hype around it  by bears . While we have seen tons of product announcements and releases from a variety of companies, monetization of Generative AI technology remains an unsolved mystery  outside of Nvidia, which is the  picks   shovels  provider of this AI race .After releasing their Q3 reports earlier this week, leading AI stocks such as Microsoft, Alphabet Google , and Meta Platforms  haven't fared all that well, with investors seemingly dejected by a clear lack of progress on the monetization of Gen AI products and services that are eating up billions of dollars in CAPEX investment.Now, as a  picks   shovels  provider riding the red-hot generative AI theme, Nvidia is likely to deliver another blowout quarter next month and Nvidia's AI GPU  and now CPU  chips are projected to sell like hotcakes for the next few years  despite the U.S. banning exports of advanced AI chips to China .If there's any real, proven beneficiary of the generative AI trend, it is Nvidia. And yet, Nvidia's stock has lost considerable ground in recent sessions, along with its big tech peers. From a fundamental perspective, I think Nvidia will continue to perform well in upcoming quarters since its major customers  cloud hyperscalers  remain committed to their aggressive CAPEX spending plans in the hunt for AI dominance.In   Nvidia  The Magnificent One Delivers On Its AI Promise,  I shared the following stance on NVDA stockSince then, Nvidia has dropped by nearly 20  or  100 per share, and it is now trading very close to our fair value estimate of  390  shared in the note linked above . In light of NVDA's price decline, Nvidia's 5-year expected CAGR has moved up to  20 , rendering the stock a  Buy.  However, as I shared in my previous note -As of today, I stand by our model assumptions, fair value estimate, and projected returns. However, given the rapid run-up in long-duration bonds and heightened geopolitical risks, I see a greater possibility of a hard landing in the economy. And in that scenario, our generous FCF margin and sales growth assumptions can prove to be too aggressive. Before updating our model again, I would like to review the Q3 earnings report  November 21st  and learn about the business' trajectory from Nvidia's management during the conference call.From a fundamental perspective, I see no material weakness in Nvidia for the foreseeable future given the positive read-through from cloud hyperscalers  Microsoft and Alphabet , Meta Platforms, and Tesla . The valuation is subject to debate, and I am not entirely confident in our long-term growth and margin projections due to the elevated likelihood of the economy slipping into a recession at some point within the next 12 months. Hence, I would like to rely upon technical analysis in this particular case to help us make an informed investment decision.Back at  500 per share, I refused to chase NVDA stock despite mentioning that technically, the sky is the limit for Nvidia with no resistance at an all-time high. However, on the back of a  20  decline, Nvidia Corporation stock is now in a technical correction and currently sits at a make-or-break level at  400 per share, with lots of air underneath this psychological level.On the weekly chart, Nvidia looks to be forming a rounding top. With RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, Nvidia breaking the  400 level could trigger a sharp selloff because there's little to no support on the chart. As you can see below, Nvidia went up from  250-300 to  400-500 in a straight line, and in technical analysis, we tend to see such vertical moves get re-traced.Zooming in using the daily chart, we can observe the formation of a bearish  Head And Shoulders  pattern in NVDA stock with the neckline at  400-410. While we haven't broken the neckline yet, NVDA is poking under this key trendline, and a breakdown here seems inevitable given the technical breakdowns we are seeing in other big tech stocks and major equity indices.If NVDA stock breaks the  400 level and we see follow-through selling in the next few sessions, I would view it as a confirmation of the  H S  pattern. A bearish  H S  pattern that  is already playing out, and I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia joined the bear parade here. While Nvidia could find some support at the 200-DMA level  350 , the measured target of the  H S  pattern is  300, which also happens to be the technical gap fill level for Nvidia stock.In light of a -20  decline since my last update on Nvidia, the long-term risk reward for NVDA stock has improved significantly, with the stock moving closer to my fair value estimate of  390 and the 5-year expected return rising to nearly 20 . As a picks   shovels play, Nvidia should continue to benefit from the ongoing AI CAPEX spending bonanza from other big tech companies. Hence, I think Nvidia's financial performance will continue to remain strong, at least in the near term.That said, the wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields has increased the likelihood of a hard landing, which could negatively impact the demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Also, the U.S. ban on the export of AI chips to China poses a fresh challenge for our long-term growth projections for Nvidia. Given our valuation model for Nvidia is quite generous, I still don't think we have a margin of safety to deploy fresh capital into Nvidia.Technically, Nvidia's stock is trading at a make-or-break level. A breakdown here could send the stock into a tailspin down by  25  to  300 per share. Despite strong beats from its big tech peers for Q3, Nvidia and the  Magnificent 7  names are experiencing increased selling pressure in recent sessions, with major market indices breaching key technical levels.Looking at recent market action, I believe a  flight-to-safety  trade into long-duration treasury bonds  real safe haven  is seemingly underway, and a lot more money could come out of  previously high-flying  big tech stocks  perceived safe havens  in the next few weeks and months.Given the heightened macroeconomic, geopolitical, and technical headwinds, I cannot justify buying Nvidia at current levels. If we do see a breakdown of the  400 level  confirmation of the  H S  pattern , then I think NVDA stock will slide down to  250-350 range in a jiffy.For bold investors willing to weather volatility, Nvidia Corporation stock could be a decent bet right here. However, considering the near-to-medium term risk reward, I will be staying on the sidelines for now, but if NVDA gets down to  250-300, then count on me to be a buyer. I rate Nvidia  Neutral Hold  in the low  400s.Thank you for reading, and happy investing  If you have any questions, thoughts, and or concerns, please feel free to share them in the comments section below.In order to navigate this tricky economic period, we are pursuing  Bold, Active Investing with Proactive Risk Management  at our investing group - . Join our community today and take control of your financial future.Ahan Vashi has 10  years of investing experience with a professional background in equity research, private equity, and software engineering.

Oracle tumbles after AI event; Wall Street comes to defense,"Oracle  shares  on Friday following the company's , though several Wall Street analysts came to the IT giant's defense.Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi, who has a buy rating and  150 price target on Oracle Guggenheimer analyst John DiFucci, who also has a buy rating and  150 price target on Oracle, said that generative AI will eventually allow Oracle to bring more to its customers, but that it will happen over time.J.P.

Transitions In Value: Technology,"When the world changes, opportunities to find value may present themselves.Something, whether it's a geopolitical event or a new technology, creates a question about a company's future, and that question can impact valuations - so as value investors, we often are looking at companiesHere are some recent examples of technology sector segments that are being affected by transitions.The investment landscape is currently experiencing the exuberance of the generative AI hype cycle.But during a recent conference, some of our U.S. value equity team members attended, it was evident that AI's true complexities are understood by a relatively small group of engineers worldwide, highlighting the nascent nature of AI-related business models. This uncertainty raises fundamental questions.Will companies truly entrust significant business decisions toAnother pivotal question is ownership of the data that fuels AI models. The separation of data from the model is possible, but the process is not without challenges. As data flows into the model, some of that data will be allowed to improve the broader model, but data that companies own or view as proprietary will likely be excluded. Data being included in some cases and excluded in others creates another level of complexity for companies to evaluate. We start with one model, but do we fragment these models over time based on what data is included  How do we maintain multiple models and who pays for that is less certainAnother question  how will AI displace labor  One company we cover operates a call center generating approximately  500 million in revenue. The prevailing assumption in the market is that AI will devastate this sector, but the management team believes AI has the potential to transform the call center's performance for the better. The aim is not to replace human agents but to empower them by swiftly providing information, thereby enabling the weakest representative to match the performance of the best.Another company in this space that sells call center software has started to introduce AI bots into its software stack. What's even more interesting is that this company is doing this on a consumption basis versus a license basis, allowing for accelerating growth as usage ramps up.While these and other questions are being answered, AI-affected stocks may experience significant price fluctuations, driven by both overenthusiasm and apprehensions about AI's impact on businesses. Companies perceived as AI beneficiaries could see their stock prices soar, while those potentially exposed to AI-driven disruption may see their stock prices plummet.These distortions in valuations, both on the upside and the downside, present unique opportunities. Quality companies caught in the crosshairs of AI-related uncertainty might experience a temporary dip in stock prices, providing astute investors with an attractive entry point. As value investors - who focus on identifying quality companies trading at discounted prices - we seek to leverage this market dislocation.A few years ago, our team noticed a Massachusetts-based company specializing in disruptive laser technology. The company's innovative technology revolutionized metal cutting, which was previously dominated by blade, plasma, and CO methods with inefficient emissions and power consumption.We were interested in the company's robust balance sheet, which boasted more than  1 billion in cash, and its resilient business model. However, the company's stock remained prohibitively expensive for value investors - until a significant geopolitical event  Russia's invasion of Ukraine  came to pass.Approximately 35  of the company's workforce was based in Russia and Belarus, creating a precarious situation for the company when the conflict erupted. Its stock price plummeted by as much as 70 , presenting a unique opportunity for value investors to acquire the stock.As we expected, the drop in the company's stock price was temporary. The company's leadership quickly unveiled a comprehensive plan to mitigate the consequences of the geopolitical conflict by relocating a significant portion of its employee base, restructuring production facilities, and exploring merchant options  a notable shift from its previously vertically integrated approach .Over the course of several quarters, the company executed this strategic pivot effectively, stabilizing its operations and instilling confidence among investors. During this time, it continued to implement new products to disrupt other end-markets. The stock rebounded.Trade disputes, economic sanctions, or geopolitical tensions often cause investors to flee stocks they see as negatively impacted. Those same investors typically move into stocks they deem to be safer or better-positioned post-conflict. This transition may create a temporary mispricing within the stock that we, as value investors, try to capitalize on. The example above illustrates how geopolitical events, although taking place abroad, can affect quality companies within our primarily domestic universe and how we would evaluate an attractive entry point into said company.There's been a lot of talk about rolling recessions, in which some industries shrink while the overall economy remains above water. The semiconductor market is an example of this. The recession started in 2022 when the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index   1  was at around 4000 and bottomed in the fall of 2022 when the SIX was at around 2100.The primary concern was that as supply chains normalized, there would be a reduction in orders. We have seen some impact, as some lead times have started to contract. To give an example, lead times were extended dramatically - from 8 to 12 weeks to north of 52 weeks. In one extreme example, we heard of some products having a two-year lead time. But we have seen lead times start to normalize, and in some cases 52-week lead times have come in six months or less.The process of working through these constraints is called inventory normalization and is usually very painful.Take analog semiconductors as an example. Analog used to experience price declines of about 8  to 10  a year, but through a concerted effort by companies to manage capacity, by 2020 pricing was relatively flat year-over-year. Then the pandemic - with all its associated supply-chain disruptions - struck. Now pricing is up 20  to 30  across multiple product segments.As a result, most semiconductor companies are at peak margins. Some of them have doubled their operating margins. And not surprisingly, their stock returns have been off the charts. In fact, the SOX has returned to levels above 3500 as investors seem to have looked right through the inventory normalization that still needs to occur.Is that pricing sticky  Can companies maintain peak margins  Management teams believe so, but we are less sanguine. We expect some level of volume and pricing decline as the level of inventory is substantial. However, there are some strong secular drivers that we believe should impact semiconductor demand over the next decade.With a reset in earnings still expected, at least for a portion of the semiconductor market, we are being patient. We believe there likely will be a reset to earnings and the market will apply a reasonable price-to-earnings  P E  multiple to those lowered numbers. Thus, we continue to be patient and look for companies within 10  of our downside scenario. As the market starts to reprice quality companies, we will be ready to opportunistically add exposure.Value investors can potentially capitalize on shifting markets in transition by focusing on quality companies that are temporarily undervalued. These opportunities exist in more than the technology sector.",1,2023-09-21T04:00:00.000-04:00

I'll now turn the call over to Juan.Thank you, Megan and good morningOur trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.2 . This result reflect yet another strong quarter for ADM. I'm proud of the team's nimble execution against our strategic plan while adjusting our business model in light of both global macro trends and the evolving needs of our customers. The global market is increasingly dynamic with factors that create both opportunities and challenges for ADM to address.Consumer behavior has shown growing variability, spending more in some categories, while slow in spending in others. And our team has a proven ability to manage through these and the impacts of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and the constantly adjusting balances of commodity supply and demand. Within each business, we are focused on navigating these external factors carefully, while we're also building on the momentum we've seen through the year-to-date. As we look ahead, we are on track to exceed our 2023 previous expectations for the total company.In Ag Services   Oilseeds, we saw the accelerated energy transition support strong demand for vegetable oil, leading to a solid crush environment. We leveraged our flexible logistics footprint to manage Brazil's record crop and our Global Trade franchise to best match supply to demand worldwide. In Carb  ph  Solutions, we delivered a record third quarter on the strength of solid margins in starches, sweeteners, and flower, as well as robust ethanol demand that help us drive strong volumes and margins.In Nutrition, Flavors growth continued to outpace the market, while we both grew and executed on our revenue opportunity pipeline. The deliberate productivity and cost management actions we have taken in Animal Nutrition are enabling improved performance as we also see market volume recovery and we continue to navigate pockets of soft demand in certain categories of the Nutrition portfolio.Next slide, please. One of ADM's greatest competitive advantages is the breadth and integration of our business model, reaching from farm to fork. 2023 has offered several examples that of how we are creating new areas of growth in each business units. On the farm, ADM has one of the largest and most sophisticated global origination networks, connecting with hundreds of thousand farmer partners worldwide. We have unique and deep relationships with the people and technologies that are shaping the future of agriculture.So as more of our customers are looking for traceable, sustainable crop sources in their own supply chains, we are a natural connector and influencer. We are proud to have announced partnership with PepsiCo, Nestle and Carlsberg, and have a target of 4 million regenerative acres and goal by 2025. The carbon equivalent of power in more than 100,000 homes a year.Moving into production, as the pace of energy transition accelerates, demand for renewables fuel sources is growing rapidly and ADM is in a leading position to capitalize on this trend. With our Spiritwood JV with Marathon currently being commissioned, we are ready to fit the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. We have announced the Broadwing Energy Project, delivering lower emission power source and a critical part of lowering our carbon emissions used to power Decatur operations.And we're innovating to deliver a new low-carbon intensity products within the fast growing BioSolutions portfolio. And as we connect to the consumer, we're working closely with our customers to serve the challenges of their consumers, whether it's sustainable solutions, the latest flavor or a cost effective ingredient replacement or explore in the future of nutrition through work with ADM Ventures partners like Air Protein and Nourished. And we have differentiated our offerings with the next-generation of evidence-based health and wellness solution.With the world's largest probiotic manufacturing facility in Valencia, more than 50 clinical trials underway and a growing team of deep scientific experts, we are well positioned for the expanding demand for functional foods and personalized nutrition. And to efficiently execute on all areas of growth while maintaining an efficient cost structure, we continue to vigilantly focus on productivity, as well as the culture that let our ADM colleagues bring their best every day.Across our global organization, we're standardizing processes and systems through One ADM and modernizing our operations through digital transformation, driving greater efficiencies while enabling the best use of our workforce and production capacity. Our planned modernization program continues to deliver impressive operational benefits, including advanced analytics and safety improvements across the 17 operations facilities currently in implementation phase. With more than 70 plants in the scope, the planned recurring cost savings associated with automation across our footprint in 2024 is already nearing  20 million per year.Our cultural efforts are the critical foundation for all of these strategic initiatives. We have ramped up our focus on a culture of caring, specifically in regards to the safety of our colleagues. This is our top priority. And our recent performance in this area has not lived up to our expectations. We are committed to taking action to improve and have already begun to do so with the assistance of both internal and external experts. We will do better.By actively managing productivity, innovation and culture and aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, ADM is well positioned for sustainable long-term profit growth across new and adjacent avenues. And with the strong performance in 2023 and a constructive expectation for the remainder of the year, we are again raising our full-year earnings outlook.For a deeper look at our Q3 performance, let me hand over to Vikram, who will cover results of operations.Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 5. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team once again delivered solid results in an increasingly dynamic environment by leveraging our experience, scale and integrated global footprint. Ag Services results were lower than the strong third quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as our team delivered significantly higher volumes and margins on strong export demand. Prior investments in port capabilities have enabled us to structurally grow our earnings while capitalizing on a stronger margin environment across the region.North American results were lower year-over-year as a result of the shift of export demand to Brazil, due to the large crop there as well as low water levels in the U.S. river system, limiting volume and barge capacity. Effective risk management, combined with higher volumes and margins in Global trade led to strong results. However, much lower than the record quarter last year. The current quarter also included a  48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida.In Crushing, we delivered another strong quarter, but lower than the prior year as global crush margins remained healthy, but lower than the very strong levels of a year ago. Our strong results were led by North America, as the crush margin environment remains well supported by structurally higher demand for vegetable oils. We officially opened our new crush facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota to meet growing demand. We are currently in the commissioning process and expected to be running at full rates in early November, adding an additional 1.5 million metric tons of crush capacity per year.In EMEA, we continue to optimize our flex capacity to prioritize crush of higher margin softseed, in line with market opportunities. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects which were lower than the net positive impacts in the prior year quarter. Refined Products and other posted another strong quarter, higher than the prior year period, results were led by solid volumes and margins in North America.In EMEA, robust export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil drove higher results versus the prior year. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects, which are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar was significantly lower versus the third quarter of 2022.Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we anticipate strong results that are slightly lower than last year, excluding the  110 million legal settlement in the ag services subsegment from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect Ag Services results to be in line with the prior year, excluding the legal settlement. We anticipate similar year-over-year North American export volumes, a competitive South American export program and continued strong performance from global trade.We forecast our crushing subsegment will deliver strong results similar to the prior year. We expect robust soy and canola crush margins and with the ramping of our Spiritwood operations higher volumes. We expect RPO to perform well, but be significantly below last year as positive timing impacts from prior quarters are expected to reverse.Slide 6, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered an outstanding quarter that was significantly higher than the prior year, enabled by the ongoing optimization of our production and supply chain network. The starches and sweeteners subsegment were higher year-over-year on a healthy demand and strong margin environment across starches, sweeteners, wheat flour and ethanol. Our team generated new customer wins and delivered double-digit growth year-to-date in our BioSolutions platform.As Juan touched on earlier, we also signed a formal agreement with Broadwing Energy to provide lower emissions power to Decatur facility, extending our ability to provide low carbon solutions across the value chain. In the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, our team executed well in a strong ethanol demand and margin environment, leading to significantly higher year-over-year results.Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect steady demand and margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flower products. We remain constructive on ethanol margins driven by solid domestic demand and healthy U.S. exports, supported by lower competing exports from Brazil due to higher sugar prices. We anticipate results to be similar to the prior year period, but with upside potential if the current ethanol margin structure holds.On Slide 7. In Nutrition, strong results in Flavors, health and wellness and recovery in the base Animal Nutrition business were more than offset by continued lower demand for plant-based proteins and persistent demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions. Flavors reported impressive results in a complex operating environment, delivering a 29  growth in operating profit on a constant currency basis.Results were led by pricing actions in EMEA and strong win rates in North America. During the quarter, we also implemented a successful go-live of our One ADM project in the EMEA region across 18 locations in 12 countries. This represents a significant milestone as we continue to harness digital across the enterprise to drive productivity gains.In Specialty Ingredients, weak market demand, particularly in the alternate meat category, inventory adjustments and unplanned downtime resulting from the recent Decatur incident led to significantly lower year-over-year results. The plant-based protein market has been experiencing destocking and consumer demand softness over the course of the year that will likely persist into next year. Given these recent market dynamics, we have re-scoped our Decatur protein modernization investment project to better match the expected lower growth demand environment.Also, we are leveraging our expertise in creation, design and development to differentiate our product offerings to serve evolving consumer needs. These adjustments will enable a faster pivot to higher growth and more resilient categories such as specialized nutrition, which have synergies across the nutrition portfolio, and we are rapidly building this revenue pipeline.Health   Wellness results were higher year-over-year due to double-digit bioactives sales and a favorable impact related to the revised commercial agreement with Spiber. During the quarter, we realized a significant expansion in our revenue pipeline, reinforcing the demand for evidence-based solutions.In Animal Nutrition, we are beginning to see the cost optimization actions and the expansion of offerings in the specialty feed and ingredient space from earlier this year, driving improved performance. However, the recovery in the base business was more than offset by normalized year-over-year amino acids margins as well as lower profit contribution from the Pet Solutions business.Looking forward, we anticipate flavors to finish the year strong, driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Health   wellness operating profit is expected to finish similar to last year. Animal Nutrition operating profit is expected to continue to recover sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Specialty Ingredients operating profit is expected to be down significantly, impacted by the recent Decatur East incident and demand softness.All in, we now expect full year 2023 operating profit for Nutrition to be around  600 million. While our results in 2023 have been below our expectations, we expect nutrition to return to growth in 2024. We will continue to build on the Flavors momentum from 2023. Health   wellness should maintain its steady performance. The cost actions in the shopper pivot to higher-margin products will enable Animal Nutrition to drive growth, further reinforced by improved go-to-market capabilities. Lastly, for SI, we will work aggressively to restart operational capabilities at Decatur East to minimize the impact in 2024.Slide 8, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results were slightly lower on higher claim settlements partially offset by premiums from new programs. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of  298 million were higher versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support our digital transformation efforts.Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still forecast corporate cost to be approximately  1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was approximately 20  higher than the prior year primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16  and 19 .Next slide, please. Through the third quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of  3.8 billion. We continue to invest in the business, allocating  1.1 billion to capital expenditures and have returned  1.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have ample liquidity with over  13 billion of cash and available credit, and our balance sheet is very strong, with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9.Our fortress balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to drive our long-term strategic agenda while also returning capital to shareholders and is also a competitive advantage, particularly in a higher for longer interest rate environment. We have completed  1.1 billion of share repurchases through Q3 and expect to increase the pace of repurchases in Q4. Even with the softness in nutrition, and lower-than-expected profit contributions from Wilmar. We are raising our 2023 earnings outlook again and now anticipate full year EPS in excess of  7 per share.JuanThank you, Vikram. As we close today's call, let me share a few thoughts about how we're seeing our efforts in 2023 position ADM to continue solid progression into 2024. External factors that influence ADM's forward look are closely aligned to the enduring macro trends we have positioned ourselves to be nimble in managing. We continue to see the interconnectivity across food security, health and well-being and sustainability having an amplifying effect across the industries we serve.More frequent extreme weather, extreme weather, geopolitical events and the recent pandemic have all highlighted the criticality of food security within those geographies and for the regions that are served by their agricultural exports. Connected to this, we see areas of supply abundance growing as evidenced by Brazil's record recent crop cycles and areas of need shifting. In some cases, this has resulted in either more domestic consumption in countries like the U.S. or elevated import demand situations where our unparalleled global asset base and deep experience are critical.Government policies beginning to support new demand patterns, whether based on a move to more renewable energy sources or an effort to increase regenerative agriculture supply. Science continues to accelerate innovation in Nutrition with an ever-present consumer interest in turning their food, beverage and supplement consumption to their personal health and dietary needs. Beyond the challenges and opportunities connected to these external factors, we believe ADM is positioned to leverage productivity and innovation to build momentum in the coming year, a continuation of the strategic efforts we have been driving throughout 2023.We anticipate our Services and Oilseeds continue to leverage its extended value chain and deliver structural changes to demand. We anticipate that crush margins will remain healthy while our productivity measures enable us to have a more efficient cost structure. We continue to drive opportunistic extension of our destination marketing scope, grow our regenerative agriculture acres and partnerships, and expand our renewable fuels feedstock production. In Carb Solutions, the compounding effects of our transformative investments coupled with early contracting for starches and sweeteners and what we believe to be a positive ethanol environment are setting up for another strong year in 2024.For Nutrition, we expect continued growth in our revenue opportunity pipeline with significant conversions continuing as we move past some near-term demand weakness. Our expanding results in flavors continue to signal acceleration across our broader portfolio. We expect the positive revenue growth trends in Health   Wellness to drive into next year, and we're already pivoting Specialty Ingredients towards high potential areas like alternative daily and specialized nutrition.Our actions in Animal Nutrition are delivering a positive impact and sustained opportunity growth, which we believe will expand further through the segment in the coming year. And by applying our commercial excellence efforts to this portfolio, we are focusing on the value of innovation in the specialty parts of the business.In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. With the momentum we have been building upon the foundation for growth we have established, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth.Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Our first question for today comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about the U.S. crush margin outlook. You commented that you expect crush margins to remain healthy. And I guess this is really a question about 2024 where the U.S. broadcast features have come down. What's your perspective on what's going on there  Do you think that the crush capacity that's coming on is having an impact, or how is that being absorbed  I guess, just trying to frame your commentary around momentum with what's going on in crush  Thanks.Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. Listen, our perspective have not changed. If anything, the perspective that we have for the market has been confirmed by what we're saying. Of course, it's a very dynamic environment with the market trying to balance a lot of issues, whether it's more availability of products, more demand, the Argentine situation. We have seen board crush explode back to near the highs recently. And this is just only a reflection of the incredible demand that is coming for soybean meal into the U.S. This drives the board crush has -- it was mill driven maybe before it was oil driven, this was mill driven.You see Argentina situation, they are getting to the end of their inventory. There are probably enough beans at this point for crushers to run until November. So what we see the export book of the U.S. for soybean meal is a record export book from the U.S., something that is higher than over the last 10 years. So I think that, that will continue well into Q1 of 2024.And fundamentally, what has changed, and you have that, if you were island of strong crush margins in the U.S. is this demand for oil. We see crush margins have been a little bit lower for soybean, certainly in Brazil or in Europe, and it s because some of the oil prices have declined. But in the U.S. with the new demand for renewable green diesel and the new   all the new capacity coming, we expect that to remain strong for years to come. So we will continue to be very constructive at our crush margins in the U.S.Great. Thank you very much.You re welcome.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Yeah. Good morning. Juan, Vikram, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on Nutrition and the updated guidance calling that roughly  600 million op income for the year. Help us understand if you can, putting that into context to what just a while ago, we've talked about the path to make this business a  1 billion operating income business. What has gone into the wrong direction and what do you still need to correct to bring this business back on track to make it a  1 billion contributor  Thank you.Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. So let's take it by different business lines. So in flavors, as I mentioned, Q3 had a very strong performance. And if you actually look year-to-date, Flavors operating profit is up 16 . And I think that's been a very important growth engine, and typically, the sales cycle in Flavors tends to be shorter than some of our other product portfolios. So just keep that in mind, that momentum is building and we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month-over-month, we anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly, continuing into 2024.The other aspect is EBITDA margins of Flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion. And finally, Flavors contribution year-to-date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50 . So important to keep that as a back of your mind as we think about the future. The second part of the Human Nutrition business, Health   Wellness.Health   Wellness have been steady. Actually, the dietary supplements market, which was a little bit of a headwind has -- we see the destocking tend to see the bit, and we are optimistic about the outlook next year. The other thing that Juan mentioned is the evidence-based portfolio of ingredients is expanding and our ability to apply that into functional food and solutions gives us confidence and that business to continue growing into next year and beyond.Specialty Ingredients. Actually, it's a tale of two cities within Specialty Ingredients. There's a texturants  ph  portfolio that has done exceptionally well because of expansion of margins. We don't talk much about that, but because it's a smaller part of the business, but that has performed exceptionally well this year. The challenge has been on the plant-based protein market. And the plant-based protein is driven by market softness, right  There is a softness in the market, and we've gone down as a consequence of what's happening in the market.What we are doing from that perspective is pivoting the portfolio into some of the more resilient categories like specialized nutrition like or to dairy. It doesn't happen overnight. But remember, we -- through our CD E capabilities, it allows us to pivot our product portfolio into the categories that are growing, and we will do that. We are in the process of doing that. What happened in the interim is the Decatur East incident.What that's created is a challenge in terms of white flake production for specialty proteins in North America. So that's been a drag that we clearly had not foreseen and that drag is going to continue into 2024. So within Human Nutrition, Flavors performing exceptionally well outpacing the market, Health   Wellness study, SI is kind of in line with market, further exacerbated by the recent Decatur East incident.Then step into Animal Nutrition, what happens with amino acids. We were coming off very high margins in 2022. The good news is, we are going to reset in a much more normalized margin levels in 2023. So therefore, '24 onwards, we won't have that lapping impact of higher amino acid margins.But if you exclude amino acid margins, the base Animal Nutrition business, excluding pet solutions, we talked about all the actions of business is undertaking to optimize costs as well as drive focus on Specialty Ingredients, that is being recognized in performance. We are seeing the benefits of that and you'll see sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. So that, we feel very good about this in Q4 as well as going forward.Ag Solutions, demand creation remains solid, that category has been fantastic. We've had challenges in demand fulfillment in North America, and particularly, we talked about that primarily in the recent acquisition that we did in 2021. Those are still lingering, but we have very clear action plans, and we feel confident that by the end of this year and early next year, we will be able to more than offset that.So all in all, combined with that a new innovation, we feel pretty confident that nutrition will return to growth in 2024. And albeit maybe at a slightly lower growth rate than we had anticipated before. But getting to  1 billion is definitely within the horizon. It may not happen in the next year or in year falling, but definitely in the near term or in the medium term.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Good morning and thanks for the question. The details on the crush moves, I think Andrew's question was helpful. But maybe we could dig a little bit more into what's happening on the oil side. I mean we have seen soybean oil prices come down over the past couple of months. The futures curve does suggest some continued pressure as we move into '24. It sounds like you have plenty of visibility that demand is very strong on this side, but maybe just some color on what might have caused this downward price move and whether it's more temporary in nature in your viewYeah. Thank you, Tom. Listen, North America refining margins are lower in this quarter. I think if you look at last year, the high priced oils were impacted by supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war. So I would say this is a more normalized environment. We have also some positive timing impacts due to the pronounced RIN and HVO market movements, pulling forward some of those gains. I would say when we look at the forward quarter, we see remain refining margins to remain strong, but maybe a decline from the elevated highs we saw in 2022 on the early part of this year. Biodiesel margins are also coming out of the highs, as maybe the RIN value component of margin has declined as the industry is building a bank of rings.So we still have not seen a significant pull from the RD demand that it's been building but we maintain our expectation of how much it's going to be built there. So we think that is coming. The other thing you need to think about oil is that demand for food oil is very strong and has rebounded. And there are expectations now that with El Nino, we might have and with the natural maturity of the plantations in the -- in Southeast Asia that we might have a little bit less supply of palm oil and all that. So although, we are coming off the highs, we continue to be constructive about margin stabilizing at a strong level in the RPO area.Right. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to -- maybe dig in on the Carb Solutions outlook and maybe if you could just parse the non-ethanol pieces a little bit more. And I think in the prepared remarks, you alluded to kind of a favorable start to contracting in North America sweeteners and starches and maybe elaborate on what you are actually seeing there, maybe better frame kind of the incremental capital investments to come in that business.Obviously, there's a lot of transformation work happening in that business. That's not all much kind of come to fruition in the near term, but better contextualize kind of what the actual level of investment that you've already committed to there, there is  And if I could just ask a clarifying question on the last point on RPO. How much was the timing benefit in the third quarterAbout  95 million.Thank you.So on the Carb Solutions question, Adam, I think it's important to just frame it. The liquid sweetener volumes have been steady. And this has happened throughout this year. Almost every quarter, we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded.The BioSolutions market, we're actually extending into new applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23 . Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments, has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins. As on all you know what's going on in ethanol. It as goes, the margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got a significant -- actually higher domestic driving miles.Now when you think about next year, I mean we're well set up for the Q4 '23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipated in 2023, and early '24 contracting in North America, sweeter and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive and similarly for ethanol, that tends to be volatile. But right now, the general trends to be supportive of a higher-for-longer ethanol margin environment.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. I have kind of a two-pronged question. One is -- one, you've kind of hit bits and pieces and Vikram as well with the nutrition commentary of the overall business outlook into 2024. The kind of implicit takeaway is, we should still expect kind of very strong and above what, I guess, we would think of as mid-cycle earnings power in 2024, albeit it's early to make that call in 2024. So correct me if I'm wrong there.But two, when you think about allocating capital at this point in the cycle, how does that change, if at all, with what you've been doing over the last several years, and you've been picking up your buyback activity, how should we be thinking about that as we move through this period of time as well  Thank you.Yeah. Thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions continuing. Ag Services and Oilseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes. And I think that that's a multiyear trend.So we're going to see higher crush margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our Ag Services business continued to grow around the world in the -- with the strength of destination marketing and that exacerbated concern about food security that bring -- brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world. So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor.Carb Solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses. We are finding new demand for those products that will do two things, will grow as revenue into new categories like, we're seeing in BioSolutions that is growing double-digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time, and we've seen that already, so those are the two.And I think Nutrition and Vikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year. This year, maybe you call it the past that refreshes, we took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation. That continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in Health   Wellness in what we are seeing in Flavors or the specialty pieces of Animal Nutrition or the demand generation impact, where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share, and we're growing faster than the competitors. So we see that with a lot of optimism for next year.When we think about how that correlates to our thinking of how to deploy capital, the priority to deploying capital is in our investment plan, and we have been doing that both in OpEx and in CapEx. Unfortunately, CapEx continues to be higher, inflationary pressure there, whether it's non-power or supply of raw materials, make us take a second look at a lot of the capital. And I think that Vikram has reflected on some of the adjustments that we made, maybe to Specialty Ingredients and other. So we're taking a look at that, and we're reviewing as always in our capital discipline on every project.But we have many opportunities in front of us, and we're going to continue to fund them. We have increased our return to shareholders. Certainly, our cash flow generation is very strong. And to be honest, when we see some of the pivot we are doing even in Carb solution with some of these opportunities, they are not hugely loading our CapEx, if you will. Some of these things where there is the pipeline for decarbonization is with partners, whether it's the LG Chem or other joint ventures are also partnerships. So it's not that taxing in our CapEx budget, if you will.So we think that we're going to continue to increase the return to shareholders. And we've been opportunistic looking at, of course, the M A environment. And to be candid, we participate in many. We have many items on the fire, but the reality is that valuations have not come down, and we plan to continue to keep our discipline in that regard. So we continue to be opportunistic in that and we look at that. I think Vikram will make a comment on this one.Yeah. I think also in terms of buybacks, good to remind everyone that if you remember in our 2021 Investor Day, we talked about  5 billion of buybacks over the next four years through 2025. If you combine what we've done last year and this year, we've done almost about  2.6 billion of buyback, so we are ahead of that pace. And as I mentioned in my comments and as Juan said, if we don't see compelling valuations and given our discipline, we probably at these trading levels, price levels, we probably are going to buy back a little more aggressively, and you probably will see a stronger pace of buybacks in Q4 as a consequence of some of those factors.Okay. Very good. Thanks so much.Thank you, Ben.Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.Thank you very much. I want to ask a little bit about the carbonization and the work you're trying to do Decatur. And I think when we -- you were talking about the 7 million tons of you're trying to sequester per year, the idea is that some of these will come from other facilities where you probably need to build pipelines. I'm just wondering, we're seeing a lot of issues with permitting and other issues with CO2 pipelines in other regions.Could this -- could you face similar issues and could this affect the total amount you will be able to request your indicator or on the other hand, could this actually be an opportunity and people that were relying on some other pipelines like Navigator 1  ph  may come to you and use your indicator wells for sequestrationYeah. Thank you, Salvator for the question. This is a very important initiative for ADM. And it's something that, as you know, we have started like 10 years ago, so it's something that we have a lot of experience in, and we're leveraging that experience and that head start, if you will, in our ability to inject carbon into the lower surfaces in our facility at Decatur. We have a couple of wells there, and we're planning, as you said, to create five more injection wells over the next few years.It is true part of that will be bringing biogenic CO2 generated by our ethanol plants through pipelines. And we are working already in two of those pipelines. We have already submitted permits for all that. Those permits have been accepted. So they are complete. They are in the process of being studied and analyzed, and we are reviewing also with our partners the right of way and acquisitions and all those type of agreements.Of course, as any industry that is breaking ground the pioneer suffer sometimes with the regulatory environment and having to adjust all that. So we're working closely with the authorities across different states and in terms of trying to align the regulatory framework to the needs of decarbonization and to the desires of the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to have a smart agriculture in the U.S. and decarbonize that.So work in progress, as you said, we have seen the news that you do. And you can take two tax that we might suffer a similar fate or that we will have less competition as you described. At this point in time, we don t have any bad news to report other than we continue forward with our efforts, and we will update you in the next call.Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Davis Sunderland of Baird. Davis, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you for the time and thank you for taking my question.You re welcome.Juan you already talked about it a little bit, but I just wanted to ask if you could expand a little bit more on the ethanol and renewable diesel supply and demand environment, maybe what you're seeing for '24 and beyond  And if you anticipate any incremental changes in consumer behavior over that time  Thank you very much.Yeah, Davis. Listen, in ethanol, we think ethanol is going to have a very constructive environment, very high sugar prices are driving Brazilians to produce a lot of sugar versus ethanol, so we're going to have less inputs of ethanol, biofuels mandates are growing around the world, whether it's more ethanol or more biodiesel. So we see Brazil going up 1  per year in that regard. And we see ethanol continues to have very good export.It has a very good value to other  indiscernible  that normally, they go for like  2.50 per gallon. So we have a big advantage around the world. And for people that want to increase the octane in their gasoline. Ethanol is a very cheap  indiscernible  around the world. So the U.S. is the best producer of that, will continue to increase. So you can see export having maybe a floor of 1.4 billion gallons going into 1.5 million. So that's very good.When we look at renewable green diesel, there has been no changes on how we see renewal diesel growth in the medium term, which is to get to around 5 billion gallons in the U.S. by 2025, 2026. Of course, we're a global company, we see that becoming 7 billion to 8 billion gallons by maybe -- and maybe 14 billion, 15 billion gallons of renewable green diesel and SAF online by 2026 and 2027.So we are at the very early innings of all these biofuel demand that is coming, whether it s again for renewable green diesel or the promise of decarbonization that SAF brings to aviation that it doesn t have any other valid options right now. So again, we re going to be a player that speedy good shows that. We re going to bring 1.5 million tons of capacity that will feed 75 million gallons of RGV. So we expect the others will deliver as we have delivered Spiritwood. So this is an industry we re building that we re excited about.Thank you very much.You re welcome.Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just ask a question on the guidance. I think previously, you're kind of saying  7 with some upside and now you're saying in excess of  7. So maybe if you could just kind of help us, I don't know, maybe quantify the difference in the two guidances and size, the upside piece would be helpful. Thank you.Well, so I think the first thing to note is, when in Q2, we said around  7 for potential -- with potential for more upside. And what we have seen saying right now is that potential upside is coming through, and that's why we're raising our guidance in excess of  7. But if you step back, Steven, think about what's happened between Q2 and Q3. One is, clearly, nutrition has been softer. We had guided to it similar in Q2. Now we are guiding to around  600 million. So you know, by definition, there's a compensation in other parts of the business.And when you think about the compensation relative to our Q2, that's probably going to come partially from AS O and partially from CS. And we gave some guidance on AS O for Q4 and also some guidance for CS. CS to be rough relatively flat versus Q4, barring any continued expansion in ethanol margins, so that could be upside in CS. And in AS O, we have some puts and takes in RPO in particular, and one went through this. We expect that to be weaker than Q4 of last year just because we expect these mark-to-market timing gains we realized in Q3 to be rolling off.And then in Ag Services, it s going to be generally flat, excluding the legal settlement that was a onetime thing in Q4 of last year. And then in crush, it s going to be strong. And I think Juan talked about that we are continuing to be constructive about the cross outlook particularly in the U.S. going forward, given some of the structural demand changes related to renewable green diesel in particular.Thank youThank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Ms. Britt for any further remarks.Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-24T12:36:03.000-04:00

Why Holding About 50% In Cash Equivalents Makes Sense For Investors Right Now,"Recessions and bear markets will occur as long as free markets exist. Pretending they don't exist or don't matter is not a good way to get better-than-average investment returns. And those investors who ignore the possibility of long bearHere is how my cash position has progressed.At the beginning of 2022, after being nearly fully investedAt the beginning of this year, I thought investors should be prepared for a -30  decline in the S P 500. Here is how the S P 500 ETF  and the Equal Weighted S P 500 ETF  have performed so far this year.As you can see, neither one of them is down -30 , even though there is a big divergence between the returns of the two. In this article, I explain why I have roughly maintained my overall cash positioning this year. I still have about a 45  cash equivalent position in my individual accounts and about a 60  cash equivalent position in my 401k. I also explain why I think it is wise for most investors to have somewhere between 40  and 60  in 'cash' right now.Before we get into the likely reasons why the S P 500 has rallied this year, it's important to point out that bear market rallies are normal and in my opinion, we are still in a bear market.The above chart is of total returns since January 1st, 2022. It is important to keep in mind that in the US we have had about 12  inflation during this time as well, so in terms of actual purchasing power, we need to subtract about 12  more from the displayed returns above. The worst performer by far has been long-duration government bonds which have lost half their purchasing power in two years. These are often pitched as  safe  to investors or  ballasts  for portfolios. The best thing investors could have done is avoid these at all costs over the past several years. Even though the percentage decline in value isn't as bad over this period as Cathy Wood's utterly dismal Ark Innovation Fund , the magnitude of losses in government bonds is probably in the hundreds of billions, which dwarfs ARKK in terms of total value lost, and I don't think even the most gullible investors ever though ARKK was  safe . Even if the value of these bonds ultimately recovers over the next two decades it's hard to imagine how inflation doesn't eat away at least half of the purchasing power.Next, we see that Vanguard's Balanced Index Fund , which is what I use as a 60 40 portfolio proxy is down -11 . Even the mighty  and the ever-popular Dividend ETF  remain in a bear market. Only my preferred cash equivalent, , has produced a positive return since January 2022, with a 6  return, which is still about -6  less than inflation, but it's at least close, and in 2023 TFLO's return has surpassed that of inflation.Overall, my individual portfolios are down about -6  over this period even though I've been consistently adding growth stocks while maintaining about a 45  TFLO weighting. So, my overall defensive positioning hasn't caused me to suffer much since 2022 relative to QQQ and SPY, even with the bear market rally we have seen this year.I think there are four main reasons SPY has rallied this year relative to the equal-weighted RSP. The first is that student loan repayments were successfully delayed by the Biden Administration for nearly two years until they finally resumed this month. These repayments will be a huge drag on the economy, and dramatically increase the odds of a recession each month as time goes on as this money is sucked out of the economy.The second reason is there is a mismatch between short-term interest rates and rates that people and businesses were able to lock in for the long term when rates were very low. So, what has happened so far is investors in short-duration treasuries, money markets, and CDs, are now collecting about 5  interest, but those people like myself with a sub-3  fixed mortgage, or even people with 4  long-term fixed auto loan  which can now be as long as 6 or 7 years  are not paying higher rates, yet. In the short term, as a commenter on my last S P 500 article pointed out, higher short-term rates can be stimulative. Personally, I think there are offsetting issues like student loan repayments and the types of spending patterns those different demographics of people tend to have  older savers with cash spend less than younger spenders with loan repayments in the economy , which I think will balance out this potential stimulative effect, or, at the very least, slow down the effect that higher short-term rates have on the economy. The bottom line is that it is taking longer for higher rates to slow the economy than I initially expected, but time is not on the side of the economy the longer rates remain elevated and more people and businesses have to refinance.The third reason is that mega-cap tech companies were able to effectively cut costs much more quickly, and had much more fat they could trim, than I would have thought. When combined with their solid balance sheets, many of these mega-caps were able to improve their overall business quality relative to the rest of the S P 500.If you look at revenue growth from some of the biggest companies in the S P 500 for the first six months of this year, they are on track to average about 6  or 7  revenue growth this year  not great, considering inflation is 3-4 .Yet, many of the stock prices have risen 6x or more than revenues have. I think a lot of this has to do with cost-cutting for the ones that are up more than 30 . But cost-cutting can only go so far. Eventually, the top line is going to have to grow in order to justify the current valuations. This is going to be difficult to do in an economic environment that is facing nothing but headwinds going forward  not to mention complete gridlock in Washington .And the last reason this handful of mega-cap tech stocks has rallied is AI and the speculation surrounding it. So, we have kind of experienced a speculative bubble in the middle of a bear market. Mega-cap, market-moving stocks like Nvidia  and Tesla  have participated in this rally. It remains to be seen how sustainable it will be over time. Both of these businesses are cyclical even if they are in secular growth industries.In the end, none of the reasons for the stock market rally in mega-caps this year should be taken as a sign that the risk of a recession or the continued bear market is over.I will make a pretty simple three-part argument for why holding somewhere between 40  and 60  cash equivalent makes sense. The first part of the argument is the primary appeal of holding stocks from the point of view of a long-term or medium-term investor is that quality businesses have pricing power so if there is inflation, those costs can be passed on to the customers of that business. So, inflation protection is the primary attribute of quality stocks when compared to bonds. The primary attribute of cash equivalents like, CDs, money markets, and short-duration treasuries is that there isn't much, if any, price risk. You know what your return will be with cash, but what you don't know is how much will be left after inflation. This differs from the risk of owning stocks, which have the risk the price could fall and not recover over a given time period as well as the risk the business might not be as high quality as the investor expected.Right now, short-term treasuries and high-quality stocks  as represented by the S P 500  both have expected returns between 5  and 5.5  if we compare the earnings yield and growth with the yields on cash equivalents. I will note here that an investor needs to be able to 1  identify quality businesses, and 2  estimate the future earnings of those businesses over a given period of time, in order to make this comparison. This is something I do in my Investing Group, but Ray Dalio as recently as last week has publicly stated this same observation that cash and quality stocks have similar expected returns as well, so I don't think my estimates are too far off the mark given the information we have right now. The practical implication of this situation is that there is probably very little, if no, opportunity cost risk in holding cash-like investments if they are yielding between 5  and 5.5 , and they are liquid. Inflation has already fallen below 4 , so even in the event of an energy price spike, holding cash doesn't have much risk associated with it right now from inflation. Stocks, however, do have recession risk and risk associated with their high valuations, so the prices can certainly fall.For demographic and geopolitical reasons, as well as due to the very leveraged nature of the US economy, I think there is a decent chance inflation will remain relatively persistent in the coming decade. There are too few workers and too much work that needs to be re-shored for defense and resilience reasons, along with an aging population, for the US to experience the deflationary pressures we've had during the past two decades. Unless we get world peace and stability sooner rather than later, that means the only way inflation stays persistently down is  1  through productivity gains  which might happen in some areas due to AI and automation but will not happen everywhere in the economy  or  2  a recession. I have termed this situation a  fragile stagflation , in which the normal state of affairs is the sort of stagflation we've seen the past 18 months, occasionally punctuated with slowdowns and recessions. What I don't see is a great boom of economic growth without inflation to go along with it.When we put all this together, it makes sense to me to have a significant part of one's portfolio in the stocks of high-quality businesses that can pass inflation on to customers and also might be able to grow faster than average in a stagnant economic environment. These stocks will guard against the danger of stagflation. It also makes sense to have cash available to invest during the occasional recession or slowdown that comes along from time to time. I think it's only through avoiding some of the damage during drawdowns, and then capitalizing on the occasional cheap prices that might pop up that investors are going to be able to get returns over the next 5-10 years that exceed, say 2-3  more per year than inflation.In short, cash and the S P 500 offer similar return prospects right now over the medium term, but during a downturn, cash has the benefit of optionality that a person 100  invested in stocks  even quality stocks  does not have. Of course, for this strategy to work a person has to be willing to put that cash to work even if it's scary at the time.I am often told things like  timing the market doesn't work  when I warn about the dangers of deep drawdowns and bear markets. But we don't have to time the market in order to see we've never had a time in history where both stocks and bonds were as richly valued as they were in January of 2022. At the most basic level, you can just look at the bond yields and dividend yields.The above chart stops in January 2022. It doesn't require any market timing skills to look at those yields and understand they were inadequate compared to the inflation risk an investor was taking at the time.Now, however, cash yields something. Times have changed. It doesn't require any market timing skills to see this, either.Lastly, I'll close with a final chart. It's the performance of SPY and QQQ from the decade of 2000 to 2010.This is what happened to investors who ignored valuations in the year 2000. They experienced more than 10 years of losses. But at least during this time period, duration bonds performed well and inflation was low. That is not the case during the current downturn.Cash equivalents right now  investments. And relative to other investments in the market, they have a good risk reward. The key danger of holding cash  inflation  can be balanced out by holding quality, growing businesses, as well in roughly equal parts. This strategy isn't going to make anyone rich, but it might be able to prevent one from becoming poor over the next 5-10 years.If you have found my strategies interesting, useful, or profitable, consider supporting my continued research by joining the .

The ongoing challenges within the biopharma segment and economic constraints in China continued to drive lower Life Sciences performance in the quarter. Clinical Diagnostics sales were weaker than we forecasted impacted mainly by the softer China market conditions. We still anticipate a strong year-over-year growth with Clinical Diagnostics Group in the fourth quarter. We continue to successfully maintain focus on tight cost control and on the supply chain front, we experienced modest constraints in supply for our clinical business, which impacted Q3 sales. Backlog remains on track to meet our year-end expectations.In Q3, we experienced further reduced demand from biopharma customers for our process chromatography resins and from both biopharma and smaller biotech customers for our Life Science research projects -- products. The continued tight spending environment in this segment constrained core ddPCR sales, which were roughly flat from the year ago period. Academic and government sales for Life Sciences was strong in the Americas, but showed declines in APAC driven down by China economic and policy constraints. EMEA academic sales were roughly flat, reflecting a soft funding environment in Germany, offset by stronger performance in the other European countries.While ddPCR sales within the quarter were softer than expected as a result of biopharma spending, we remain very positive on the long-term growth outlook for the platform. During the quarter, we were encouraged by several noteworthy announcements involving ddPCR. On the clinical testing front, our QX ONE platform has been selected for SMA testing for all newborns in Hong Kong. And here in the U.S., Geneoscopy announced they have published the results of their pivotal CRC-PREVENT clinical trial, reporting the highest sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer amongst similar tests powered by our QXDx ddPCR platform.Additionally, in the U.S., Verily won a major multiyear national wastewater testing contract from the CDC based on our QX600 platform. We see these as contributors to future growth and a strong reinforcement of the versatility and impact of the technology.As highlighted earlier, China was a continued challenge in Q3 for our Life Sciences business. And unfortunately, the economic constraints have now also impacted our Clinical Diagnostics business, which in the first half of the year has been a positive for us in this region. We have now further constrained our expectations for China for the year-end and look to 2024 before we expect to see signs of recovery.Our clinical business overall had a mixed quarter. We saw growth in demand in the U.S. and Europe as expected, which was partially offset by the softness in China. In particular, we were pleased with the continued momentum for our immunohematology and diabetes franchises in the quarter.Despite the market challenges of this year, we view our strategy framework as being very solid and our platforms and market opportunities as providing sustainable long-term growth. We continue to focus on driving and improving our execution, and with completion of a single global instance of SAP have now completed a major component of operational improvement.Looking to the end of the year, we continue to expect the biopharma and small biotech company turndown and ongoing constraints in China and Russia to impact the overall growth for our Life Sciences business, although we do expect to see sequentially improved sales in the final quarter of the year. We remain positive on the momentum and continued growth in the Clinical Diagnostics business although somewhat moderated by the greater market constraints in China as well as ongoing trade restrictions in Russia.Thank you. And at this point, I will now pass you to Ilan to review the financial results.Thank you, Andy. Now, I would like to review the results of the third quarter.Net sales for the third quarter of 2023 were  632.1 million, which is a decline of 7.1  on a reported basis versus  680.8 million in Q3 of 2022 and a 7.9  decline on a currency-neutral basis. The third quarter year-over-year revenue decline was primarily the result of ongoing weakness in the biopharma end markets, impacting the sales of our Life Science tools and bioprocessing products. In addition, we experienced weaker demand in China as a result of the macroeconomic environment as well as the local made in China initiatives.COVID-related sales in Q3 were  300,000 versus about  17.2 million in Q3 last year. Core revenue, which excludes COVID-related sales decreased 5.5  on a currency-neutral basis. On a geographic basis, currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue decreased in Asia and Europe, partially offset by increased sales in the Americas.Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2023 were  263.5 million compared to  317.9 million in Q3 of 2022, which is a decline of 17.1  on a reported basis and a 17.8  decline on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding COVID-related sales, the Life Science Group year-over-year currency-neutral core revenue decreased 13.7  and was primarily driven by lower sales of qPCR, process chromatography, western blotting products and about flat year-over-year ddPCR revenue.Excluding process chromatography sales, the underlying Life Science business decreased 16.7  on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2022. The Life Science Group revenue, excluding process chromatography and COVID-related sales decreased 11.6  on a currency-neutral basis. On a geographic basis, Life Science year-over-year core revenue decreased in Asia and Europe, partially offset by modest increased sales in the Americas.Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the third quarter were  368.1 million compared to  361.9 million in Q3 of 2022 or growth of 1.7  on a reported basis and a 1  growth on a currency-neutral basis. Core Clinical Diagnostics year-over-year revenue, which excludes COVID-related sales increased 1.4  on a currency-neutral basis. Growth of the Clinical Diagnostics Group was primarily driven by blood typing and diabetes products as well as growth from our quality controls portfolio.On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by the decline in Asia. The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 53.1  on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.7  in Q3 of 2022. The year-over-year gross margin decline was mainly due to unfavorable product mix, lower manufacturing volumes, higher material costs and inventory reserves and was partially offset by improved logistics costs. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was  4.5 million compared to  4.4 million in Q3 of 2022. Third quarter operating expenses benefited from our cost-cutting initiatives as well as a contingent consideration benefit of  18.9 million from last year s acquisition of Curiosity Diagnostics.SG A expenses for Q3 of 2023 were  201.2 million or 31.8  of sales compared to  211.1 million or 31  in Q3 of 2022. The lower SG A in the quarter included  4.1 million in contingent consideration benefit, as I mentioned earlier, as well as lower employee-related expenses. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG A for the quarter was  1.6 million versus  1.8 million in Q3 of 2022.Research and development expense in the third quarter was  43.5 million or 6.9  of sales compared to  66.8 million or 9.8  of sales in Q3 of 2022. The significantly lower R D expenses recorded in the third quarter included  14.8 million in contingent consideration benefit that I mentioned earlier as well as lower project and employee-related expenses. Q3 operating income was  90.9 million or 14.4  of sales compared to  94.6 million or 13.9  of sales in Q3 of 2022.Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity security holdings which are substantially related to Bio-Rad s ownership of Sartorius AG shares, added  36.4 million of income to the reported results.During the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of  9.7 million compared to net other expense of  13 million last year, primarily driven by increased interest income from investments.The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was 22.5  compared to 21.5  in Q3 of last year. The effective tax rate this quarter was primarily affected by an unrealized gain in equity securities and the tax rate reported in Q3 of 2022 was primarily affected by an unrealized loss in equity securities.Reported net income for the third quarter was  106.3 million or  3.64 diluted earnings per share compared to a loss of  162.8 million or  5.48 diluted loss per share in Q3 of 2022. This change from last year is largely related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius holdings.Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items which impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release.Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded  4.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring expense. These exclusions moved the gross margin from 53.1  for the third quarter of 2023 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.9  versus 55.6  in Q3 of 2022. Non-GAAP SG A in the third quarter of 2023 was 31.7  versus 30  in Q3 of 2022. In SG A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded  4.1 million of an acquisition related to the contingent consideration benefit mentioned earlier and in vitro diagnostic registration fee in Europe for previously approved products of  1.9 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of  1.6 million, and  1.3 million of restructuring-related expenses.Non-GAAP R D in the third quarter of 2023 was 9.2  versus 9.7  in Q3 of 2022. In R D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded  14.8 million of an acquisition related to the contingent consideration benefit mentioned earlier and a small restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 14.4  on a GAAP basis to 12.9  on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of 15.8  in Q3 of 2022.We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity securities and loan receivable holdings of  36.4 million,  2.5 million gain from the release of an escrow for an acquisition and about a  700,000 loss associated with venture investments.The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was 23.9  compared to 21.7  for the same period in 2022. The higher rate in 2023 was driven by geographical mix of earnings and reduced compensation-related deductions. We continue to estimate the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 22  and 23 . And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2023 was  68.1 million or  2.33 diluted earnings per share compared to  79.2 million or diluted earnings per share of  2.64 in Q3 of 2022. Moving on to the balance sheet.During the third quarter, we purchased 58,478 shares of our stock at an average share price of  364.61 for a total cost of  21.3 million. We still have nearly  480 million remaining in our Board authorized share repurchase program and plan to continue with our opportunistic approach to buybacks as part of our capital allocation strategy.Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 was  1,765 million compared to  1,728 million at the end of Q2 of 2023. The increase in cash and short-term investments from the second quarter was primarily due to changes in working capital.Inventory at the end of Q3 was  775.8 million, which is slightly lower than the inventory in the prior quarter.For the third quarter of 2023, net cash generated from operating activities was  97.7 million, which compares to  11 million in Q3 of 2022. This increase mainly reflects changes in working capital and income tax payments.The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 was  112.7 million or 17.8  of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2022 was  135.7 million or 19.9  of sales.Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2023 were  44 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was  37.3 million.Moving on to the non-GAAP guidance. Given the current market environment, we are revising our 2023 financial outlook as follows. We now expect about a 3.5  currency-neutral year-over-year revenue decline in 2023 versus a growth of about 80 basis points previously. For the full year, we estimate currency neutral year-over-year revenue growth, excluding COVID-related sales to be between 0 and 50 basis points versus about 4.5  in our prior guidance. Of the 400 to 450 basis points core revenue guide down, 50 basis points are related to the third quarter revenue shortfall of which approximately 200 basis points is related to weakness in biopharma and remaining 50 basis points related to lower Clinical Diagnostics sales. The remaining 150 to 200 basis points reduction is attributed to reduce process chromatography and other biopharma demand as well as continued softness in China.For the Life Science Group, we expect about a 12  currency-neutral revenue decline for 2023. And when excluding COVID-related sales, the Life Science Group currency-neutral revenue decline is projected to be between 4  and 5 . Excluding COVID and process chromatography related sales, Life Science Group revenue is expected to decline between 2  and 3 . For the Diagnostics group, while we remain encouraged with the overall demand we are now guiding core revenue growth to be about 4.5  versus 5.5  previously.Full year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be about 54  versus about 54.5  previously, reflecting our updated expectation of shift in product mix and volume. We now project full year non-GAAP operating margin to be about 14.5  versus approximately 16  in our prior guidance as we continue to carefully manage discretionary expenses. And full year adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 20  and 20.5 . We versus about 21.5  in our prior guidance.And now I ll turn the call over to Norman for a few remarks. NormanThank you, Ilan. So, I guess, I just wanted to take a minute here to really to recognize Ilan and his contributions over the last several years. As part of our transformation, Ilan has been a very valued member of the team, kind of working to improve financial planning and reporting processes as well as to enhance the Company s external profile with the financial community. I think we all very much appreciate his guidance and contributions which do position us well for our continuing transformation. As you might imagine, we have initiated a search for his successor. And in the meantime, we have a strong, capable team who can manage very well in the interim.So, maybe while I have the floor, maybe a closing comment about this year. Certainly, it s not unfolded the way we or many of our peers first envisioned it. Coming out of the pandemic, I think it has been challenging to predict the pace of recovery or market normalization, really all exacerbated by inflation we ve not seen in 20 years, geopolitical events and, of course, the biopharma disruption. If I think about it a little bit, I think what we can be confident of is that our markets are buoyant and I feel the outlook is positive. There could always be a few more bumps in the road in the near term, but I do feel the Company really is well positioned to navigate what might come our way. And just maybe to reemphasize a point that Andy made, longer term, our strategy and vision for the future really has not changed.With that, operator, I think we ll open the line up to questions.And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.I am sure this is another question for Andy or Ilan, but the magnitude of the guidance reset in Life Sciences, relative to where you started the year, is the most dramatic of any of your peers by far. Why does there seem to be such an inability to accurately forecast the business and demand trends  And how do we assess whether this is, in fact, a market dynamic as opposed to potential share lossesCould you just say the very last piece again, Brandon  I didn t catch your very last few words.How do we assess whether this is, in fact, a market dynamic versus potential share losses in Life ScienceOkay. Look, I think that we came out of 2022 with really good trajectory. And the effects that some companies had seen, particularly in bioprocessing, were not showing up for us. And that -- I think that s something that we communicated at the end of the first quarter that that was a surprise. And it took a while within 2023 for those effects to really roll out into our funnel and start to experience the deferred orders being pushed out. But then the other factor that no one anticipated and which was meaningful for us was the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and the knock-on effects of that, which really impacted the spending profile of the smaller biotech companies, and we had significant trajectory in the smaller biotechs for, in particular, our Droplet Digital PCR platform, which also had some halo effect around it. So I think it took a couple of quarters for those effects to really materialize for us because our profile is a little different to some of the other players. So, that s how I view it.And then, of course, since then, spending has not improved. The order pushouts have continued and it s very difficult to gauge the true inflection point right now. And I think that s probably a message is coming across broadly from other players in the category as well.This is Simon. Maybe I ll just add to that as well because as we look at our funnels and we look at our win-loss ratios across the portfolio, whether you re talking about western blot or gene expression or digital PCR or our bioprocess business, we really don t see any significant shifts there. I mean, obviously, the conditions in China in biopharma have really deteriorated. But the feedback that we consistently get from the field is that there s still a high level of interest in the products, the products that we ve launched to be really well received. And again, the funnel dynamics in terms of win-loss ratios are not seeing any significant shifts. So, we really do believe that this is a bunch of transient effects that are compounding and it s making for a very difficult year but I don t think there are any macro shifts in our competitive positioning in Life Sciences.Okay. Ilan, I think the revised guide implies 4Q revenue steps up to about  700 million, I believe. 4Q is usually seasonally very strong for Bio-Rad, but this isn t a normal environment either. So how derisked is that revenue outlook  What are some of the variables that can swing that target up or down as you re keeping in mindSo it s Andy. The variables that might swing that, I think they re the same that we re -- the variables would really be the same that we re experiencing, just a little bit more acute, if China gets definitively worse than the trajectory it s on, for example, that that would -- academia really pulled back some spending, that could have an effect. We re not expecting a Q4 budget flush this year. That s not in our thinking. If that materializes, that s good news, but we re not planning on that. Other than that, I don t think we see anything that may be meaningful that we could predict.And Brandon, I will add to the inputs that Andy just mentioned. Generally speaking, we have not deviated from our approach of kind of coming up with the realistic what we see in front of us in terms of the forecast and the guidance. So I don t know that we are underestimating or overestimating our projections. And definitely, the fourth quarter this time around is an unusual circumstance in addition to the macroeconomic kind of environment to end this kind of inputs maybe the China environment today. I mean, I think it s going to continue well into the end of the year. So, the smaller biotechnology companies environment in terms of the funding environment are not expected to improve in our mind through the end of this year. So, I agree with you, historically, traditionally, the fourth quarter used to be a stronger seasonality kind of quarter for us. That is not the case this time around.Okay. Last one, and then I ll jump back in the queue. Andy, given you and Ilan started at Bio-Rad around the same time, you ve worked very closely together. You ve both been instrumental to Bio-Rad s transformation last four years or so. In light of his departure, I think investors would like to know, are you happy with the operational direction of the Company  Are you adequately incentivized to stay the course, or do you have an eye to retirement anytime soonYes, Brandon, thanks. First, can I just say I m really sad to see Ilan move on. And you re right, we have worked extremely closely. He and I are in each other s offices virtually every day. So, it s been a really good journey. I want to thank Ilan for that personally on the call. But my point of view right now is we started this transition. It s not finished. And the focus really is on the transformation of the Company and executing against the strategy framework, which I firmly believe has the potential to increase operating performance for the Company moving forward.Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi.Maybe another one on the 4Q ramp, but on the margin side, a pretty meaningful step-up from whether it s sequential or the rest of the -- prior part of the year. Can you just talk about the moving pieces to get to that implied margin  I think it s 16.5 , 17  type margin in 4Q, yes, just a path to get there and get people comfortable that that s a realistic number.Sure. Hey Patrick, this is Ilan. I ll start and Andy can chime in. But obviously, on the top line, we baked in kind of the updated mix with the software Life Science. And overall, I mean, on the operating expenses, we plan to continue some of those initiatives that we have been working on. And already in the third quarter, you can see that the operating expenses came in lower on a dollar basis. So, we continue to work on additional initiatives going into the fourth quarter. And again, overall, for the bottom line, I mean, we feel it is a realistic projection here.I may only add we re still focused on keeping our operating cost structure as tight as possible. So, the volume and mix will have a decent flow-through in the fourth quarter operating margin.Okay. And then maybe on China, if you could just talk about that market, a little bit surprising to see the diagnostics piece softer as well. Can you just talk about what you re seeing  Is it various policies over there that s impacting things  It would be helpful just to get a little more discussion there.Okay. So, the policies, I mean, are clearly impacting both Life Science and the Diagnostics side of the business. And they have -- they re made in China for China. There s the anticorruption, there s volume-based pricing, and then you layer on top of that recession. And the government, I think, that is generally struggling to find the right way to stimulate the market. You can add in an extra effect of capital markets soft for biopharma, which was a focus for us for expansion and growth of our -- those pieces of our portfolio. They all have varying impacts to both sides of the business. And it s just been a really tough ride through China, and there s just no current clear reason to think that it s going to improve in Q4.And on the Clinical side, it just created a softer pull for our products in China in the quarter. And we still have had a little bit of backlog on our Clinical business as we called out, which by the end of this year, we should be roughly where we expect to be, we may finish with a very slightly elevated backlog on clinical products at the end of the year, but we re pretty much on track relatively speaking for that.Okay. On the diagnostics side, is it more the instrumentation  Obviously, the VBP stuff comes up quite often with all diagnostic players. Are you guys seeing anything on that front yetWhat was the questionThe volume-based pricing. Sorry, we were just having difficulty here. Dara, do you want to comment on VBPSure. It s starting to impact how we navigate tender requirements. So I think how that s translating to reality is things are a little bit slower as we re navigating how best to position for new deal considerations. But value-based pricing, it has historically been applied to other sectors, but in a couple of provinces we re starting to see it reach into IBD.  Ph  So I think right now, it s just sort of impacting sort of forward-looking risk. And then as Andy said, we re still working through some supply chain fulfillment challenges in backlog, which we re weighted a bit towards that region as well. And we re working through that and have line of sight for a really solid Q4 landing.Okay. And maybe last one, just on the PCR side. You guys called out, I think, qPCR weakness, it seemed like ddPCR step down as well. Can you just talk about what you re seeing in that market  Is it just a broader slowdown  Is it specific pockets there would be helpful.I think again, it s a compounding issues that we ve already touched on here. So we ve obviously got a fairly significant qPCR, Digital PCR footprint in biopharma. And again, the slowdown in early biotechs. We ve seen a continuation of layoffs and project deferrals. That s impacted the business. We ve got the COVID compare. We ve got all the challenges in China that we ve already talked about. And I think on top of everything else, there s kind of a club of systems out there in the market that were placed in the pandemic, and there s a bit of free capacity out there. So, you roll all of these things together.Again, we refreshed our qPCR platform over the last couple of years. And again, the feedback that we get from out in the field is really positive in terms of how these products are being received in the market, but this compounding of market conditions right now is what s adding up to a tough environment.May I just add one extra comment. You look for the silver lining on occasion. And the customer demand in that -- in small biotech biopharma, the desire to take in Digital PCR, in particular, remain very strong. What we re actually experiencing is just the deferral of when they re going to make the purchase because they re constrained on kind of cash expenditure and some other changes going on structurally on the program focus. So the demand side remains very encouraging.Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron.So just wanted to talk about how the quarter played out here. So revenue was about 8  below the Street. Can you just talk about kind of the pacing of the quarter. Was most of the pressure you saw in September  And is it possible, are there any orders that slipped into 4Q for any reasonI think, Jack -- this is Ilan Daskal. The way to think about it, I think we saw it throughout the quarter, but it accelerated towards the end of the quarter. So, the pace was kind of decline was stronger towards the end of the quarter. But throughout the quarter, it started to get weaker and weaker, but definitely, it accelerated towards the end.Okay. And Norman, I know you mentioned in your comments, there s potential for maybe a couple more bumps in the road along the way. I think there s a debate amongst tools investors around further through the cutting cycle, or could there be kind of new risks ahead because of some of the changes in the funding environment for customers  Just curious like -- maybe like what you re seeing through October  Do you -- I guess, like kind of what was the thinking that went behind the fourth quarter guide that you ve built hereWell, I think certainly, in terms of the fourth quarter guide, we look very carefully at kind of the order book and the funnel, the sales funnel, kind of accumulating as much data as we can to get the best assessment of where we think we ll land for the year. When I think about bumps in the road, I think about the -- I think there were a lot of people that kind of thought the pandemic is over and everything will be back to normal next week. And I think we re seeing a continuation of that with some of this kind of biopharma meltdown and the readjustments that are being made in some of these programs. It just -- I think we just have to be careful about calling the end and saying, it s always possible that there s something else that might bubble up.Understood. Okay. And then on the income statement, you previously talked about kind of OpEx reductions. I was looking at the SG A line kind of on a non-GAAP basis, it actually increased a little bit sequentially, and that was despite kind of revenue declining sequentially. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened in SG A in the quarter. And like is there room to like pull more cost out given the lower top lineSo usually, what you see -- it was a minor kind of step-up, Jack. Usually, on the fourth quarter, we see a much higher kind of step-up in SG A which this time around, actually more of the initiatives that we have been working on will kick in on the -- in the fourth quarter. So, we don t anticipate the traditional step up in the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, it wasn t that material.Your next question comes from the line of Tim Daley from Wells Fargo.So first on the process chromatography business. So I think you were previously expecting down mid single to high single decline. With the update today, I m getting to 13  down or so for the year. But even with that that implies a pretty significant step up in the fourth quarter. I think almost like 80  sequential dollar increase from 3Q to 4Q. So first off, are these numbers that I m kind of getting to in the right ballpark  And then secondly, can you help us understand the visibility, confidence that you have to kind of get that big sequential step-up, especially given the commentary around a slower or lower than typical seasonality for this year-endYes, I think maybe it s kind of some of the math might be a little off there. I think the process chrom overall it s going to end up at a lower number, in kind of the guidance implication there. And it s kind of like mid-teens. And so, I don t think we re seeing a meaningful step-up in process chrom in Q4. But yes, I think that s really probably just a bit of math there, it s slightly higher.All right. Got it. That s helpful. And then, Andy, can you -- the supply chain impacts weighing on the third quarter Diagnostics revenues. Can you just provide some details on like what is that, how big the impact was in the quarter  And if you expect those delayed revenues to be fully recuperated in fourth quarterYes. So essentially, we -- obviously, we ve been communicating our supply chain challenge on the clinical side because various impacts of COVID plus we moved our plants from France to Singapore. We re catching up quickly, but it s sometimes difficult to get the pacing of that right. So, if you get a bit of delay, you also get a bit of pull-through, consumable pull-through delay as well. And so that factored a bit into our Q3. But we are looking at a pretty strong Q4, and we have good line of sight now. Our plant in Singapore is really cranking. We ve done a lot of work leading out the workflows there. And so, we re going to get the benefit of that in Q4 and also get some pull-through effect. So Q3 just ended up being softer as a result overall.And then final one here for Norman. With the  23 guidance now 400 basis points lower, that midterm CAGR for 2025, the guidance updated in May now has an incremental 100 basis points or so steeper, I guess, headwinds in front of it. So, given the current environment, how are you evaluating the 2025 target  Or is this something that maybe will wait until a new CFO is in the seat to put their own fingerprints on, if you willSo Tim, this is Ilan, I will chime in and then Norman probably will have some additional color. But already in the prior quarter, we communicated that the 2025 targets from our perspective is kind of in a holding pattern. We would like to get more insight and visibility going into 2024 in order to shape our thinking about the 2025 targets. So probably in the next kind of earnings call, early next year, when we have the 2024 kind of guidance in front of us, the 2025 numbers, we ll know how to think about it and to see what is the reason impact and what magnitude, et cetera.I think that covers it pretty well.Your next question comes from the line of Conor McNamara from RBC Capital.Just without getting into 2024 guidance, just how should we think about 2024 in general  And just which headwinds that you called out in this quarter likely to persist in 2024 and which are likely to end by the end of this yearHey Conor, this is Ilan. So I can start with obviously various aspects that are associated with the macroeconomic, I m not sure personally that China will recover like in a few weeks. So that may take a little bit longer. The funding environment, which is obviously indirectly linked to the treasury yield is here to stay. The inflationary environment is here to stay for a while. So, there does and probably will continue for a while to have some impact on the smaller biotechnology companies funding, and the way they think about the pace of their spend. So these are definitely areas that we want to kind of think about it -- to think about and then not to mention the geopolitical everywhere now that is getting kind of -- to probably a new level that we have not experienced before. So, there are multiple fronts there that -- and when you think about Europe, I mean, overall, for us, Europe, generally speaking, is doing okay for us. But when you think about the macroeconomic, Germany is probably already in a recession. So, it s going to be interesting. I mean specifically that domestically, we re going into an election year domestically. So, we ll have to wait and see how everything will shape up. But it doesn t have to do anything with our own kind of organic initiatives, products, new products, the end markets that are not disappearing, they re not going anywhere. So it s only -- from my perspective, only a timing issue.Okay. Great. And just following up to Patrick s question about PCR. Can you just talk about ddPCR, specifically because that slowdown was worse than any of your other business units. So how do we -- can you give investors some framework to think about how that -- how we can get comfort that that s definitely a market environment and not competitive pressure because there have been some competitors out there making some noise. So we just want to make sure that you still feel good about your market position there in ddPCRI still think we feel good about the position. I mean, we ve made no secret of the fact that the competitive landscape is intensified. And as we reflect on Q3, I think as we called out in the scripts, we had a couple of really notable wins there that we think are going to help continue to position us well for the future. I think what we really saw in Q3, again, is an exacerbation of these biopharma impacts. We have put secular strength in the early biotech sector. And I think what we saw in Q3 was a cumulative impact of these deferred projects and layoffs in the continuing extremely tight budget environment.Once again, we re seeing a lot of interest in the products, but the money is just not flowing. We continue to see healthy adoption and really strong acceptance of our QX600 platform. So, as we look to the future, if we all believe that these impacts in biopharma transient and when we emerge from it, we think we re going to be in a really strong position. And then, of course, we ve got competitors who are playing more in the lower end segments, and we plan to enter there with the QX Continuum platform in 2024. So for sure, the competitive pressure is intensifying, but I think we ve got compelling responses and where we ve got leading positions in these segments will continue to do well as and when these markets recover.And just a quick follow-up on pricing. And I guess this is across everything in Life Sciences. What s the pricing environment like  And how should we think about that going forwardYes. I think that the environment is still inflationary. As you probably appreciate, on the clinical side, tender-driven business, you can only take very modest and periodic price increases. And we do that when we get that opportunity. On Life Science, there is still inflationary effect and we will still look to try and take modest price increases as we move forward to help offset our inflationary pressures that we re receiving. And we expect to do -- we ve done that this year. We expect to do that next year. And I think in the quarter, we probably got just over 1 point of price, 1.5 points of price on a net basis and think that that should at least be a floor.We ve seen a mix impact there with process chrom as well.Yes.Okay. And just a final question. This for Norm. Just given the recent selloff in the space and specifically in your stock, how does that change your acquisition strategy, if at all  And would you still consider issuing equity to pursue an acquisition target in this environmentSo I think that kind of in light of the recent stock dislocation, I think we will very much consider continuing our share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy and obviously, at this point, not such a good currency for M A. I think, in fact, while we do continue to kind of look at opportunities, I think it s probably fair to say that more of our focus over the next several quarters will be centered around kind of navigating our markets and our continued operational transformation.There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Edward Chung for further remarks.Thank you for joining today s call. As always, we appreciate your interest, and we look forward to connecting soon. Thanks, operator.Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",0,2023-10-26T20:04:05.000-04:00

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Operator Instructions  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Davidson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Oshkosh Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Earlier today, we published our third quarter results. A copy of that release is available on our website at oshkoshcorp.com. Today s call is being webcast and is accompanied by a slide presentation, which includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will use during this call and is also available on our website. In connection with the AeroTech acquisition, we are now excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and calculating adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for all periods presented, which is highlighted in the appendix. The audio replay and slide presentation will be available on our website for approximately 12 months. Please refer now to Slide 2 of that presentation.Our remarks that follow, including answers to your questions, contain statements that we believe to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities LitigationOur presenters today include John Pfeifer, President and Chief Executive Officer  and Mike Pack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please turn to Slide 3, and I ll turn it over to you, John.Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I m pleased to report another quarter of strong results for Oshkosh Corporation with significant year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings. For the third quarter, we grew revenue by 21  and more than doubled adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to  276 million and  3.04, respectively. We are continuing to gain momentum as supply chains improve, and we are benefiting from the many actions we ve taken over the past several quarters to drive revenue and earnings growth. In particular, both the Access and Vocational segments posted double-digit adjusted operating margins in the quarter, leading to a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 11 . Importantly, we expect further opportunities to grow revenue and earnings as supply chains continue to improve, as we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions, and as we benefit from higher pricing in the vocational backlog over the next year and return to pre-inflationary price cost dynamics.Demand for Oshkosh products continues to be healthy, and we re pleased with the pace of orders, as infrastructure spending, mega projects, and solid municipal budgets continue to bolster demand. We expect that 2024 will be largely booked as we exit 2023, including expected strong orders in the fourth quarter for our Access segment. This is our first quarter with AeroTech as part of the Oshkosh family, and we are pleased with our integration progress to date. We will share some highlights in a few moments when we discuss the Vocational segment in greater detail.During the quarter, we were named to Newsweek s 2023 list of the World s Most Trustworthy Companies, ranking number 19 globally and number one in the U.S. in the vehicle and components services category. This award reflects our exceptional track record over the last century of doing business the right way and supports our purpose of making a difference in people s lives. It is a testament to how Oshkosh team members embrace and live our core values. As a result of continued strength in our end markets, strong third quarter performance, and our positive outlook, I m pleased to announce that we are raising our full year adjusted EPS expectations to be in the range of  9.50, up from our most recent estimate of approximately  8, or  8.35 when you adjust our most recent estimate for the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles.Please turn to Slide 4 and we ll get started on our segment updates. Our Access team delivered another quarter of strong performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 27  and an adjusted operating margin of 17.6 . Notably, we grew revenue in all major global regions. Our positive results stem from excellent operational execution as well as continued investments in products and technologies. As we have discussed over the past several quarters, demand for Access equipment has remained healthy. The strong demand environment is driven by the large number of mega projects, infrastructure investments and industrial construction projects across the U.S. and the globe. Demand is also benefiting from expanded use cases and aged fleets that need to be refreshed. Again, we expect these drivers to continue for the foreseeable future.Orders in the quarter were solid at  932 million, leading to a backlog of nearly  4 billion. Further, we believe our visibility to demand extends well beyond our current backlog as we are actively working with customers to slot the remainder of 2024. As such, we expect that 2024 new equipment sales will be substantially booked as we exit 2023. We hosted an investor field trip to JLG in August and many of you had the opportunity to see firsthand JLG s leading innovations and visit our factory of the future in Shippensburg where we have invested in technology and automation to improve our manufacturing processes, support our customers and position the business for success well into the future.We are also investing in our Jefferson City, Tennessee facility to accelerate production of JLG telehandlers. We are already shipping telehandlers from the facility this year and expect to continue to ramp production throughout 2024. With strong market dynamics and ongoing investments in innovation, we expect to better support our customers as well as drive further growth and strong financial performance. I will close Access with a thank you to Frank Nerenhausen for his many years of dedicated service and outstanding leadership to our company and particularly his last 11 years leading JLG in the Access segment.We wish Frank all the best in his well-deserved retirement. We have a world-class leadership team at Access and we are pleased to welcome Mahesh Narang, who is a perfect complement to our strong team in leading the segment forward. Mahesh is an accomplished executive with extensive global and industrial experience. He and Frank will be working closely over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. I am confident that Mahesh will build upon the exceptional work and strong momentum underway at Access and we look forward to benefiting from his deep knowledge and experience.Please turn to Slide 5 and I will review our Defense segment. Defense revenue in the quarter was down compared to the prior year as expected. Nevertheless, we delivered stronger operating income in line with expectations. We expect the fourth quarter will be strongest of the year as a result of anticipated contract awards and a richer aftermarket parts mix. We received good news from the U.S. Army during the quarter as we were selected to compete in Phase I of the robotic combat vehicle program. Our approach leverages our Pratt Miller team as well as our partner KINETIC to offer a mature and proven solution with demonstrated durability and flexibility, while incorporating new technologies to meet the demands of an evolving battlefield. We expect to deliver two tracked autonomous prototypes for testing in August of 2024. The Army has announced its intent to select one vendor for Phase II full system prototype design and build in late 2024.In late September, we were pleased to receive a  40 million contract award for ROGUE Fires, our unmanned ground vehicle that leverages the JLTV s extreme off-road mobility, payload capacity, and advanced autonomous vehicle technologies to support ground-based anti-ship missile operations. The unmanned technology associated with ROGUE Fires allows the vehicle to operate in teleoperator or leader-follower mode and allows for integration of scalable weapons system payloads to meet mission requirements. We continue to move toward the production phase of the USPS  next generation delivery program and are currently building and testing design certification vehicles. We will deliver vehicles beginning in mid-2024 with production ramping to full rate in 2026. And lastly, as part of our focus on profitable growth and disciplined portfolio management, we sold our snow removal equipment business in July. This action allows us to better focus on growing our core business.Let s turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of the Vocational segment. We ve been building strong momentum in our Vocational segment over the past two quarters. For the third quarter, we delivered 35  revenue growth, including  116 million benefit from AeroTech for two months of Oshkosh ownership. Vocational also delivered an adjusted double-digit operating margin for the second straight quarter with margin of 11 , including a solid contribution from AeroTech. Improved supply chain and operational execution enabled our strong results. We expect further improvement as we return to our planned production levels and benefit from stronger pricing in our backlog in 2024 and beyond.Turning to AeroTech, we are pleased with our integration progress since the close of the transaction on August 1st and expect it to be a meaningful contributor going forward. Our outlook for AeroTech is strong as global passenger traffic is expected to grow in the high single digits over the next several years, and airport spending is expected to accelerate with legislation and aging infrastructure. In late September, AeroTech participated in the International GSE Expo, which is the airport ground support equipment industry s premier event. This show was a great opportunity for us to display our industry-leading technologies, such as the AmpCart towable charging platform, a mobile charging solution that supports current and future airport infrastructure.Also in the airport space, we announced two significant Striker Volterra electric ARFF orders during the quarter as interest in EVs continues to grow around the globe. The new airport under construction in Sydney, Australia, placed an order for four Striker Volterra ARFFs to service the airport and support its carbon neutral sustainability initiatives. And in September, long-time customer Dallas Fort Worth International Airport issued a purchase order to add six Striker Volterra ARFFs as well as two traditional Striker ARFFs to its fleet. We are confident that there will be many more airports ordering our industry-leading Striker Volterra electric ARFFs in the future. Finally, we received an order from Republic Services for 50 McNeilus Volterra ZSL units, North America s first fully integrated zero emission electric refuse collection vehicle. We are confident in the long-term attractiveness of fully integrated EVs for the refuse collection industry.With that, I m going to turn it over to Mike to discuss our results in more detail and our updated expectations for 2023.Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 7. Consolidated sales for the third quarter were  2.5 billion, an increase of  443 million, or 21 , over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a  280 million, or 27 , increase in sales at Access as a result of higher volume, improved pricing, and the benefit of Hinowa sales, and a  181 million sales increase at Vocational driven by a combination of the benefit of two months of AeroTech sales totaling  116 million as well as the benefit of higher volume and improved pricing. Adjusted operating income increased  149 million over the prior year quarter to  276 million, or 11  of sales, a 490 basis point improvement versus the prior year. The improvement in adjusted operating income was largely driven by favorable price cost dynamics, higher sales volume at Access and Vocational, and improved mix, offset in part by higher incentive compensation costs.As previously noted, current and prior year adjusted operating income excludes amortization of purchased intangibles, which has been highlighted in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in the appendix. Adjusted operating income exceeded our most recent expectations as a result of favorable mix, lower spending at Access and Vocational, and favorable price cost. Also excluding amortization of purchased intangibles had the effect of increasing adjusted operating income by  10 million during the quarter versus our most recent expectations, which equates to  0.11 of adjusted EPS net of tax. Adjusted earnings per share were  3.04 in the quarter versus  1.15 in the prior year.Now let s turn to our outlook for 2023. Please turn to Slide 8. We expect the strong performance we delivered through the first three quarters of 2023 to continue. Additionally, demand for our products remains strong and supply chain conditions are improving. Based on these factors, we are increasing our expectations for 2023. On a consolidated basis, we are estimating 2023 sales and adjusted operating income to be in the range of  9.65 billion and  875 million, respectively, up from our most recent sales and adjusted operating income expectations of approximately  9.5 billion and  750 million, respectively.We are estimating adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of  9.50 up from our most recent estimate of adjusted EPS in the range of  8 per share. The exclusion of non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles increases adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS expectations for 2023 by approximately  30 million and  0.35 net of tax, respectively, compared to our most recent expectations. At a segment level, we are estimating Access sales and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of  5 billion and 15  respectively, up from our most recent estimate of sales and operating margin of  4.9 billion and 14  respectively.Turning to Defense, we continue to expect sales and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of  2.1 billion and 3  respectively for the year. We expect 2023 Vocational sales and adjusted operating margin will be in the range of  2.5 billion and 9.5  respectively versus our most recent expectations of sales and adjusted operating margin of approximately  2.5 billion and 7.25 . The exclusion of amortization of purchased intangibles increases adjusted operating margin expectations by approximately 75 basis points versus our most recent expectations. Our estimates for corporate expenses, tax rate, and average share count remain generally in line with our most recent expectations. Our estimates for CapEx has decreased by approximately  50 million to  300 million, while our expectations for free cash flow increased by approximately  50 million to  250 million.Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated sales will be down versus the third quarter by approximately  50 million due to fewer production days in the quarter as a result of several holidays. We also expect a few notable mix shifts. Access revenue is expected to be down by approximately  150 million due to fewer production days, while Defense is expected to be up as a result of the timing of aftermarket parts deliveries. Vocational is expected to be roughly flat as an additional month of AeroTech sales largely offsets the impact of fewer production days. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of  2.10, which is lower than the third quarter as a result of the lower sales, unfavorable manufacturing absorption due to fewer production days, higher investments in NPD and facility ramp-up costs and Access related to the Jefferson City telehandler facility, and in Vocational related to the Murphysboro eRCV facility.I ll turn it back over to John now for some closing comments.We delivered strong results in the third quarter and continue to make progress with supply chain and production throughput. Demand is robust, and we are investing in capacity and new products that we expect will drive profitable growth. We are in the process of integrating our accretive AeroTech acquisition, and we are already seeing the considerable value it brings to our company. Once again, we are meaningfully raising our expectations for 2023 as our investments in operations and product technologies are paying off with our transition to a more resilient business. This is an exciting time for Oshkosh, and we are confident we are taking the right steps to drive growth and deliver enhanced shareholder value as we move forward with positive momentum.Okay, Pat, let s get started with the Q A.Thanks, John. I d like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up, and please stay disciplined on the follow-up question. After that follow-up, we ask that you get back in queue if you d like to ask additional questions. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period of this call.Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask that all callers limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you may requeue, and those questions will be addressed, time permitting.  Operator Instructions  One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. Good morning and nice quarter. You mentioned being sold out for Access in 2024 by year-end. Can you maybe just clarify what the implied volumes are at that sold-out levels  Is that higher volumes in the plan next year  Any comment on sort of the price versus cost that you have embedded in thatYes. I guess the bottom line is we re not providing guidance yet for next year, but obviously based on all of our commentary, our view and outlook is strong. So I would take that into consideration. So you would expect that the book-to-bill ratio to achieve that s going to be strong in the quarter well above one-to-one. So I think that s bottom line. From a price-cost perspective, you know, we re delivering very strong margins across our business. And I think the bottom line is we would expect that we continue to deliver strong margins in our business. We re going to continue to monitor inflation. Ultimately, we re continuing to get more volume through our facilities. That s certainly helping from an absorption standpoint and just a manufacturing efficiency standpoint. So as we look forward to next year, we see continued strength in our margins.Yes. Steve, it s John. We ll give you guidance next quarter on what we are going to   what we expect for Access in 2024. But suffice it to say, the market is strong, and our customers are doing well. Our customers have equipment needs and that   and long-term equipment needs I m talking about. So stay tuned, and we ll give you an update, but we ve got a healthy outlook for sure.Okay. And then maybe just on the Vocational side, really strong orders in the quarter. I m curious what the visibility you have on the orders is from here and where you see perhaps more momentum in the next few quarters  Is it on the fire apparatus side or on the refuse collection sideYes. We have really strong orders in the fire and emergency segment primarily and   but strong orders across the entire Vocational business. I mean if you look at the AeroTech business, which is a new business for us, we ve only had it for a couple of months, that s a market that we re seeing long-term growth as well. But you ll see a lot of improvement continue in that segment in 2024. You ll see nice margin improvement in 2024, a lot of it driven by the fire and emergency side.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.Hi. Good morning. Great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is similar to what Steve asked. Since you have some visibility into next year, given orders are going to be pretty much booked by the end of this year for 2024, what kind of pricing do you expect to get on 2024 orders for Access equipmentYes, Tami, I think if you look at   so our pricing very much correlates with what we re seeing for inflation. So we had very significant price increases really over leading up to the beginning of this year over that 18-month period prior. With certainly, inflation continues, but it s at a more moderate case so I would expect that our pricing will follow suit with that. So, again aligned with inflation and again we don t view price cost as a headwind going into the future. Okay, great. Perfect. And then my second question is on Defense. What is the outlook, how should we model Defense margins going forward, especially since you expect a ramp in NGDV production in the back half of next year, how would margins look like when that volume hitsSure. Just in general, this is consistent with what we ve said that last several quarters that not going to be a lot of change in the core underlying business. We ll start ramping up at the back half of the year, next year, but you can imagine that s going to be   there will be lower quantities. We ll continue to ramp up through 2025.So I would say   I would think about Defense next year not necessarily notable incremental volume, it s really when we get to 2025 and beyond that we re going to see more meaningful benefits of that ramp. There is some gives and takes supports with JLTV but we do expect some good, solid profitable growth as we get into 2025.Yes. And Tami, it s John. I just want to point out that the Defense business, the headline as Mike just talked about is we ramp JLTV down in 2024, we ramp up the postal vehicle starting next year into 2025 and get the full production by 2026. But within the Defense business there is a lot of really good programs in our Defense business. And we talked about new programs that we re bidding for that are advanced technology programs like the robotic combat vehicle.So we re going to go through a period of a couple of years to get the Defense business margins on a trajectory that we all expect. But there is some really good business on the base business, about a  1 billion of really healthy base business in there that sometimes gets overlooked.Our next question comes from line of Mircea Dobre with Baird. Please proceed with your question.Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning.I am curious if we can talk a little bit more about AeroTech, just looking at the backlog that you disclosed there, and it s frankly, quite a bit higher than what the former owner JBT reported last. So maybe you can give us some context in terms of where you are seeing demand there, is it on fixed equipment, is it mobile equipment  And I am also kind of curious from an integration standpoint, what have you learned in the first few months of ownershipSure. I ll start with that and then we can   and certainly John can add in. Just from a comparability standpoint, we re reporting backlog essentially in the same manner. So it s based on firm orders, so that s not a   that s not a difference of view of what represents backlog. So we are seeing strong orders and it s really across the board and it s tied to a lot of the tailwinds that we ve talked about and why the business has excited us regarding just airport growth in general.Yes. And Mircea talking about the integration of it, first of all, go back to why we acquired Aerotech. We acquired Aerotech because it s a business that we ve already been in the airport markets, JLG is in the airport markets, our vehicles are in the airport markets. So we ve always looked at this as a near adjacency almost, right   almost even not even adjacency, like right in the middle of our sweet spot. It s all purpose-built equipment where you have the opportunity to continuously apply technology in the form of autonomous technology, intelligence products technology, electrification to continue to drive productivity improvement for customers. So it s kind of right in the middle of our sweet spot.That is   so the biggest thing that we have learned, which is very positive, is culture and people can make or break any acquisition. If you get the culture right and the fit and the people, right, then things go really, really well. And this is a fantastic cultural fit for us. In terms of the values of the company, how the people on both sides have embraced the acquisition the AeroTech people, the Oshkosh people, that s a really important part of a successful acquisition, and that is going extremely well. And we re really pleased and look to a very, very strong long-term future for this business.Understood. My follow-up is on the refuse business. I appreciate the announcement that you had on Volterra orders. I am curious, as you re looking at that particular customer, how you expect that EV demand to ramp up for them  And are there any other ones that are that are considering similar types of vehicles  Maybe you can comment a little bit how that impacts margin as well from a mix standpoint. Thanks.Yes, we re really excited about this Volterra electric refuse and recycling collection vehicle. We will start producing and selling production units by the end of this year, like imminently, like right now. And we ll do a prudent ramp up of production in our plant in Murphysboro, Tennessee and we ll be doing, of course, dozens and dozens of units next year, and we ll continue to ramp it from there. But this product is not just an electric vehicle, it s a fully integrated vehicle that drives an enormous amount of productivity benefits for our customer, benefits for the driver, making it easier, safer more productive for them at every single stop.So, there is a huge amount of interest in this vehicle. It s almost a new category for the industry because it s not a body on chassis, again, it s a fully integrated, purpose-built vehicle, like we know how to do. And we think this is a really strong driver of growth in margins consistently year-over-year, probably for the next ten years. It s hard for me to say exactly what s the adoption rate going to be, but we expect it s going to be very good over a long period of time.Our next question comes through line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Hi good morning guys. Maybe backing up a little bit big picture, I think, one of you sort of mentioned that supply chain has improved. Can you just characterize sort of where we are now  Are you able to get sort of full production through your plants now, or is there still some upside as supply chain normalizesWell, a great question, Steve, because we have definitely benefited through this year by improved supply chain conditions. But I will also say that supply chain is not back to normal. If you look at our on-time delivery, supplier on-time delivery rates right now, that s one kind of high level metric. It s kind of around 80 , typically we would expect it to be at least in the low 90s. So it s improved a lot over the past year, but it s not back to normal.So, I think one of the important things is we ve done an enormous amount of work in re-engineering, in resourcing, dual sourcing, using analytics and digitizing the supply chain inputs so we know where problems are going to be before they disrupt our plants. I think all of that is also paying a lot of dividends to us. It has been most evident in our Access business to date. Our Vocational business has more complexity and longer bills of material. They have made improvements because of supply chain, no question about that. But we have a little bit more runway with, I think, the Vocational business on operating efficiency as supply chain continues to improve, but we expect it to continue to gradually improve going forward as it has over the past few quarters.Great. And that was kind of my follow-up. Maybe you answered it. But I was trying to figure out if there s additional productivity upside as we get to whatever normal looks like at some point in the future. It sounds like you re saying maybe more in Vocational than in AccessThat s correct, yes. Yes, we ve   we ve seen a nice productivity benefit over the last few quarters at Access.Okay. Thank you guys.Thanks Steve.Our next question comes from line of David Raso with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.Hi, thank you. I was impressed the Access book-to-bill for the third quarter was able to achieve, you know, sort of historical norms. I am just given a supply chain normalization tough comps, would have thought maybe that would be a little lower than the average we ve seen historically. You made a comment about the fourth quarter book-to-bill back above one. Can you put a little finer comb on that  And usually it s almost 1.7, 1.6 just to get a perspective on the new order flow versus what you re shipping. And given, I assume you re decently into those conversations already for next year. Do we think the book-to-build in fourth quarter could be back to the more seasonal, traditional above 1.5 timesYes, I think the, the bottom line, David, is I think, if you implied we ve said that we expect the back half of the year to be at one-to-one. So if you sort of do the math around that, you can start getting to some higher book-to-bill ratios.Okay. So just sort ofWe clearly expect it to be above one David. I don t know that we ve calculated it to 1.5, but we definitely expect it to be fourth quarter above one for sure. Yes, that s the whole thing, yes. I m just trying to understand. It looks like the backlog at end of the year, definitely north of  4.5 billion, I mean  4.5 billion,  4.6 billion, you can t name the exact number. And I m just curious at that size of backlog, how much of that is expected to ship in 2024  Obviously the large majority, but are we already having conversations about 2025  And to the extent you would actually start to put it in the backlog, I m just trying to understand how far this stretch is out and how comfortable your customers are even willing to put something on the dotted line for 2025. Not saying they can t cancel, but I m just curious how to interpret that backlog we ll see in three months.I would say, David that generally the focus right now is on 2024. And you re right, we re way into those conversations. And really it comes down to just the PO timing as we work through it. But we have good visibility to the year. So I think that 2025 conversations, of course, we see strong demand well out into the future, but the bottom line is right now the focus is on 2024, but I would expect, again, back to our prepared remarks, we re going to be largely booked as we expect for new equipment as we exit the year. So, that implies that really that that s the year is essentially booked.Yes, just to make sure it s clear, the orders we re booking now are essentially for the end of 2024 delivery. So as Mike just said, and as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to be fully booked for 2024 in the fourth quarter. So it won t be long before we re booking orders for 2025. I guess maybe that s a simple answer to your question.Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Good morning everyone. This is actually Christian Zyla on for Steve Barger. Thank you for taking my questions. My first questionSure. Good morning. Good morning. My first question is on your capacity across all segments. I know you aren t guiding to 2024, but what is the average capacity utilization of your factories  And what do you think the upper limit on revenue for all the segments combined is  And then where are you tightest on capacity and is there currently a capacity expansion planWell, I mean, I will kind of give you some general ideas. We re essentially at full capacity in a lot of our facilities, and so that s why you see us announcing manufacturing capacity expansion, and we ve got a few of them going on. We ve done a lot of work in existing factories. We had JLG event with many of our   of you in August where we showcased Shippensburg  Factory of the Future . You saw a lot of investments we re doing to improve our throughput. But in addition to that, we ve got a new facility or a repurposed facility in Tennessee to increase output for JLG. We ve got a new facility in Murphysboro, Tennessee to do fire truck cabs and our new ERCV refuse collection vehicle product. And of course, we ve got the big Spartanburg plant, And of course, we ve got the big Spartanburg plant, which is getting ready   is producing postal vehicles today and getting ready to go into production vehicles over the next several months. So, we are adding capacity because we see long-term growth trends in these markets. When we look at JLG we look at a lot of events that are coming together. It s a very unique thing that s happening where you have huge infrastructure bills that have been passed by the government.You have technology transformation happening with regard to EVs and battery plants, chip plants because of the digital revolution that we continue to be in. Energy transformation, we have geopolitical concerns causing onshoring to continue. We ve got also an aged fleet. So all of these things come together, and it s a very unique thing for all of these big macro things to be coming together. And what it tells us is that there is a lot of long-term demand that is underway. And that s why we re putting more manufacturing capacity in because we know we have to meet that demand long term.Great. And then as a quick follow-up, your backlog coverage has held up really well. With all that said, do you think this level of backlog relative to your revenues is sustainable  Or do you think you ll be able to monetize some of that backlog at a quicker pace next year and in given those capacity expansions and everything you just said. Thank you so much.Yes. I think ultimately, what we d expect is, is that over time, as productions normalize, that you will have backlog trends and order trends normalize a bit more. I think where you ll see a decrease over time is in vocational because that s where we see pent-up demand. And as John said earlier, we see some more   they re a little bit later working through the supply chain challenges given the complexity of the product. So I would expect to see some normalization over time as we go through next year there.Yes, I mean a little bit more color on that. So you see the big backlog that we have today, it s  16 billion. As I talked about earlier, as we continue to increase capacity, we re increasing capacity not because we have a big backlog, we re increasing capacity because we see strong order rates continuing into the long-term future. Now that will also help us to bring those backlogs into a more realistic level from a lead time perspective. So we want to provide lead times that are a little lower than we have right now with our JLG business. We want to bring our fire and emergency lead times to under a year, they are well over a year today. So that will happen as we go. But we re putting that capacity in place because we see the demand continuing long term, not just because we have a big backlog.Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.Good morning, Jerry.John I am wondering if you could just share what you re seeing in the telematics data that you track aerials versus telehandlers, we re hearing about a different range pleaseYes. So you are basically talking about product utilization. We see utilization of product at a very healthy level today. It ebbs and flows, right  And certainly, as you put   as we ve made progress, putting a little bit more equipment into the marketplace is certainly been needed. You might see ebbs and flows to that utilization rate. But the utilization rate is still at a very healthy level. And our customers still need a lot of equipment. And I think that some of the customers that we have that are publicly traded, you can see that there s still a need for more equipment. There is a healthy dynamic in the market right now.Right. And maybe just to put a finer point on it sounds like the telescopic and is still extremely tight, but there is some loosening on scissors and telehandlers. Is that right  And can you comment on what you re seeing in Europe specifically  I think there are some concerns around utilization slowing thereI think when you say loosening, I mean, we don t see loosening as a bad thing. We re able to produce more equipment, we re able to get more equipment into the hands of our customers who are deploying that equipment and in some cases, they re starting to replace older equipment, which is a good thing, and you see that in the used market. So I think you ll continue to see that replacement dynamic happen over a long period of time.So the scissors and the AWPs that are the booms that are continuing to go in the market, it s a healthy thing. Our customers want to see that. They want to see it continue. The telehandler production, we continue to see expanded use cases for the product. And that s why we re continuing to increase our output in that segment.Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to go back to an earlier question about defense margin. I think it looks like you are penciling in something in the 6  range or so for the fourth quarter. I think I heard you say something about mix is going to be more towards parts and stuff like that. So again, I m just trying to understand, is this 6 -ish number for the fourth quarter a good number to use going forward  Because this has been an area where margins   a lot of us have had a hard time trying to get arms around margins for this business. Thanks.Yes. I would say the fourth quarter margin, it s mixed, but then it had also expanded to typically in quarters that we have larger orders, particularly with JLTVs and we do expect the JLTV order we do benefit from that in the quarter. So I would say the fourth quarter is higher than what our run rate is right now versus like a full year. So I would say that again, we re not providing guidance yet for next year, but we re sort of still operating in the lower to mid-single digits net business. And the turning point is when we start really ramping up NGDV at scale.Okay, that s helpful. And can you just comment, given the geopolitical events, have you seen it pick up in conversations for any international JLTV interestWell, sure, we have   I ll remind everyone while we have the DoD contract ramping down, we ll continue to produce JLTVs for international customers for the foreseeable future. Yes, there is demand there. I mean with regard to the current conflicts that are going on, I can t comment on the specifics. But I will say that we, of course, closely monitor it. And we will always be standing ready to support the Department of Defense and our allies. I can t say more than that, other than to say, yes, of course, there is international demand for these products.Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for fitting me in. The past two years, you guys had kind of been running at an elevated CapEx number. You ve done a lot to expand the footprint. Just curious if we start thinking out over the next several years, do we think the CapEx piece kind of moves back to more of what you ve done historically  Or will we need kind of a continued higher level of spend to support some of the EV sort of facilities that are going to be out thereSure. I can take that, Stanley. I think from a CapEx perspective, certainly, last year was relatively higher with our investments, particularly in NGDV and some of our other facilities   high this year again because of NGDV as well as our Murphysboro and Jefferson City facilities as well as some of the other capacity for fire trucks. I would say next year, we ll be wrapping up many of those projects, so probably still a little bit higher than typical times, but I would expect once we get into 2025 and beyond, a lot of that electrification infrastructure is going to be in place from a facilitization perspective. So I would expect that to start normalizing. Not really different than what we talked about, about a year and a half ago at our Analyst Day that it would be higher in these first few years.And I guess because the next question would end up being kind of talk about maybe some of the longer-term plans for the balance sheet, right  You ll be approaching kind of a net debt neutral in the next 18 months to years. Do you want to carry leverage  Do you want to increase the share repurchase  Just it seems like there s going to be a lot of free cash flow generating in the next several years.Sure. If you go back to really our targets that we ve talked about for capital allocation, we expect over for the foreseeable future to really operate in that 65  to 75  of our cash deployment to be going towards growth initiatives, whether M A or investments internally. So that s going to continue to be a significant piece. I would say this year, it s obviously been a bit heavier than that with the AeroTech acquisition and Hinowa and some of the investing in the NGDV facility. But again, that s how we think about it over time.And so I think to the extent that we see, we re going to continue to look at acquisitions and expect to look for those opportunities. I think from a share buyback perspective, again, going back to our Analyst Day, in periods of higher M A, you would expect less buybacks, but it s still a very important part of our capital allocation strategy. So, in periods when we re less acquisitive, you would expect to see more share buyback activity. But our target leverage is still two times or less. We re under that still. So, we certainly have capacity to continue to deploy our balance sheet.Perfect guys, thanks so much.Thanks, Stanley.Mr. Davidson, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.Great. Thanks, Christine. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We re very pleased to be entering the final quarter of 2023 with momentum and a very strong outlook. Please reach out to us if you have any follow-up questions, and have a great day.",0,2023-10-26T12:48:03.000-04:00
$100 Per Ounce Of Silver Is Well Possible,"Earlier on I wrote  about the future of gold prices. The forecast I wrote was not conservative, indeed. But if it turns out to be true, then silver will be worth  100 per ounce at the very least.I am an absolute fan of physical metals, but I appreciate some investors might not want to pay any storage fees. So, they might want to benefit from a likely price surge by buying ETFs such as  .You might be wondering why I am so bullish on precious metals. But the recent , a likely monetary policy shift, and growing geopolitical uncertainty may make silver prices rise to new highs. I will give you some historical examples and also explain my bullish forecast in some more detail.As I have mentioned many times before, silver is a small brother of gold. In other words, it goes in the same direction as gold and reacts to the same news as the yellow metal. However, silver is much more volatile due to the fact its market is much smaller than the gold one.Recently, it was announced Fitch, the credit rating agency, decided to . U.S. Treasuries are now rated AA  and not AAA like they used to. The agency explained the decision reflects both the political standoffs in Congress over the debt ceiling as well as the federal government's  debt load.But in my view, the political standoffs are not as important as the mounting debt and rising interest rates. It is well possible the downgrade by Fitch is just the first one. In other words, many more credit rating agencies may follow Fitch's course. But given the fact it is in nobody's interest to allow the U.S. to go bankrupt, the Fed is highly likely to start easing its monetary policies and devaluing the USD in the near future. After all, the macroeconomic indicators would start deteriorating sooner rather than later, whilst the Fed cannot keep fighting inflation forever.It was  that the BRICS currency would be backed by gold. It might sound speculative, but many central banks are seeking alternatives to the U.S. dollar. For sure, the transition, if it  happens, will likely be quite slow. But a number of nations have agreed to use currencies other than U.S. dollars to exchange goods and services.In past centuries gold used to serve as a unit of value. In other words, currencies used to be backed by gold to avoid inflation. The USD used to be backed by gold, the pound sterling used to be backed by gold  It might well happen in the BRICS this time. But in the case of BRICS, the member countries want to move from the USD for political reasons to avoid excessive reliance on the U.S. Here is a list of the member countries.But more countries want to join the BRICS. Discussing the expansion of BRICS to BRICS  is still in progress and could be decided during the . The countries that have shown interest in joining BRICS so far areSo, if the plans regarding the gold standard turn out to be true, this is highly bullish for the gold prices and not so good for the USD because it could gradually start losing its popularity as the world's reserve currency. The gold standard might not be introduced immediately and will most likely not be accepted by all the BRICS countries straight away. But it is a substantial upside risk.I have mentioned many times before that in spite of the Fed's rate hikes, the amounts of liquidity in the U.S. economy, also known as the money mass, have not decreased by much. Neither the gold nor the silver prices have decreased. This normally happens to the precious metals when the monetary policies get tighter. This is not happening right now, however. Imagine what would happen to the gold and silver prices when the Fed eventually starts easing.Also don't forget the geopolitical tensions. The situation around Ukraine and the conflict around Taiwan may escalate further, which will obviously be a bullish factor for the precious metals. You might be wondering why I am talking about gold. But the factors affecting the prices for gold and silver are the same. The two metals normally move in the same direction.Now we have come to my price target for silver. Earlier,  the silver price per ounce could get as high as  30 in 2023. It is well possible in the remaining months of 2023 if the Fed starts easing. No major global events or extraordinary inflation are necessary for this to happen. However, ample amounts of liquidity can affect the silver prices the way they affected them in the 1970s. You might argue the 1970s is a bad example. After all the silver price surge was mostly due to the . But the very same thing happened in the 2000s. As I have mentioned many times before, silver is the small brother of gold. Generally speaking, gold and silver prices move in the same direction, but silver often offers bigger potential gains.In the 2000s, silver was worth around  10 per ounce. In 2011, it traded as high as  50 per ounce, a rise of x5. This was due to a jump in the money supply and a fall in the interest rates. Something similar might actually happen now. So, silver prices can rise from  23 to  115 per ounce.The graphs below illustrate this well.The money supply diagram below shows that the amount of money in the U.S. economy started rising at a faster pace in the beginning of the 2000s. The silver prices also started increasing quite fast as well. But the situation got even more radical after 2008 when the U.S. government declared unprecedented monetary stimuli, namely the QE  quantitative easing .Also, lower interest rates set after the Great Recession prompted silver prices to rise further.The point I am making is that something similar might actually happen now.Moreover, silver is quite undervalued compared to the Dow Jones index. Right now the Dow-to-silver ratio is near its all-time highs.Traditionally, when the Dow-to-silver ratio is high, it means rising silver prices in the future. This might happen this time.The question is how investors might benefit from increasing silver prices. I have always advocated physical metals. However, not everyone might be willing and able to pay the high storage fees. Such investors might prefer to invest in ETFs. I have prepared a table with the largest ETFs. The largest one is   SLV . Due to its size, it seems to be more reliable than the others, whilst it is more liquid thanks to its popularity.You might wish to choose any ETF you like. But keep in mind that you do not own any physical silver even if you invest in a physically backed ETF. That means you cannot redeem or sell shares in exchange for actual silver.The risks to the price of silver are quite general. The first one is that of prolonged monetary tightening. The second one is that of market speculations aimed at holding the prices down. Some JPMorgan Chase's  employees .Another risk is that of a prolonged depression that could hold the commodity prices down. We all know that silver is both a hedge against inflation and also an industrial metal. So, if there is a prolonged economic depression and central banks do not take any measures to support the economy, silver prices would tend to stay depressed.However, this scenario does not seem likely to me. The Fed, just like other central banks, would not let the global economy stay depressed for too long. So, they would start printing money. Given the  green  economy trend and the fact silver is a highly useful energy transition metal, the demand for it should stay high. But the most important arguments for silver price growth are the likely monetary easing ahead and also the shiny metal's undervaluation.Silver is trading really low now, given the amounts of liquidity in the U.S. economy. Geopolitical tensions and the likely easing of the Fed can really make silver prices rise as happened after 2008.I am in favor of buying physical metals, but some investors might wish to buy silver ETFs. In that case it would probably make sense to choose the largest one, iShares Silver Trust ETF.One of the largest downside risks for silver is that of a prolonged economic depression and hawkish central banks. But this is not my base case scenario, and even if it occurs, restrictive monetary policies and economic downturns do not last forever.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Cultivating Growth: Investment Outlook For CF Industries,"CF Industries Holdings  is involved in the production and dispersal of nitrogen-based fertilizers. The company possesses nitrogen facilities that cater to both agricultural and industrial clients through its distribution network. High shipping and storage expenses for nitrogen fertilizer importsThe criticalThis connection between nitrogen demand and corn acreage becomes even more significant when considering the latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates  report from the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA . The report predicts an impressive surge in corn production for the forthcoming 2023 24 season of up to 55 million bushels, marking an a 58  uptick from the previous year. Whether you believe in global warming or not, the best temperature  available indicates that the weather is becoming more volatile and less predictable. Naturally, this may lead you to question if the WASDE or other figures from USDA can be trusted. Without digressing too far, a 2020  by the University of Cambridge found that the data presented by USDA contained significantly smaller errors when compared to the data collected by those in the private sector. Another  conducted by the National Corn Growers Association  NCGA  noted that, historically, WASDE reports have reduced market uncertainty  as measured by option implied volatility .credit  Based on this information, I believe that investors are in position to see a robust demand for nitrogen fertilizers, driven by expanding corn acreage, and that we can expect to see a substantial  positive  influence over investor sentiment.Lower gas prices in North America relative to other parts of the world help to secure CF s global competitive edge. As Russia substantially reduced its pipeline gas exports to the European Union, causing an  over the year and sparking a global energy crisis in 2022, it created a profound supply disruption that had a far-reaching impact on both European and global . This abrupt shift in Russia's gas production prompted extensive reconfiguration of worldwide liquefied natural gas  LNG  flows, leading to record-high natural gas prices in  and necessitating revisions in gas demand forecasts.In contrast,  has managed to sustain relatively elevated levels throughout the year 2023, notwithstanding a decrease in U.S. natural gas prices. During the first half of 2023, the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub spot price averaged  2.41 per million British thermal units  MMBtu , marking a contrast to the annual average of  6.42 MMBtu observed in 2022.Natural gas serves as the  feedstock in nitrogen fertilizer production, constituting nearly half of production expenses. CF benefits from the cost advantage of lower natural gas prices relative to their overseas , who are currently relying on higher-cost natural gas or coal-based feedstocks. While I do not believe that cheap natural gas alone can insulate CF from other unfavorable conditions that may arise, this certainly tips the scale in favor of a growing share price over the next 52 weeks.While CF's  enjoy affordable North American natural gas due to their proximity to their primary customer base in the , there is another interesting angle to this location. Sure, CF sells fertilizer, and since corn requires a lot of fertilizer, it is good to be located near your customers  but, I think there is more to this location than just being near customers. I suspect that the U.S. Corn Belt is potentially the best place in the world for any company with infrastructure needs. I believe that the corn belt contains a unique convergence of electrical lines, railways, pipelines, and barge access. Although some of the information I need to support this claim is not publicly available, for security , we can still think this through. For one, the corn belt is a huge expanse of land, located in an  climate, and is predominantly flat. Can you think of another benefit to having flat land  Flat land means lowers construction costs to get pipelines installed, electric lines ran, and railway systems laid, since less dirt work and demolition are needed. In addition, the Ohio River and Mississippi River are well-known for their  access and utilization. I just had to include this aside because I have always considered this possibility to be intriguing and deserving of further research.No analysis of this nature would be complete without also taking into consideration the fundamental aspects of the company. A few things stand out from a basic review of the financial statements. While operating income stagnated from 2018 to 2020, these figures increased by roughly 50  in 2021 and again in 2022. At the same time, SG A costs have remained fairly consistent. Stable SG A coupled with a growth in operating income demonstrates that the company can scale up to match the demands of the economy without losing administrative efficiency.A review of CF s comparative financial statements reinforces my bullish position and supports my belief that the stock price will continue trending upward. As you will see, the financial statements unveil a pattern of asset growth, augmented retained earnings, and enhanced shareholder equity during the period in question. However, diligent monitoring of current liabilities and a deeper exploration of the motives behind the shift in treasury stock are imperative. Looking at this data, I think this is the best time to buy the stock in 5 years, so let s dive inLooking at cash equivalents and short-term investments, we see that CF s cash holdings cash have demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory, culminating in  1,902 million by the close of 2022. CF is also seeing significant growth in short-term investments. Compared to 2018, when these investments were valued at  682 million, CF s positions grew by 70  over this 5-year period, arriving at a valuation of  2.3 billion by the end 2022. In my opinion, this underscores the potential for yield optimization on idle cash reserves, strong liquidity, as well as CF s ability to meet short-term financial obligations.CF s receivables have also grown over this 5-year period, both gross and net, from  235 million in 2018 to  582 million in 2022. I believe that this signifies an expanding sales portfolio, but moving forward, investors should also watch for any significant changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.It is likely that CF is preparing for growth in production and sales, as inventory holdings have moderately increased from  309 million in 2018 to  474 million in 2022. On the other hand, the net value of property, plant, and equipment has declined from  8,623 million in 2018 to  6,691 million in 2022. This suggests depreciation or potential curtailment of investments in those specific assets, but I do not believe that this will have any long-term implications for the company. No substantial changes are noted in goodwill, intangibles, long-term investments, or other investments.Short-term liabilities have increased by approximately  200 million from 2018 to 2022, while long-term liabilities have moderately decreased.Both common stock and additional paid-in capital have exhibited a state of relative constancy throughout this same period. Retained earnings has seen a substantial upswing, progressing from  2.4 billion in 2018 to  3.8 billion in 2022. This underscores the company's profitability and its retention of earnings for future growth. Overall, total equity has grown from  2.9 billion in 2018 to  5 billion in 2022, signifying an improved state of shareholder value.Perhaps the most interesting change the company has gone through is that the treasury stock balance has transitioned from a negative balance of  504 million in 2018 to  0 in 2022. To me, this indicates that CF is serious about following through with its aggressive share repurchasing programs. The  for CF Industries indicates that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of  1.5 billion from November 3rd, 2021 to December 31st, 2024. Then again on November 2nd, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  3 billion in shares, upon the completion of the 2021 repurchase program, through December 31st, 2025. Could be Board of Directors consider another repurchase program in November, 2023  Only time will tell.It is also important to compare how CF is performing relative to its main competitors. CF has a much higher current ratio and operating margin than ICL Group , Mosaic Company , and Nutrien Limited . This suggests that not only is CF in a much better position to pay its debts, but that CF also has better control over its variable costs. Examining the gross margin, ICL Group is a close rival to CF Industries, but Mosaic Company and Nutrien Limited are still far behind. The difference in operating margin is much more concerning for ICL, MOS, and NTR, as this will make it more difficult for them to remain viable when economic conditions become more challenging. As the old saying goes, when the tide rolls out, you can see who is skinny dippingWhen considering that CF maintains a superior operating margin, gross margin, and current ratio to its competitors, I feel that CF's P E ratio is only marginally higher. In my opinion, CF is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. Before addressing the operations of the company itself, which will help to inform this opinion, I want to briefly comment on MACD and RSI, just to rule out any interference from trading conditions.A 52-week chart of the MACD and RSI indicators are presented below, along with the stock price. The RSI indicator shows that the stock is not currently overbought or oversold. Over the past 52 weeks, RSI has seldom entered overbought or oversold territory. At the time of this writing, the MACD indicator shows that the stock is slightly oversold. Over the past 52 weeks, MACD has frequently changed between overbought and oversold. A review of these charts would lead one to conclude that the pricing action of CF stock has not been significantly influenced by any large amounts of buying or selling. No significant fluctuations in positions stemming from insider trading have been noted.CF Industries operates as a prominent ammonia producer, employing the  process to manufacture ammonia-based products vital for food production. Haber-Bosch is currently the most  process in the industry for producing ammonia, but it comes at the cost of greater carbon-emissions. The company plans to continue using this process while making changes to completely eliminate its carbon footprint by 2050. Meeting this goal would be significant step toward de-carbonizing the agricultural industry, as  of the carbon footprint associated with corn originates from the necessary production of ammonia as a fertilizer.CF has identified a growing interest in the use of  as a source of hydrogen, which is an excellent renewable energy source. I feel that this is a likely area for CF to expand into and could one day serve as an additional revenue source for the company. In contrast, wind and solar energy have fallen out of  because they are cost prohibitive.The company notes in its 2022 Annual Report that it maintains a robust distribution network for nitrogen products, utilizing a setup that is unique to each of its plants. For example, the report notes the facilities in Donaldsonville, Verdigris, and Yazoo city rely extensively on barges to transport product. At other facilities they will opt to use a fleet of leased railcars instead. I believe this commentary supports my earlier position about the strategic location of the U.S. Corn Belt.In describing the main characteristics of their product line, the report discusses the seasonality of their sales. Demand for CF's products are strongest during the spring planting season and the fall harvest. While it would be preferable to have sales that are consistent throughout the year, one advantage to the routine downtime is something known as plant . Every plant in the manufacturing industry has to go through at some point. Simply put, it is a period of time where the plant shuts down its operations to perform maintenance and inspections that would not otherwise be possible during operations. For CF, this time is often needed to upgrade its equipment to keep up with everchanging environmental regulations, as well as their goal of producing green ammonia by 2050.CF Industries  strong operational performance and solid financial results for the first half of 2023. They reported adjusted EBITDA of  1.72 billion for the first half of 2023, compared to  3.60 billion for the same period in 2022. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders were  1.09 billion for the first half of 2023, with a net earnings per diluted share of  5.55. The company also returned approximately  1.3 billion to shareholders over the last twelve months through June 30, 2023.The company reports that the results were driven by robust nitrogen demand, favorable gas costs, and strong operational performance. CF Industries also reportedly made significant progress in its clean energy initiatives, including signing agreements for long-term clean ammonia offtake and supply, as well as advancing blue and green ammonia projects.In my opinion, the company appears to be focused on increasing free cash flow generation capacity and growing shareholder participation in their free cash flow. The company's strong free cash flow metrics indicate an undervalued equity, and they continue to emphasize opportunistic share repurchases and investments in high-quality clean energy projects. CF anticipates that the global nitrogen market will remain strong for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024, with favorable energy differentials supporting significant margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers.Despite all of this, there were some aspects to the report that lead to a mixed reaction from investors. Earnings per share  from  5.58 per share to  2.70 per share from the corresponding period of the previous year, though it exceeded the  of  2.15. The company's net sales experienced a decline of approximately 47.6  year-over-year, reaching  1,775 million for the quarter. Within its segments, net sales decreased in the Ammonia, Granular Urea, Urea Ammonium Nitrate, and Ammonium Nitrate segments compared to the prior year. Overall, the 2Q 2023 report for CF did little to move the stock price in either direction.The report was released on August 3rd, 2023. Presented below is a chart showing the stock price for CF from August 1st, 2023, to September 8th, 2023. The volume of shares is also presented.My valuation of CF Industries is based on an analysis of discounted cash flows and leads me to value the stock at  97.90 per share. First, we examine the free cash flow from 2018 to 2022 as of December 31 of each year. The net changes in cash are presented in a chart below and a linear regression line. We see that from 2018 to 2022, the net change in cash flow increased by an average of  303.6 million.While looking at the net changes in cash at year end holds predictive value, we can gain more insight by examining the quarterly reports from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023. During this period, we see a significant decrease in the growth rate of net cash flows. The chart above has an average growth rate of  303 million per year while the chart below has an average growth rate of  0.26 million per year.What could be the explanation for this stagnation in the growth rate of net cash flows  Looking at the table below, we see a steady increase in cash from operations. Cash from investments has remained consistent. Cash from investments experienced moderate downward momentum. Foreign exchange events have stayed relatively low compared to the other categories, with moderate downward momentum in 2022. It seems that the two biggest influences were increases in cash from operations and decreases in cash from financing.Changing our focus to the quarterly reports, total cash from operations remained consistent from 06 30 2022 to 12 31 2022. Q1 and Q2 of 2023 saw some decreases in cash flow from operations. From 06 30 2022 to 06 30 2023, cash from investments remained consistent. Cash from financing saw an increase in the first half of 2023. Cash from foreign exchange increases saw a moderate increase from 06 30 2022 to 12 31 2022. Moving into 2023, cash from foreign exchanges returned to typical levels over the past five years. In my opinion, it appears that the primary reason for stagnation of the moving average for net changes in cash flow decreased compared to the last three quarters of 2022.Additionally, the projection assumes that the number of outstanding shares will remain constant at 192.9 million, although there is reason to believe that this figure is likely to decrease. To summarize the table below, first we look back at the end of 2022, when net changes in cash was  695 million and there were 195.6 million shares outstanding. The figure for 2023 is the most recent data that is available, on 06 30 2023, when net changes in cash were  896 million and there are 192.6 million shares outstanding. Then, 2024 and 2025 each see an increase to net changes in cash of  300 million. From 2026 to 2033, the net change in cash is left constant at  4 billion and the outstanding shares are left constant at 192.9 million for the same reasons that are stated above. Next, the net change in cash is divided by the number of outstanding shares, resulting in the figures for net changes in cash per share. Lastly, the discount rate assumes that investors can go elsewhere  such as CD s or sweep accounts  to receive a 3  interest rate. The average net changes in cash per share from the end of 2023 to the end of 2023 come out to an average of  15.90. Net changes in cash is from Q2 2023The current stock price is approximately  82. Adding  15.90 to  82 is  97.90, which is where I see the stock price going to over the next 2 years. Further growth beyond this amount would lead me to re-evaluate market conditions to determine if there is a favorable outlook for continued growth.My opinion that CF is poised for growth is heavily predicated upon the belief that corn acreage will increase while natural gas prices will remain competitive in  relative to other parts of the world. While a decrease in corn acreage and an increase in natural gas prices are the most obvious risks to this thesis, there are other factors that should also be taken into consideration.While the cost of natural gas is the single largest influence on the price of nitrogen fertilizer production, the pricing can also be influenced by other factors such as  conditions,  events, and  imbalances. Any significant fluctuations in these prices could impact CF Industries' profitability and stock price.Macroeconomic factors such as ,  rates, and overall economic health can also influence investor  and stock prices. Changes in these macroeconomic factors can affect CF Industries' cost structure and access to capital. However, such conditions would likely affect CF s competitors as well.Although Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent on natural gas prices in Europe has had favorable results for CF industries, this can act as a double-edged sword. Fluctuations in currency exchange  can impact its competitiveness and profitability in international markets. Currency devaluations or appreciations can affect the company's revenue and earnings. The global economic landscape can change rapidly. Economic downturns or recessions can reduce demand for fertilizers and impact CF Industries' financial performance. Likewise, disruptions in the supply chain, such as transportation or logistics issues as the result of war or other events, can affect the company's ability to distribute its products efficiently. This can lead to delays, increased costs, and potential revenue loss.Lastly, the fertilizer industry is highly , and CF Industries faces competition from both domestic and international producers. Shifts in market share, aggressive pricing strategies, or technological advancements by competitors could affect CF's market position and profitability. For now, this concern is mostly kept at bay by CF s superior operating margin and current ratio.Investors should conduct thorough research, consider these risks, and diversify their portfolios to manage potential volatility and uncertainties associated with investing in CF Industries or any other stock. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance tailored to individual investment goals and risk tolerance.In conclusion, CF Industries presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the synergy between increased corn acreage, favorable natural gas prices, and  green  ammonia. The company's strategic positioning, efficient distribution network, and sound financial fundamentals make it a strong contender in the market. However, wise investors should always be mindful of potential risks, from unpredictable weather patterns to global economic fluctuations. Diversification and expert guidance are the compasses that will help navigate the ever-changing waters of the financial world. So, as you consider your investment choices, may your decisions be as fruitful as a bountiful harvest, and your portfolio, well-fertilized with nitrogen.

"Above The Noise: So Long, September. Strikes, Shutdowns And Social Security","We made it through August and September  Readers of Above the Noise know that I say that with sarcasm. The media is happy to remind us each year that stock markets have had historicallyNow, stocks were in fact challenged over the past two months, but I d attribute this year s August and September downturn to too-strong US growth and higher rates rather than anything specific about the calendar.Nonetheless, if you care about this sort of thing, we are now entering what has historically been the best two months for stocks. Either way, investors whoPersonally, I ll continue to focus on the big questions rather than the date on the Gregorian calendar. Speaking of whichWe start with three simple questions.Historically, it has taken roughly 12 to 18 months for the impact of interest rate hikes to be felt on the US economy. A year ago, the Fed Funds rate was 2.50 . Eighteen months ago, it was 0.25 . Give it time. The slowdown in the economy is still ahead of us.Financial markets  over the past three months and global central banks have revised their respective assessments of near-term recession probabilities, as reflected in favorable asset returns and recent upgrades to economic outlooks. Our research indicates that the odds of a recession in 2023 are minimal, and that economic resiliency should persist through the end of the year.Is a Federal Reserve rate hike in play for November  Regardless, the Fed Funds futures market suggests that the end of tightening is near.A backdrop of economic resilience and improving risk sentiment  over the past three months  has us favoring risk assets over the remainder of the year, if not into 2024.We favor credit over Treasuries as well as cash-like instruments. Within equities, we overweight cyclical factors with high operating leverage and a higher sensitivity to a rebound in growth expectations, such as value and smaller capitalization stocks.From a regional perspective, we remain overweight emerging markets, supported by improving risk appetite and expectations for US dollar depreciation. today, as in the past, I expect another late cycle rise in oil and gasoline prices to have a deflationary impact on the US economy, rather than result in higher inflation and further policy tightening.Energy prices surged going into the recessions of 1991 and 2008 also. Back then, the increase in gasoline prices lifted headline US Consumer Price Index  as it did again this August , but it cut into real consumer income just as the consumer spending was already slowing.It feels like déjà vu all over again. I d expect the rise in energy prices to again serve as a  tax  on the consumer rather than the impetus for additional policy tightening.When we come back, we're not going to leave. We're going to get this done. Nobody wins in a government shutdown.    Kevin McCarthy, Speaker of the US House of RepresentativesGet out the popcorn  The House speaker appears willing to move ahead with a short-term spending bill, despite threats from members of his party that such a move would result in a floor vote to remove him.Personally, I ll be watching with faint interest as these things rarely matter much to the economy or to the financial markets. Here s some things to know to prepare you for the showdown.The European Central Bank  ECB  continues to raise interest rates even as the economy is slowing. Is this the next  Trichet  moment, when the European Central Bank under President Jean-Claude Trichet raised interest rates on the eve of a financial crisis  I posed the question to Arnab Das, Global Market Strategist-EMEA at Invesco.His responseQ  Doesn t Social Security run out of money by the middle of the next decadeA  No. The Social Security trust fund will have been depleted by the middle of the next decade. From there, the US will pay out what it collects in payroll tax revenue.It is expected that retirees would then receive roughly 80  of benefits, although I would expect politicians to act to ensure Social Security s long-term viability.This would include similar action taken by the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, such as increasing the taxable maximum, altering the cost-of-living adjustments, or raising the retirement age, to name a few. How will the auto strike affect the US economy There are a few potential concernsHowever, strikes have not historically lasted for very long. The United Auto Workers union has a finite strike fund in which to provide strike pay. Additionally, most domestic car manufacturers have ample supply, and the used car companies have rebuilt their fleets. Supply has increased at a time when consumer demand is slowing. As a result, any upside move on inflation would likely be very limited.David Nadel joined the Greater Possibilities Podcast to discuss the misperceptions investors have about small- and mid-cap international  SMID  stocks and where his team sees opportunities in this often-overlooked space.Among his insightsMy travels this month took me to Detroit, a homecoming of sorts for this University of Michigan graduate. Let s just say I m not surprised to hear businessman Dan Gilbert proclaiming  Detroit is back  and rock star Alice Cooper declaring Detroit to be  the coolest place around.A mere 10 years after becoming the largest municipality to declare for bankruptcy, the city has a great combination of new hotels, restaurants, stadiums and arenas, and apartments.Challenges remain but the progress is great. Anytime the company needs me in  the 313  for an investment conference, I ll be happy to get a great meal in Detroit s Corktown Historic District and to take in a Tigers or Red Wings game.See you next month.

"ArcelorMittal: A Solid Steel Play, That Simple","The steel industry may not be the most exciting in the markets right now, it's not nearly as broadly covered as AI, for example. But that isn't to say there aren't some very good deals in this market currently. ArcelorMittal S.A. The last  showcased the company having some trouble getting shipments up as the pricing environment has become less favorable for it. I think however that prices are likely to return higher as interest rates go down, not only in the US but around the world and construction projects become more appealing andMT stands as a global powerhouse in the steel manufacturing industry. As the second-largest steel producer worldwide, the company achieved a remarkable feat in 2022 with an annual production of 88 million tonnes of crude steel and revenues nearing the  79.84 billion mark. This impressive scale and financial prowess position MT at the forefront of the steel industry, ready to tackle new opportunities and challenges on a global scale.MT is a highly vertically integrated company that encompasses the entire spectrum of the steel industry. Its operations span from cutting-edge research and development to mining, manufacturing, and distribution of steel products. The company is well-poised to capitalize on major global trends, such as the substantial increase in construction expenditures, which are driving the demand for steel across the world. With its diverse capabilities and alignment with these megatrends, MT is a compelling player in the steel industry.The  is a key point to watch with MT as it helps gauge the potential they have for growing and expanding. As we can see above, they have done a fantastic job at bringing down the net debts and growing into a more flexible financial position as a result. The interest costs are declining steadily as a result, leaving more earnings available for distribution by the company. MT has been able to deliver a strong shareholder return thanks to the buyback programs they have begun. Since just 2020 the outstanding shares have declined by around 30 . This has ensured strong shareholder value and, in my opinion, is the reason for the continued uptrend the share price has been on recently as well.The steel market has been quite volatile over the last few years, and this has of course affected the earnings of companies like MT. In 2021 the earnings exceeded  14 billion, the highest in the company's history. This enabled them to buy back significant amounts of shares and also pay down debt and end up in a better financial position as well.The company  to note though that the activity in the industry remains quite lackluster and poor. But what is fundamentally going to drive demand in the medium to long term at least I think is the low inventory levels that companies have. The real demand for the first half of 2023 remains stable, and that is really what anyone could have asked for, in my opinion. The war in Ukraine has made commodities markets around the world quite volatile, and rising interest rates have softened demand somewhat as well. If we see a rise in the shipments for MT further, I think that is a good indication of trends reversing, and we are heading for higher earnings.The steel industry is closely tied to key sectors like automotive, engineering, and construction. However, these sectors are currently grappling with significant macroeconomic uncertainties that have the potential to dampen demand. Factors such as ongoing global trade tensions, evolving government policies, and geopolitical events are casting a shadow over these industries. These uncertainties are not only affecting steel manufacturers but also posing challenges for the entire supply chain. The steel industry must navigate this complex landscape and adapt to changing market conditions to ensure its sustainability and growth.MT currently boasts a formidable position, which I believe is quite robust. With a market capitalization exceeding  21 billion, they stand among the industry's giants. Capitalizing on this strength will play a pivotal role in their efforts to expand and enhance both their revenue and profitability. In an ever-evolving market landscape, leveraging their substantial market cap can open up promising avenues for future growth and success. The recent downturn in  seems to have made the shipments for MT slightly lower as well, and they await better prices and a great opportunity to benefit from a more positive pricing environment.In comparison to a peer like Steel Dynamics, Inc. , I think that MT looks like the better option right now. The sheer market position that MT holds is one thing, but valuation looks to offer a better immediate upside potential.The p e for MT is just under 5 on an FWD basis, far under the sector median of 14. Now, steel companies tend to get a lower multiple as a result of the volatile prices that can occur, making resilient earnings very difficult.On the side of STLD, I think the multiple is not that appealing, the p e is at 6.5 on an FWD basis and doesn't offer the same immediate discount that MT has. Now, I think that the reason that the market may be pricing STLD like this comes from higher growth estimates, but I would argue there is more shareholder with MT as they have an extensive history of buying back shares, at least at a rate faster than STLD.The steel industry has been quite tumultuous the last few quarters, but the steel prices seem to finally be finding their footing and heading higher now. I think that MT displays a very good investment opportunity right now as the company is trading at a discount and has a good track record of delivering shareholder value. I like the business, and megatrends like increased industry spending are going to drive demand. Rating MT a buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Geopolitical Developments: A Sustained Market Impact?," Bloomberg, Principal Asset Management. Data as of October 9, 2023.Following the horror of the Hamas-led attacks in Israel, global investors are contemplating the potential impact on broad investment markets.While geopolitics typically has a short-lived direct market impact, the indirect impacts via inflation and economic growth can be more persistent.The critical macro concern lies with the oil market reaction. Brent crude prices have not risen materially, but a significant escalation inGlobal economic growth is by no means immune, but the fall in global energy intensity in recent decades implies a smaller growth impact than in the 1970s. As a net oil exporter, U.S. economic growth is also less vulnerable.The inflation risk from spiking oil prices is more pertinent. While policymakers will likely look through these developments in the near term, higher oil prices can work their way into core inflation and inflation expectations if sustained, demanding central bank action.Safe haven flows have contributed to a sharp fall in bond yields this week. Yet, if oil prices rise further and price pressures do re-emerge, expectations of additional monetary action from policymakers could threaten a renewed bond rout.In light of the situation in Israel, it is prudent for investors to maintain a diversified portfolio across different asset classes, with a particular emphasis on high quality and defensives.

Gold Is Not An Ideal Long-Term Buy Yet,"With all the head-spinning events taking place right now on the geopolitical front, investors are having a hard time understanding why gold a traditional safe-haven in times of turmoil has underperformed. Given the extent of the fear in the news headlines, yellow metalBut what market participants often fail to see is that gold is  overvalued  by a couple of key metrics, which partly explains its failure  by and large  to respond to the growing number of international wars and other political and economic developments  notably the persistence of inflation .Consider the GraniteShares Gold Trust ETF , which closely tracks the gold price. As I noted back in May in a previous Seeking Alpha , since gold is priced in dollars, the relentless strength of the U.S. dollar index was a big reasonFast-forward to October, and gold still faces a major obstacle from the strong dollar due to the yellow metal s currency component. BAR has rallied in recent days, as the above chart shows, but this is likely due more to the impact of war-related short covering and short-term panic than a genuine reversal of gold s big-picture trend.Then there s the competition offered to non-yielding bullion by a runaway rally in U.S. Treasury yields. As investors chase higher bond yields, gold is largely ignored and has suffered the negative effects of the 16-year highs in the 10-year Treasury Yield Index  TNX .Beyond the fact that gold is being challenged by bond market and currency strength is the observation some analysts have made in recent weeks concerning gold s unresponsiveness to lingering inflation in the U.S. This is the case made by many analysts who point out that the precious metal has likely already discounted any additional future increase to the U.S. inflation rate.However, a much more compelling explanation for gold s sluggish performance was offered by economic blogger Scott Grannis, who  that according to inflation-adjusted standards, gold is actually  expensive.Indeed, he goes on to note that over the last century, gold as measured in today s dollars has averaged about  780 an ounce. Today it s worth 150  more than that today, or  1,940  see chart below for an illustration . This suggests that until interest rates come down significantly, investors won t have much of an incentive to load up on non-yielding gold at current prices.Moreover, Grannis goes on to point out that 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, tend to lead gold prices. Specifically, the inverse of the TIPS real yield shows a long-term tendency to precede major long-term moves in the gold price. As the following chart shows, there s a conspicuous spread between gold and TIPS, with the latter suggesting the former asset could come down even further before eventually attracting attention from bargain-hunting investors.In view of the factors mentioned here most notably U.S. currency and Treasury yield strength I m recommending that investors avoid the temptation to start major long-term positions in gold. If the analysis discussed here is correct, a much better opportunity for purchasing gold should occur when inflation begins to significantly diminish, as reflected by falling Treasury yields and a weaker U.S. dollar.

Operator Instructions . Please note today's event is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to William Conroy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining Nabors' third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today, we will follow our customary format with Tony Petrello, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer  and William Restrepo, our Chief Financial Officer, providing their perspectives on the quarter's results, along with insights into our markets and how we expect Nabors to perform in these markets.In support of these remarks, a slide deck is available, both as a download within the webcast and in the Investor Relations section of nabors.com. Instructions for the replay of this call are posted on the website as well. With us today, in addition to Tony, William, and me, are other members of the senior management team.Since much of our commentary today will include our forward expectations, they may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as disclosed by Nabors from time-to-time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, our actual results may vary materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.Also, during the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as net debt, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. All references to EBITDA made by either Tony or William during their presentations, whether qualified by the word adjusted or otherwise, mean adjusted EBITDA as that term is defined on ourLikewise, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, references to cash flow mean adjusted free cash flow as that non-GAAP measure is defined in our earnings release. We have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures.With that, I will turn the call over to Tony to begin.Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us, as we present our results and outlook. Activity in our major global markets was essentially in line with our expectations. Rig count in the lower 48 declined in the third quarter. It appears to have reached the bottom. Leading-edge pricing seems to have stabilized, lower drilling activity in the U.S. impacted results in our Nabors drilling solutions and rig technologies segments. The new bill of rigs in Saudi Arabia were a source of disappointment as reflected in our third quarter results. Specifically, the issues included delivery delays by our local supplier, field performance challenges with certain of the new build rate components, and higher startup costs, as we addressed these challenges. The impact to EBITDA in the third quarter was approximately  5 million. We have now addressed the existing quality issues. We expect our supplier's performance to improve rapidly as their local manufacturing experience increases. On the positive side, our lower 48 margins remain at historically high levels and international rig markets provide us with multiple opportunities at attractive pricing. For the third quarter adjusted EBITDA total  210 million. This result principally reflects the known decline in lower 48 drilling activity as well as the shortfalls in Saudi Arabia. Our global average rig count for the third quarter declined by eight rigs, all of which was attributable to the U.S. Our drilling solutions and Rig technology segments together accounted for 18  of total EBITDA. This contribution is approximately double the proportion immediately pre-COVID. Next, let me make some comments on each of our five priorities. First, performance in the U.S., daily rig margins in our lower 40 operation were in line with our expectation. Pricing in this market reflects the reduction in industry utilization this year. Please note that our margin performance in the third quarter was higher than that of any quarter prior to 2023. Our reported lower 48 daily rig margin reflects the financial results of just our drilling rig. On top of that, Nabors Drilling Solutions portfolio generates significant additional margin. I'll discuss this in more detail in a few moments. Now I'll discuss our international drilling business. In the quarter, we stood up a new bill rig in Saudi Arabia and a rig in UAE. These units are the first two of the 13 pending international startups that I detailed last quarter. Profitability improved substantially in several international markets, primarily in Latin America. Let me add a few more comments concerning the new bill program in Saudi Arabia. The fourth rig deployed in the third quarter. The fifth was also expected to start in the third quarter. Although construction of the rig has been completed, its start date has been pushed to the beginning of next year. The aforementioned supplier issues caused this delay. This timing mismatch between the capital outlays and the commencement of EBITDA had a negative impact on free cash flow in the quarter. The second tranche of five rigs is currently under construction in the kingdom. We currently expect the first of this group to spud in the first quarter of next year. Two of the remaining four rigs should be deployed by the third quarter of 2024. The last two rigs of that tranche are expected to spud in the early 2025. Saudi Arabia recently awarded the third traunch of five new bills. We expect to deploy the first of these rigs around mid-year 2025. In general, the outlook for international business, including Saudi Arabia, remains quite positive. Coming out of the third quarter, we have 11 deployments expected through the end of 2024. Beyond these, we see improving prospects for additional rigs across the number of markets. These include Kuwait, Algeria, and Oma in the Middle East, and Argentina, and Columbia, and Latin America. Next, let me discuss our technology and innovation. Growth in NDS's international business actually accelerated in the third quarter. Managed pressure drilling and casing running drove this growth. NDS s US business was impacted by reductions in overall rig activity. Third party revenue offset some of these reductions. Next, I will detail the value that NDS generates in the lower 48 market. The average daily margin in the lower 48 from our drilling and drilling solutions businesses combined was over  19,000 in the third quarter. Of that, NDS contributed approximately  3,400 per day. This significant incremental margin contribution comes with limited capital spending. Thanks to the low capital intensity of the NDS portfolio. The returns on capital are the highest in our company. In the third quarter, penetration of NDS services held steady on Nabors rigs in the lower 48 at nearly seven per rig. Once again, we saw an increase in installations of our Smart Slides directional steering system and our smartNAV directional guidance software. Our volume of casing running jobs also grew sequentially. Our NDS portfolio remains robust. We have seen increasing interest both domestically and internationally in including for our software solutions on third-party rigs. Next, let me offer an update on our capital structure. Our free cash flow generation and debt reduction were challenged in the quarter. Most of the items impacting our liquidity were one-offs or resulted from shifts in expected timing between quarters. We are addressing the impact of the issues in Saudi Arabia that I mentioned in order to recapture our momentum. The entire company remains focused on increasing free cash flow and reducing net debt. I can assure you these goals remain our top priorities. I'll finish this part of the discussion, which remarks on sustainability and the energy transition. Our energy transition initiatives, as you know, focus on making a difference on Nabors own emissions profile and exporting solutions to other verticals. These technology solutions already contribute visible margins. The first of these is our power tap module. This unit connects rigs to the grid. At the end of September, we had 23 modules running more than 20  of those were on third-party rigs. We have commitments in hand to add two units in the fourth quarter. Notably, one of these is our first PowerTap unit incorporating a frequency converter for the international market. This allows our rigs working in certain markets to tap into the local grid. We believe this is an industry first. In addition to the unit now deploying, we expect three more international deployments by early 2024. Second is the nanO2 diesel fuel additive, which improves engine performance and reduces emissions. We have treated more than 22 million gallons of diesel to date on both drilling rigs and pressure pumping units. In the third quarter alone, that increased by 10 . Quarterly revenue and EBITDA from our energy transition portfolio, once again, increased versus the prior quarter. We see a path to further growth across the client base, both on Nabors and third-party rigs, as well as in other verticals. Now, I will spend a few moments on the macro environment, notwithstanding the volatile environment as well as the decline in rig count in the quarter, commodity prices remain constructive for operator economics. Compared to our last earnings conference call, oil prices are up more than  10 a barrel. We believe this oil price environment is very positive for international markets. We are still of the view that several large LNG projects along the Gulf Coast will support drilling activity for gas, especially in the Haynesville. These commodity prices form a favorable backdrop for operator economics. However, the combination of operator capital discipline and consolidation could temper the scale up in U.S. activity that we have normally seen at these higher prices. Recently, we have noted two announced mergers involving U.S. majors. These transactions indicate their confidence in the future of the U.S. hydrocarbon business. As I mentioned, given this backdrop, international prospects, particularly those driven by national oil companies, remain favorable. Our balanced geographical portfolio positions us well to capture U.S. growth in 2024, and to capitalize on these international opportunities. Some overhanging risks nevertheless remain. These include sustained higher interest rates, if not additional increases by the Fed and looming geopolitical concerns across several geographies. Next, I'll spend a few moments on the rig pricing environment. Our third quarter results for the lower 48 reflect stabilization of leading-edge market prices. As I have emphasized in the past, these current rates for our highest spec rigs exceed all of the pre  23 market highs. Our focus in the lower 48 market remains profitability while continuing to serve our valued customers. As such, we continue to demonstrate the worth of our technology portfolio with NDS. As I mentioned, in the international market, we still have visibility to 11 additional rigs through 2024. This growth should provide substantial uplift potential. Given the commodity price backdrop, we believe there is room for additional unit additions in the Middle East and Latin America. As rig utilization across these markets improves, we expect rig pricing will increase further as well. Once again, we surveyed the largest lower 48 clients at the end of the third quarter. Our survey covers 17 operators, which will account for approximately 45  of the working rigs at the end of the quarter. The survey indicates this group will add about 6  to its rate count through early 2024. This increase is spread across nearly 50  of the surveyed operators. We are encouraged by the distribution of this planned increase. With the expected international additions, we would increase our international rig count by 15  by the end of next year. Let me wrap up my remarks with the following. We expect our financial performance to improve materially in the fourth quarter as we remain committed to increasing cash flow, reducing that debt, and greater returns to our investors. Now let me turn the call over to William, who will discuss our financial results and guidance.Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter financial results reflected primarily the expected reduction in lower 48 activity with an associated leading-edge pricing decrease. As anticipated, our US offshore results fell as we completed planned annual maintenance and critical components for our largest rig. I will also point out that results in Saudi Arabia, despite their quarter and quarter activity increase, fell materially short from expectation. Results were mainly affected by the disappointing performance and quality assurance by the supplier of our new builds. Standard experienced delays in delivery and commissioning of their new build rigs, which cost them significant revenue and which we only partially anticipated. These delays were compounded by unexpected downtime and newly delivered rig components by the same manufacturer. We are now forecasting additional loss margins in the fourth quarter from these issues. The drilling activity reduction in the lower 48 also impacted our NDS results more than we expected, driven by higher than anticipated rig count reductions in the general market. These affected our ability to increase penetration on third-party rigs. On the positive side, we continue to experience tailwinds in most international drilling rig markets, particularly in Latin America and throughout the eastern hemisphere. Revenue from operations for the third quarter at  734 million declined by  33 million or 4  as compared to the second quarter. Revenue for our US segment at  276 million fell by  38.4 million or 12 . This decrease reflected an eight-rig sequential reduction in low 48 rig count. Revenue per day of  35,700 fell by  1,054 from the second quarter level. US offshore revenue was  6.5 million lower sequentially as our largest platform rig completed its planned angle maintenance for major components. In addition, a second rig was placed on standby rate by our customer through the end of the year. Our international segment reached  345 million at  7 million or 2  improvement over the prior quarter. This expansion was driven by an additional new build rig deployed in Saudi Arabia, as well as strong increases in Argentina and Mexico. These positive outcomes offset the end of contracts in Kuwait and Columbia. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the increase was disappointing due to the aforementioned delays and quality assurance issues on the new bills. These issues cost China a total of  5 million in foregone revenue during the quarter. Nabors during solutions and Rig technologies were both affected by the reduction in U.S. rig count during the third quarter. The combined revenue impact for the two segments was approximately  6 million sequentially. Revenue in our drilling solutions segment declined by 5  to  72.8 million, reflecting the lower drilling activity in the lower 48 market. There were, however, a couple of bright spots to highlight. Despite the headwinds in the broad U.S. drilling rig market, NDS revenue continued to grow with third parties, compared to the second quarter, NDS increases us third party revenue by 8 . International revenue also continued to expand increasing by 8  sequentially. Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was  210 million,  25 million lower than the second quarter at 10.6  decline. Nearly all of this decline was in the U.S. drilling segment, which reported EBITDA of  117.4 million down by  24.1 million or 17  sequentially. This was driven by the activity reductions in the lower 48 market. Lower 48 drilling rig EBITDA decreased by  18.2 million or 15.3  compared to the prior quarter. Average recount of 74 declined by 10 . Average daily rig margin of almost  15,900 was in line with expectation and represented a reduction of about  1,035 per day or 6 . Operating expenses were in line with the prior quarter. We believe leading edge prices as well as costs has stabilized. For the fourth quarter, we project our average daily rate gross margin between  15,000 and  15,200, driven by the repricing of renewals, as rigs roll to new contracts. We're targeting flat operating costs. During the third quarter, our rig count when it's low as 70 rigs, and exited the quarter at 71. On a net basis, Alaska and the U.S. offshore businesses perform better than we anticipated. In the third quarter, the combined EBITDA of these two operations was  16.5 million, a decrease of  5.9 million. This reduction reflected planned downtime for the top drive upgrade and recertification on our M400 rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Combined EBITDA for Alaska and U.S. offshore should improve by  1.5 million in the fourth quarter with a full quarter of M400 operations, partly offset by planned maintenance on two rigs in Alaska. International EBITDA decreased by  2.2 million or 2.2  to  96.2 million. Average rig count and average daily gross margin were lighter than expected, largely driven by the new gold challenges in Saudi Arabia. In addition to the material foregone revenue, we still had to absorb compensation on other costs on these non-performing rigs. For the quarter, average rig count remains at 77, average daily gross margin came in approximately at  15,800. The summit issues affected our international daily margin by about  700. We project international average rig count in the fourth quarter to increase by one to two rigs driven by redeployments in Latin America, and for average daily gross margins, we are targeting between  16,200 and  16,300. Drilling solutions posted adjusted EBITDA of  30.4 million in the third quarter down  2.3 million. This was primarily driven by the declining that Nabors lower 48 rig count. Although international and third-party revenue did well during the quarter, some of our third-party target clients reduced their activity, which cut our opportunities for additional expansion in this market segment. We expect fourth quarter EBITDA for drilling solutions to increase by approximately 10  over the third quarter level as we continue to grow in international markets and add third party activity in the US. NDS gross margin per day for the lower 48 was  3,388. Our combined drilling rig and solutions daily gross margin close at  19,243. Rig technologies generated EBITDA of  7.2 million, a 12.7  increase versus the second quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by higher margin aftermarket sales and services, as well as higher penetration of our energy transition technologies. We expect rig technology EBITDA in the fourth quarter to expand by approximately 20 , reflecting expected yearend sales of rig components and additional increases in energy transition revenue. Now turning to liquidity and cash generation. Free cash flow for the third quarter at just under breakeven fell below our target, mainly due to higher capital expenditures of  33 million, which reflected the accelerated timing of investments in Saudi Arabia and the US. This should result in lower than previously expected CapEx in the fourth quarter. In addition, our accounts receivable balance and other working capital items were some  40 million higher than we expected. In addition to this working capital impact lower EBITDA than plan negatively impacted free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we expect overall CapEx to decrease significantly and the Q3 working capital impact to reverse itself. We expect free cash flow for the four-year 2023 of between  225 million and  250 million as compared to our previous expectation to generate between  300 million and  350 million. The reduction includes  40 million of incremental CapEx during the second half. Our Algerian deployment has been moved up. We expect to spend approximately  20 million in CapEx before year end. In preparation for the four rig multi-year contract, we also decided to spend  10 million in purchasing a rented base in Argentina's Vaca Muerta Basin. The opportunity to purchase this critical facility presented itself after unsuccessful attempts in previous years to lock in our major operation space for the long term. Finally, also SANAD new build CapEx in the third quarter was essentially an acceleration from the fourth quarter. We now expect about 10 million of 2024 CapEx to move into late 2023. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were  157 million,  4 million higher than per quarter. This amount including investments for the SANAD newbuild program of  52 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect capital expenditures of approximately  95 million, including  35 million for SANAD newbuild. For the full year, we are targeting  520 million of which  190 million are per SANAD newbuild rigs. In conclusion, the third quarter EBITDA and free cash flow were unfavorably affected by one-off events, as well as items that shifted between quarters. Excluding these items, the underlying results for an international segment continue to progress and we expect further acceleration ahead. Just as importantly, the trends in the lower 48 proceeded as we had forecast, and I believe we have seen a bottom in rate count and pricing. We also anticipate that U.S. drilling, NDS, and Rig Tech will benefit from a meaningful uptick in activity in 2024 driven by an expected recovery in gas drilling. Increased EBITDA in 2024 versus the prior year, as well as sustained capital discipline, should result in higher free cash flow next year than what we now forecast for full year 2023. We will continue to allocate this cash generation to debt reduction throughout 2024. With that, I will turn the call back to Tony for his concluding remarks. Thank you, William. I will now conclude my remarks this afternoon. Notwithstanding challenging marketing conditions in the U.S., we expect a material improvement in our consolidate financial results for the fourth quarter. In the lower 48, we expect to grow our rig count this quarter from its current level. As we look to put rigs back to work, we remain committed to our pricing, discipline, and expense control. Our international segment has excellent visibility to significant growth through 2024 and beyond, and additional opportunities are already emerging across our major markets. The international portion of our NDS segment is also growing as those clients realize performance benefits from the NDS solutions portfolio. In the U.S., we continue to focus on increasing penetration on our own rigs as well as on third-party units. We are encouraged by early signs of an acceleration in rig technologies, especially for capital equipment in the international markets. On top of that, we have high expectations for rig tech's energy transition initiatives. We remain committed to our goals of free cash flow generation and net debt reduction. We expect to report improvements in both metrics this quarter. That concludes my remarks today. Thank you for your time and attention. With that, we will take your questions. Operator Instructions . The first question comes from Derek Podhaizer with Barclays.Just wanted to ask you about the 14 warm stack rigs you highlighted in the press release. You mentioned these things are ready to go. Just maybe give us a more color around your expectations on when those should be deployed, the cadence of deployment, maybe the customer type, the basin. Just help us with those 14 rigs as you look at them through 2024. Sure. Well in terms of customer types, obviously we've seen a bit of a shift from the private to the public from where we were a year ago, and I think that shift is going to continue given other developments. In terms of basins right now, I think the most attractive right now is South Texas due to a combination of interest and rig availability. West Texas, there's been some redeployments of existing equipment there and there's no operator churn. But at the same time, we're seeing slight increases. And based on our survey, we see a pickup in early 2024 with budgets reloading. East Texas and Northeast s we alluded to, that those are gas driven. And right now, we see some stability. In fact, we think pricing, which had been disconnected from oil is actually firming up that gap between oil and gas is actually narrowing. So that's another area. And then finally, North Dakota, as you get into winter, that activity's going to be pushed into next year more. But there's some recent stuff now, but then later in the year. So pretty much in each of those markets. Northeast, I'm not so sure where you see much in the northeast for us right now. I guess how many of those 14 do you think you can add back by the end of 2024  It depends on customer demand, Derek. I mean, it's a bit early to be hazarding that, but if the demand is there, we'll be ready. Just follow-up, just wanted to ask about the 2024 CapEx budget. Any help you can give us as far as color, maybe some bookends, how we should think about it between the US international, SANAD, technology, anything just to give us some preliminary guidelines here. I think, SANAD will be similar to this year, maybe slightly higher. Because the suppliers going to get better and probably deliver those rigs, a little bit more reliably than they have in the past. We'll have a significantly higher rig count. And as you know, the maintenance CapEx is directly correlated to the number of rigs. So that will go up. So those are the areas where we see, on the other hand, we won't be buying a base in Argentina. And some of the things we have absorbed in places like the Algeria will not repeat. So, we will see, I would expect to see CapEx higher than this year, but we haven't yet finalized our budget exercise. And as you know, CapEx is a competition between different geographies. So, we are shooting to have a number that's going to be constructive in terms of free cash flow generation next year, but we we're not ready yet to share that with our investors. And the next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Tony, I just wanted to go through some of the call, the challenges you talked about in Saudi Arabia in the quarter. How has this impacted the future timing of the new build schedule  Is this going to be kind of compartmentalized to this year or does it have kind of a knock-on effect  And I know you gave us a bit of color around four startups next year and five beyond that  Correct. Well, yeah. Let me give you some context first. First of all, the new build program vis-a-vis what neighbors normally does in countries, it's kind of sui generous. Because as you know, in this particular operation, it's unique because Aramco has committed over 10 years for us to build these, these 50 rigs. Five a year. But also, this was part of Vision 2030 and they wanted to source the manufacturing in local country and they award that sourcing contract to a joint venture between them and OV. So unlike where Nabors normally does stuff or our sales and controls at all, that's different. And also, the fact was that JV called on had no infrastructure. So, they had to build a new facility, they have to get up to speed, they had no inventory, all that stuff. And all that was occurring at the same time. The new build programs started to get underway. So, the only thing I tell you is, that we're committed to follow Aramco's wishes. I'm trying to make this work. We actually have a 30-year relationship with NLV  ph , so we respect them, but it's hard and it's -- these are -- this is actually a very big project and there's a lot of strain in the system when this stuff happens. Aramco has very deliberate acceptance testing processes and procedures and what's been going on these rigs is given -- it's all a startup operation from a manufacturing point of view, the acceptance for seizures are taken somewhere from two to three months just to go through acceptance testing, nevermind putting things that are coming up. And then there's issues of stock inventories for stuff that's never been there in the country before and all those kinds of challenges. So that's what's stretching everything out and that's what's create great tension. But notwithstanding that, I think we've really had some great success this year in terms of getting these rigs on the payroll. And as we said, we have great visibility here right now, in terms of next year with the four more rigs next year and the beginning of the second crunch. So as William said, the fifth of the first crunch, it's going to be pushed to the first quarter. Obviously, that rig, as we alluded to, is already built. But again, for all these problems, we have to make sure the base rigs are all working in the right way. That's the foundation here. So, it's in everybody's interest to make sure they're all get to up to snuff the exact way and then it should become cookie cutter as you go forward. So that's why the time is being spent here. And obviously that all drives extra costs, because if you have a rig and you've been crew planning for the rig and then the acceptance testing gets strung out, then we have all that crew, extra crew expense as well. So that's what's driving a lot of this extra expense here. So that's a concept. And then the last thing I make is, two other good points here is we've also told you that the third tranche has also been announced, which is going to start in 2025. Again, that just shows Aramco is really getting behind this thing now and the fact that they're announcing it so early when 2024 is not even yet delivered, the second tranche shows that their intent on pushing everybody to actually get the program going. So here, so like I said, everybody's motivated to get this work. I'm sure, our friends across the street feel the same way and we just want to make it work and get this cadence down. In terms of the numbers and impact, I think this is probably the least appreciated thing of what Nabors has today actually. These -- the four rigs that have already been put on the payroll next year, combined with the four that are going to be added are going to be more than  40 million incremental EBITDA  50 million to  60 million roughly actually to be precise. Yes. Well, so anyway, the magnitude as you can see is very large and therefore that gives us great visibility. And when you add that to the 11 rigs that you know about in other markets, I think international is really poised for a really great upturn here. And we can talk a little bit more about that context. But hopefully, that answers your questions about Saudi Arabia. If you have any other ones, I'll be happy to follow up question. Let me say something what Tony said, that I think is very interesting and a lot of people are not seeing is that we still have some 11 rigs that have been awarded that are going to be deployed before the end of the year, 2024. And then we have another seven already awarded that would be deployed in 2025. So that's what are between the beginning and the end of 2025. So, there's 18 more rigs that are coming on the payroll over the next couple of years. And that's huge growth based on our 77 bases. Yes, I would say there's nothing like that in the sector or there's ever been that much planned growth committed to in the land drilling sector ever at the, at this kind of numbers. It really is unparalleled, and then as I said, and then you have away from Saudi Arabia, you have the other things that's going on in the macro environment. And the next question comes from John Daniel with Daniel Energy Partners. Tony, just sort of a big picture question for you, but let's assume Middle East tensions, the situation escalates, and energy security, fears, ramp even higher. How quickly can you just ramp your international business, not country-specific, but just broadly speaking, how quickly could you ramp it further  I would say very, very quickly actually that that's the benefit of having the integrated infrastructure that we have. And so, we actually have a bunch of assets around the world in various places that form the outlines of something and adding them and refurbishing them and bringing them out. The stuff is what we do every day. And that is just a question of the opportunity. So, if that comes up, whether it's enhanced energy security here in the US or there's other markets that need it, I think that that is really the power of the company that we have today. And that's actually what makes us different than everybody else, John, as. And so, that is really the strength of the company and I think, we're all positioned to meet that. And I guess sticking with the energy security theme, are you seeing any change in behavior with people looking for longer-term contracts on equipment just to know you they've got it  Or is it too early  Too early. Although, we have gotten inquiries from the Middle East. We've had a number of on the can rig side actually, we've gotten a number of inquiries from what you might call our local, what our local competitor companies. These are companies that really, we don't really compete with because they typically drill in the shallower part of the market or they're captive companies for certain markets where the national oil company controls it more. And those companies, we've had a lot of inquiries recently reaching out, asking about equipment and sizing things up. I mean, this goes consistent with the theme that William alluded to, which is the overall international arena here. I mean, just to give you an idea, there is a away from Saudi Arabia, I may have a list here just to give you an idea of the breadth of what's going on internationally. I mean, you've heard the big, all the big boys oil service companies, they've all talked about super cycles and things like that. But let me -- I can illustrate the following way. Let me give you a list of company s countries, Kuwait, Algeria, Oman, India, Abu Dhabi, PNG, I mean, Papua New Guinea, Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, Venezuela. Those companies today have tenders out what we have in hand for more than 50 rigs. -- I've never seen, this is really something that we've never seen before. This kind of scale, it's kind of stunning. And what the reason for that, I think the reason alluding to what you're talking about, which is the security thing, I think, the AMCs appear driven to increase their production capacity. That's clearly a big driver of it. Second, obviously, the geopolitical events obviously are also reordering the flows of oil and gas, including into areas like North Africa where you're going to see people there that up to now are put a higher priority on increasing their production. And then finally, I think we're all underestimating the fact that all these major oil and gas countries, their internal energy consumption is increasing themselves. And so that also is a driver. So, you put all this together and the fact of lack of investment, what's gone on in the past five years, that's what all this -- that's what's generating all this activity. Now will this all result in that number of rigs being awarded that I'm not going to -- I don't want to -- I'm not overselling that, but I'm just trying to give you an idea to respond to your question of inquiries. When you have that many tenders out, you can see why can Rig is getting in inquiries from everybody in the world because they want top drives. They want things to be upgraded. They want all kinds of things. And so that's what's driving the activity. Operator Instructions . And the next question comes from Dan Kutz with Morgan Stanley. So, I wanted to ask on the lower 48 activity, it looks like you guys have kind of stated in a pretty consistent market share range recently, which is a little bit lower than maybe we saw in some past years, but that seems consistent with your strategy and what you're saying about defending, being disciplined in your bidding, managing costs and kind of trying to defend margins as much as possible. But I wanted to ask, is there a scenario where you could gain some market share and still achieve all the other stated goals  Or do you think that we're kind of at a fairly steady state from that perspective  And it's just going to be more the macro backdrop that will be the biggest driver of your lower 48 rig count. Thank you. Well, obviously, we do like to grow, and but we like to go profitably. And so, there's always that balance. And what we've tried to prioritize in our thinking is focusing on customers that also have a similar view us as the adoption of technology, because as the rig count or our rig margins one thing, but that the added benefit of NDS margins on these rigs also it's material enhancer, not just of absolute margin, but also of return on capital. Because the NDS quality of that EBITDA is much higher than also the base drilling business where the cash conversion rate is almost 80  of the EBITDA, the cash conversion. So that's where the priority is. And we think that as customers begin to get the story of NDS more and more and learn about the product line, that offers great expansion opportunities to help drive the rig sales and it also helps to drive the use of NDS on third party rigs. And you saw in this quarter something quite interesting, which was even though our rig count dropped, NDS actually grew in third party business, which is interesting in and of itself, which proves the concept that what we're trying to unlock with this stuff is something that actually has a broader applicability away from just Nabors rigs. So, the answer is yes, I do believe as the market matures, as the big players take a bigger position in the U.S. market and they are more technology focused, that there isn't an opportunity to gain market share. So, one example of that is the focus on with the consolidation has occurred. I think one of the things people will be focused on is improving EOR, not just drilling wealth faster. As the industry's done a great job drilling wells very, very quickly. And at a certain point there's going to be a lot of diminishing returns. So, I think some of the metrics are, may go to looking at EOR per lateral foot drilled, and you've actually seen some of the big guys talk about that increasing lateral length as much as five miles and that kind of stuff benefits Nabors, because we've pre-invested in that move. We built the M 1000 rig, which was the successors to the X-ray a couple years ago, has a million-pound hook load that's perfectly designed for these longer lateral lengths. We also introduced to the market a new top drive that has the pious torque available that can actually handle a five-mile lateral. So, the company's positioned itself to capture that moment. And I think when as the market moves in that direction that all these were betts, we made the past couple years as the market moves in that direction, I think it help would help us also with share. So, that's a pretty long-winded answer, but I hope -- it's response is to what you wanted. No, that's great. It was a long-winded question, so, thank you. And then, I guess just another one on the international space. So, if I back out the SANAD rates that are working today, you guys are somewhere in the low, mid-seventies. And if I look back to kind of the pre-pandemic period, when the SANAD program hadn't kicked off, you guys, international activity was another dozen, two dozen above where your ex nod activity is now. Well, what I'm basically trying to frame or understand is like, what do you think the potential is in the international space just to kind of get back to the level of investment and activity that's required to kind of get back to a normal production level  And then on top of that you have all of these capacity growth targets that a lot of the Middle East players are have put out there. But I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there's a historical period that you would point to that you think could be the opportunity for international activity upside outside of SANAD. And again, I appreciate you guys have given us a ton of color on your visibility over the next two years, but I'm just trying to understand what like the ultimate opportunity could be for international rig redeployments if, aside from the substantial SANAD opportunity. Well, I gave you a pretty big list of those opportunities and it is really going to be a question of our prioritizing where we want to allocate the capa, what's best served is, what a way I would put it. And as we think about that, some of the other logic I've talked about, which is technology and NDS also applies to international in terms of which opportunities we choose to pursue. So, it's going to be a balance in terms of allocation of capital and what we want to pursue in terms of how fast we want to grow. But I think right now you're seeing an environment where there's not going to be a dear of opportunities. The question is what are the returns on capital are good enough to meet what our hurdle rates and what are they such that it makes 101 equal three when we pursue that opportunity. And I'll let William add anything to that. I think, Latin America, which is under -- I would say, estimated piece of the pie, I think, we have real opportunities to grow in places like Argentina and Columbia where we already are the strongest player and in Mexico on the platform rig market, we're getting a lot of pressure from Pix to add rigs in that market as well. So, I don't even want to mention Venezuela because it's still a little bit up in the air and whether, how much the sanctions are going to be removed and how much some of our clients are going to go back to that. But we do have real opportunity. We have four rigs in prime condition in Venezuela waiting for a resumption and activity by some of the foreign players. And then we have seen places like, Kazakhstan that have gone down, but we don't know when that will come back. But I think, if it does, we're ready for that as well. And then Kuwait, we have some very important tenders coming and we are very well positioned in that market as well. Now we mentioned that we got an award in an Algeria for 4 rigs, which is a very impactful win for us. And we are looking at other places in North Africa as well to expand. So those are the areas where you would, where you would expect to see most of the uptick in Nabors. Now we do have to be conscious that we cannot address all the opportunities that are out there. So, we have to be selective. We have to focus, as Tony said, on places where you can get technology on top of the rigs. And we have to make sure we have a CapEx program for next year. That makes sense in terms of our free cash flow objectives. And the next question is a follow up from Derek Podhaizer with Barclays. I just wanted to follow up on the 11 rig highlighted international to be deployed by the end of next year. Is that a net number or, I'm just wondering how we should think about that. Will we see some offsets, maybe some rig releases in other regions  I know you highlighted Kuwait and Columbia as areas of softness currently. Just thinking about if that 11 is completely incremental or we should think the 11 minus something. Listen, the 11 is stuff that we have in hand already, but we have others that we have very high probability of getting. So, the 11 could be higher right now. It's true that in some places it could be some releases somewhere. But again, we have very long-term contracts all over the place, so right now we're not expecting to see reductions in other places. Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And then just, I know capital allocation strategy talked about it being towards debt reduction repayment, but considering just how constructive you are on NDS, I'm just curious how we should think about M A opportunities, whether it's a Tuck-in or Bolt-on as far as technology or anybody else out there that can fold right into the under the Nabors solution. Just thinking about M A opportunities and NDS how we should think about that. I think you've hit on something that clearly, it's been on our radar for quite a while, and we have been looking and we've added some small software stuff that you haven't really seen much visibility to. That's become part of our product lines as well. So, kind of add to our internal growth with kind of small tuck-in acquisitions. And then we've also embarked on partnerships as well. So, our example is Cova out there, which has a software product that we competed with, but together we think we can actually do one-on-one equals four. And the marketplace is not a big marketplace, right  I mean, there's only x 100 -- 700 rigs, what in the international, I mean, altogether maybe 1500 rigs that are target rigs. It's not like the Microsoft and Apple, which have a gazillion customers out there. So, for the technology to work, it makes sense to try to work with incumbents and see if there's a way to make things work better. And so, we've embarked on that path with some of these deals we've done and we're open to it. We are looking at other similar deals, not just acquisitions. I think we also deal with Halliburton, I think is going to be accretive to Nabors drilling solutions. And of course, one of the big objectives that we have is to try to convince some of our peers to take our technology rather than redeveloping, reinventing the wheel themselves. And we have been having some success on that. Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the forward management for any closing comments.Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. If you have any additional questions or would like to follow up, please contact us. And with that, Keith, we'll end the call there. Thank you, very much.Thank you. And as mentioned, the call has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.",23,2023-10-14T09:48:03.000-04:00
Tesla Is Bound To Move Above $380,"It's time for a revisit to   since  of the stock. Tesla has increased production above our previous forecasts, which is great, and has managed to maintain its position as a market leader in termsSo, what is needed to take Tesla to new highs  The green transition is the main catalyst, although we also expect Tesla to maintain a strong market share and improve profit margins. We believe all pieces are in place for Tesla shares to continue their positive path.Tesla's ability to remain the market leader for the past years manifests as proof of its quality and brand recognition around the world. Tesla is alsoHowever, the main catalyst for Tesla is the Paris Agreement and the legislative initiatives that stem from it. Based on those premises, the transition toward an electrified vehicle industry is mandatory, and Tesla is perfectly positioned to benefit from it.The company has seen an exponential growth rate since 2016, driven by a strong global demand, and Tesla has a bold goal to deliver . If Tesla manages to maintain its exponential growth rate of 50  per annum, this target may be reached in just a few years' time. However, we believe 20 million EVs is a bit of a stretch. To reach 15 million EV deliveries per annum in the next ten years is realistic.Tesla is now planning a , this time in Mexico, with production estimated to begin in late 2024 or Q1 2025 with an annual capacity of reportedly 1-2 million vehicles. This would take EV deliveries up to 3-4 million vehicles per year for Tesla. There's no doubt Tesla will keep announcing new factories as global demand continues to surge.Continued demand for electric vehicles is a focal point for Tesla's ambitious growth plans. The fact is that the , with sales seeing exponential growth rates. In 2022, 10 million EVs were sold and its market share has more than tripled in the last three years, from around 4  in 2020 to 14  in 2022. The IEA expects EV sales to reach 14 million by the end of 2023, a 35  YoY increase. This trend should continue as country officials keep enacting on the Paris Agreement and take us toward a more sustainable society.Furthermore, global car production for 2023 is expected to end at 70 million vehicles per year, and by 2030 we'll likely see a global production of 100 million cars per year. , all new cars and vans are planned to be electric in the EU and we expect 70-80  of global deliveries to be EVs by 2040. Hence, it's highly plausible that Tesla will reach 15  million yearly EV deliveries in the next ten years.One important move towards net-zero emissions is the European Union's adoption of the new CO2 standards for cars and vans in March 2023, where carbon emissions are to be reduced by 55  and 50  for new cars and vans respectively by 2030  compared to 2021 , and 100  for both by 2035. This new legislation poses a strong growth catalyst for Tesla shares. Tesla is well positioned to capture on this opportunity through its Berlin-based Gigafactory, and most likely one more factory will be announced soon as demand prospects within the EU remain strong. We also expect similar legislative initiatives to be adopted around the world in the near future, and as mentioned we anticipate 70-80  of global vehicle production to be EVs by 2040.Tesla also offers geographical diversification in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, and when the U.S. EV market struggles with price cuts and rising inventories. With its geographically spread Gigafactories, Tesla ensures a steady and cost-efficient supply of its EVs by staying close to the end customer while at the same time capturing the rising trend for global EV demand.Turning to valuation, total  by an average of 50  for the last three years  2019 to 2022 , from  24.6 billion to  81.5 billion. Revenue growth is highly correlated with vehicle sales, which has had a similar growth rate for the same period, and we expect automotive sales to be the driving positive factor of future growth.   ASP  as competition tightens is the main negative contributing factor on revenue.Tesla posted free cash flow of  7.552 billion in 2022 compared to  3.483 billion in 2021. The Free Cash Flow CAGR for the past three years is 98 . In our discounted cash flow  DCF  model, we anticipate a modest CAGR of 30  for the subsequent 10 years, yielding a Fair Value of  382 for the Tesla stock. This poses a major upside for Tesla, and we are strongly bullish on the stoc.Tesla is by now a major enterprise which means it receives high coverage from analysts across the globe. Still, it seems that the overall consensus of analysts is underestimating future growth. As we all know, Tesla is a market-leading EV manufacturer, and the company will most likely continue to lead as the transition towards sustainable transportation evolves. Taking into account current and upcoming legislative initiatives, in line with the Paris Agreement, the EV market is still to see a major expansion. Meanwhile, Tesla will reach 15  million vehicles in sales per year by the early 2030s. We believe it's only a matter of time before the market consensus aligns with our expectations, and that Tesla stock is bound for a major ride towards our target price.

Will The Fed Trigger Another Crisis Event?,"As the narrative grows, the risk of a  event in the economy increases. Will the Fed trigger another crisis event  While unknown, the risk seems likely as the Fed s  narrative isSuch is a question worth asking as we look back at the Fed s history of previous monetary actions. Such was a topic I discussed in  To witHistorically, when the Fed hikes interest rates and yield curves invert, someone inevitability pushes the But that is also the fallacy in the 1995 scenario the media is currently pinning its hopes on. Indeed, the economy did not slip into a recession  however, there were crisis events along the way. More importantly, the yield curve did not invert in 1995. However, it inverted in 1998, and a recession followed roughly 24 months later.The chart above shows that yield curve inversions occur roughly 10 24 months before recognizing a recession or crisis event. This is because it takes time for the  of higher borrowing costs to negatively impact the economy.While the Fed hopes individuals will act rationally as they tighten monetary policy, investors tend not to act that way. But what the markets are likely missing is that we are not just talking about the Fed s monetary policy decisions in isolation.We currently live in the most highly leveraged economic era in U.S. history. As of Q2 of 2023, the total measurable leverage in the economy is  97 trillion. The entire economy is currently at  22.2 trillion, so it requires  4.36 in debt for each  1 of economic growth. Critically, that level of debt has nearly doubled since 2008, when it stood at  54 trillion and the economy was roughly  16 trillion in value. In other words, in just 13 years, the economic leverage rose from  3.38 per  1 of growth to  4.36. That massive surge in leverage was made possible by near-zero interest rates during that period.Given the financial system s leverage, the collision of debt-financed activity with restrictive financial conditions will lead to weaker growth. Historically, such increases in financial conditions have always preceded recessionary onsets and crisis events. Notably, those events occurred at substantially lower levels of overall leverage.If we look at the annual rate of change in total system leverage versus changes in interest rates, we find about a 36-month lag from when rates increase to a crisis event. Given that rates started to rise in 2021, such suggests the next crisis event will occur later in 2024.As noted above, confirmation of the timing of the next recession or crisis event in 2024 comes from the yield curve inversions. Historically, when yield curves invert, the media proclaims a recession is coming. However, when it doesn t immediately manifest, they assume it s  We just aren t there yet, as the  has yet to take hold.Due to the amount of  stimulus  injected into the economy and the still-elevated levels of money supply as a percentage of the economy, the recessionary onset likely will be akin to the 2006 episode.Simply, just because the collision of higher borrowing costs, reduced money supply, and slowing economic growth hasn t caused a crisis or recession yet doesn t mean it won t.In  we discussed how a crisis event is possible if interest rates rise, the Fed tightens monetary policy, or the economic recovery faltersMost importantly, over the last decade, the primary rationalization  Unfortunately, with inflation elevated, which shrinks profit margins, and high interest rates, valuations are likely a more significant issue than most suspect.As At the moment, we don t know when the next  will arrive.However, it is only a function of time until the Fed s  higher for longer  causes someone to push the  big red button.

RTX Corporation's Underrated Stock: A Haven Amid Middle East Crisis,"RTX Corporation  is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies headquartered in Arlington, with a  of systems and services in high demand by military and commercial customers worldwide.We emphasize three of the company's four segments, accounting for 84.9  of its total revenue. The first is Collins Aerospace, a global supplier of products to the aerospace and defense  A D  industry, including aircraft maintenance services for airlines and airplane manufacturers.Collins' portfolio consists of numerous products, including engine control systems, navigation systems, aviation systems, and flight control systems used on multiple Boeing  and Airbus  aircraft. Moreover, this division is supplying power generation systems as part of a  to modernize the B-52, a long-range strategic bomber.The second segment, which contributed about 31.1  ofIn addition to civil aviation, Pratt   Whitney supplies F135 engines for various variants of Lockheed Martin's F-35 . Given Iran's rhetoric and geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea, we believe that demand for these aircraft from NATO members will remain high.Meanwhile, given the war in the Middle East, we believe that Raytheon Missiles   Defense will greatly contribute to improving RTX's financial position. This segment is a supplier of products aimed at detecting and countering various threats. We expect that due to increasing geopolitical tensions in the world, demand for the NASAMS and Patriot missile defense system, the company's air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, will continue to grow. The company does not rest on its progress and is , including counter-hypersonics and radars, which will strengthen US leadership in the arms industry.Growing geopolitical tensions in the world, especially in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, contribute to maintaining interest in the company from Wall Street mastodons. The  of RTX Corporation, collectively owning 31.9  of the company, include Vanguard Group, Blackrock, Capital International Investors, State Street, and Capital Research Global Investors. showed remarkable results, as not only RTX's revenue was able to exceed analysts' expectations, but also the company's management business strategies aimed at stabilizing its gross margins continue to remain effective despite persistent inflationary pressures. Moreover, its EPS continues to beat analysts' consensus estimates in recent years, indicating Wall Street is conservatively assessing the company's business prospects despite rising geopolitical tensions worldwide., RTX will publish its financial report for the 3rd quarter of 2023. , RTX Corporation's third-quarter 2023 revenue is expected to be  13.32 billion to  19.13 billion, up 8.6  year-over-year and 28.2  higher than analysts' expectations for the prior quarter. At the same time, following our model, the company's total revenue will be slightly above the median of this range and will amount to  18.4 billion.RTX's revenue growth will be driven by increased sales of Raytheon Missiles   Defense and Pratt   Whitney products to commercial and military customers and boosted demand for aircraft maintenance due to increased airline travel volumes in the post-COVID-19 era. These factors, in particular, will mitigate the negative impact of the strengthening US dollar against the euro in our view.We forecast that RTX's operating income margin will reach 11.1  by 2023. Moreover, in 2024, this financial metric will increase to 11.6 , thanks to an increase in the number of new orders from Israel and NATO members, optimization of labor costs, and reduction in the price of raw materials used for the production of aircraft engines, missiles, and various systems. data, RTX Corporation's Q3 EPS is expected to be  1.13- 1.3, up 3.4  from the consensus estimate for Q2 2023. At the same time, according to our model, RTX's EPS will be in this range and reach  1.25.Moreover, the company's Non-GAAP P E  TTM  is 14.68x, which is 10.64  lower than the sector average and 21.38  lower than the average over the past five years. Additionally, RTX's Non-GAAP P E  FWD  is 14.85x, which is one of the many factors indicating its undervaluation by Mr. Market during the period of growth in passenger aircraft production, largely due to the recovery of passenger traffic in the world., the total number of passengers was 37.37 million in the first fifteen days of October 2023, an increase of 11.2  from the previous year.Like numerous other aerospace and defense companies, RTX's debt has continued to rise in recent quarters, putting pressure on its net income margin. At the end of the second quarter of 2023, RTX's total debt was about  36.9 billion, an increase of  3.37 billion over 2021. On the other hand, the company's EBITDA continues to grow yearly, resulting in its total debt EBITDA ratio remaining around 3x.RTX Corporation is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies headquartered in Arlington, with a diverse portfolio of systems and services in high demand by military and commercial customers worldwide.Due to issues discovered in the production of components using contaminated metal powder, Pratt   Whitney had to remove over 600 of its geared turbofan  GTF  engines from aircraft for quality checks, according to news from . As a result of these challenges, the company's share price has experienced a decline of over 26  since the beginning of the year.Despite all the difficulties that RTX has encountered in recent months, its management continues to increase dividend payments yearly. Moreover, given the company's rising revenue, its dividend yield of 3.19 , and the growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East due to aggressive actions by Hezbollah and Hamas against Israel, we initiate our coverage of RTX with an  outperform  rating for the next 12 months.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Sentiment Speaks: Are We Ready To Rally To 4800?,"Inflation, the Fed, interest rates, Russia Ukraine war, Israeli Hamas Hezbollah war, Iran, China, North Korea, housing, earnings, oil, politics, bank instability, unemployment, US Dollar, etc. Did I forget anything  Well, I am quite sure there are other issues that many are focused upon which I did not enumerate. But, the point is that almost every single article written about the stockNow, take a step back, and ask yourself how many of these authors focusing upon all these factors have been able to accurately and consistently outline to you where the market is headed  Have you ever considered why they can'tWell, the simple answer is that none of these factors drive the market, so they are looking in the wrongIn a 1988 study conducted by Cutler, Poterba, and Summers entitled  What Moves Stock Prices,  they reviewed stock market price action after major economic or other type of news  including major political events  in order to develop a model through which one would be able to predict market moves RETROSPECTIVELY. Yes, you heard me right. They were not even at the stage yet of developing a prospective prediction model.However, the study concluded that  m acroeconomic news . . . explains only about one fifth of the movements in stock market prices.  In fact, they even noted that  many of the largest market movements in recent years have occurred on days when there were no major news events.  They also concluded that  t here is surprisingly small effect  from  big news  of  political developments . . . and international events.  They also suggest thatSo, rather than focusing on economics and geopolitics, there must be a better way to forecast the stock market  There is and it is based upon a view of market sentiment.When I have made this claim in the past, many question me as to how sentiment drives the market and simply turns on its own without any exogenous drivers  My answer is simply 'biology.'Intuitive and knowledgeable investors and analysts recognize that market participants move in  herds  in the same way as many animals. You see, humans are hard wired for herding within their basal ganglia and limbic system within their brain, which is a biological response they share with all animals. And, this is driven by emotion and not by  reason.There have been many recent studies that support this perspective. For example, in a study performed by Dr. Joseph Ledoux, a psychologist at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, he noted that emotion and the reaction caused by such emotion occurs independent and prior to, the ability of the brain to reason.In a paper entitled  Large Financial Crashes,  published in 1997 in Physics A., a publication of the European Physical Society, the authors, within their conclusions, present a nice summation for the overall herding phenomena within financial marketsSo, while almost all authors attempt to reason with the market based upon all the factors outlined above, we have to finally come to the realization that it really is useless if our goal is to determine which way the market is going to move based upon societal sentiment. As I have said before, attempting to reason with the stock market  an emotional environment  is akin to attempting to use logic to reason with your spouse when they are emotional. How well does that work for youThe definition of insanity, as attributed to Albert Einstein, is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result. Based upon this definition, it would suggest that most of those who base their analysis on the factors noted above are insane. And, while what I am saying here is clearly not going to stop the insanity, I am hoping to at least open the minds of some of you to the truth of what I have been presenting for many years.The fact that I engage in an esoteric form of analysis and still have 75,000 followers on a fundamental analysis website, have the 3rd largest paid service on a fundamental analysis website, and have 8000 subscribers and almost 1000 money manager clients suggests that I have been somewhat successful in opening the eyes of many investors as to what truly drives the market, rather than generally accepted fallacies.Now, consider how I was able to tell you that the market was likely going to rally to 4300  from the 3500SPX region as we were bottoming in October of 2022. In fact, consider how I was looking for a bottom at 3500SPX when most of the market was expecting a further decline due to the worse than expected CPI report. And, none of that was based upon considerations of any of the factors outlined at the start of this article.Now, consider how I was also recently suggesting that we will likely head down to the 4230-4274SPX region when the market was in the 4500SPX region. Did any of those expectations include an assessment of ANY of the factors noted above  Did any of that matter to my view  Yet, I was able to prognosticate the market quite accurately without those considerations. How is that even possible  Does that not suggest that all of those factors noted above do not really even matter for accurate market prognosticationWhen you finally come to the realization of what truly drives the market, you can tune out all the noise and then focus on what is important to your investment account and bottom line. I know that this seems so hard to believe and so counter-intuitive to what you have thought for many years, yet when you are able to come to this realization, it makes your life so much easier and much more profitable. Along those lines, this comment is an example of what our members have told usLet's move to our market view.As I outlined several weeks ago, as long as the market holds the 4165-4220SPX region, I am still going to be looking to the next higher target in the 4800SPX region. I also outlined that the 4375-4401SPX region is going to be an important resistance region. Thus far, we struck a low just over the 4219SPX level, and rallied to our next resistance region. While the market struck a high of 4385SPX in the regular market hours, the futures struck a high in the 4400SPX region.While I just posted a 3-page detailed analysis of my view to members, I will give you a very simplified perspective. As long as we hold the 4280-4302SPX region of support and then break out through 4401SPX, it would make it likely we are on our way to our next higher target in the 4800SPX region. However, a sustained break of that support would concern me that a major top may already be in place. I do apologize, as I have to leave the detail of the analysis to our members.Lastly, I want to thank you all for your messages of support for my family during this horrible situation in Israel. My son, Sammy, actually wanted to stay in Israel and go back into the army, even though he was not called up yet. But, my youngest son, Yoni, Facetimed him and cried to him that he already lost his mother, and did not want to lose his brother too. So, Tuesday morning, my late wife Becky's brother and his whole family, Becky's father and wife, and our son Sammy - who were all in Israel for the Sukkot holiday - all landed safely back in the United States.Again, thank you all for your support and prayers. Now, we have to keep praying for the rest of Israel  including for the Seeking Alpha staff living in Israel , as this is likely going to get much worse before it gets better.

The Time To Plan For Tomorrow Is Today," shows that the vast majority of individual investors - and even the majority of active professional money managers - do not even achieve the total returns of the S P500 let alone  beat the market . There are, of course, many reasons why this is the case. But theMany years ago, I put all my investments into a spreadsheet and began tracking itNow, before I go any further, and in hopes to minimize the number of comments that will point it out, . There are a plethora of factors that should impact any individual investors' portfolio decision making  age, net-worth, working retired, goals, risk tolerance, taxes ... well, you get the picture. Please keep this in mind when I discuss the sample portfolio structure below.I prefer taking . That is, I look at my total  liquid  net-worth and allocate capital into the various  for which I want exposure. A sample portfolio implementing such a strategy is shown belowThis sample portfolio has allocated 50  toward the S P500. In my case, this is accomplished primarily with investments in the Vanguard S P500 ETF  and the Fidelity 500 Index Fund . These are long-term holdings in which I never sell but will typically and readily add to during times of big market corrections  as in last year's bear market .The dividend income category, for myself, is primarily energy stocks  ConocoPhillips , Phillips66 , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , and Enbridge . These stocks have delivered excellent dividend growth over the decades that I have owned them. That said, many retired investors have been advised  brainwashed  into vastly over-emphasizing the dividend income category simply because they are  retired  and despite the fact that many can live just fine on the combination of their pensions, social security, and investments. I discuss this issue in one of my most popular Seeking Alpha articles  . From what I gather from writing articles on Seeking Alpha, and reading thousands of comments, this is probably the  1 reason why retired investors significantly lag the returns that the market is more than willing to give them via the S P500.Being an engineer, the growth category of my portfolio is primarily directed at the Technology Sector and is my attempt to outperform the market  i.e. the S P500 . These stocks include the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Trust , Amazon , Google , Broadcom , and Jabil  - most of which have beaten the S P500 over the time frames in which I have owned them.I question whether or not the sector specific category is worth the time and effort and if I would simply be better off simply moving the proceeds into the S P500. Some of these are legacy positions prior to my change in portfolio strategy and include ETFs in the Defense   Aerospace sector , Consumer Staples , Utilities , Healthcare  and - of course - the Technology Sector  the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF , the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF , and the iShares Expanded Tech Software ETF  - among a few others. Other than the technology funds, these funds give me some diversification but have generally lagged in comparison to the S P500.The speculative growth category includes higher risk reward opportunities and typically contains stocks that I watch with an eagle-eye. For instance, one of my speculative investments was in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , which I invested in after I noticed that PayPal and Square announced they were supporting the crypto  see  . This turned out to be one of the fastest appreciating investment I have ever made - tripling in a matter of weeks. I eventually sold half to cover my original cost basis, and later sold the other half on the way down. To be fair, I have also had my fair share of failures - most recently in Akoustis , a company with great technology but a terrible stock. Regardless, the goal of the speculative growth category is for the successes to far outweigh the failures such that the long-term performance of the category beats the S P500. More conservative investors may choose to eliminate this category from their portfolios.I got into precious metals way back in the George W. Bush administration when I predicted he would get us into a war and spend a lot of money. I bought gold and silver U.S. minted coins. Both have roughly doubled since then, but have probably lagged the returns had I simply bought the S P500 instead. However, I view gold and silver as insurance policies for black-swan events and geopolitical uncertainty - which is exactly what the world faces today  the 2020 January 6th coup-attempt in the U.S., a republican party that arguably no longer even supports American Democracy and has proven to be incapable of governing the House of Representatives  no Speaker of the House now for 17-days and counting ... , Putin's horrific war-on-Ukraine, the potential for a large-scale in the Middle East, and China's militaristic aggression on Taiwan. It is no surprise that gold has been rallying over the past couple of weeksIn my opinion, and despite the lack of investor analysis on the subject, the  cash  category - and the management of it - is one of the most important categories within an investor's portfolio.  Cash , at least for me, is defined as  checking savings accounts for day-to-day transactions, money market funds, CDs, and bonds. Each of these can be a source of income, comfort, and long-term gains.For instance, in the early 2000's when I was still working, I bought some U.S. I-bonds with excess cash that I was uncomfortable putting into  the market . As you know,  have two components  a  fixed  rate and a  variable  rate. The variable rate is based on the rate of U.S. inflation. At the time  pre-shale , I was worried about a potential shortage of oil leading to high inflation. For years these I-bonds were pretty awful investments and I almost sold them. But I am glad I didn't as over the past couple of years some of them yielded 10-11 . And, as Einstein once saidI also maintain a CD ladder and have various money market funds that are currently yielding 5 . However, in my opinion the most important aspect of the cash category is to enable you to take strategic advantage of market volatility by pouncing on attractive investment opportunities when they arise. Last year, investors were given a bear-market gift with tremendous investment opportunities - but only if you had available cash to put to work.As I mentioned earlier, I track my portfolio spreadsheet on a monthly basis. But that doesn't mean I take action every month. Now that I have my portfolio structured the way I want it  well-diversified and built for the long-term ... , I can go months hardly doing anything at all. And to repeat, it took me years to transition my under-performing portfolio into the portfolio I decided I wanted - and I advise investors not to rush that process. Take your time and move intentionally and wisely.I say that because research also shows that individual investors  and professional money managers ...  are just awful at timing the market. Much of that is because of the influence of incessant investment  noise  by loud-mouthed  experts . The other reason is because timing the market means you have to be right twice  when to get out, and when to get back in. I have several friends that sold during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and to this day have never gotten back into the market. As a result, they missed the biggest bull-market of their lives.At the end of the day, a picture is worth a thousand words, and the 10-year total returns chart of the major market indexes  as represented by VOO, , and QQQ  speaks volumesHeck, when I first started investing in the market during the early 80's, the DJIA was around 1,200. At pixel time the DJIA is at 33,266  27.7x . The S P500 was trading around 460. At pixel time the S P500 is at 4245  9.2x . And those returns don't even include dividends.The importance of periodically rebalancing your portfolio cannot be overstated. I recommend reaffirming your allocation percentages and your portfolio at least once a year - I do it at least twice a year and even monthly during times of high volatility. Rebalancing makes sure you stay on your long-term plan and prevents you from become over-loaded into any particular asset class  unless that is what you planned to do, like me with the S P500 .As we head toward the end of another eventful and fascinating year of world events and investing, I encourage investors to analyze their portfolios to make sure it matches their goals, objectives, and risk tolerance. I also encourage them to be ready to take advantage of market volatility because, given the world we live in today, you are quite likely to get a great chance to make some wise portfolio moves at valuation levels significantly below those available today.

"InMode: Overblown Reaction On Guidance, A Rare Valuation","InMode  and its stock first came to my attention just a few days ago, when I refreshed my Seeking Alpha key High Quality and Bad Momentum stock screener. I began to investigate further. In the analysis, I willIn the past, the company was significantly overvalued, but that has changed dramatically, and I now view it as an excellent bargain for the reasons I will explain later. However, based on the company's balance sheet, I determined that the company's margin of safety is substantial, as the Cash and Short-term investments minus total liabilities calculated per share is close to  7. Compare it to the stock price of  20  this will help you evaluate the situation in which, in my opinion, Mr. Market is wrong.There is a great deal of negative fundamentals, which is aggressively dragging the stock price down. However, I will attempt to determine whether it was caused by psychology or actual events. As a future shareholder, I view the current events as a phenomenal investment opportunity because, as I will reveal in the valuation section, the company is facing headwinds, but the price has been cut by more than 30 percent in recent weeks. In terms of valuation, it begins to be truly safe near this point, as the margin of safety increases significantly in my view.However, one of the primary drivers of the most recent price decline is the company's , as reported here on SAAccording to management, there are solid  for this, including the company's return to normal, seasonality in Q3, and economic slowdown, as well as the company's observation of a decrease in summertime purchase decisions. Additional reasons cited here wereIn conclusion, there is a decline of 8.5  from the highest  old  estimate to the lowest  current  estimate, but still a substantial margin. In a short period of time, revenue forecasts for the current, subsequent, and two fiscal years out have dropped significantly, and this trend may continue. However, despite this decline, Forward PE is still very attractive.The margin is still quite high, and in the event of further demand concerns, a typical easing in cyclical sectors could occur. Nevertheless, this is a cyclical point. To find out more about the macroeconomic outlook, you should read my most recent analysis . I believe the company is on the right track based on its history and the industry's continued growth.As INMD is an Israel-based company, the entire stock market experienced a significant sell-off, led by the stock index TA 35, which fell by more than -10  in the first trading days following Hamas's multi-pronged attack on Israel. The Israeli prime minister also declared war. Uncertain as to how this will impact the economy as a whole, there is a possibility of a consumer shock manifested by decreased consumption, retail sales, investments, and migration. From this point forward, there may be a significant impact on the Israel business unit. Furthermore, it is a new geopolitical risk that could result in even more aggressive global tightening if the price of oil reacts by increasing.However, below I provide the company's geographical revenue breakdown from its  filings, which indicates that 66  of sales are made in the United States, 11  in Europe, and 23  internationally. My subjective point was that only a fraction of total sales are in Israel, perhaps 1-5 . Later, the company his up laterIn the initial reaction, the stock price fell -6  on the first trading day, and then more than 25  after reduced guidance  however, the company is getting closer to  pure value,  as I term it. Currently, the stock price is fluctuating near  20, accompanied by a pervasive negative sentiment.Where I see potential risk from the conflict is not in Israel sales, but rather in the form of additional pressures on energy prices, which could lead to an increase in CPI and, potentially, a prolonged tightening in tandem with a decline in consumption. Many individuals may become more cautious and prefer to delay certain consumption habits. On the other hand, geopolitical risk carries the potential to trigger additional tightening from market participants and central banks. As some current  have stated in the past week, the significant increase in bond yield has nearly eliminated the need for additional rate hikes. Such aggressive moves on the bond market, in my opinion, not only reveal the great opportunity out there, but also cause much stronger tightening than the overall 25 basis points by the FOMC. Until the end of the year, it is uncertain whether rates will increase once more. However, in my opinion, risks associated with overtightening are increasing rapidly, and with the addition of geopolitical tension, which could cause growth concerns, this is the ideal time to focus on stock picking based on extremely strict criteria and a long-term outlook.In my previous , where I am bullish  as of early September explains why my outlook on bonds with current yields is becoming increasingly bullish. Yes, I was a little more preliminary, but this was the current pricing set-upHonestly, the US 10-year yield has just reached 4.9 , the 20-year yield has reached 5.2 , and the 30-year yield has risen to 5 . So, from my perspective, there was no perfect timing, even when considering a further move of 10-20 bps, but this makes me an even stronger bull on the market, as Bill Ackman recently I strongly concur with this viewpoint. However, additional risks could result in a further decline in the stock price. And for this reason, I emphasize the importance of being a strong bull for US bonds  with combination of short opinions on SPX and Nasdaq in last 3 months  and a cautious, critical stock picker. And INMD is one of few companies that offers a very large margin of safety, a stunning valuation, and solid balance sheet criteria despite the current growth concerns.As the majority of the company's revenue came from equipment sales rather than the subscription model, it makes sense to concentrate on lending standards. Initially, it is essential to consider the clientele and business model. The company's primary source of revenue is the sale of its aesthetic market-focused medical devices and technology. The clientele of InMode consists of companies, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and other professionals who provide such services and treatments to patients.A climate of rising interest rates can have a significant impact on the company's clientele. First, these professionals who purchase InMode's devices and technology can rely on financing to acquire its likely expensive products. The current interest rate environment can make financing a client's equipment more expensive and difficult. The second possibility is that they want to postpone future investments or purchases, will reconsider purchasing InMode's products, and may struggle due to their reduced budget. In general, a higher interest rate can have a greater influence on consumer demand. However, the extremely robust industry demand significantly mitigates a number of these factors, as will be demonstrated below.Although the sector outlook is very promising, a great win for the business as a whole is still increasing demand in the aesthetic medicine market, where, according to Moreover, in the  called  Global Medical Aesthetics Market Forecast to 2028 - COVID-19 Impact and Global Analysis By Product, is projectingI would like to mention briefly that no screener is the holy grail, and that I can be affected by incorrect selection assumptions. Nonetheless, I believe that searching for a quality stock using specific criteria increases the likelihood of success. Consider that this stock screener includes stocks with negative momentum but a superior business model. There are more than five or six choices, but this one captured my attention on the first and second viewing. In other words, the screener reveals a high-quality business model based on its criteria, but cannot guarantee that the price will not drop further. Because  the shape  of negative momentum carries this risk. However, you need not catch the bottom, as Warren Buffett statedHowever, based on the pricing, business development, and industry outlook, I believe I could buy shares of this wonderful company at a wonderful price.Here are the first criteriaThe filter results should be considered as very preliminary and as first-view narrative, as indicated by my previous analysis with focus on lithium stocks that are highly susceptible to commodity price-related risks, but are still gainers. My experience has taught me that it is preferable to concentrate on businesses that exclude such risks as INMD, where there are no external factors other than common macro ones. There were many successful small picks in the screener, such as , , , and , which are no longer included in the screener because they no longer satisfy the condition of bad momentum. Despite the fact that ALB is down 30  in my previous screener-based analysis, I continue to believe it possesses enormous potential. However, I cautioned that the decline is possible, as it is a bad momentum filter risk in the very short-term  however, the long-term perspective is different. Nevertheless, the lithium stock is performing significantly below expectations due, among other external factors, to the price of lithium. From this point of view, we should focus on companies where there is no-commodity related risk.In the screener I had revealed key criteria and here is the summary of InModeIn conclusion, InMode is a great company with a solid trend, a pure balance sheet with no leverage, and only temporary issues  however, the stock is under pressure due to growth concerns stemming from lowered guidance due to strong tightening conditions  their clients may struggle to borrow and delay investments  and potential harm in overall spending and CAPEX by other companies. However, a mitigating factor is the industry's optimistic outlook and extremely low valuation levels.First, I see an excellent valuation summary in Seeking Alpha's valuation section, which indicates that the company is very cheap with an A- grade and very cheap relative to the sector from every angle. Regarding forward PE, PB, PS, and PCF, there is a 36 -55  discount to the sector's overall valuation. This indicates that the margin of safety is substantial. Consequently, I observe a wildly overblown reaction to the updated revenue guidance  downwards  and war concerns, which I believe are extremely disconnected from reality.The price has a strong correlation with both the revision trend and Wall Street's price target. However, there is currently a wide gap between the current price and price targets. Almost certainly, we will experience a further downward revision, but we will be better informed after the next earnings report in a few weeks.Before comparing the company's profit margin and forward price-to-earnings ratio to the overall sector's profit margin and forward PE, I typically assess the company's valuation. We can conclude that InMode is in a very rare position, in the right corner, and is therefore a company with extremely high margins and a low market value. Companies with a profit margin between 20 and 27 , but a higher valuation, are most comparable  little bit left . This indicates, according to the sector's margin, that the company's valuation is quite attractive. There is no comparable company facing similar circumstances. This is another reason why I believe the revenue decline and war fears to be exaggerated reactions that drove the stock price substantially and largely unjustifiably lower.As stated in the very first lines of the analysis, the balance sheet is devoid of any indication of leverage due to screener criteria. In addition, a deeper examination reveals that the working capital is extremely valuable, as total current assets significantly and multiple times exceed total current liabilities.However, I calculated  Cash Value  in the chart below, which I consider to be Pure Cash. This is why. First, we must define what I have categorized as pure cash. The item consists of cash and short-term investments  market investments  that can be quickly converted to cash, but at least generate a return. Then, I deducted  all liabilities,  including not only current liabilities but also long-term debt, etc. Then it was divided by the total shares. The following are the calculationsAs shown in the graph below, the trend in cash generation is enormous and will continue with extreme certainty in my view, despite reduced revenue projections for FY 2023. And it is driven primarily by high margins. However, this indicates that based on the current price of  20,  6.8 are fully reflected by cash. In other words, 33-35 percent of the current market price is fully adjusted for  pure cash,  or if you purchase a share of stock for  19.8,  6.8 of that amount is fully adjusted cash. Moreover, I am convinced that if price pressures continue, the company has more than  560 million in highly liquid assets  more than one-third of its market capitalization  to announce any potential buybacks.Despite all of the data and growth concerns, I am convinced that the market's reaction to the company's guidance has been exaggerated. Current macroeconomic conditions have a significant negative impact on the company's clientele and their capital expenditures, but the industry outlook appears to be quite positive with a high CAGR. In addition, there is a great deal of negative sentiment surrounding the stock price, which is also affected by the conflict in Israel and its potential repercussions. There is still a risk of additional downward pressure on future earnings and revenue forecasts heading into FY 2024, but the company is navigating these challenging times with great skill. There are almost no direct effects of war  on InMode's operations  I see, with the exception of a possible global effect that could weaken consumer demand. Despite all of these threats and risks, which I described in the macro implication section, I am confident that the valuation is extremely attractive, based on both relative ratios, such as Forward PE, and relative to the sector, where I compared profit margin with Forward PE, as well as a very healthy balance sheet with a strong cash position and strong cash generation. I believe that this long-term trend represents an opportunity. I believe the fair value of the stock price is between  32 and  38, which is assuming valuations close to the sector average. Using a balance sheet approach as well as a great valuation table from Seeking Alpha, I can say that the stock is extremely undervalued relative to its track record, growth, challenging times, and unleveraged business model with solid potential.Before investing in the company, it is strongly advised that you conduct your own research.

Buy Gold In October 2023: The Planets Are Aligning For Its Resurgence,"ActivTrades senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista  yesterday thatIn this article, we are going to look at the various factors that are aligning to lead to what we believe will be a resurgence for gold  in the coming months and years.The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has sent shockwaves through global markets, with investors rushing to shield their portfolios from the ensuing uncertainty that the conflict may spread throughout the region and ultimately even lead to a conflict that embroils two major oil exporters in Iran and Saudi Arabia. Gold, with its historical precedent of being a safe-haven asset, has witnessed a significant jumpMoreover, the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine and its Western Allies as well as the growing tensions in East Asia between North Korea and South Korea and between China and Taiwan - with the potential for catastrophic wars to erupt from any of those hot spots - provide additional incentive to own gold during these geopolitically volatile times.Gold has traditionally been an  against inflation. With the global economy experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty at the moment and various nations still trying to balance fighting off inflationary pressures with trying to avoid falling into recession, gold looks like an increasingly prudent investment.Despite the gold price initially falling more than 11  from its May high due to the Fed's hawkish outlook, the precious metal still holds potential for price appreciation in the coming years...And it has already begun to make a comeback in recent daysMoreover, it seems probable that the U.S. Government will continue its runaway deficit spending for the foreseeable future. Consequently, this will exert significant pressure on the Federal Reserve to eventually reduce interest rates, potentially resulting in negative real interest rates in the long run. As a result, inflation rates are expected to surpass nominal interest rates, creating a highly favorable scenario for gold over the long term.Another reason to be bullish on gold right now is that historically, gold has demonstrated a pattern of delivering positive average returns of 0.71  and 1.3  in November and December, respectively, due in part to a rise in jewelry demand and a generally weaker dollar in December. As a result, if history is any guide, buying gold in October could be a great risk-adjusted move.The recent surge in central bank purchases of gold underscores the precious metal's enduring appeal amidst global economic and geopolitical tumult. Central banks, both from advanced economies and emerging market developing economies  EMDE , are amassing gold reserves at a pace not seen for over 50 years, with these entities accounting for 34  of total gold demand in the third quarter of 2022 and their rapid pace of buying continuing into 2023.This buying spree was likely prompted at least in part by the geopolitical upheaval caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant sanctions on Russia, prompting a re-evaluation of U.S. dollar reserves' vulnerability. This is evidenced by the fact that 42  of banks anticipate a decline in U.S. dollar holdings, according to a World Gold Council . Furthermore, nations like Russia and China have been aggressively purchasing gold, potentially as a safeguard against foreign asset seizures. EMDE banks, often more proactive in their gold-buying endeavors than their Western counterparts, clearly increasingly view gold not merely as a historical store of wealth, but as a strategic asset that provides a buffer against potential payment crises arising from current or future sanctions and insulating their often more fragile economies against global financial crises.If this strong central bank demand continues - which it is showing no signs of slowing down - it will likely provide a pretty strong tailwind for gold prices over the long term.Thanks to its multi-millennia history of being a safe-haven asset, gold is once again catching a bid due to rising global geopolitical unrest, driven by conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and East Asia.Furthermore, gold serves as a hedge against inflation, especially as the global economy faces uncertainty and inflationary pressures. Despite a recent drop in gold prices due to the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance, it is expected to appreciate in the coming years, given the likelihood of continued deficit spending and potential negative real interest rates for years to come.Historical trends also favor gold, with positive returns in November and December due to increased jewelry demand and a weaker dollar during that period. Last but not least, central bank purchases of gold have surged, driven by concerns over geopolitical upheaval and sanctions on Russia. This trend is particularly notable in emerging markets and developing economies, where gold is seen as a strategic asset to protect against payment crises and global financial instability. This strong central bank demand is expected to support gold prices in the long term.There are many great ways to invest in the yellow metal, including holding physical bullion in a secure location, investing in ETFs like GLD, IAU, or PHYS, or even buying gold miners and streaming royalty companies through ETFs like  or directly via leading global miners and streamers like Barrick Gold , Newmont Corporation , or Wheaton Precious Metals . Personally, I think that an all-of-the-above approach makes a lot of sense because each form of investment has its pros and cons and helps to insure against a host of potential outcomes, which is the main purpose of investing in gold in the first place.

Why Colgate-Palmolive Is A Bargain You Shouldn't Ignore Right Now,"Colgate-Palmolive  is one of the world's largest consumer products companies, . Since then, the company has gradually become a leader in the production of personal care and home care products, and itsThe Oral Care business is key to Colgate-Palmolive's financial position, accounting for more than . Its portfolio comprises pharmaceutical products for dentists, various toothpastes, and toothbrushes sold under world-famous brands such as Colgate, Darlie, and elmex.In addition, the company continues to be a leader in the global beauty and personal care market due to the high demand for its skin health products, shampoos, shower gels, and deodorants. The growth in sales of these products from year to year is ensured by factors such as strong brand recognition and theThe company also holds a leading position in the global pet food market. Colgate-Palmolive's products are available in most countries worldwide, and their sales contributed about 21.9  of the company's total revenue for the second quarter of 2023.In recent months, euphoria in financial markets has continued, caused by an increase in interest in technology companies developing and implementing AI-related products and services. However, Colgate-Palmolive is a consumer defensive stock, which we believe should again begin attracting long-term investors' attention due to its stable cash flow even during periods of geopolitical turmoil and rising inflation., Colgate-Palmolive has maintained a policy of increasing dividend payments year after year, and, as a result, it is a member of the prestigious S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index.On the other hand, a significant increase in the company's operating income in recent quarters has contributed to the fact that many well-known Wall Street companies remain among Colgate-Palmolive's major shareholders. The top , including Vanguard Group, State Street, Wellington Management Group, Blackrock, and Geode Capital Management, collectively hold a significant 28.9  stake in the company.The second quarter of 2023 showed excellent results since not only Colgate-Palmolive s revenue was able to exceed analysts  expectations, but on the other hand, its gross margin has been growing in recent quarters despite the persistence of elevated inflation in some countries of the European Union., Colgate-Palmolive will publish its financial report for the third quarter of 2023. According to Seeking Alpha, Colgate-Palmolive's third-quarter 2023 revenue is expected to be  4.72 billion to  5.01 billion, up 8.1  year-over-year and 2.6  higher than analysts' expectations for the prior quarter. At the same time, under our model, the company's total revenue will be within this range, amounting to  4.81 billion. We expect Colgate-Palmolive's year-over-year revenue growth trend to continue, driven by its share in the global toothpaste market, growth in sales of Pet Nutrition products, and expansion of its personal care portfolio. These factors, in particular, will soften the negative impact of strengthening the US dollar against other currencies.We forecast the company's operating income margin will reach 20.1  by 2023. Moreover, in 2024, this financial metric will rise to 21.1  due to an increase in prices for the company's goods, a decrease in the cost of raw materials and packaging materials, which are used to produce the company's products, optimization of labor costs, and a decrease in selling and administrative expenses., Colgate-Palmolive's Q3 EPS is expected to be  0.78- 0.82, up 6.7  from the Q2 2023 consensus estimate. At the same time, according to our model, Colgate-Palmolive's EPS will be  0.79, an increase of 6.8  compared to the previous year.Moreover, the company's Non-GAAP P E  TTM  is 22.88x, which is 38.52  higher than the sector average and 8.18  lower than the average over the past five years. On the contrary, Colgate-Palmolive's Non-GAAP P E  FWD  is 21.79x, which is one of the factors indicating its slight overvaluation by financial market participants at a time of rising tensions in the Middle East, which increases the likelihood of further disruptions in the global supply chain.One of the main factors behind Colgate-Palmolive beating consensus EPS in recent quarters is primarily attributed to its share buyback program. Over recent years, the amount of cash flow allocated for this purpose has continued to remain stable, and for the three months of 2023 ended June 30, 2023, the company repurchased approximately  371 million of its shares.At the same time, at the end of the second quarter of 2023, the remaining authorization to buy back Colgate-Palmolive shares amounted to . According to our assessment, this will partially minimize the impact of short sellers on the company s share price in the event of a continuation of the upward trend in inflation in the United States and a possible hike in the Fed interest rate at the end of 2023.Colgate-Palmolive is one of the world's largest consumer products companies, founded in 1806. Since then, the company, whose headquarters is located in New York, has gradually become a leader in the production of personal care and home care products, and its products are currently sold in almost every corner of our planet.Despite the company's margin growth, its share price is down more than 12  year-to-date, underperforming main competitors in the consumer staples sector, such as Church   Dwight  and Reckitt Benckiser Group .On the other hand, the main risks for Colgate-Palmolive's financial position are increased competition in the global beauty and personal care market, a significant increase in U.S. household debt, and a military conflict in the Middle East, which threatens stability in this region. Moreover, given the technical analysis, we believe that the price level at which the risk reward profile will be attractive is  67- 68 per share.We initiate our coverage of Colgate-Palmolive with an  outperform  rating for the next 12 months.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

First Foundation Inc. (FFWM) Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"First Foundation Inc.  Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 11 00 AM ETScott Kavanaugh - President and CEOJamie Britton - CFOChris Naghibi - COODavid Feaster - Raymond JamesAndrew Terrell - Stephens Inc.Adam Butler - Piper SandlerGary Tenner - D.A. DavidsonGreetings, and welcome to First Foundation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking today will be Scott Kavanaugh, First Foundation's President and Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Britton, First Foundation's Chief Financial Officer  and Chris Naghibi, Chief Operating Officer.Before I hand the call over to Scott, please note that management will make certain predictive statements today during today's call that reflect their current views and expectations about the company's performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release. In addition, some of the discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, please see the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Scott Kavanaugh.Howdy, howdy from Dallas, Texas. Thank you for joining us for today's third quarter 2023 earnings call. The turbulence that rocked the financial industry in the first quarter has largely abated across the entire banking sector. With stability normalizing, we dedicated the entirety of our third quarter to unwaveringly executing our strategic initiatives of improving our loan-to-deposit ratio, increasing overall loan yield, and improving the sensitivity of the loan portfolio against higher interest rates.Although we have made great strides in our achievements, thereAlthough there remains much uncertainty with the Fed's fight against inflation and the geopolitical events that recently transpired, management believes this is a troughing quarter for pretaxI'm exceptionally proud of the commitment and diligence exhibited by our entire team. From investment management, trust, banking deposits and lending, our team is dedicated to delivering exemplary results during what I believe to be the most challenging time I've experienced in my professional career. As we reflect upon the last quarter, we are delighted to report continued improvements in our loan-to-deposit ratio, increased average yields on our loan and securities portfolios, and improvements in our capital ratios.For the third quarter, we reported net income attributable to common shareholders of  2.2 million or  0.04 a share for both basic and diluted shares. Tangible book value, which is a non-GAAP measure, ended the quarter at  16.19, an increase of  0.07 from the  16.12 at June 30, 2023. Total revenues were  63.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.4  from the  61.1 million as of June 30, 2023. Net interest income increased to  52.1 million or by 6.3  as compared to the  49 million as of June 30, 2023. Non-interest income was  11.7 million for the quarter compared to  12.1 million as of June 30, 2023.Our net interest margin was 1.66  for the quarter as compared to 1.51  as of June 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 99.7  during the quarter as compared to 92.5  as of June 30, 2023. Our adjusted return on average assets, a non-GAAP measure, ended the quarter at 0.08 , down from the 0.11  reported as of June 30, 2023.Our loan-to-deposit ratio showed continued improvement, decreasing to 95.1  as of September 30, 2023, from the 97.9  as of June 30, 2023, and 108.4  from September 30, 2022. We remain committed to continuing to improve this ratio through a combination of strategically reducing lower-yielding loan balances and continuing to grow deposits. Our deposit pipeline remains robust as we look into the fourth quarter. We firmly believe that this favorable trend will continue.Related to operational efficiencies during the quarter, we have remained laser-focused on cost saving initiatives and proactively shrinking our loan balances. As you are aware, we are in the early -- that we were early in the making of extremely difficult decisions to reduce our workforce and terminate projects that were slated for completion. These deliberate actions and strategic decisions have been instrumental in controlling expenses and managing their impact on earnings. By diligently managing costs and streamlining our operations, we have been able to optimize our resources and capitalize on opportunities that support sustainable growth.Our deposits remained at  10.8 billion in the third quarter versus the second quarter, an increase from the  9.5 billion as of September 30, 2022. Core deposits totaled  8.1 billion for the third quarter. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 22  of total deposits as of September 30, 2023 compared to 25  and 37  as of June 30, 2023 and September 30 of 2022. Brokered deposits accounted for 24.6  of total deposits as of September 30, 2023 compared to 20.4  as of June 30, 2023. As I said, our deposit pipeline remains robust heading into the fourth quarter.Our branch network remains key to the success of our deposit strategy. Chris will discuss initiatives we have to expand our core deposits and our branch network. We also continue to see resilience in our digital banking channel. The platform has continued to serve as an invaluable source of new depository accounts, allowing us to expand our client base, both demographically and geographically across the country. With limited branches across the markets we serve, this product allows easy access to our clients in our markets as well as to digitally-forward prospects across the country.We recently completed an upgrade utilizing MANTL for our front-end opening process. Early indications have shown fairly significantly increased pull-through rates for account opening, while requiring less of our personnel's direct involvement. We are truly encouraged by this ongoing trend as it reinforces our commitment to providing accessible and convenient banking solutions to our valued clients.We have continued to improve our insured and collateralized deposits to approximately 87  of total deposits as of September 30, 2023 as compared to the 88  as of June 30, 2023. We maintained a strong liquidity position of approximately  4.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. Our liquidity to uninsured and uncollateralized deposits ratio was 3.1 times. Borrowings were  984 million as of September 30, 2023 as compared to  802 million and  1.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.I think it is interesting to note that the average borrowings for the quarter were  587 million for the quarter compared to the  1.7 billion for the prior quarter. The decrease in average borrowings was due to the continued paydown of additional borrowings which were used to increase on-balance sheet liquidity following the banking industry's events that occurred during the first quarter and into the second quarter. As the deposit levels have stabilized and begun to return to previous levels, some of the additional borrowings were paid down. During the quarter, we added an additional  800 million of term FHLB advances that were puttable. The average cost of borrowing was reduced by over 1  versus the overnight rate. Jamie will provide greater insight to our borrowing activity.Turning to loans, credit quality continues to serve as a crucial differentiator for First Foundation. Our non-performing assets to total assets were 0.1  as of September 30, 2023 as compared to 0.12  as of June 30, 2023. Loan balances were  10.3 billion, a reduction of  302 million for the quarter as compared to  10.6 billion for June 30, 2023. Chris will give a further breakdown of loan activity during the quarter.Looking at our Wealth Management and Trust businesses, although markets have remained volatile, FFA has seen strong performance and secured new client relationships throughout the quarter. First Foundation Advisors had  5 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2023. This is down  300 million from the  5.3 billion in AUM as of June 30, 2023. The decline was largely due to the volatility in the market. Trust assets under advisement ended the quarter at  1.2 billion as compared to the same in June 30, 2022. Margins for our fee-based divisions remained high, and our new client prospects remain promising for both advisory and trust services as we head into the fourth quarter.In the third quarter, I am pleased that CNBC and Barron's recognized First Foundation Advisors amongst the top wealth advisers in the country. Jamie will provide more detail on the Trust and Advisory businesses.I will close by reiterating my heartfelt appreciation for the incredible efforts and unwavering dedication of our entire team. It has been an undoubtedly challenging year, but their hard work and commitment have played an instrumental role in our continued success. We recognize that there are factors beyond our influence, including the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. However, we remain steadfast in focusing on the aspects of our business that we can control. And navigating through the ever-changing market conditions, our client-first mentality remains a foundation of our business and core franchise. Our commitment to our clients and their financial success has only strengthened over time. We proudly believe that by putting our clients' needs at the forefront, we can successfully navigate the challenges of the market and continue to thrive. Now I will turn the call over to Jamie to cover the financials in greater detail. JamieThank you, Scott, and good morning. Before continuing to discuss the quarter, I'd first like to say how excited I am to be joining First Foundation at such an important time for the company and the industry. Though unprecedented market volatility has presented challenges not faced in a generation, as our most recent results suggest, I believe we have the right team in place to weather the environment and emerge as an even stronger institution for our clients, our teams and our communities.I've been fortunate enough to spend time with many of our teammates over the past couple of months, and I've been nothing short of impressed. We have more work to do as we continue building on First Foundation's success, but I want to thank each of you for your commitment so far and say I look forward to working with you on the challenges and great opportunities we have ahead.Okay, moving back to the quarter, I'll start with the balance sheet and our net interest margin, which as Scott mentioned, improved 15 basis points from 1.51  in the second quarter to 1.66  in the third. This was influenced by several dynamics. Loan yields improved modestly, 4 basis points, as did yields on both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios, 76 basis points and 18 basis points, respectively. When coupled with the mix shift loans, these yield improvements drove a quarter-over-quarter increase of 5 basis points on our earning asset yield. Contributing to the 76-basis point improvement in the available-for-sale portfolios yield were new securities purchases,  400 million of which were short-dated U.S. treasuries. We also purchased some Ginnie Mae agency mortgage-backed securities, which helps to explain the difference between the available-for-sale portfolios period end and period average balances. The full quarter benefits of these purchases to our net interest margin will be captured in the fourth.We maintain a cautious posture amid recent volatility in the longer end of the curve, but we are open to taking advantage of opportunities to purchase high-quality securities at attractive yields should they present themselves. On the right-hand side of the balance sheet, net interest margin benefited from seasonal growth in our non-interest-bearing deposit portfolio, which I'll touch on more in a moment, and interest-bearing liability costs increasing by only 4 basis points despite the full quarter impact of the FOMC's 25-basis point increase in early May and the partial quarter impact of the most recent 25-basis point move here at the end of July.On the interest-bearing liabilities, continued increases in interest-bearing deposit costs from 3.72  in the second quarter to 4  this quarter were partially offset by not only by a reduction in average borrowings balances, some of which did move to broker deposits, but also by a decrease in the cost of borrowings, which decreased from 5.14  in the second quarter to 4.16  in the third. Our balance sheet remains liability sensitive, but to pull some of the benefit forward, we entered into additional puttable advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank. As Scott has described in the past, the FHLB retains the option to put these back to us once the lockout period is clear. But in the meantime, we can benefit from the market's expectations for rate reductions in the future. Since the new advances were added to the balance sheet after the midpoint of the third, as with the available for sale portfolio balance, average borrowings balances are expected to increase in the fourth.As I mentioned, the quarter's net interest margin improved in part due to the seasonal growth in our non-interest-bearing deposit portfolio. As we've discussed previously, a portion of this portfolio is from relationships receiving compensation through customer service costs, which increased  5.7 million or 30  quarter-over-quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, outside of market share capture or relationship growth, we fully expect seasonal trends to continue and balances to decline from period-end balances at September 30. Assuming a stable short-term rate environment, customer service costs will come down in lockstep with balances. This would benefit quarterly non-interest expense, but the mix back to interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the balances we will secure to replace the runoff, will weigh on the fourth quarter's net interest margin.Outside of this dynamic, which is an important one for the NIM and net interest income, we would expect a flat rate environment to maintain favorable momentum on other important factors. Loans exited the quarter with a September average yield of 4.75 , only 2 basis points above the quarterly average of 4.73 . But due to the yield improvements in the securities portfolio and in on-balance sheet cash, earning asset yields closed the quarter at 4.66  or 10 basis points above the quarterly 4.56  yield. Interest-bearing deposit rates averaged 4.03  in September as compared to a 4  average for the quarter and our 3.86  average in June.We are pleased with the balance sheet's improvements. Though we continue to manage concentrations in our loan portfolio, we grew the balance sheet by  211 million in the quarter from  12.8 billion in the second to  13.1 billion in the third as we took advantage of opportunities to improve our net -- our interest rate position and support near-term earnings. We will continue to monitor the rate environment for opportunities to shift the balance sheet to a more sustainable long-term interest rate risk profile and mitigate the earnings risk of future short-term rate increases.Moving to the income statement and net interest income, though we saw modest quarterly decrease in average earning assets, a 15-basis point lift in the net interest margin drove a  3.1 million or 6.3  increase in net interest income. A slight reduction in excess liquidity drove a modest  560,000 decrease in interest income, while the shift to non-interest-bearing deposit balances and the  600 million decline in interest-bearing liabilities overall provided a more impactful  3.7 million reduction in interest expense.Non-interest income declined by  381,000 this quarter from  12.1 million in the second to  11.7 million in the third. As Scott mentioned, we saw a quarterly decline in AUM, being income's primary source, which contributed to the reduced fee income. Market volatility and net withdrawals were factors in the quarterly results, but we are very pleased with FFA's performance. We continue to benefit from new accounts,  77 million this quarter, and businesses maintaining its efficiency and recent operating margin improvements.Outside of customer service costs, which I discussed before, other non-interest expense categories totaled  39.5 million for the quarter as compared to  38.5 million in the second quarter. Importantly, compensation and benefits, which declined by  1.4 million this quarter, was only  19.6 million as compared to  29.5 million in the third quarter of 2022. This is reflective of the very difficult decisions made earlier in the year, and as Scott mentioned, our recognition of the importance of remaining laser-focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling our discretionary costs as we regain operating leverage and long-term steady growth in net interest income.Moving finally to capital and liquidity, continued management of the loan portfolio led to a 22-basis point improvement in First Foundation's total risk-based capital ratio, which now stands at 11.98 . Our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio ended the third quarter at 7 , which is also in line with peer levels, but importantly, provides a relatively strong risk capital balance versus peer when considering first, our held-to-maturity portfolios' relatively favorable after-tax unrealized loss position of  75.2 million, which is only 8.2  of tangible equity, and only 58 basis points of tangible assets. And second, our strengthening liquidity position and relatively low levels of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, which proved to be the most vulnerable during the significant market turbulence we saw earlier in the year.Further on these points, insured and collateralized deposits represent more than 87  of total deposits. Cash and cash equivalents of  819 million represent 6.3  of total assets at September 30. And total available liquidity stands at  4.3 billion or 3.1 times our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. We are pleased with the stability we've achieved in our liquidity position. And when considering both pledged and unpledged securities are comfortable with the level of on-balance sheet liquidity we are holding today. We will continue to monitor for opportunities to improve our structural interest rate position, but we are confident in where we stand.Before turning it over to Chris to provide additional detail and color on our loan portfolio, our deposit portfolio, and the initiatives underway to expand our core deposits and strengthen our balance sheet position even further, I just want to say thank you again to our team and your commitment to our company. The work you've done this year has made a difference, and I look forward to supporting your continued success. ChrisThank you, Jamie. Good morning. As Jamie suggested, I will be talking to you today about lending, deposits, and a bit about our strategic direction. While we've seen a quarter with lower market volatility in the sector than in the previous two quarters, there is still much to be done. Last year, when interest rates started to rise, we originated more fixed-rate lending than we should have. Our goal is to continue to reduce that exposure and diversify into index plus margin-based pricing focused in conservatively underwritten C I lending, where we prioritize relationships. We have and continue to make great strides towards this end goal. All of our departments have worked together to manage the strategic direction of our diverse loan portfolio, which as of September 30, 2023, remains composed of 51  multifamily loans, down from its height of approximately 54  as of Q3 2022, 32  commercial business loans compared to approximately 30  as of Q3 of 2022, 9  consumer and single-family residence loans, 6  non-owner-occupied commercial real estate, and approximately 2  of land and construction loans.From an operational perspective, we have challenged our lending departments to evolve and adapt to the current climate. We have pivoted to focus on what supports both our clients and our operational health, maintaining a cautious yet proactive approach to growing with all eyes on asset quality. The loan yields Jamie referenced were the result of quarterly originations, 91  of which was in the C I lending space. Loan fundings comprised of primarily high-quality, adjustable rate C I, SBA, and mortgage lending totaled  245 million, offset by loan payoffs of  546 million in the quarter.Our goal is to continue to drive down our commercial real estate exposure and have a greater balance between fixed and variable rate lending. Over the near term, we are taking a cautious protectionary lending approach with our existing multifamily portfolio. On a long-term basis, we need to be and will be more diversified overall on all of our underlying assets. Ultimately, this will gradually increase the bank's CECL reserves as a more balanced portfolio will have a naturally increasing reserve.From a philosophical perspective, I want to highlight that we are a relationship-based bank, borne out of our synergies with our high net worth clients from our partners at First Foundation Advisors. We do not focus on transactions, but rather stickier and more robust relationships. Offering products like margin lines of credit on low leverage portfolios of assets under management can help deepen relationships with the platform while providing additional adjustable pricing and blunt fixed rate interest rate exposure in the portfolio, maintaining a low-risk credit profile.Regarding risk management, our achievement in maintaining high underwriting standards is not solely a credit risk measure, but a reflection of our organizational culture strength. It shows how deeply our teams understand and resonate with the principles that have always guided us in that we do not sacrifice credit quality. This discipline is why we have been able to reallocate internal talent from originating loans to assisting with portfolio management, asset quality review and an organic internal cross referral network. Looking at the breakdown of loans that we have originated so far year-to-date, the percentages are as follows, commercial business loans, 90 , multifamily, 2 , single family, 2  and other miscellaneous loans at approximately 6 . It is always worthwhile to reiterate the commercial business portfolio is diversified with no sector comprising more than third of the portfolio and only 12  of the portfolio exposed to commercial real estate.Our decision to temper fixed-rate lending, especially in the multifamily segment, should not suggest a lack of confidence in the asset class. In fact, now more than ever, workforce housing is in demand. There is a housing affordability crisis in the United States which cannot be ignored. The Housing Affordability Index just hit a new record low of 90. This means that housing affordability is down approximately 50  since 2021 alone. And since the peak in 2012, housing affordability is down nearly 70 . The cost of buying a home versus renting one is at its most extreme since at least 1996. The average monthly new mortgage payment is 52  higher than the average apartment rent according to CBRE analysis. The last time the measure looked this disconnected to wages was before the 2008 housing crash. Even then, the premium peaked at 33  in the second quarter of 2006.There is no state in the United States where housing affordability is worse than California, where seven of the 12 least affordable housing markets are found. California, a rent-controlled state, also happens to be where approximately 88  of our multifamily loans are located. As a reminder, having made a strategic decision years ago to be cautious of financing newly built properties, the bank has limited exposure to the Sunbelt region and even more limited exposure to high-end luxury apartment units. Newly built properties typically only have downside risk and are also generally less impacted by rent control in states like California. This shift illustrates more than a simple portfolio adjustment. It shows our agility, unity and shared vision with every team member contributing to a refined, collective, strong credit culture.Regarding our multifamily portfolio, its strength is evident in both its credit quality metrics and its low NPA ratio for the third quarter of 10 basis points as highlighted by Scott earlier. As you have come to expect, our underwriting remains staunchly conservative with weighted average LTVs of 55  for multifamily loans and 54  for single-family loans. Additionally, we are seeing the average duration of the portfolio continue to move downward just below three years, which would only further continue to support the repositioning efforts of the diversifying of its underlying assets.Our deposit growth, particularly in insured and collateralized deposits, mirrors our clients' trust. The proven high-level personal touch, combined with our strategic stance on rate adjustments, has fostered a deeper relationship with our clients, distinguishing us in the marketplace. Like our lending operations, we have a bifurcated strategic vision. Liquidity and funding have been the focus near term, while over the course of a longer term, we need to drive core funding back up, and we will do that.Now that funding appears to have stabilized, we are pivoting to a campaign where we aggressively look to grow core funding. This will allow us over time to drive down any overdependence on broker deposits and home loan bank advances.It is particularly important that we highlight the entire company's commitment to bolstering the growth of the bank's deposit franchise. From our First Foundation Advisors family to our Trust team, from in-branch tellers to the person that answers the phone when you call the digital branch, it is everyone's job to collaborate and champion the strength of what this platform can do. The breakdown of our deposits is as follows  money market and savings, 29 . Certificates of deposits, 28 , interest-bearing demand deposits 21 , non-interest-bearing demand deposits, 22 . Our deposits are diversified by geographic distribution with California accounting for 36  of total deposits, Florida at 17 , and Texas at 8 , which makes up the majority of our deposit portfolio with Nevada, Hawaii and other states making up 39  of the total.I'm also pleased to reiterate that our digital branches online account opening process has been completely overhauled to incorporate the latest in Plaid technology for seamless instant account opening and funding with real-time risk mitigation and fraud detection. Since its implementation on August 15, we have seen our application abandon rate drop from 53  to 23 , our completed applications grow from 63  to 94 , and our application approval rate increase from 46  to 66 . All of this was accomplished with a fully automated submission rate of 65 , meaning that no manual oversight was needed to create an account and instantly fund it.The second phase of this project will also be a rollout of the same technology into our physical branches, which should prove to create a best-in-class new account opening process, which will also be an elegant, fully digital solution. Additionally, our next focus will be partnering with our esteemed branch employees to aggressively grow our granular core retail deposit franchise, as I noted earlier. We will ask them to rise to the challenge of being the backbone of our institution because the growth of our retail channel is integral to our resilience and continued success. We will do this by empowering an outbound network of branch managers who will partner with the bank's product lines to visit clients frequently. The technology we have implemented, combined with refreshed policies and procedures and the careful elimination of redundancies have equipped our teams with the time they need to focus on client outreach. Simply put, we have empowered them to do what they do best, to get out and engage with the community.Before we move to questions, I'd like to take a moment to express my profound gratitude to every member of our team. From those in customer-facing roles to our back-office heroes, it is your commitment, mutual support, and shared aspirations that have not only steered us through recent challenges, but also fortified the very culture that makes us who we are. I will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of David Feaster with Raymond James. Your line is open.Hey, good morning, everybody. Hey, David. Good morning. Good morning. I was hoping maybe we could elaborate on some of the funding dynamics that you talked about, Jamie. On the shift in the deposit mix, maybe less reliance on some ECR deposits. Could you maybe just elaborate on that trade  And then maybe more broadly, glad to hear the deposit pipeline is strong. Curious just how you think about the deposit outlook. Obviously, there's a lot of dynamics that have been talked about here and initiatives, but just curious where you're having the most success immediately and maybe some of the timeline for that branch deposit initiative that you're working onSure. The changes in the third quarter, as I mentioned, primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits. We grew, as we typically have as the seasonal inflows increase to their peak, which usually occurs in October, the customer service costs increase in lockstep with those. But as I mentioned, as we moved into the fourth here, as payments go out to the municipalities for tax purposes and to the insurance companies for annual premiums, we would expect those to decline in the fourth and then start to rebuild again in the first. We moved some of our borrowings to broker deposits in the quarter as well. And as Chris mentioned, we are focusing on our deposit initiatives. Primary focus will be in the retail branches, and so I expect to see some continued growth in the coming year from all of our markets as we attempt to reduce the amount of time in-branch and get out to customers going forward. I'll let Chris speak to anything else on the early success or the longer-term timing of the initiatives.Yeah. David, good to hear your voice as always. The branch network has been what I would call one of the things that we need to really focus on more. It was a little under-focused on in the last several years, largely because we had some of the other initiatives going on. And one of the benefits we had to streamlining our focus, and I guess if you want to pull it out of the contagion period and some of the changes we've made, is we've been able to really focus on the things that we want to look at. The digital branches rollout of technology was a huge part of that, as you heard. But obviously, getting back to our core values with the relationship focus and bringing bankers with us when we go out on meetings is so imperative to our success. And I think that puts a face to the name. You get a lot of this collaboration, and I think that really helps bring in deposits. On the lending side, we've also helped enable that by requiring things like a deposit relationship on what would otherwise be transactional relationships. Operating accounts, primary banking relationships. It's really the first question that we ask when we think about the bigger picture of our client relationship and how they can mutually grow with us. We've also brought treasury management services downstream, and we're planning on growing with small businesses in the community that go into the middle market space if you will, that are growing into bigger spaces. And one of the things that we haven't been able to offer them in the past was treasury management services a la carte, which we've also focused on. All this to say, I expect the growth in the retail physical branches, as Jamie noted earlier as well, to continue to grow. We're really looking to start the culture and push aggressively now in the fourth quarter. I would expect to see the benefit of that starting Q11.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Terrell with Stephens. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Maybe just to start, I wanted to get a sense on the loan yield side, just how the new origination yield of 8.3 , how they compare with the yield on the payoffs and paydowns you saw this quarter  And then just how much in quarterly loan payoffs and paydowns you expect over the next 12 monthsMost of the payoffs that we saw during the quarter were also in the C I category, and so I would say that the loan payoffs were similar to what we saw in the new payment yields for C I. I believe --No. There was a pickup of something.We'll get back to you on that. But the answer was, I would say seasonally some of the multifamily loans or the lower-yielding loans. I would say the CPRs the last several months, there in the summer months, were slower. We're starting to see not significant but a bit of a pickup in terms of payoff requests. We think that will continue. And of course, as we look into the fourth quarter, the yields are still in that 8.30-8.40 range for the C I stuff that we've got going forward, which a lot of that is going to be tied to the deposit flows as well that we talk about when we talk about a pretty healthy pipeline of deposits.Yeah, that's kind of where I was going with it. It looked like the C I payoffs were kind of heavy this quarter. To the extent C I balances are more stable, and we see maybe a little pickup in the multifamily and single-family paydowns, you should see more tailwinds to loan yields in coming quarters. Is that fairYeah. If you look back at prior years, and of course, this one is different just in the sense that rates have risen a lot. But if you look at the prepayments or refinancing activity in multifamily, it's always been extremely slow heading into October. And it's usually around mid-October, November, December that you start to see activity in the multifamily pick back up. Plus, we've got an initiative that we're really working on right now to try to roll some of the lower coupon multifamily. That's starting to take root in terms of the repositioning of some of the lower yields on that multifamily. We've identified, I would say probably  300 million,  400 million of what we think are good assets to reposition and we're starting to reach out to those borrowers. And we're initially having good success in talking to those. But again, you won't see that activity until probably late November, December and heading into the first quarter.Great. I really appreciate all the color there, Scott. And then last one for me. I know the customer service cost expense can be a little difficult to model sometimes. Just hoping you can help us out with maybe what you're expecting in terms of customer service cost expense in the fourth quarterWhat I've tried to -- I think we've said it in prior years, and this year, I don't believe to be any different. There's usually somewhere around 20 , 25  of those MSR deposits that tend to flow out due to taxes and insurance payments. So, largely, like California, tax payments are coming up mid-November. You'll see a bulk of those deposits, which is what Jamie was talking about that tend to flow out. The fourth quarter typically has a decline in balances. The peak has ended in the third quarter. It's still -- I can tell you so far during the quarter, it's held pretty steady. But I don't believe this quarter is going to be any different in the sense that we should start to see seasonality pick up and some of those deposits be used for tax payments like I said. I would anticipate somewhere between 20  and 25  of those deposits to decline. And then, obviously, back in January, you'll start to see those balances build again.Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. I appreciate it. Yeah, you bet. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Butler with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.This is Adam on for Matthew Clark. Hi, Adam. I appreciate the commentary just now about the customers' service costs. If I could just tag along on the total expense number, I appreciate the disclosure of average FTEs down right around 20  in the third, during the third quarter. Just to get a sense, what is your appetite to cut more expenses going forward given just some of the headwindsWell, we'll continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiency for sure. We've already had three riffs, which as you can imagine, was pretty challenging, so we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce cost. But near term, I'd expect fourth quarter expenses ex customer service costs to remain at or around current levels from Q3. And then going forward, we'll continue to pivot as we can, depending on what happens with the rate environment and the balance sheet going forward. But at this point, we have no plans to do any future riffs, but we'll continue to focus on operating efficiency just as we always have. If you look at our non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets ex customer service costs relative to peer, we are a very efficient shop, and we pride ourselves on that, and we'll continue to do everything we can to maintain that or improve it going forward.Yeah. Adam, I would just add, as you can imagine with three riffs and as many layoffs that were experienced, as Jamie said, it was extremely tough. But that being said, we're running about as efficiently as we can   technical difficultyThere are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to Scott Kavanaugh for closing remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by. Technical difficulty  Thank you for standing by. Chris, you may resume your conference.Andrew  ph , I don't know if that answers your question. Are you still there  Essentially, the bottom line is that no more riffs and continue to improve cost efficiencies when and where we can. We've been looking pretty aggressively to look at everything across the platform from just a cost approach to make sure that we do the best we can. But that is going to be an ongoing process throughout the next year as much as it was for the first three quarters of this particular year.Okay. Can you guys hear me  I don't know if --Yeah, I can hear you.Okay. Great. And then just moving on to -- I don't know if this is something that you would elaborate on, but in the reconciliation table you called out  250,000 in professional service costs. I was just trying to get a sense for what that was for, if you would provide some comments on it.Yeah. I'll let Jamie speak to that when he gets back on. But it was  250,000, right  Yeah, so I'll let him speak to that when he joins the call back with Scott, but I'm sure that he has some commentary and some color on it. I'm not 100  updated on it.Sorry. I guess we got cut off somehow.There you go. Adam asked about the reconciliation table we have, there's a  250,000 customer service cost, and he wanted to know if there's any clarity we could provide.What are you talking aboutProfessional services.Give us just a second to get caught up. We were a little caught off guard that our phone somehow got cut off.It was related to driver.It's from the activist fees, Adam.Okay. Understood. And then just a housekeeping question. I was just wondering if you guys had a spot rate on either the interest-bearing or total cost of deposits as of the end of the quarter in SeptemberI do. The interest-bearing deposits averaged 4.03  in September.Okay, great. Those are all my questions. I appreciate the time. Thank you.You bet. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Thanks, good morning, guys. I wanted to just ask a follow up on the customer service-related deposit costs. And I wonder if you could elaborate more specifically on the amount of deposits that are subject to those or that drive that cost and maybe confirm the percentage of those maybe made up of MSR-related deposits, if it's not all of them.About  1.2 billion in total MSR deposits.And does that -- I mean, is there another -- is that just a percentage of the total deposits that drive that line  Or is there something else in the mix as wellYeah, Gary, this is Jamie. We also have 1031 and other clients in --Title, escrow.Yeah, and that's another  400 million or  500 million.Okay, great. Thank you. And then a question just on kind of the loan outlook as it relates to kind of the prospective runoff of multifamily say through 2024. Obviously, there's planned or scheduled amortization, then there would be some payoffs. But assuming an 8  to 10  decline in that book through 2024, is that reasonable  Or is there a large delta plus or minus to that do you thinkWe are going to work as hard as we can to keep those relationships, migrate them to market rates as they reset over the next year or two or three. We're hoping to expand relationships where we can as well to bring in operating accounts and other deposits. There could be some variability based on those efforts. But I think you're generally in the ballpark of what we'd expect for runoff if they chose to refinance elsewhere as their rate resets come due.Thanks very much. You bet. This concludes our Q A for today. I turn the call back to Scott Kavanaugh.Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for attending today's conference call. We look forward to seeing you in the fourth quarter earnings call as well. Thank you. Have a great remainder of your day.This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",36,2023-10-13T11:27:35.000-04:00
Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up  in the 2020s decade,  setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion  a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation .After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy  in 2018 . It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream  exploration, drilling, extraction , midstream  transportation, storage, refining , and downstream  retail sales and distribution  handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company  a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco , Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the  350-400 billion range, but declined to the  200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only  178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over  275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly  400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers   32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  15-20 billion range from 2015-2019  with a notable drop to  8 billion in 2016 , a disastrous decline to a loss of  22 billion in 2020, a return to form of  22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to  55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story   45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to  14 billion in 2020, and a rise to  48 billion and  67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P E ratio of  8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P E is 12x,  15  above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P B  price to book  and P Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25  and over 50  above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P S  price to sales  is slightly discounted at  10  below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument  the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oilTo start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources  see Lazard data referenced later , i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables  i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.  is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy  at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used , renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost  the one-time payment for the devices themselves  to generate power  the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF , Reeves Utility Income Trust , DNP Select Income Fund , Vanguard Utilities Index ETF . Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle  or virtuous cycle  stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply  meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity Energy  or  LCOE , essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced  for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,   opens in Excel .This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about   aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry . As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. ,  t he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,  and  renewables are set to account for over 90  of global electricity expansion  in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99  of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change  humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union  EU  legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA , are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause  fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is  designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing   emphasis added . In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries  this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists  however, an  of the law by  t he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks   emphasis added . While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear  ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31  increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities  i.e., choose renewables , and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common  They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism  not to be confused with partisan liberalism . By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC OPEC , which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness  this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation , The Phillips 66 Company , Sempra , ONEOK, Inc. , OGE Energy Corp. , Brooge Energy Ltd , WEC Energy Group, Inc. , White Energy Company Ltd , Magellan Midstream Partners , Sunoco LP , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. , Enbridge Inc. , TC Energy Corporation , TotalEnergies SE , , Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Corporation , Valero Energy Corporation , NuStar Energy LP , Ovintiv Inc. , Cenovus Energy Inc. , ConocoPhillips Company , Eni S.p.A. , , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Ring Energy Inc. , VAALCO Energy, Inc.  Occidental Petroleum Corporation , Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.  aka Petrobras  , Pampa Energía S.A. , , Callon Petroleum Company , Imperial Petroleum Inc. , NiSource, Inc. , Devon Energy Corporation , Energy Transfer LP , Ecopetrol S.A. , Vistra Corp. , The Williams Companies, Inc. , Canadian Natural Resources Limited , Koninklijke Vopak N.V. , , InPlay Oil Corp. , Inpex Corporation , , Shell plc , , Dominion Energy, Inc. , Duke Energy Corporation , Baker Hughes Company , Enterprise Products Partners L.P. , APA Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , Warrior Met Coal, Inc. , PBF Energy Inc. , and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. , , Ørsted A S , , Iberdrola S.A. , , ReNew Energy Global plc , Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. , Ocean Power Technologies , Tesla Inc. , Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. , Brookfield Renewable , , Freyr Battery , Array Technologies, Inc. , Nano One Materials Corp. , Novonix Ltd , , LiCycle Holdings Corp , Maxeon Solar Technologies , First Solar Inc. , Azure Power Global Ltd , Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A.  aka Eletrobrás  , Acciona, S.A. , Nextracker Inc. , AmmPower Corp. , Enphase Energy, Inc. , Fluence Energy, Inc. , and Vestas Wind Systems A S , , among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the  winners  in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time  they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets  e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline petrol station infrastructure, etc.  into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams  upstream, midstream, and downstream  in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach  carbon neutrality  or  net zero carbon emissions  by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example  a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing   expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours  of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5  in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99  dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. ,   to cut natural gas production by 40  and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its   page 14  is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by  advanc ing  other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies,   emphasis added .At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings  this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that  t hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately  17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions   and  help in  reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling     emphasis added . Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that  a ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with   emphasis added . This is in addition to the  sustained investment  in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels  notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis . Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited  appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves  their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share  in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB  solar, wind, and battery storage  System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figureUltimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Lithium Americas: This Is Ridiculous,"Having first wrote on Lithium Americas  in  I've been well aware of the utterly massive amount of lithium the company is sitting on in Nevada. Imagine my amusement when a recent article pointed out  LAC isYet, the last year has not been a good time if you were invested in the lithium market. Some companies are in purgatory  others are beaten to a pulp. Yet, a few lithium companies offer exceptional value -- potentially In this article we will cover one that I think fits the bill for a long-term value play, Lithium Americas. Before we get into the company splitting into two parts, let's review some amusing legal events.Having monitored the LAC legal cases for years, it has been a story of LAC winning again and again via state court  and also at the appeals court level . The prosecution's claims presented were rather silly or .Activists, having lost in court repeatedly, have decided to play new games --- games with . According to the new lawsuit filed in May by Lithium Americas, the activists have been engaged in  Stealing equipment, vandalization, unjustly profiting, unlawful drone operation, oppression, fraud, malice, and trespassing. According to the suit, these fall under the following countsCount 1 - Civil conspiracyCount II - NuisanceCount III - TrespassCount IV - Tortious Interference with Contractual RelationsCount V - Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic AdvantageCount VI - Unjust EnrichmentI find  Unjust Enrichment  one of the more interesting counts. Basically it is asking people for money to support illegal activity.Meanwhile, the defense is trying to make the claim that all of the above fall under the 1st amendment. While a person is well within their rights to protest, once it infringes on the rights of others, their rights end and the others begin.It would be very hard to prove that all of the above could not have been protested in a legal fashion elsewhere rather than on BLM land. Land that has been designated to LAC to have dominion over. This comes in conjunction with tribal agreements. The courts will decide on these new actions by the activists.A catalyst is simmering within Lithium Americas  One that has the potential to move the stock  one that few people are talking about. Simply put, the company will soon split into two public companies and once this occurs the door to the catalyst opens. More on this in a moment. First, we need to lay down a timeline of actions which must first occur.Things with China have been simmering for decades, but only in the last few years have things really started to warm up and not in a good way. Geopolitics and economics come into play. In response, the powers that be in the United States have put various economic speed bumps in the path of China, be it limiting access to semiconductor chip production or limiting the means of production via hindering China from obtaining necessary chemicals for the semiconductor manufacturing process. In response, China has threatened to ban various rare earth elements. Needless to say, it is not wise to be associated with China economically and unfortunately Lithium Americas has an association via China's in the South American . It should be noted that China also owns stock in LAC but  a controlling interest.To distance themselves, Lithium Americas will break into two public companies. Current shareholders will receive stock in both of the new publicly traded companies. North American operations will be called  Lithium Americas  while South American operations will be named  Lithium Argentina .This separation allows the China-dominated South American operation to go off on its own as a pure play. The North American operation is then free from the China-dominated South American operation and hence free from the geopolitical baggage that comes with it. With this, the powers that be are free to push for government loans for LAC for the Nevada project.Quite a few people have inquired what things will look like equity-wise after the company breaks into two parts. The answer is simple. Per the provided LAC chart, we can see that it will be an equal division. To make it simple, if you owned  1000 in LAC you would own  1000 total --- divided among both companies. This might look like share price X for LAC and share price Y for LAAC but the end result would be the same amount of equity. Do note the target of October 3 for the separation.LAC rough plan on what company finances look like per the August IR slide deckAnd Lithium ArgentinaWe can see the footprint and potential for expansion in Argentina is very large. Note the LAC projects in red, blue, and pink. The Cauchari-Olaroz project will be the first to spin up to full production and then a planned expansion will occur. Meanwhile, a feasibility study is ongoing for Pastos Grandes. The mental thought process one should engage in is  What does this look like in 5 or 10 years as projects come online and expand  I would venture it looks quite favorable.A reader  Kudos to user Crispix14  pointed this out and I think he is correct. It appears my initial math was incorrect concerning Thacker Pass. The numbers are . Thus I am updating this entire section. First updated will be interest rates and then potential funding.Getting back to North America, the split gives the Thacker Pass operation in Nevada the freedom to obtain U.S. government backing. While using old interviews I thought the loans would be 1  interest. This is incorrect.We can look  for Ioneer  loans to get a general idea of how it  structured. For Ioneer, the loan has a payback of 10 years and this comes in tranches  thus interest rates can change as new tranches payout . The tranches are tied to U.S. Treasury rates. We might assume starting out that this is a which is 4.438  as of this writing. However, maybe the DOE goes with a lower time period such as 1 year per tranche. A 1 year loan is currently 5.464  . Again this is just guesswork. I still have more research to conduct but this is the most accurate info I can provide at this moment.Moving on to funding. While LAC has funding from the automotive industry, they still need an utterly preposterous amount of capital to fund Thacker Pass. How much exactly  We can make some rough guesses based on the above.LAC Post Split will have roughly  336 million cash give or take a little. We can assume they might gain a small amount due to shipping product in South America. An additional  330 million is available from GM. Added together we get   666  million.Thacker Pass Phase 1 project cost is  2,268 million and this is where I am changing my math. Before I did a calculation based on  total project cost - cash on hand - GM capital   Y. Then Y times .55  to .75    X. This is where I might have errored. If t makes me think they will get a loan based up on total project cost. Per the PRClick to enlarge.andAssuming the loan is for the total project cost as noted in the PR, if this is the case, then . Before we get into all the numbers lets note the follow detail.Getting back on topic --- For comparison my old numbers were  If a 55  loan, then LAC    721 unfundedif a 75  loan, then LAC    401 unfunded. Let us run the new numbers to see how things look assuming total project of  2,268 cost times a loan. 2,268 total project cost x 55     1,247.42,268 -  1,247.4    1,020.6 left -  666  cash   potential GM investment     354.6 unfunded.Assuming a mere 55  loan, with the backing of GM and the government, additional doors can be opened to fund the required amount left over. Taking on debt or accessing the stock market can meet the funding gap.2,268 x 75     1,7012,268 -  1,701    567 -  666  cash   potential GM investment  99 million surplus.Assuming a 75  loan we can see LAC actually has a small surplus buffer. Meanwhile, Lithium Americas is pushing progress forward at Thacker Pass via prep work on the lithium mine location. Land is being cleared and pipe lines are being laid. After many unnecessary judicial delays it is very nice to see progress.ithium stocks have been under tremendous pressure over the past year. Many names have suffered  Standard Lithium , Century Lithium , to name a few. However, these names should benefit from massive government loans given time.Yet, one has to wonder if and when Lithium Americas receives a rather large loan will people once again look at lithium plays  Could that be a trigger to increase interest in the white metal  I think it is a possibility. Even Exxon  is getting into lithium via property that is near Standard Lithium in Arkansas.This generation of investors tend to have a tragic flaw of no patience and little ability to look long term. Ponder the picture below for a moment and ask  What does the future look like once Thacker Pass is operational and generating revenue  As previously discussed, LAC is sitting on a monster of a deposit but few recognize just how much land LAC has in the McDermitt Caldera. We can see Thacker Pass in the below graphic, but note all the blue areas of LAC land rights that extend all the way to the Oregon border.While land is nice, does it have lithium on it  The answer from the 2018 technical report from LAC is  yes.  Note the areas in red  shown below  are known zones of lithium. What we see are four possible areas to expand given time  and water needs . One might think of this as four additional Thacker Pass areas that might come about in the future.Investing in mining companies comes with extreme risk. A variety of factors can impact one's investment  Mining delays, equipment problems, funding issues, politics, environment challenges. You name it and when it comes to mining expect, if not demand, problems and delays. Lithium Americas is no different as it seems the South American project has been delayed to mid-2024.  We might as well add more delays into that estimation.The point is if you are investing in any mining company you need to have patience. An additional point of risk is the obvious  Interest rate raises, a choppy stock market in lithium, add raging inflation. These factors could impact EV adoption and lithium prices which in turn could impact project profitability. Yet these are short term concerns and will ebb and flow given time from periods of gloom and doom to euphoria and back again. Such is the cycle of investing.If Lithium Americas obtains a government loan the stock might react in a positive manner. Short term the company will split into two parts and each part will receive competent management from the existing LAC. This bodes well for each company. Right now LAC presents quite a value for the long term patient investor. However, macro issues are looming. Inflation still rages out of control. Interest rates continue to drift upward. Frankly put, the market is very choppy. Yet for the long term buy and hold investor, this stock might represent a ridiculous value play given the long-term EV outlook and political support worldwide.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

GDP Surprise Throws Predictions Out The Window," -  surprised to the upside this morning, at 4.9 , the strongest rate of growth in two years. Growth was led by Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE , as seen in our exclusive chart.The second largest component of growth was inventory buildups, accounted for under Gross Domestic  Private  Investment  GDIGovernment Consumption Expenditures  GCE  were the final increase to GDP as Net Exports  NEX  reduced GDP.Most of the GDP PCE growth seems to have come in the Summer months.  Note that the chart below, by which the Atlanta Fed keeps track of the GDP for its  GDP Now  estimates, includes data after September 30.PCE has cooled sinceOf the PCE spending, most was for services and, of those services, the greatest increases were - in order - for housing, healthcare, financial services, and food services and accommodations.Today's numbers certainly exceeded expectations, and substantially so. But the investors should concern themselves with its makeup and the heavy reliance on PCE.Consumer debt levels are, today, at their highest levels in , although debt, as a percentage of income, is just , which is not excessive, given history.  It was about 14  prior to the 2008 financial crisis.  But delinquencies are rising and are at the  since before the pandemic.As the Five Year bond  comes  danger close  to the 5  mark, investors should be wary of the ability of middle- and lower-income Americans to purchase consumer discretionaries at the same rate. Credit cards are being used more to counter inflation, and the supplemental pandemic cash many received is long gone.We expect interest rates to continue to escalate, but mostly on the longer end of maturity as the markets do much of the Fed's job for it. We have said for some time that the terminal rate will be in the neighborhood of 6 ,  - 50 bps. We're close to that now. But the Federal Reserve and the Biden Administration are working at cross-purposes  as the Fed raises rates and tightens quantitatively, the Biden Administration has added  to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, most recently in  accrued in a single month, according to the guys over atIn that environment, Bloomberg  that the old purchasers of Treasury Bills - governments, institutions, banks and the Fed itself - have been replaced by new purchasers of Treasurys - hedge funds, insurers, and pensions -While we anticipate higher rates, and credit standards tightening, we also expect profits in the consumer discretionary and durables sectors to fall. So, a downturn in both equities and bonds is likely into 2024.Some regional banks may also face the kind of challenge that Silicon Valley Bank et. al. faced earlier this year as bond yields increase and they incur unrealized losses on their bond portfolio.For the time being, modeling six months into the future is much more challenging as market behaviors  e.g., declining stocks and bonds  are currently anomalous. That said, we think a fourth quarter GDP in the range of 3   - 25 bps  is most likely. First quarter 2024 is too unpredictable to estimate at this time.

Veeva Systems Vaults Forward: The CRM Shift Ahead,"  provides cloud solutions for the life sciences sector, emphasizing customer success and regulatory adaptability. They offer tools for engagement and product development, ensuring compliance, and serve the consumer and chemical industries.In my  of Veeva  FQ2 Non-GAAP EPSThe following article discusses Veeva's Q2 earnings report, financial standing, and the migration of Veeva's cloud offerings from Salesforce to Vault CRM. At the end, a  Buy  recommendation is maintained.Looking at Veeva's most recent , the second quarter revenues reached  590.2M, a 10  increase year over year. Subscription services made up a significant portion at  470.6M, also up 10  from the previous year. Operating income rose by 3  to  104M, with non-GAAP operating income at  211.9M, marking a 5  growth. The company reported a net income of  111.6M, 23  higher than the prior year, with non-GAAP net income at  198M, a 19  rise. Additionally, Veeva projects revenues between  2,365M and  2,370M for fiscal year 2024, and anticipates at least  2,800M revenue for fiscal year 2025.Turning to Veeva's , as of July 31, 2023, the company has combined assets totaling  3.87B from 'Cash and cash equivalents'  742.6M , 'Short-term investments'  3.13B , with no listing for 'investments'. Over the most recent six-month period, Veeva generated positive net cash from operating activities amounting to  770.9M, averaging about  128.5M monthly.Assessing the company's liquidity, Veeva remains in a robust position, primarily driven by its considerable cash reserves and short-term investments. The company has total liabilities amounting to  1.08B, with no explicit mention of debt. Given its strong liquidity position and a minimal debt burden, should Veeva seek additional financing, its financial health would likely be attractive to potential investors or lenders. These observations and or estimates are my own and might vary from other analyses.According to Seeking Alpha data, Veeva is well-poised with an A- rating in earnings revisions and a B  for both growth and momentum. The company's valuation, while rated F, suggests it might be overvalued with an EV Sales of 12.54 and a forward P E of 42.12. The company's capital structure highlights an enterprise value of  27.30B with minimal debt compared to a substantial cash position, relative to its  30.86B market capitalization. Its stock shows positive momentum over the short term, despite trailing the S P 500 over a one-year period.Veeva has  its first Vault CRM customer win, a milestone reached in less than a year since revealing plans to shift its acclaimed Veeva CRM solution to the Veeva Vault Platform. By April 2024, Vault CRM will be the default for all new clients, offering the familiar functionalities of Veeva CRM, enhanced with new omnichannel features through the Vault CRM Service Center.Management's excitement about this development is evident, as they  the product's earlier-than-anticipated market adoption. This positive reception signals robust efforts from the product development team over the past year.Migration from Salesforce to Veeva Vault Platform has implicationsIn conclusion, Veeva, with its latest achievements and forecasted growth, remains a force to reckon with in the life sciences cloud solution sector. Its recent Q2 earnings solidified its financial strength, backed by an impressive balance sheet and commendable liquidity. While its valuation metrics hint at potential overvaluation, the company's robust projections for the upcoming years coupled with a sound capital structure paint a picture of a resilient and thriving enterprise.The significant and strategic pivot from Salesforce to the Veeva Vault Platform marks a pivotal moment in Veeva's journey. By lessening its reliance on Salesforce, the company stands to gain heightened control over its product offerings. This move, while bold, is rife with challenges. As the migration phase ensues, investors should keep a keen eye on how the firm manages potential technical challenges, adaptation issues for legacy Salesforce users, and the gradual transition that spans over a couple of years. It's crucial for Veeva to ensure that their customer experience remains unaffected during this phase. Yet, the long-term benefits, such as increased product control, innovative features, and potential cost savings, could solidify Veeva's position in the market further.In light of the recent developments and considering Veeva's proactive strategy towards self-reliance, I maintain a 'Buy' recommendation. The company's growth trajectory, coupled with its strategic decision to shift away from Salesforce, signals a proactive vision for the future. Despite the associated risks, if Veeva can execute this transition smoothly, it stands to gain not only in terms of product enhancement but also in financial robustness. Investors should remain alert to the company's quarterly reports to gauge the success of this transition, but as of now, Veeva's future appears promising.In recommending Veeva, potential risks I might have overlooked or underestimated include  This article is intended to provide informational content only and should not be construed as personalized investment advice with regard to  Buy Sell Hold Short Long  recommendations.

BDC Weekly Review: How A Rising Term Premium Will Impact BDCs,"Welcome to another installment of our BDC Market Weekly Review, where we discuss market activity in the Business Development Company  BDC  sector from both the bottom-up - highlighting individual news and events - as well as the top-down - providing an overview of the broader market.We also try to add some historical context as well as relevant themes that look to be driving the market or that investors ought to be mindful of. This update covers the period through the second week of October.BDCs were marginally up this week as markets whipsawed on geopolitical concerns and higher-than-expected inflation readings. Despite a positive week, the sector remains down around 2.5  on the month.Valuations have recovered slightly from the recent slide but stand around 5  below the recent peak.ManyWe can see this rise in the term premium a couple of different ways. One academic definition of the term premium shows that it's moved into positive territory and is not far off the top of the range.Perhaps a more intuitive definition of the term premium is simply the difference between 10Y and 2Y Treasury yields as shown below. This has risen as well but remains well below its longer-term range.What drives the term premium  A common answer is the debt load - the higher the debt, the higher the term premium investors require and vice-versa. US debt outstanding has been rising sharply over the past couple of years which has now been followed by a rising term premium.However, today's dynamic is unusual as, historically, the term premium behaved in the opposite way than we would expect - higher debt loads coincided with a falling term premium and vice-versa. This is likely because higher debt loads have been associated with recessions and during recessions inflation falls, giving investors more confidence in buying longer-dated bonds, while at the same time investors also seek safety in higher-quality assets, boosting demand for Treasuries.Rather, the historically down-trending term premium appeared to be driven by a stronger level of inflation anchoring due to increased Fed credibility and transparency. A subdued level of inflation volatility, until recently, has also helped as well as strong buying of US Treasuries by foreigners, particularly foreign central banks given an increase in global FX reserves.Foreign holdings as a share of America s national debt have now been on the decline, falling to around 27  while commercial banks have been sellers as well  BTFP has mitigated this somewhat  and the Fed itself is allowing Treasuries to roll off its balance sheet.Inflation volatility has jumped sharply though it appears to be slowing down once again. Fed's credibility has been dinged however long-term inflation expectations remain low, suggesting that inflation remains well anchored across markets and the sharp hawkish turn by the Fed has helped shore up its inflation-fighting credentials.Overall, the term premium will likely remain elevated and higher than what we saw in the decade preceding COVID, however, two of the three pillars remain mostly in place which suggests that the term premium is unlikely to move back to the top of its multi-decade range.The most direct impact of an elevated term premium on BDCs is through their cost of debt. Many BDCs were able to refinance their fixed-rate bonds in 2021 at, what now look like, incredibly low levels. This was because both Treasury yields and credit spreads were both very low in 2021.For example, BXSL issued 5 bonds in just over 14 months starting in July 2020 at coupons that are miles below today's Treasury yields, locking in an amazing net interest margin for years.One of these bonds already rolled off in July and others will follow in subsequent years. Unless rates collapse from here this means that many BDCs will be refinancing bonds with coupons of 2-3  to bonds with coupons of 6.5 , in effect more than doubling their cost of funding on each issue.Some BDCs, like BXSL, have longer-term debt than others so those will be better off for a while however after 2-3 years nearly all will be forced to refinance the majority of their low-coupon bonds.BDCs will have an option whether to refinance with 3-5 year bonds or whether to borrow via a floating-rate credit facility and that will depend on the shape of the yield curve - a very upward sloping curve will push many to use the credit facility over issuing bonds. This might make more sense as a credit facility has a lower credit spread, being secured and shorter-term, and can be terminated in short order whereas a bond, even a callable one, can sit on the balance sheet for years.Overall, a higher cost of debt is almost inevitable and this will create a headwind to BDC net income over the coming years.BDC Saratoga Investment Corp  is reporting early results in the sector. Recall that SAR doesn't follow typical calendar quarters but quarters that are shifted by one month from nearly all other BDCs.The NAV fell marginally as retained income mostly offset unrealized depreciation  which was around 1 . Non-accruals rose to 2 from 1  out of 55 portfolio companies  and stand at 1.6  on fair-value   4.5  on cost.Overall, it was a good quarter from the company and, while anecdotal, suggests that the sector should deliver decent Q3 results. While borrowers are feeling some pain from high base rates, so long as the economy hums along, sector portfolio quality should remain stable overall.BDC Main Street  said that in Q3 it originated  107m of new commitments and funded  137m of investments. The larger fundings figure reflects commitments made prior to Q3 and funded only in Q3. This compares fairly well against fundings of  148m in Q2 and just  44m in Q1.All of this suggests that the lending market is fairly favorable - borrowers aren t too scared to borrow, repayments aren t falling off a cliff and lenders have the confidence to put money to work.BDCs have remained relatively expensive in aggregate over the past couple of months so our focus has been more on modestly downshifting exposure and looking out for relative value opportunities. The upcoming Q3 earning results period is likely to lead to additional volatility in the sector with more opportunities opening up for investors.Check out  and explore our , engineered with both yield and risk management considerations.

RTX Corp.: I'm So Bullish It Hurts,"On October 12, I wrote an  titled . In that article, I discussed my move to buy more Northrop Grumman  stocks and my dedication to overweightSince last week, four of my top five holdings are defense companies, accounting for 26.8  of my total portfolio. In other words, I did put my money where my mouth is.One of my largest defense holdings is the , formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, which is the result of a 2020 merger between United Technologies and Raytheon.The company was one of the first holdings of my new dividend portfolio. I used the pandemic to aggressively buy this aerospace stock. After all, it's my only defense holding with significant commercial exposure. Roughly half ofThis year, I was able to step things up, as the market presented us with terrific buying opportunities.While I am writing this, RTX shares are down 27  year-to-date, trading 30  below their all-time highThis is an abysmal performance. The S P 500 is up 12.8  year-to-dateAfter shares peaked in 2022 due to slower global growth expectations  in general , the real trouble started when the company announced its 2Q23 earnings.While the earnings were strong, showing a significant rebound in commercial demand and higher defense orders, the company announced that it had found major issues in its commercial engine segment, run by its Pratt   Whitney segment.That was also when I decided to use this opportunity to throw more cash at a company that, I believe, will turn into one of my biggest long-term winners. Both from a total return and dividend growth perspective.Since then, the stock has lost another 15 , as RTX has made everything public. In a special investor call, it explained the cost it would have to deal with and why this would ruin its initial outlook.The good news is that the problems aren't likely to impact the company's long-term growth outlook or any of its relationships with Airbus and Boeing.While I cannot sugarcoat what has happened, this article aims to explain why I believe that RTX provides significant long-term value for dividend growth investors.Whenever I write articles that involve major issues at companies that are very important to my portfolio, I can honestly say that I am not biased. I know that defending poor choices will only cost me money in the long term.The good thing is that I'm convinced that aggressively adding to RTX was one of the smartest moves I made this year.That said, in the aforementioned Northrop article, I was asked how I would rank the largest defense contractors in the United States. Please note that I had to add Lockheed Martin  manually to the screenshot, as I forgot to include it in my original answer.Also, I want to quickly use this opportunity to thank all of my frequent readers and commenters for providing so much food for thought for myself and everyone engaging in interesting discussionsMy decision to put RTX so high is based on two things.Essentially, RTX needs to recall some of its key products, resulting in a massive short-term financial impact.On July 25, during its earnings call, the company mentioned that due to rare conditions in powdered metal, it had to accelerate maintenance for some of its commercial engines.Less than two months later, on September 11, the company held a special call to put all findings on the table, explaining to investors what was going on so investors and analysts knew what was going on.CEO Gregory Hayes addressed the root cause of the issue, describing it as a manufacturing escape involving contaminated powdered metal. He explained that a contaminant made it into the powder during a capacity ramp-up in late 2015. The issue was due to microscopic elements that inspection techniques couldn't detect.They've since introduced an angle scan inspection to identify these anomalies and have made process changes to ensure powder purity.The company estimates a potential expenditure of up to  7 billion for engine repairs and compensations to airlines. This comes as over 600 Airbus jets will be grounded for inspections in 2024 due to the identified problems.As investors expected going into the special call, the suspected contamination of metal in certain engine parts makes an accelerated inspection and grounding of planes very important, creating a strain on the availability of fuel-efficient engines.RTX is set to remove and inspect approximately 600 to 700 Pratt engines within the next three years due to the powdered metal-related issue. The inspection is expected to occur primarily within this year and the early part of the next year.While this issue is already bad, The Wall Street Journal  that it comes on top of some issues that have pressured the company since 2015.Pratt   Whitney's Geared Turbofan  GTF  engine has required more maintenance than initially anticipated since its introduction in 2015, particularly in hot climates such as India and the Middle East.This is impacting planes like the Airbus A320neo. 40  of these planes are powered by P W engines. The rest use Leap models from a joint venture between General Electric  and Safran , which also have some .RTX expects that 350 Airbus jets will be grounded over the next three years  annually  for accelerated GTF engine expectations.However, for airline passengers, there is no reason to be worried. It's completely safe to fly with operating GTF or Leap engines. Neither RTX nor any of its customers are taking any risks that could even remotely endanger the safety of its many passengers.Also, as the data below shows, these issues do not impact revenue growth. It mainly impacts cash due to costs related to maintenance.Organic growth is expected to remain extremely strong, with an expected growth range between 9  and 10 .With regard to the company's longer-term outlook, the company initially expected to generate  9 billion in free cash flow in 2025. That number has been its target since its mega-merger.Now, it has adjusted this number by  1.5 billion to  7.5 billion.Despite this, the company remains committed to its capital return commitment of  33 to  35 billion through the end of 2025Furthermore, during the call, the company emphasized that it expects to be done with the majority of costs before the end of 2025. After that, RTX is in a great spot to return back to normal.The company is also continuing the production and delivery of new GTF engines for customers and does not see major interruptions for airlines as a result of its GTF issue.RTX will also continue to benefit from ongoing tailwinds in other areas - after all, P W is just one part of a massive business that now has close to  190 billion in backlog ordersThis backlog comes with a 1.34x book-to-bill ratio, meaning for every dollar in finished products, it gets  1.34 in new orders, boosted by a strong global aerospace recovery and new geopolitical challenges like the war in Ukraine.Unfortunately, we can add the war in Israel to this list, which recently was triggered by horrendous terror attacks.In light of ongoing tailwinds, UBS made the case that aerospace companies will likely enjoy higher growth due to recovering demand.As reported by  also came with positive comments. In this case, aimed at defense companiesEven in the current environment of bad GTF news, analysts expect the company to maintain mid-single-digit annual EBITDA growth and 12  average annual free cash flow growth in the 2023-2025 period.It is also important to mention that analysts expect to see  6.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow. The company is guiding for  7.5 billion, as I briefly discussed.I believe that's a good thing, as the market has priced in a lot of bad newsThe market is so bearish that it has made RTX the  in the industrial sector, going into 3Q23 earningsRTX will report its third-quarter earnings on October 24, 2023, before the market opens.Analysts are looking for  1.19 in EPS, which is based on .While I do not invest based on short-term expectations, I'm very bullish about the upcoming earnings.If the company comes out with bullish comments, I have no doubt that investors could reward it with a steep surge in its market cap.The downside is that RTX reveals new issues related to its GTF problems. While I do not expect that to happen, it's the biggest potential factor that could cause a sell-off after earnings.It also helps that RTX is attractively valued.Based on the aforementioned EBITDA and free cash flow growth expectations, RTX is trading at just 9.5x 2025E EBITDA.Applying a conservative multiple of 12.5x EBITDA would result in a fair price of  96, which is 31  above the current price.This is based on a net leverage ratio of 2.5x, which includes pension liabilities and minority interest. The company has a BBB  credit rating, which is one step below the A-range.When using earnings estimates and a return to a normal valuation, we could even make the case that RTX has the potential to return 27  annually through 2025  this number is visible in the chart belowAs we can see in the chart belowWhile I am not going to promise that RTX will return 27  per year through 2027, this data shows that the company has a terrific valuation, which is why I've been buying so aggressively.It also needs to be said that RTX has a 3.2  dividend yieldThis dividend is backed by a 45  payout ratio, a BBB  credit rating, and high expected future growth.When adding that a potential  7.5 billion 2025 free cash flow result indicates a 7  free cash flow yield, investors are in for strong future dividend growth and buybacks.For now, however, I expect dividend growth to remain subdued due to cash outflows related to the GTF issues.But that's OK. After all, we now get to buy RTX with a 3.2  yield.Having said all of this, RTX is one of my highest-conviction investments.In a turbulent market, I doubled down on Raytheon Technologies, and here's why  While the company faced significant setbacks with its GTF engines, I firmly believe that it remains a compelling long-term investment.RTX's combination of top-tier defense and commercial capabilities sets the stage for robust free cash flow growth, supporting dividends and innovation.Despite short-term financial strain due to engine issues, the company's revenue growth remains solid. RTX is committed to maintaining its capital return pledge through 2025.The market's pessimism and overcrowded short position present an attractive entry point, especially considering the company's attractive valuation.With the potential for 27  annual returns through 2025, RTX offers a bright outlook.Furthermore, the 3.2  dividend yield, supported by a low payout ratio, solid credit rating, and future growth prospects, makes RTX a compelling choice.While near-term dividend growth may be tempered, long-term investors could see substantial long-term returns, making RTX one of my highest-conviction investments.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Teekay Tankers: A 'Hold' Amidst Rising Tides,"Navigating the volatile shipping industry requires a careful balance of risk and reward. Teekay Tankers  has shown strong financial performance, but current market conditions and increasing environmental regulations present significant risks. High ship prices and potential regulatory compliance costs, particularlyTherefore, our current stance on TNK is 'hold'. We recommend waiting for strategic fleet reinvestment at favorable prices before considering a more aggressive position.In the second quarter of 2023, Teekay Tankers reported a GAAP net income of  151.2 million. This figure was accompanied by an adjusted net income of  149.4 million. These numbers, while robust, were slightly lower than the financial results from the first quarter of the same year. In Q1 2023, Teekay Tankers had announced a GAAP net income of  169.4 million and an adjusted net income of  174.9 million, indicating a slight decrease in theTeekay Tankers operates with a well-defined financial strategy. The company's free cash flow breakeven point stands at  16,000 per ship per day. They project for every increase of  5,000 above this breakeven point, Teekay Tankers generates an extra  2.60 per share in free cash flow.Looking ahead to the third quarter, Teekay Tankers is in a strong position. The company has already secured between 52  and 56  of its spot ship days at an average daily rate ranging from  42,800 to  48,300. This strong booking rate indicates that the company's earnings are likely to remain robust through the fall and winter.This positive outlook is further supported by broader market trends. As highlighted in  on STNG, the demand for oil tankers continues to rise. This demand is growing at a rate that is outpacing the ability of shipyards to construct new vessels. With most shipyards operating at full capacity, existing oil tankers are likely to remain in service for longer periods. This extended service life, coupled with the high demand, means that these vessels are likely to command higher values in the marketplace.In July 2023, Teekay Tankers showcased its strategic approach to fleet management and capital allocation by exercising purchase options on four vessels under existing sale-leaseback arrangements. This move, amounting to a total of  57.2 million, is part of a broader strategy to optimize the company's fleet and financial resources. The vessels are expected to be purchased using the company's available cash reserves and subsequently refinanced under a previously announced  350 million revolving credit facility that covers 19 vessels. This refinancing is set to take place when the vessels are redelivered in the third quarter of 2023.This strategic move is part of a broader financial strategy that has significantly improved the company's net debt position. From the fourth quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2023, Teekay Tankers managed to reduce its net debt from  345 million to a mere  28 million. This drastic reduction in debt has not only improved the company's balance sheet but also reduced its financial leverage, positioning it favorably for the next phase of its strategic plan.Teekay has made a concerted effort to allocate a significant portion of its cash flow towards debt prepayment. Of the  370 million in cash flow generated during the last 6 months, a substantial  307 million, or 83 , was directed towards debt payoff. This aggressive approach to debt reduction underscores the company's commitment to strengthening its financial position.The remaining cash flow was also strategically allocated. A total of  42.5 million, or 11  of the cash flows, was distributed as dividends, demonstrating the company's commitment to providing returns to its shareholders.Teekay Tankers is now at a pivotal point where fleet reinvestment has become a strategic necessity. The majority of their vessels, all constructed before 2013, are nearing the end of their typical operational lifespan. This aging fleet, while still functional, may not be able to keep pace with the evolving demands of the shipping industry, particularly in terms of fuel efficiency, environmental standards, and insurance companies ability to insure them.Teekay Tankers' recent financial maneuvers, including aggressive debt reduction and building a strong cash reserve, have positioned the company well for this reinvestment strategy. With a significantly deleveraged balance sheet, the company has the financial flexibility to invest in a new fleet. We expect CAPEX to eat in to FCF over the next few years despite strong tailwinds.As Teekay Tankers embarks on its strategic path of fleet reinvestment, it's crucial to acknowledge and prepare for the potential risks associated with this strategy.A significant risk stems from the current market dynamics. The oil shipping industry is currently experiencing elevated spot rates, which have consequently increased the value of ships. This, coupled with a scarcity of shipyard space both now and in the foreseeable future, is likely to push ship prices even higher. If these spot rates were to unexpectedly plummet, Teekay Tankers could potentially face a situation where it has overpaid for vessels. This could put a strain on the company's financial resources and prolong the period needed to realize a return on these investments.The company's existing fleet, largely composed of older vessels, presents another set of challenges. As these vessels age further, they may not meet the evolving environmental standards and could face increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. This could limit their operational use and potentially lead to higher costs associated with compliance and retrofitting. Moreover, insurance premiums for older vessels can be higher, and certain types of coverage may become increasingly difficult to secure, leading to increased operational costs.Furthermore, the shipping industry is subject to the cyclical nature of global trade and is sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices and geopolitical events. These factors can cause volatility in demand for tanker services and impact spot and charter rates. Any significant changes in these areas could affect Teekay Tankers' revenue and profitability.Lastly, the process of fleet reinvestment itself is complex and time-consuming, involving negotiations, inspections, and regulatory approvals. Any delays or complications in this process could impact the company's operational efficiency and financial performance.As investors, our primary objective is to identify companies that offer a favorable balance of returns and risk. Teekay Tankers has demonstrated strong performance in the shipping sector, particularly with its impressive balance sheet management. However, several factors prompt us to exercise caution.TNK's fleet, largely composed of older vessels, is a concern. The age of the fleet impacts operational efficiency and compliance with environmental regulations, which are becoming increasingly stringent. The company's ability to compete effectively in the industry could be compromised if it doesn't modernize its fleet in a timely manner.Not helping matters at all, the current elevated ship prices, driven by high spot rates and a shortage of shipyard space, pose a significant risk. If TNK purchases new vessels at these inflated prices and the market turns around, it could strain the company's financial resources and extend the time required to achieve a return on these investments.In addition to that, environmental legislation is another factor that could impact TNK's operations. The shipping industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, and companies with older fleets are likely to face higher costs to comply with new regulations.While we believe in TNK's potential to continue its success from a cash flow perspective, we also recognize that the current risks may outweigh the potential rewards. In the context of a spread trade, TNK could serve as a good counterbalance to stronger performers like  .Therefore, our current recommendation for TNK is a 'hold'. We advise waiting for evidence of strategic fleet reinvestment at favorable prices before considering a more aggressive investment stance. This approach allows us to manage risk while keeping an eye on the potential for future growth. We will continue to keep them on our radar.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

AMD's Consolidation Presents Strong Price Development (Technical Analysis),"  is scheduled to  for Q3 2023 post-market on October 31, 2023. While the company anticipates growth in both revenue and earnings due to robust product demand, there are heightened risks stemmingIn , AMD delivered commendable revenue figures, further cementing its pivotal position in the semiconductor sector. Even with an operating deficit, the company's financial results were noteworthy, particularly from a non-GAAP perspective. This piece picks up from my , offering an updated snapshot and highlighting potential investment avenues for long-term investors. Notably, the stock price has held its ground, and its consolidation at crucial thresholds suggests a bullish price development.In Q2 2023, AMD reported a  of  5.4 billion, marking a notable presence in the semiconductor industry. Their official releaseDr. Lisa Su, AMD's Chair and CEO, emphasized the significant ramping up of 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors. A massive increase was observed in AI engagements, with a seven-fold rise during this quarter alone. This was attributed to customers initiating or expanding their programs, primarily supporting the future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. The company is also gearing up for the launch and ramp-up of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Segment-wise, the Data Center segment revenue came in at  1.3 billion, a decline of 11  YoY, yet a sequential increase of 2 . Despite facing a drop of 54  YoY due to a weaker PC market and supply chain inventory corrections, the Client segment managed a sequential growth of 35 . Moreover, the Gaming segment faced a 4  YoY decline, with its revenue being  1.6 billion. In contrast, the Embedded segment saw an uplifting 16  YoY increase, totaling a revenue of  1.5 billion.Significant events and strategic movements also marked Q2 2023. At the Data Center and AI Technology Premier event, AMD unveiled two new 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors optimized for different workloads. Some of the event's other highlights were partnerships with industry leaders such as Hugging Face and PyTorch and robust networking portfolios. Cloud giants like AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft Azure, and OCI embraced 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors for new instances. Gaming and commercial PC users also have new products to look forward to, with the introduction of the Ryzen Z1 Series processors and the Radeon  RX 7600 graphics card.Strategically, AMD is set to invest  135 million to amplify its adaptive computing research in Ireland, targeting next-gen AI, data centers, and 6G communication infrastructure. Finally, the appointment of Phil Guido as the chief commercial officer, coming from a 30-year tenure at IBM, promises to bring in fresh strategic insights for AMD's global operations.AMD is scheduled to announce the Q3 2023 earnings on 31 October 2023. For Q3 2023, AMD expects growth in both revenue and earnings owing to solid demand for its products. The revenue is expected to hover around the  5.7 billion mark, with a potential variation of  300 million. Additionally, the company projects its non-GAAP gross margin to be close to 51 . Surpassing these expectations with positive results could significantly boost AMD's stock price.In the previous article, a deep dive was taken into the pronounced bullish trends observed in yearly and quarterly charts. The article emphasized how the notable downturn of 2022 was counteracted by strong bullish formations, suggesting a potential rise in momentum. This steep decline in 2022 can be traced back to the wick on 2021's yearly candle. Further insights from the quarterly charts revealed a pronounced breakout from the 38.2  Fibonacci retracement mark at  102.25. This threshold was pivotal for bullish momentum, and a second consecutive quarterly close above it only solidified this perspective.Additionally, the critical reversal candle touching a low of  54.57, backed by staunch support at the 61.8  Fibonacci retracement of  63.83, suggests that the bottom was hit, and an upward trajectory was expected. The weekly chart corroborated this bullish view, showcasing a completed inverted head and shoulders and a descending broadening wedge. It's also worth noting that any monthly close below  102.25 could hint at further declines. Yet, with September 2023 closing at  102.82, the market seems to maintain its bullish stance. To sum it up, the prior article posited that the price adjustment in AMD offers a prime buying opportunity for long-term investors.As previously discussed, AMD has held its pivotal levels and now exhibits a more bullish trajectory. The monthly chart below showcases the long-term foundational development from 2001 to 2019. This robust foundation was surpassed in 2019, marked by the red trendline, which served as the bullish base's neckline. Leading up to this breakthrough, the price had carved an ascending broadening wedge delineated by the blue trendlines. When these patterns were surmounted, the stock witnessed a significant upward movement.Several factors fueled this surge. At the forefront, AMD experienced a surge in demand for its Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, allowing it to snatch market shares from its rivals in desktop and data center domains. These products' standout performance and efficiency branded AMD as a potent contender against established market leaders. Furthermore, the global semiconductor landscape saw a general uptick, propelled by the digital revolution during COVID-19, growing cloud computing needs, and the increasing integration of electronics across industries. AMD's strategic alliances, relentless innovation, and successful roadmap implementation amplified investor trust, reflected in the stock's impressive performance during this period.Nevertheless, as highlighted in the previous discussion, the market's robust correction halted at  54.56. This bounce-back is a positive sign, hinting at a potential upward journey. Moreover, the RSI on the monthly chart is comfortably above 50.Conversely, the updated weekly chart highlights the stock's challenge in sustaining above the blue trendline. The pullback from the peak of  132.83 is attributed to fulfilling the descending broadening wedge pattern's target. Additionally, the RSI has edged above its midpoint, suggesting potential support at this crucial level.Moreover, the latest market pullback is better visualized on the subsequent weekly chart. It reveals a correction from  132.83 that has formed a bull flag pattern. A breach above  125 could potentially trigger a significant upward rally. The observation underlines the bullish stance for AMD, reinforced by a pronounced inverted head and shoulders pattern with the head at  54.57 and shoulders at  71.60 and  81.02, combined with the emerging bullish flag.Investors may consider increasing long positions at the present rates, given that the consolidation at critical levels, coupled with the appearance of a bull flag and inverted head and shoulders, signals an upward momentum.Various factors, including global supply chain dynamics and inventory adjustments, threaten AMD's performance and stability. The notable 54  YoY drop in the Client segment due to a struggling PC market and supply chain inventory changes underscores this vulnerability. While the company has shown the capability to manage certain industry pitfalls, continued disruptions or any imbalance between supply and demand can jeopardize its revenue, profit margins, and its place in the competitive landscape.External macroeconomic factors, such as potential economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, and unexpected global incidents, can further unsettle AMD's operations and stock value. The competitive landscape is also challenging, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Intel's earnings. Underperformance against these market expectations, especially in critical areas like data centers or client sales, can cause significant stock price fluctuations. Additionally, the possibility of competitors introducing groundbreaking technologies or aggressive pricing strategies remains a consistent threat to AMD's market dominance. On a technical note, if the stock closes below  102.25 in a month, it could drop to  63.82, but a monthly close beneath  63.83 would challenge the long-term optimistic forecast.AMD displayed a robust revenue performance in Q2 2023, asserting its prominence in the semiconductor sector. While the company faced particular challenges, such as an operating loss, its non-GAAP figures and continued growth under Dr. Lisa Su's leadership spotlight its potential and adaptability. The introduction of the latest EPYC and Ryzen processors, coupled with a significant rise in AI engagements, underscores AMD's forward momentum. Various segments within the company showed mixed results, with major product releases and strategic partnerships further enhancing the company's market position. AMD's upcoming investment in Ireland showcases its commitment to pioneering advancements in adaptive computing. However, the future brings both optimistic projections and uncertainties due to broader economic influences.From a technical standpoint, AMD displays a robust bullish trend through pronounced price patterns. The appearance of the inverted head and shoulders combined with the bull flag formation bolsters the bullish argument presented in the previous article. As a result, investors might think about increasing long positions to capitalize on the potential upward surge. AMD is set to reveal its Q3 2023 earnings in a few days, which could catalyze AMD's next significant movement.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

We believe these measures are the proof point of our willingness and ability to take action to better position the bank for success, both now and in the future while building long-term shareholder value.These actions were, first, in our Q1 '23 quarterly earnings comments, we announced our intent to undertake structural expense reductions when deposit costs rose faster than expected in order to maintain positive operating leverage. We did what we said we would do, and announced an expense reduction program in June that is expected to reduce the annual expense run rate by approximately  17 million and had all measures implemented by July.Second, concurrent with Q2 '23 earnings, we announced our entry into a merger agreement to acquire Danville Virginia-based American National Bankshares in an all-stock transaction. We believe this transaction will improve AUB's financial performance, further build out our franchise in a way that keeps us dense and compact, open contiguous expansion markets in North Carolina and further drive the scarcity value of our franchise.The initial feedback from the community and American National clients has been strongly positive, and we believe we are on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2024. We remain excited about what we'll do together with the American National team once the merger is completed.Third, we've now acted twice this year to reposition our balance sheet for a higher for longer interest rate environment. We undertook the second action in the third quarter by pairing a sale-leaseback of 27 properties with our restructuring of a portion of our securities portfolio. This enabled us to unlock equity in certain owned real estate assets and use that to restructure certain available-for-sale securities and a capital-neutral transaction.Rob will have more details on the transaction, which was immediately accretive to our earnings, and is anticipated to have a greater impact in the fourth quarter, now that the proceeds have been reinvested into higher-yielding securities in our available-for-sale portfolio.All these actions were strategic in nature with anticipated benefits in both the near-term and long-term. We will go into our quarterly results and our financial performance in a few minutes, but broadly we saw impressive customer deposit growth, which more than funded our loan growth during the quarter, better than expected loan growth in the normally seasonally slow third quarter, a decline in operating expenses, demonstrating the initial benefits of our expense actions, modest net interest margin compression and negligible charge-offs, all of this indicates that our franchise remains healthy, strong, and resilient.We see our financial results this quarter as another confirmation of our long-term strategy of being a diversified traditional full-service bank, that makes a positive difference in our markets with a strong brand and deep client relationships. We provide economically beneficial services and financing that help people and help businesses. It's a straightforward business model that works and it stood the test of time over our 121-year history. This is why soundness, profitability, and growth in that order of priority remain our mantra and inform how we run this company.I'll now comment on macroeconomic conditions and then our quarterly results. Inflation appears to be an overall improving trend despite month-to-month volatility, and we expect the Fed to be most likely done with its rate tightening cycle, while for the purpose of forecasting, we continue to plan for a mild recession. It seems there is a real possibility of a soft landing. The macroeconomic environment remains favorable in our footprint and we still do not expect this to change in the near term.Our markets appear to be healthy and our lending pipelines are down a bit from last quarter, but are slightly higher than a year ago, which suggests to us that the current macro environment is in pretty good shape in our footprint. Virginia's last reported unemployment rate of 2.5  in August, improved from 2.9  in May and as usual remains below the national average of 3.8  during the same time period. We're not anticipating any materially negative near-term shift away from these low unemployment trends and generally benign credit environment, but as always we continue to closely monitor the health of our markets.Given continued investor focus on non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and more specifically office exposure, I'll reiterate what I've said for the past two quarters. Commercial real estate finance is a historic strength of our company and it's an asset class that has performed well in our markets, which have not traditionally been prone to boom and bust cycles.We stick to our knitting and we generally deal with local and regional developers and operators that we know well and have track records with us. Non-owner occupied office exposure totaled  792 million and comprised approximately 5  of our total loan portfolio at quarter end. Of this, approximately 22  is a medical office, which we consider among the highest quality office category. We do not finance large, high-rise or major metropolitan central business district office buildings and we have no exposure in the District of Columbia.The portfolio is performing well and is generally geographically diverse. I described most of our office exposure, sub-urban, single-storey, and mid-rise properties under long-term leases, generally to local tenants. They are less likely to use remote or hybrid work options than large national firms.We recently finished another deep dive analysis of the rerolls of the larger office loans that cover more than half of our portfolio with an eye toward any near-term lease expirations, which we define as less than two years.As of last quarter, we proactively monitored this portfolio and we don't see any systemic concerns in the office book currently. Should problems develop in the portfolio, we believe they would likely be distributed over years and we expect any problems that may develop to be readily manageable.Turning to quarterly results, we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage that is growing our revenue faster than our expenses. Here are a few financial highlights for the third quarter, which Rob will detail momentarily. On a year-over-year basis, we generated positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 3.1 , as adjusted revenue growth was up approximately 5.2 , while adjusted operating non-interest expenses increased approximately 2.1 .I'd also like to point out that pre-tax pre-provision adjusted operating earnings increased 10.6  year-over-year. Total deposits grew 9.1  annualized for the quarter and are up 7.2  year-to-date. Given our year-to-date performance, at this time, we expect to be in the mid-single digits for deposit growth for the year, which should largely pace loan growth.The remixing of non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits continued over the quarter, though at a decreasing rate, and we saw good growth in customer CDs. Quarter-end non-interest-bearing deposits were 25  of total deposits, a decline of 1.6 percentage points linked quarter.We posted annualized loan growth of 5.7  during the third quarter, led by growth in commercial loans. Year-to-date loan growth was 7.7  annualized. Loan growth was up across commercial real estate and commercial industrial banking in the quarter. Construction-led balances were down from the second quarter as projects rolled off, but are still higher than the prior year.Our pipelines are holding up pretty well, are slightly elevated from a year ago and remain healthy. Given our year-to-date performance, at this time, we expect to be in the upper end of our mid-single-digit loan growth guidance for 2023. While the economic outlook in our footprint and borrower demand could change, we expect to remain in a growth mode for the rest of 2023.C I line utilization this quarter was relatively flat with the prior quarter, but up from prior year's third quarter. Commercial real estate payoffs declined year-over-year and were down slightly from the second quarter.Turning to credit, that was a good story, as we recorded annualized net charge-offs at 1 basis point for the third quarter, down from 4 basis points in the second quarter. We have yet to see any sign of a systemic inflection point in our asset quality metrics, which remain benign. While we continue to expect normalization in asset quality at some point following a long run of minimal net charge-offs, we remain confident and are pleased with our asset quality.In sum, we thought this was a strong and fundamentally sound quarter for Atlantic Union. We have continued to demonstrate that we will take the necessary strategic actions to successfully navigate the challenges we face in this uncertain economic environment.And we don't foresee that uncertainty ending anytime soon with recent geopolitical events and a possibly contentious process for the next round of congressional funding, but for the time being, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook.As usual, with uncertainty comes opportunity, which we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on. Atlantic Union is a uniquely valuable franchise that is a diversified traditional full-service bank with a strong brand and deep client relationships in stable and attractive markets. It should soon be even more so with the addition of American National Bank to the AUB family.We remain on solid footing, resilient, and expect a good finish to the year. Last month marked my 7th Year Anniversary at Atlantic Union Bank and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teammates to be the central role they have played in the evolution of this great company. As I look back, I can say that, overall, we have done what we said we would do and while our strategy has evolved and responded to our changing environment, this also remains consistent and it's working.I'll now turn the call over to Rob to cover the financial results for the quarter. RobThank you, John, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today.Please note that for the most part, my commentary will focus on Atlantic Union's third-quarter financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted operating basis, which excludes the pre-tax costs of  8.7 million recorded in the third quarter and  3.9 million recorded in the second quarter related to our strategic cost-saving initiatives announced in the second quarter, as well as the  2 million in pre-tax costs related to our proposed merger with American National, which was incurred in the third quarter. In addition, the third quarter financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted operating basis, exclude the pre-tax gain of  27.7 million related to the sale-leaseback transaction and the pre-tax net loss on the sales of securities of  27.6 million.Our previously disclosed sale-leaseback transaction of 27 owned properties, including 25 branches generated cash proceeds of approximately  46 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately  27.7 million in the third quarter, with  22 million after-tax, net of transaction-related costs.Aggregate first year - first full year of rent expense under the lease agreements will be approximately  3.7 million or  2.9 million after tax, which will be partially offset by the elimination of the annual pre-tax, depreciation expense on the properties of approximately  969,000 and the estimated increase in annual pre-tax interest income of approximately  2.2 million generated by the investment of the transactions net cash proceeds.Concurrent with the sale-leaseback transaction the Company restructured a portion of its investment portfolio by selling approximately  228 million in available-for-sale securities, yielding approximately 2.3 , resulting in a pre-tax net loss of approximately  27.7 million, almost wholly offsetting the net gain recognized from the sale-leaseback transaction.The net proceeds from the securities sales and the sale-leaseback transaction have been reinvested into the available-for-sale securities portfolio, yielding approximately 6 . In combination on an annualized basis starting in the fourth quarter, these strategic actions are expected to increase earnings per share by  0.06 or 2 , at 5 basis points to the net interest margin and reduce the efficiency ratio by approximately 24 basis points.In the third quarter, reported net income available to common shareholders was  51.1 million and earnings per common share were  0.68. Adjusted operating earnings available to common shareholders were  59.8 million or  0.80 per common share for the third quarter, which was an increase of  4.4 million or 7.9  from the second quarter and up  4.7 million or 8.5  from the third quarter of 2022.The adjusted operating return on tangible common equity was 18.3  in the third quarter, up from 17  in the second quarter. Adjusted operating return on assets was 1.21  in the third quarter, which was up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. And on an adjusted operating basis, the efficiency ratio was 52.4  in the third quarter, which was down 3  from 55.3  in the second quarter.Turning to credit loss reserves, as of the end of the third quarter, the total allowance for credit losses was  140.9 million, which is an increase of approximately  4.7 million from the second quarter, primarily due to loan growth in the third quarter and the impact of continued uncertainty in the economic outlook. The total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 92 basis points at the end of the third quarter.The provision for credit losses of  5.5 million in the third quarter was down from  6.1 million in the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs. Net charge-offs decreased to  294,000 or 1 basis point annualized in the third quarter from  1.6 million or 4 basis points annualized in the second quarter. The year-to-date net charge-off ratio was 6 basis points on an annualized basis.Now turning to the pre-tax pre-provision components of the income statement for the third quarter, tax equivalent net interest income was  155.7 million, which was a slight decrease from the second quarter, as higher cost, deposit costs due to increases in market interest rates, changes in the deposit mix as depositors continue to migrate to higher costing interest-bearing deposit accounts, and growth in average deposit balances were partially offset by an increase in loan yields on our variable-rate loans due to increases in short-term interest rates during the quarter as well as by growth in average loans held for investment.The third quarter's tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.35 , which was a net decrease of 10 basis points from the previous quarter due to an increase of 20 basis points in the yield on earning assets, driven primarily by increases in loan yields and loan growth, which was more than offset by a 30 basis point increase in the cost of funds.The loan portfolio yield increased 22 basis points to 5.84  in the third quarter from 5.62  in the second quarter, which added 20 basis points to the net interest margin, primarily due to the impact of rising market interest rates on variable rate loan yields, new loan production yields, as well as on renewing loan yields.The 30 basis point increase in the third quarter's cost of funds of 2.04  was primarily driven by the 36 basis point increase in the cost of deposits to 1.97 , which had a 35 basis point negative impact on third quarter's net interest margin, which was partially offset by the 4 basis point impact of lower borrowing costs.The deposit cost increase was driven by changes in the deposit mix, as depositors migrated to higher-costing interest-bearing deposit accounts during the quarter, the modest increase in higher cost, brokered deposit balances, as well as by the increases in interest-bearing deposit rates driven by rising market interest rates.Adjusted operating non-interest income, which excludes the loss on sales of securities, and a net gain on the sale-leaseback transaction recorded in the third quarter increased  2.8 million to approximately  27 million from the prior quarter, driven by a  1 million merchant services vendor contract signing bonus, as well as quarterly increases across most of the other fee revenue categories.Reported non-interest expense increased  2.8 million, to  108.5 million for the third quarter from  105.7 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted operating non-interest expense, which excludes amortization expenses related to intangible assets in the second and third quarters, expenses associated with strategic cost savings initiatives in the second and third quarter, and merger-related costs in the third quarter declined by  3.9 million to  95.7 million in the third quarter from  99.5 million in the prior quarter.The quarterly decline in adjusted operating non-interest expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of  1.6 million in salaries and benefits expenses, reflecting the impact of the strategic cost savings initiative executed in the third quarter.In addition, professional services expenses declined  1.1 million related to the LIBOR transition and other strategic project costs, which were incurred in the prior quarter. Marketing and advertising expenses declined by  598,000 and technology data processing expense was also lower by  643,000.At period end loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs were  15.3 billion, an increase of approximately  217 million or 5.7  annualized from the prior quarter, driven by increases in commercial loan balances of  238 million or 7.4  linked quarter annualized growth, partially offset by declines in consumer loan balances of  21 million, or 3.6  annualized.At the end of September, total deposits stood at  16.8 billion, which was an increase of  375 million, or approximately 9  annualized, from the prior quarter, which was driven by increases in interest-bearing customer deposits and broker deposits, partially offset by lower levels of non-interest bearing demand deposits.At the end of the third quarter, Atlantic Union Bank shares and Atlantic Union Bank's regulatory capital ratios were well above well-capitalized levels. In addition, on a pro forma basis, we remain well capitalized as of the end of the third quarter, if you include the negative impact of AOCI and held-to-maturity securities unrealized losses in the calculation of the regulatory capital ratios.Our financial outlook for the full year 2023 is as follows  We expect to generate full-year loan growth in the higher end of our mid-single-digit range, which is expected to be materially matched by deposit growth. We continue to project that the full year fully tax equivalent net interest margin will fall in a range between 3.35  to 3.45 , driven by the assumption that the Federal Reserve Bank maintains the Fed funds rate at 5.5  through the end of the year.In addition, we now project that our through-the-cycle total deposit beta will be approximately 45 , which will be more than offset by the projected through-the-cycle loan yield beta of approximately 50 . The through-the-cycle interest-bearing deposit beta is expected to be approximately 55 . As a result of loan growth and our tax equivalent net interest margin projection, we continue to expect the taxable equivalent net interest income to increase by mid-single digits in 2023 from full-year 2022 levels.We also expect that the company will generate positive adjusted operating leverage in 2023 due to expected mid-single-digit adjusted operating revenue growth, outpacing expected relatively flat adjusted operating non-interest expense growth in 2023 from full-year 2022 levels, as a result of the strategic cost-saving actions we took during the second quarter.In summary, Atlantic Union delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2023, despite the challenging banking environment we find ourselves in. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to generate sustainable, profitable growth and to build long-term value for our shareholders in 2023 and beyond.And with that, I'll turn it back over to Bill Cimino to open it up for questions from our analysts.Thanks, Rob. And, Josh, we're ready for our first caller, please.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Casey Whitman with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.Good morning, Casey.Hi, good morning. So Rob, just because your NIM guide for the year is still sort of a broad range, do you think margin compression in the fourth quarter should be less than what we saw in the third quarter to help us the securities restructuring  And then my follow-on question is just, when do you think the margin sort of bottoms for AUB, I guess excluding the impact of American NationalYes. So in terms of the fourth quarter, we do look for further compression in the margin. We're modeling between 5 basis points and 10 basis points, inclusive of the impact of the restructuring. In terms of where we think it's going to trough if you will, we think that's in the first quarter, in the 3.25  range give or take a few basis points.And then kind of stabilized from that point forward. Of course, this all depends on our assumption - if our working assumption of the Fed funds rate staying at 5.50  and market rates kind of being where they are, that's our current outlook based on that.Okay. And that was standalone, right, the marginYes, standalone, yes. If you bring in - if it's a little complex in terms of the impacts of the American National merger impacts which obviously will bring in a lot of accretion income. So, again, I think we said on the call related - when we announced the acquisition, we'd be in the 3.60  to 3.70  range with accretion on a combined basis.And then can you talk about just sort of where new loan production is getting put on now, and then maybe sort of pair that against where the incremental cost of the new deposit is  Just sort of to get an idea of the spread coming onYes. So, new production this quarter came on of around 7 . Combination of both variable rate loans coming on, production and fixed rate. I think the variable rate loans are probably about 50-50 in terms of rounded in terms of fixed versus variable. The variable was coming on closer to 8 . Fixed was coming on a little over 6 .So blended, we're talking about 7 . So that continues to churn as fixed rate loans - a portfolio of fixed rate loans reprice or we add new loans, that's going to help the loan yields continue to go up. But again, we expect deposit rates to continue to go up primarily from the continuing remix that we're seeing. We think that's slowing down, but will continue to impact the margin a bit more than loan yields. So little negative continuing there.Okay, I'll just switch gears just to ask, obviously, there's more questions in the industry around shared national credit. So can you maybe walk us through the size of that book for you and any color around it you might want to addYes, Casey, this is John. This is not a primary focus for us. We do have some shared national credits. Historically, what we've done, most of it would be Virginia-based corporations, where we know them. This is a single-digit percentage of the loan portfolio. It's more important to talk about what we do not do. We do not maintain what some banks will call a secure pay syndication platform, also known in the industry as a Buy Desk. We are not buying secondary issuances in the open market.What we would do would be to deal with companies that we know, where we have relationships with management that we physically call on, and anything we would take on would almost certainly be a primary syndication. You will see subsets of this, some of the larger government contractors, we have some of that asset-based lending, we have some of that, although as we've expanded asset-based lending and really built out our infrastructure. The primary focus there is more individual bank deals. This is not a big effort for us.Okay, appreciate it. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll let someone else, and I'll step back.Thanks, Casey. And Josh, we're ready for our next caller, please.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW. You may proceed.Hi, Catherine.Thanks, good morning. Hey, good morning. Seeing that you really a nice quarter. You saw some nice growth in service charges and trust fees. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about fee growth into the next quarter and really how do you think you're going into '24Yes. So in terms of those categories, it really is being impacted by net client growth, the number of accounts. We see about 2  top 3  in new client growth. So we'd expect to be in the 2  to 3 , 2  to 4  growth rate as we go forward. Also included there is debit card interchange.So we continue to see more growth there as well, with the number of new accounts coming in as well. And then there's seasonal impacts in the fourth quarter. So you'd expect to see some of that Q3 to Q4 increase with the holiday season and more transactions coming through. But in the end, we're talking about 2  growth in those categories as we go forward on a standalone basis.Thanks. Great. And then on loans. John, you made a comment that you're still in growth mode, going into the fourth quarter. How do you - how do you think about growth into next year and just where you're comfortable adding new loans where you are kind of pulling back and really what this kind of client appetite is today with higher ratesYes. I'm going to add, We have Doug Woolley, Chief Credit Officer  and David Ring, Head of Commercial Banking here, too. And since most of the production comes out of the commercial side, I'll ask Dave to comment. My few sense on this is that, the environment, it is opaque. I do think that, in general, our economy, as I indicated in my prepared comments is in good shape. We are in the budgeting process for next year.And at this point, what we are discussing would be something in the mid-single-digit loan growth range. I think we will continue to be able to grow at a medium pace. We'll see what happens. Dave, as you think about it, what is your take on thisYes, our pipeline going into the year would support that, John, in the mid-single-digit growth. It's probably going to come more from the C I and Equipment Finance and the regular businesses that operating businesses versus real estate. We just saw our production for this quarter be two-thirds C I, and one-third real estate. So we're seeing that start to happen today, and we think it'll continue into the next quarter, into the next year.I think that's a good assessment. It really points back to the merit of our 7-year-long effort to diversify the bank's capabilities. If we were just a commercial real estate lender, I would be giving you a different answer. But I think that diversification of the things that we do, the brand that we've built for small and mid-sized businesses, and the overall strength of our markets, all of this makes us bullish. The wild card will be American National Bank. I don't want to get too far into that right now, but as we said when we announced the merger, we bring a bigger balance sheet.We bring infrastructure and capabilities, particularly on the C I side. You marry that with the great team that they have, the reputation that they have, the physical presence, the things we can do and kind of the industrial markets of the South Side of Virginia, or Southern Virginia, as I should call it, and then the entry into Piedmont Triad, all of these things give us confidence that we should be able to achieve, let's just call it mid-single-digit growth, and then we'll see what happens from there.Great. Very helpful. Thank you.Thanks, Catherine.Thanks, Catherine.Josh, we're ready for our next caller, please.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Russell Gunther with Stephens. You may proceed.Hi, Russell.Hey, good morning, guys. Hi John, good morning. I have Just a couple of follow-ups. So on the loan growth, discussion, I appreciate your thoughts there, how does the North Carolina market fold into there  What's the opportunity set, particularly as American National folds inWhat do you think Dave, now don't be too bullish here.Well, we've been in North Carolina in real estate.Yes, we're there now - Quite a while for six or seven years, and we've been pretty successful there. What American National brings is really good commercial industrial bankers in markets like the Triad and the Triangle areas of North Carolina. So we think there's going to be an opportunity there. We don't know what it is completely yet, but we think it's going to be an opportunity for growth.This could be an incremental growth opportunity. And they sit there - if you look at the map on the I-40 corridor, starting in Winston, Salem over to Greensboro, Burlington, they have a small Raleigh office. And those are good industrial markets. So I agree with Dave. On the real estate side, we mostly bring a bigger balance sheet.On the commercial and industrial side, we bring robust treasury management services, equipment, finance, asset-based lending, and just the infrastructure to be able to better go after, I would say, mid-sized companies. And then Southern Virginia, which used to be called the South Side, where their home turf is Danville, Martinsville over into South Boston.And by the way, we do double down in Roanoke. These are good commercial and industrial markets and we've not had a presence in Southern Virginia. We are in Roanoke, so, we're bullish. I don't want to sound too bullish. I'm just saying that these are things that will be incrementally beneficial to us.And if you look at the backgrounds of the American National people, they absolutely do have people with commercial and industrial backgrounds too, in addition to good traditional commercial real estate community banking backgrounds. All of this is beneficial. I think there's a lot we can do together. - will come in overtime.Yes, just be clear, over time. So we'll see where it goes from here. But I think this is really an expansion platform. We're going to be able to do more things in Southern Virginia, and we're going to be able to definitely build for a very long time as far as the eye can see along that I-40 corridor and North Carolina, using exactly the same strategy we have here in Virginia. We're built to be the challenger bank to the large institutions.We're the alternative to the large institutions. We can do what they do for small and mid-sized businesses. And we think, we do it more responsibly - responsively. And at the same time, we recognize we compete against the small banks all day, every day. So we're kind of covering both bases. That's the hallmark of Atlantic Union Bank, authentic human experience plus digitally forward technology, that is our strategy.That's good color, guys. I appreciate it. Just switching gears with a follow-up on the margin. So a lot of good detail in terms of expectations. One that I wanted to focus on was the deposit remix. Comments made that, that's slowing, but certainly remain impactful to the NIM. So as you think about where non-interest bearing ultimately shakes out as a percentage of total deposits, just give us some updated thoughts on that front. And is that a function of outflow  Is that a function of remix out of non-IB from current customers into higher-yielding products  Just some additional color would be helpful..Yes, so Russell, we're projecting that we'll be in the 23  to 25  range, kind of where we were pre-pandemic close 22  to 25 . We've been holding fairly steady. We saw a big decline from the fourth quarter through the first two quarters and it's kind of slowed down. Most of that is not really outflow going out of the bank. It's really getting remixed into interest checking and some of our other higher-cost, higher-yielding rates categories.So we do expect to kind of stabilize around where we are. May drop a bit, but we'll have to see how that plays out. But really not much shift going on here. In the end, there's a stabilized level where people are using demand deposits for operating accounts and there's a certain level it's going to stabilize and that's where we think it will be.Yes, Rob is right about that. And as we've really grown the commercial business base of clients, to small and mid-sized businesses, you pick up more operating accounts, they're using Treasury Management services. And I think if you look at our average balances, the average consumer balance this quarter was  19,000 going from memory.The average business client has about  100,000 in their account. This suggested me that many of them are probably at a kind of core operating level and non-interest bearing, we think. It's hard to say to - we can't predict with any precision where it's going to be. But I agree with Rob, I think we're sort of approaching the bottom. We'll see exactly where...Yes, I think, Russell, on the remix, a lot of that is kind of remixing from what I would call deposits and standard rates kind of moving to these higher levels from an interest checking or money market account to a higher yielding CD is kind of really what we're talking about from remix and expect that will continue. But certainly will slow down from what it was in the first couple of quarters.Okay, great. Thank you both. Just a clarification on the fee outlook. So I think I only half caught this. There was a certain merchant servicer signing bonus that was this quarter and about  1 million, and then just kind of where in the P L that fell line item-wiseYes, that's in other fees, Russell. Service charges and other fees and service charges.Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just last...Yes, other service charges, commissions, and fees.Thank you. And then last one for me. Credit has been really strong for you guys. I hear the commentary about normalization. Understood. What does normalization look like for Atlantic Union, as you think out to '24  And what would the drivers of that normalization beYes, so we would project that 15 basis points to 20 basis points of annualized charge-offs is probably a normal level for us. Of course, we haven't come near that to date in this period, but that's kind of what we're looking for. Things like higher interest rates and other recessionary factors could play into that. We're not projecting that at this point, although our allowance for credit losses does skew towards a more recessionary environment. But that's about what we think. And Doug, I don't know if you have anything to add from the Chief Credit Officer's perspective, but that's the view we have as a company.Yes, the weakening, if it comes, will be in smaller credits. We don't see anything. We've done a recent resizing of maturing commercial real estate loans and construction loans converting to their mini-perm, they're resizing on that and all of that looks perfectly fine to them. If something happens, it'll be in the smaller commercial credit base and as is always the case, the consumer portfolio.And if you think about the drivers of the CECL modeling, what drives it underpinning it, the unemployment rate, what's happening with the gross domestic product, and it's just hard to see the economy falling off a cliff anytime soon, at least in the markets in which we operate. Having said that, I would caution, there's always the infamous one-off.Now, you can't have a four-off and a five-off, and a 10-off, but things do happen from time to time that could be idiosyncratic. We're always subjected to that. We saw one of those this year. But overall, Russell, we still feel pretty good. But I acknowledge Black Swan events happen all the time, but we feel pretty good about where we are right now.Understood. Okay guys. Thank you very much for taking my question.Thanks, Russel.Thanks, Russel.And Josh, we're ready for our next caller, please.Thank you. One moment for our next question our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Moss, Raymond James. You may proceed.Hi, Steve.Good morning, guys.Good morning.Good morning, John. Based on - going back to loan pricing here, Rob mentioned loans coming in at 7  for the quarter. Just curious, should we expect a step up in loans being added - in loan rates for loans being added this quarterSorry, do you mean production, Steve  Is your question, what is - what do we expect for production in Q4, or do you expect the rateThe new expected rate. So what do you expect for the rate in the quarterYes, I think you'll see probably kind of staying where we saw in the third quarter, averaging about 7 , maybe a little over 7 . I think with term rates being up, you might see the fixed-rate loans get priced a bit higher on the production. But I think if the Fed does stay steady, I don't think we'll see much movement in the - in the short-term rates.So variable new loans coming out will probably be in closer to 8 , which was what we saw in the third quarter. So not looking for a lot of shift there, but if it's going to happen, it's going to be in the fixed rate term loans, just because term rates have gone up since the end of the quarter.Okay. And then on the deposit front curious with your margin guide here of - to the 3.25  range  What you guys are thinking for - what that implies for deposit beta  And just - maybe just a little talk around the competition for deposits your understanding on your marketsYes, so in terms of the deposit betas, we're now saying that total deposit beta through the cycle is going to be around the mid-40s. That's up from, I think, last quarter we were guiding to about 40 . Interest-bearing deposits guide now is 55  betas through the cycle offsetting. That would be our loan yield beta, which is about 50  through the cycle. So we will continue to project that unless there's movement in the short-term rates from the Fed's perspective.But in terms of the total deposit rates, if you look at it, on average this quarter, we were at 1.97  cost of deposits. If you look at it from September levels, just the month of September, it's at 2.07 . So we're seeing that continue to move up. Now the  indiscernible  has also moved up, but we'll continue to see that through the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter, that we'll continue to see deposit rates ratchet up somewhat offset by loan yields ratcheting up, but we'll see how it plays out.In terms of market rates or competitive rates, we haven't really seen much movement at all in the last two quarters, maybe since, I guess, maybe, late April-May, it's been pretty steady. We haven't really raised our rates at all in terms of our published deposit rates or specials, CD specials or money market promos. So we're not looking that, to see a lot more market rates unless we see or deposit rates increase from the Fed point of view, unless we see market rates rise, which we're not projecting at the moment.Okay, that's helpful. And then, John, I apologize, I dialed in at the end of your credit comments here, but just - on the 30 to 89-day past due bucket picking up here, it was crossed, owner occupied, non-owner occupied, and C I. Kind of curious, any color or maybe any underlying trends thereYes, that was largely driven by a couple of administrative past dues. We literally had one credit that was a third of that increase and for various reasons, it was not renewed on time. It's subsequently been renewed. We are not concerned about that. We've seen no material change in past dues from our perspective. Doug, do you have anything to add to thatJohn, well said, a few smaller - few smaller loans, but administrative past dues drove that.Yes, which are cleared.Okay, great. No, I appreciate all the color there. Thank you very much, guys.Thank you.Thanks, Steve.Thanks, Steve. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to talking with you in three months' time. Everybody have a good fourth quarter.Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

SPY: You Have Been Warned By Jerome Powell,"The notion that history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes in the stock market encapsulates the idea that while each financial eraTypically, stocks and treasury yields  interest rates  are inversely proportional. As risk-free interest rates rise, equitiesHowever, as soon as long-duration  10-year  treasury yields broke past previous cycle highs at  4.25 , the S P-500 formed a local top in mid-July and has since declined by nearly 8   with 10-year treasury yields soaring to new cycle highs of 5.001  last week .Now, the rally off of October 2022 lows has been characterized by  extremely poor  breadth, with nearly all of the equity market returns from the last twelve months being generated by a select few mega-cap tech companies that carry heavy weighting in major market indices.Interestingly, the rally in big tech has been driven by significant P E multiple expansion  and not fundamental earnings growth . Given the steep rise in long-duration treasury yields, such a multiple expansion goes against common sense and financial logic. The only reasonable explanation is that investors are piling into big tech names due to their  safe-haven  status  massive free cash flow generation and robust balance sheets  as macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to pile up in the economy. In one of my recent notes, I shared my views on the significant concentration into big-cap tech and its risks to the Nasdaq-100  Now, from a historical standpoint, I am seeing a lot of parallels between 2023 and 1987 - the year of the  Black Monday  crash. In a similar vein to 2023, we can observe a sharp rise in equities and long-duration treasury yields through the summer of 1987  an anomalous breakdown of the stock and bond yield relationship . And as you can see on the chart below, the rally of 1987 ended with a violent crash in the stock market on  Black Monday   19th October 1987 , with investors fleeing into treasury bonds in a  flight to safety  trade  causing a sharp decline in treasury yields .In today's note, we will try to find an answer to this question, but before we do that, let's understand the drivers of this ongoing wild run-up in long-duration treasury yields.On the back of a 40-year bull run in the bond market  1982-2022 , treasury yields have spiked up over the last eighteen months as the Fed has tightened its monetary policy to combat the pandemic-induced inflation, ending the era of free money.During this tightening cycle, the Fed has already raised the Federal Funds rate from 0 to 5.5  and reduced its balance sheet assets by  1T through run-off of treasury and mortgage securities at the rate of  95B per month.While inflation has moderated rapidly since peaking out in 2022, it is still running well above the  target of 2   September CPI  3.7  y y . With persistent labor market tightness  unemployment rate  3.8  and strong economic data, central bankers refuse to declare victory in its war on inflation, and rightly so given past inflationary episodes.For several months, the Fed has insisted that a  higher rates for longer  policy will be kept in place until the inflation genie is put back into the bottle. And, in his recent address on monetary policy at the New York Economic Club, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open to more rate hikes  despite strong indication of a pause in the hike cycle due to tightening of financial conditions caused by the ongoing surge in long duration treasury yieldsNow, as we know, the  monetary tightening actions and  higher interest rates for longer  stance explain the move higher in short-duration treasury yields. However, long-duration treasury bonds have absolutely collapsed in recent monthsAmid a bear steepening  long-term interest rates outpacing short-term interest rates , the US treasury yield curve has been uninverting rapidly. And, as of writing, the spread between 10-year and 2-year treasury yields has narrowed down to just -16 bps  from more than -100bps just a few weeks ago .Historically, yield curve uninversions have occurred right before the start of economic recessions, and while stock market investors are big on the idea of a soft landing  with S P-500 trading at  19x P E , leading economic indicators continue to point towards an imminent slowdownNow, higher long-duration bond yields mean tighter financial conditions and slower economic activity. While the bond market is doing some much-needed work on behalf of the Fed in the fight against inflation, the velocity of this move up in long-duration yields is quite incredible, and the longer this goes on, the greater the chance of something breaking in the financial system that eventually leads to a hard landing  recession  in the economyDuring the Q A session of his appearance at the New York Economic Club last week, Powell  on being queried about his understanding of the run-up in the long end of the treasury yield curve  listed out multiple theories that could explain the surge higher in long-duration treasury yields- Given the continued strength in the economy  tight labor market and strong GDP growth , higher interest rates are becoming an ineffective tool for slowing down economic activity or that rates just haven't been higher for longer-  US government debt   33.6T, current fiscal deficit   1.7T, massive treasury issuance from the government, Powell said - we are on an  unsustainable  path fiscally-   reduction of Fed's balance sheet assets, Fed moving from buyer to seller- investors are demanding a higher term premium due to growing expectations that the world is moving into an environment of more supply shocks than demand shocksAnd followed that up with the following commentsBy pointing toward supply-demand dynamics, my opinion is that Powell essentially admitted that the Fed has lost control of the long end of the yield curve. While the Fed's rate hiking campaign is likely on pause for now, the door has been left open for future rate hikes. More importantly, with inflation still running well above its target rate of 2  and Q3 US GDP growth projected to come in at 4 , the Fed is unlikely to ease monetary policy  switch back to QE  quantitative easing  in the foreseeable future. And without the Fed buying up government treasuries, the wild run-up in long-duration yields may continue for a while, pressurizing valuations of risk assets.Since treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the US government, their yields are considered the risk-free rate in the investing world. In a normalized environment, risk assets like equities tend to offer a premium of 2-3  on top of this risk-free rate. Hence, at this time, the S P-500 should ideally command an earnings yield of 7-8   risk-free rate  10-year treasury yield  of 5    equity risk premium of 2-3 .By inverting this 7-8  earnings yield, we get to a Price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5-14.28x for the S P-500. Considering forward 2024 earnings estimates of  245 for the S P-500, the market is currently trading at a forward P E of 19x. According to the yield math shared above, S P-500 should be trading 25-35  lower than current levels, i.e., in the 2,800 to 3,200 range.In addition to this yield-based repricing, I see additional risk for the S P-500 since consensus analyst estimates are looking for 12  y y earnings growth in 2024 heading into a potential recession. If we do end up getting a garden variety recession, S P-500 earnings could drop by 15-20  next year. And in that bearish scenario, the S P-500 could drop down as low as 2,200 to 2,640  2024 S P-500 earnings   176-185, P E multiple  12.5-14.28x .From a valuation standpoint, there's ample room for a significant de-rating in the S P-500, with its Shiller PE ratio  28.87x  sitting at extremely elevated levels as you can see on the chart belowYes, the yield math could change quickly if long-duration treasury yields moved back down to 2020-21 lows  however, current economic conditions are unsupportive of such a low-interest rate environment. A Fed pivot and re-introduction of QE-infinitum is probably the only thing that can push rates down to such depths, and while I do expect the Fed to revert back to QE at some point in the future  I believe the Fed Put is currently inactive  due to strong economy and high inflation . This reality doesn't change until and unless something breaks in the financial markets or the economy. And honestly, if something does break, we could see a  crash in the financial markets before the Fed pivots back to quantitative easing.On the back of a sizeable pullback since mid-July, the S P-500 is currently testing the support trendline from the COVID-19  March 2020  and the October 2022 lows. With weekly RSI and MACD indicators rolling over, a massive technical breakdown here is very much on the table.If long-duration treasury yields hold up at elevated levels or continue to climb higher over the coming sessions, equity market selling could pick up here accompanied by a potential spike in VIX  CBOE Volatility Index , which rallied past the 20 level last week.The S P-500  SPY  has support in the 410 to 420 range  however, if we break those levels, then all bets are off, and yes, we could even see the S P-500 experiencing a crash similar to 1987.That said, so far in 2023, SPY has followed seasonality patterns quite well, and numerous analysts have cited strong past performance trends in the November-December period while predicting a year-end rally for stocks  Recent economic data has remained resilient, and Q3 earnings are unlikely to rock the boat. With the Fed virtually on pause now, equity markets can embark on a run higher to close out 2023.Last Friday, SPY closed right under its 200-DMA support level and the trendline of support from October 2022 lows. However, we could be forming a bear trap here, with RSI and MACD indicators on the daily chart showing signs of positive divergence.From a sentiment perspective, investors appear to be fearful at this moment in time as indicated by CNN's Fear   Greed Index  currently in  Fear  territoryAhead of a seasonally strong period in a pre-election year, investor sentiment is bearish  fearful  whilst SPY is nearly oversold and trading within a critical support zone. From an ultra near-term perspective, SPY can forge some sort of a bounce here as long as we hold the 410 to 420 support zone  and then resume the downtrend in H1 2024.The immutable laws of money dictate that risk assets such as equities offer a positive risk premium relative to the risk-free rate in the market. With the long end of the treasury yield curve having moved up to  5  in recent weeks, the S P-500 trading at a 4  earnings yield is simply unsustainable, and a de-rating to 7-8  earnings yields would be justified.Given the current state of the economy and Fed chair Powell's recent talk, long-duration treasury yields are likely to move higher from here, not lower. From a valuation and technical perspective, the S P-500 can drop by 25-50  from current levels.As we noted in this article, there are uncanny similarities between 1987 and 2023 up to this point of the year. Will we see a 1987-esque crash  Frankly, I don't know, but under the given set of economic and financial conditions, I simply cannot rule out a stock market crash.Winston Churchill once said -Heading into a potential recession, the equity market  S P-500  valuation reflects a high degree of investor complacency. A 1987-esque may or may not materialize  however, prudent investors must prepare themselves for a wide range of possible outcomes  tail events  in this uncertain environment. Considering the simple yield math behind stock valuations, the S P-500 is ripe for a significant correction. A technical bounce here may delay the inevitable move lower  however, looking at medium-term  1-3 years  risk reward, I rate SPY a  Sell  at current levels.The era of free money is over, and we are now operating in a normalized interest rate environment. With major US equity indices yet to price in the new financial realities, the risk of significant correction or crash remains elevated.In order to navigate this tricky uncertain environment, we are pursuing  Bold, Active Investing with Proactive Risk Management  at our investing group - . Join our community today and take control of your financial future.Ahan Vashi has 10  years of investing experience with a professional background in equity research, private equity, and software engineering.

Thank you for joining our call.Today, we reported third quarter net income of  251 million, or  1.84 per share -- moderation per share, exceeding expectations.  indiscernible  optimization and moderation in customer demand drove the decline in average loans to  54 billion. Successful execution of our targeted deposit strategy grew customer balances, enabling us to repay  5 billion in maturing FHLB advances. Our continued focus on fee income produced another robust quarter, and credit quality remained very strong with modest net charge-offs, following three consecutive quarters of net recoveries.Complementing our compelling financial results, we advanced other strategic initiatives. Small business remains a priority. And I'm excited to announce that we exceeded our  5 billion lending goal ahead of our three-year commitment. With our investments in talent, products and services for this important sector, we believe small business will become a growth engine over time. Achievements such as publishing our first financed emissions report, making community development investments and recognition for our volunteer program further underscore the value we place on supporting the communities we serve.Advancing our Ameriprise partnership and selective talent acquisition within wealth management, position us to achieve our noninterest income objectives while deepening customer relationships. We continue modernizing our approach to technology to better enable agile product enhancements as we leverage off-premise platforms to run over three quarters of our business applications. Progress towards these initiatives allow us to balance the strength of our legacy for the future vision to sustainably support our customers as a trusted banking partner.Moving to a summary of our results on Slide 4. Average loans declined  1.4 billion, with the largest reduction resulting from our strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance. Success in winning new deposits and bringing back customer balances drove an increase in average deposits of  1.6 billion. Net interest income exceeded expectations for the quarter, even with the impact of competitive deposit pricing and loan trends. Credit quality remains very strong despite continued expected migration. Outperformance in noninterest income partially offset higher-than-expected expense pressures. Finally, profitability and loan selectivity further enhanced our capital position as we generated an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.79 , above our 10  target.Despite the disruptive industry events earlier this year, we effectively managed our balance sheet to create abundant liquidity, enhanced returns over time, while taking care of our customers and exceeding the profitability expectations.Now, I will turn the call over to Jim, who'll walk through the quarter in more detail.Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone.Turning to Slide 5. Our strategic actions and shift to optimization caused average loans and commitments to decline. The exit of Mortgage Banker Finance is progressing as expected and contributed to almost half of the reduction in average balances. We still expect the exit to be substantially complete by year-end.Declines in equity fund services were largely concentrated in non-relationship customers, but we remain committed to this important business.Lower utilization within general middle market reduced balances, reflecting softening loan demand in this elevated rate environment.Ongoing funding of multi-family and industrial construction projects continue to drive higher commercial real estate utilization, but we saw an inflection in commitment growth as we strategically managed pipeline and origination volume.The floating nature of our commercial loan portfolio benefited from rising rates as loan yields continued to climb to 6.34  in the third quarter.Slide 6 demonstrates our successful deposit generation. Average deposit balances increased 2.4 , exceeding expectations and HA trends as we added new deposits and won back customer balances that diversified earlier in the year. In fact, corporate banking and middle market California both closed the quarter in line with their early March balances after experiencing more concentrated diversification in Q1.As expected, noninterest-bearing deposits trended down at a decelerating rate with the lowest balance decline in the last four quarters. Considering that modest reduction, our deposit mix was more impacted by growth in the denominator, with success in winning interest-bearing deposits. We continue to view our deposit mix as a competitive advantage, providing a more stable and cost-effective funding source than our peers.Industry efforts to enhance liquidity drove competition. And when combined with a higher rate environment, deposit costs increased to 290 basis points, resulting in a cumulative beta of 55 . In recent weeks, deposit betas have been moderating and we intend to remain nimble on our relationship pricing approach, so we are able to balance customer needs with profitability targets, while closely monitoring the market.With an even lower percentage of uninsured deposits, the operating nature of our accounts and an enviable customer base, we believe our strong deposit profile is now even more attractive.As shown in Slide 7, our effective liquidity strategy and strong deposit growth allowed us to absorb all of our contractual wholesale funding maturities this quarter. We expect to continue to utilize excess cash to further reduce wholesale funding in the coming quarters. Our loan-to-deposit ratio continue to trend favorably, closing at 80  for the quarter. With significant liquidity capacity and very light remaining unsecured funding maturities, we have flexibility to manage funding needs and are better positioned to prioritize high-return growth in 2024.Period-end balances in our securities portfolio, on Slide 8, declined  1.1 billion, with paydowns, maturities and a  710 million negative mark-to-market adjustment. Although we have nominal treasury maturities remaining in 2023, larger scheduled maturities and anticipated securities repayments over the next two years are projected to benefit net interest income and AOCI.Altogether, we project a 25  improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years. This estimated burn-off is sensitive to the dynamic rate environment and length in the quarter-end. However, since our portfolio is pledged to enhance our liquidity position, we do not anticipate any need to sell securities and, therefore, unrealized losses should not impact income.Overall, our security strategy remains unchanged as we stopped reinvesting over a year ago, and we maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale, providing full transparency and management flexibility. We will continue to closely monitor final regulatory rules to consider the impact on our security strategy as we consider the need for future compliance.Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income decreased  20 million to  601 million, but outperformed expectations. We were encouraged by the lower pace of decline in net interest income as we move closer to what we believe may soon be an inflection point. Competitive deposit pricing and lower loan balances offset the benefits of loan yields and reduced wholesale funding balances. With the strategic management of our interest rate sensitivity, rates have phenomenally impacted income and we remained effectively asset neutral.As shown on Slide 10, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the current composition of our balance sheet favorably position us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual 100 basis points or 50 basis points on average decline in interest rates. By strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios, while considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to maintain our insulated position over time.Credit quality remains very strong, as highlighted on Slide 11. Following three consecutive quarters of net recoveries, we observed modest net charge-offs of  6 million. As expected, credit migration continued with greater concentration in businesses with more relative exposure to elevated rates and inflationary pressures, including commercial real estate, leveraged loans, and technology and life sciences.While the economic forecast improved slightly from the prior quarter, the outlook remained uncertain, which when coupled with lower loan balances, which impacted loan mix, contributed to an increase in our allowance for credit losses to 1.38  of total loans. Notably, non-accrual loans declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, and inflows to non-accruals of  14 million also declined. Consistent with our proven credit discipline, we continue to closely monitor our portfolio and expect further migration to remain manageable.On Slide 12, noninterest income of  295 million was our third highest quarter on record, following our second highest quarter in 2Q. Deferred compensation, which was fully offset in expenses, reduced  7 million, contributing to most of the noninterest income decline. Softer derivative activity more than offset increased loan syndication fees, pressuring capital markets revenue. Fiduciary income was negatively impacted by annual fees received in the prior quarter. Movement in the rate curve benefited risk management hedge income, but will vary in the future based on the rate environment and the position of our hedging portfolio. Growth in noninterest income continues to enhance our overall revenue profile and capital efficiency over time.Expenses, on Slide 13, increased  20 million. Salaries and benefits were up  9 million and  8 million of that increase was in temporary labor due to staff augmentation, advancing technology and wealth management initiatives. Outside processing increased  7 million, driven by certain vendor terms that are sensitive to interest rates and our Trust Platform conversion. Other expenses benefited from large modernization credits from the sale of real estate, offset by increased litigation and regulatory-related expenses, consulting fees and operational losses.We believe we in the industry are in a period of calibration, as we balance the profitability and risk management impacts from the first quarter disruption, with strategic investments critical for future growth. We remain committed to managing an efficient organization and are assessing opportunities to offset some of these pressures so that we may continue to deliver strong returns over time.Slide 14 highlights our solid capital position. Capital generation from profitability and lower loan balances drove our CET1 ratio further above our target to an estimated 10.79 . Our third quarter tangible common equity ratio of 4.62  includes a negative 502 basis point impact from AOCI. Higher rates increased unrealized losses in our securities and swap portfolios, driving a more negative impact than the prior quarter. Based on the September 30 forward curve, we anticipate approximately a 37  reduction in our unrealized losses by the end of 2025. Although the proposed capital changes do not apply to us based on our asset size, we favor a conservative approach to capital management and feel it is prudent to remain mindful of the regulations as they evolve.Our outlook for 2023 is on Slide 15, and assumes no significant change in the economic environment. We project full year 2023 average loan growth of 7 , which would be our highest annual loan growth rate in a decade. The strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance and increased selectivity is expected to continue to impact fourth quarter balances. Our projected full year average deposit decline of 13  improved over prior expectations, with the success in winning new deposits and bringing back customer balances.With the exception of the impact from our Mortgage Banker Finance exit and utilizing excess cash to modestly reduce the maturing broker deposits, we expect deposits to remain relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Our outlook does not assume a significant benefit from seasonality, but if we did see a return to more normal fourth quarter seasonal patterns that may provide more upside than projected.We still expect another record year of net interest income in 2023, growing 1  to 2  over last year's record results. Competitive deposit pricing, continued deposit mix change, and a modest decline in loans are expected to drive a 5  to 6  reduction in fourth quarter net interest income. Although short-term rates are expected to remain high through year-end, our asset sensitivity position is designed to protect our profitability by minimizing the negative impact of rates when they decline.Credit quality remained very strong, and we expect continued migration to be manageable. We forecast full-year and fourth quarter annualized net charge offs to remain below our normal 20 basis point to 40 basis point range.Noninterest income has exceeded expectations for the first three quarters, and we project full year growth of 9  over 2022. Benefits from non-customer income from FHLB dividends are expected to continue, but at declining rates, as we repay maturing advances. Risk management income is expected to eventually reduce over time with rates and our swap position.For the fourth quarter, noninterest income is expected to decline 3  to 4 , largely driven by a reduction in capital markets income considering market dynamics and increased selectivity.Noninterest expenses are expected to increase approximately 11  year-over-year, with 3  of that growth attributed to higher 2023 pension expense and almost 2  due to higher FDIC expense.Fourth quarter expenses are projected to increase 3 , as we observed pressures related to investments in technology and risk management in addition to third quarter modernization gains that are not expected to repeat. While we are not offering 2024 guidance, we are mindful of the need to mitigate expense pressures as we recognize the new funding paradigm in the industry. These pressures are largely concentrated in the need for selective ongoing strategic investments, in addition to investments to further enhance risk management and regulatory compliance.We are in the process of evaluating cost reduction opportunities, with the objective of keeping 2024 costs only modestly higher than 2023. This assumes no change in pension expense, which will be determined largely by year-end rates and market performance. Prudent expense management remains a priority as we work to balance our expense base commensurate with our earnings power. Strong profitability is expected to further grow our capital position in excess of our 10  target. Share repurchases remain paused, considering the ongoing volatility within unrealized AOCI losses and subject to further regulatory clarity.In all, it was a solid quarter of a strong deposits, liquidity, fee income and credit. We believe we are in great shape as we look to finish out the year and prepare for 2024.Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.Thank you, Jim.Slide 16 summarizes our differentiated value proposition. As a leading bank for business, with strong wealth management and retail capabilities, our tenured colleagues deliver value-added industry expertise to our blue-chip customer base, while our highly regarded approach to credit has historically outperformed our peers. Complementing our commercial loan expertise, our relationship model is exemplified by a product set tailored to meet our customer needs, enhancing revenue and retention.Our deposit profile has long been a strength with a focus on commercial operating deposits and a consistent retail base. With new products already in the market and additional efforts underway to expand small business and payments, we expect this core funding source to be even more compelling.Finally, we remain committed to running an efficient organization, and we'll be taking steps to offset expense pressures while leveraging investments designed to enhance productivity and optimize resources.Before we open the line to questions, I just want to comment on what a remarkable quarter we think this was for our company. After the significant industry disruption this past spring, once again, our relationship-based model has proved resilient. We're very proud to see a return to deposit growth, especially when the H8 data shows declines across the industry. Our liquidity is in great shape. We repaid significant FHLB advances, and our loan-to-deposit ratio puts us in a very favorable position. Credit remains strong, and fee income continued to perform at near-record levels. During this disruptive time, we have taken care of our customers, we've borne back deposits, we've added new relationships, and still exceeded profitability expectations.As I shared on our prior calls, throughout our almost 175-year history, we have managed through a number of challenges, and I'm confident in our ability to navigate this environment. We remain focused on our core strategy, enhancing efficiency, managing risks, protecting returns and positioning for organic growth. With the uncertain economic landscape and being just under  86 billion in assets, I feel very good about Comerica's position. We're proud of our colleagues to the performance we delivered.We appreciate your time this morning. And now operator, we'd be happy to take some questions.Certainly.  Operator Instructions  Our first question today is coming from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.Thanks. Good morning, everyone.Good morning.Hey. Good morning. Curt, question for you just on one of the last comments you made about deposit growth. You mentioned that you're adding and bringing back customer deposits. Can you talk about the extent of what you brought back, and why these clients are coming back, and kind of the extent of it and what's left to bring backHey, Jon. This is Peter. So, yeah, the bringing back clients, I would say a lot of that has occurred probably in our middle market businesses. So, if you look back to pre-SEB, and Jim mentioned this, for example, middle market California, corporate banking, we're back to pre-SEB levels in those businesses, but that's true in a couple of other businesses as well. Environmental services has that sort of results, and middle market overall, I think has performed really well.A lot of our new deposit growth, I would say would be in middle market, small business, business banking. We're really being aggressive on trying to attract granular deposits, small business deposits. We're making a lot of investments there in people and product. And so, that's the success that we've had. I think as the year has gone on, our customer base and prospects have continued to have a lot of confidence in our name and our success. And while all the banks were challenged between March and April, I think we've proven to be pretty resilient through this.How rate sensitive are those deposits  Or is this kind of, call it, relationship gatheringI think it's a little bit of both. I think some of it is providing confidence overall that occurred early in the year. But certainly, you're attracting some of it with interest-bearing rates that we're being competitive on. And I think we talk a little bit about what we're seeing on our deposit betas here today. But -- so it's a little bit of both. I think some of it's product investment that we've made to make it easier for our customers to manage their liquidity. But we're certainly doing what we need to do to be competitive with other banks on the interest rate environment.Okay. Jim, one for you. You are kind of dancer on this in terms of you're talking about betas moderating and we still have this down net interest income sequentially and down margin. But the way things sit today, if the Fed is done, what's your best guess on NII inflection for the companyYeah. Thanks, Jon, and good morning. I do feel like the pathway on that inflection point is becoming a little bit more on the focus, even though there is still some degree of uncertainty. I would say right now, our base case is that we'll probably hit a trough in Q1, but whether or not that's the inflection point, and again, that is the base case, and more importantly, what that upward slope of the line will be from there, really depends on a lot of things, as you know.A lot of uncertainty out there, deposit betas, the Fed stays higher for longer, how do betas respond. And just as importantly, if rate cuts occur, how much is there in terms of a deposit pricing lag, monetary policy. Loan volume, we do anticipate growing at some point in '24. That's certainly a variable loan pricing is out there. It's a variable. We think that the new funding paradigm commands wider spreads or higher yield, but it remains to be seen if the market will accept that.So, a lot of variables out there, but I'll just circle back and say at this point, we think the trough is likely to be Q1, then a little bit of a slope up from there.Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.Thanks, Jon.Thank you. Next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now live.Ebrahim, good morning.Good morning. Maybe Jim, first for you, looking at the Slide 10 rate sensitivity, when we look at -- so it looks like, obviously, you've not added any new swaps this year. When we look at the trajectory of the swaps and the outlook, is the jack from the swaps fully baked into as we look into the third quarter and fourth quarter outlook incrementally  Does it get worse or does it just level off if rates don't change  And just give us a sense, do you expect any additional changes around balance sheet mix going into next year and whether or not you're thinking about protecting eventually against rate cuts or notYeah. Ebrahim, you were cutting out a little bit, but I think I got the gist of the question. We are relatively interest neutral is how I think of it right now. We do have some swaps that will mature over the next five quarters, but we also have a number of forward starters that are coming onto the books over the next five quarters also. And so, based on the amount of forward starters that are coming on, I think we have more forward starters coming on than maturing swaps, I don't see a need to go out and acquire any more swaps.Now, we'll continue to monitor how the balance sheet responds and noninterest-bearing deposits respond, which have an impact in that sensitivity equation. But for now, I feel really comfortable that we're well prepared for a drop in rates should they occur.And I guess maybe just a separate question on credit quality. Maybe if we can unpack the three areas that you called out on CRE leveraged loans and tech, like how do you expect the losses to evolve within those three buckets  And any impact on your sort of auto exposure when we think about the UAW strike  And if that gets prolonged, if we could see some negative migration or lossesYeah, Ebrahim, thank you. This Melinda. I'll just make some overarching comments around credit, just to reiterate what both Curt and Jim said. We're really proud of the quarter. Credit continues to hold up really, really well. As you can see on Slide 11, we did have an increase in our criticized assets. We absolutely projected that we would continue to see normalization. That is exactly how it's playing out. The majority of the increase in criticized this quarter came from that commercial real estate book. And as of right now, we do not really see a lot of lost content in that commercial real estate portfolio. Just as a reminder, we're very heavily concentrated in construction financing with very strong borrowers and sponsors. Very low loan to cost is really how we underwrite, and it's predominantly multi-family and industrial.So, the industrial segment is holding up incredibly well. We don't have any criticized assets in industrial. Multi-family is really where we're seeing some of the migration. And that's, again, expected just given what the right environment has done, just as well as a bit of oversupply in certain markets. So, there is some rent leveling out and starting to feel a little bit of rent concessions. We have no delinquencies, no past dues in this portfolio. Our sponsors are stepping up as we would've expected them to based on their historical performance, and they are covering shortfalls. So, I do not expect to see losses coming through the commercial real estate portfolio. But cautionary, we are continuing to build a reserve there. So, our coverage ratio is up to 1.58 this quarter, which I think is up 5 basis points or 6 basis points from last quarter.The charge-offs that we did see this quarter, there is no concentration. It was very granular business banking, TLS, middle market, but they're very small in nature. So, I'm not really seeing any themes as of right now in terms of like where lost content would come from. Leverage would be one that it would be very possible, just again because of the elevated rate environment and the cumulative impact of the 500 basis points interest burden on those borrowers.Automotive production, we've got about  1 billion in automotive production loans. Obviously, we've been in this business for many, many decades, and we've been through many cycles with this customer base. I would say, overall, they are very resilient. This particular pool has been relatively stressed, honestly, from 2019 on. You had the 2019 tariff, then you had COVID, then you had chip shortages and supply chain disruption. But we really haven't experienced losses in this sector. So, we're watching the UAW strike very closely. The longer it goes on, there will be more impact to the portfolio. We're very well reserved, but again, we have a lot of experience managing through this, and we have a very, very strong customer base that knows how to do this.So, hopefully, I hit all of your questions, but happy to follow up.No, that is comprehensive. Thank you so much.You're welcome.Thank you. Next question is coming from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.Good morning.Good morning, John.On the expense growth commentary for 2024, I know you indicated -- the objective is for -- keep expense growth modestly higher versus 2023. Can you -- it looks like the Street is out there modeling maybe 3  to 4  or so year-over-year. Can you maybe help us think about what modestly higher could mean  What's a reasonable pace of growth to assume as you're looking at the initiatives playing out that you're reviewing  Thanks.John, this is Curt. I'll start, and I'm going to ask Jim to add in some more color commentary. First of all, maybe just from a backdrop standpoint, as you and others on the call are aware, '21 and '22 were really record years of performance for our company across the board, revenue growth, loan growth, liquidity, really a great performance from a ROE standpoint. In fact, at the end of 2022, performed in the mid 20  range on ROE. And we were able to do all that and maintain a very low efficiency ratio. As Jim mentioned, and I think I did as well in my comments, I do think that we and the whole industry are in this period of transition and sort of recalibration as we're looking at lower NII really based on the funding dynamics.And then, the second thing I'd say here is just that there are some anomalies in our 2023 numbers. We certainly have a pension impact that others maybe do not have. Everyone has the FDIC components. So, when you factor that out, the rate of growth in 2023 over '22 is not quite as high as might appear. That said, we are committed to managing expenses and managing efficiently as a company, and as you just said, a more modest growth in expenses '23 over '24.But I want to be careful here and just caution that we have been in a new investment -- or net investment focus of the company. We've been doing a lot of things the last two years that we believe are driving revenue growth for us, helping us on the client acquisition side, a lot of investment in payments, treasury management, wealth management, capital markets. We've expanded into some new markets, Southeast and Colorado, a lot of focus on small business. So, we've got a lot of initiative under underway, and I want to keep our focus on those because we believe those are the right things for our company long term, and once we get beyond sort of the period of time that we're in right now.But having said all that, we are going to strike the right balance and we've proven over time in our history that we know how to manage expenses well, and we are looking at sort of what levers we have. We typically provide some guidance at our fourth quarter call. We can go into some more details at that point. But we are working on some initiatives we believe will help us reduce expenses and offset some of what we, I think, is really sort of more near-term pressure versus longer-term pressure.Jim, what would you add to thatThe only thing I would add is, we -- to reemphasize Curt's comments, we do recognize the new funding paradigm, the new profitability equation, and I do think there's a lot of work to be done and we're committed to getting that work done. And I think we're going to make significant progress for 2024, but I don't view it as a one and done deal either. I think this is probably going to play out for some period of time, but we have to continue on the cost reduction initiatives to make sure that we can fund the necessary investments. So, something we've done before. We know how to do. We're committed to. There was a pivot in the industry that's occurred over the last few months, and we're going to have to adjust to that, but we do recognize that. So, fully committed to getting it done, and we'll be sharing more at some later point in time, as Curt said.Okay. Thank you. Appreciate all that detail. And then, separately, I guess when it comes to capital, more specifically, capital deployment, maybe can you talk about what would you need to see to sort of be willing to ramp up buybacks here  Just want to get your updated thoughts on the potential for deployment. Thanks.Yeah, John, I would say the number one factor for me is the uncertainty. That would be the uncertainty in the general economy and geopolitical events and so on, but also uncertainties related to interest rates and AOCI. We did take a step up this quarter as the whole industry did. And I'd like to see a better line of sight in terms of where that's going before we turn on share repurchase.I would say capital rules are something we're watching also. I would say that's more of a secondary factor. We're well below  100 billion, but we do want to be prepared in case things changed in the economy with, whether it be monetary policy or anything else that may catapult us towards  100 billion faster than we're expecting. But the uncertainty is really the key factor there.I will note that even without share repurchase, we do have one of the stronger common dividends in the industry. So, we do feel like we're returning capital to shareholders. But I would love to buy at these prices also. We think the share price is a fantastic buy and very attractive. The idea of buying back those shares is very attractive. But certainly for this year, we are on pause and then we'll assess the uncertainty factors as we get into 2024.Jim, I would add that while we have been cautious on RWA and managing down some aspects of our loan portfolio, that's not sort of our long-term perspective -- our long-term objective. We do want to grow, again, as a company. We see opportunities to grow really based on sort of how the economy plays out as we get into 2024. And that's always the first place we want to use our capital is around the loan growth equation.And then, secondly, John, I think you are aware that we've done a good job over the course of the last three or four years of leveraging buybacks. And so, we do think it's an important tool, but again, sort of balancing between the two will be really important.Makes sense. Thanks so much, Curt.Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.Good morning, Steve.Hey, good morning, everyone. So, I want to go back to your response to Jon Arfstrom, his question where you said NII would likely bottom in the first quarter. Maybe Jim, from a NIM view, do you see NIM following the same trajectory maybe stepping down in 4Q then 1Q and then we bottom thereGood morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. I mean, as always, I'll put my disclaimer out there that we're not a big NIM percentage shop. The lumpiness of our commercial business model offer results in a NIM percentage that doesn't necessarily correlate with income. So, one that I am always hesitant to comment on. I'll just say in general that I do expect NIM percentage to improve as we bring down cash and purchase funds over the next quarter. So, I do think we'll see some positive traction there. And I do think it's fair to -- in a very general way, to say if we see net interest income troughing in Q1, that's likely the trough for NIM also. So, we'll continue to keep an eye on that. But that's what I would say big picture.Okay. And then Jim, given the comments that you're fairly neutral now in terms of ALCO positioning, if rates stay higher for longer, I know you don't like commenting on this, but I'm going to ask you anyway, directionally speaking, if we bottom in the first quarter, how do you think we trend through the year  Assuming no cuts, assuming that the Fed just stays really on hold, do you think directionally NIM trends favorably through the yearThat's going to depend on some of those variables that I mentioned early on. Loan growth, loan spread, pricing, those are all big factors. But I do think that if we do stay higher for longer and QT continues, that does have the potential to put pressure on NIM. It's not our base case. It's not what the forward curve is saying, higher for longer. But we haven't been in this situation in a long time as an economy and an industry, so it's really hard to say. But we will see some of the continued deposit pressures if we do stay higher for longer, I believe.Jim, I do think that we have been very successful on the overall pricing side, on the lending side, obviously, taking into account sort of full relationships and doing the right thing by our customers. And so, I think there's a chance for us to offset some of that just by pricing discipline and potentially loan growth in 2024.Yeah. As I mentioned earlier -- thanks, Curt. I mean, we do feel like we have the right to ask for the proper pricing relative to our cost of funds. And to the extent there is less liquidity in the economy, the deposit pricing cost of funding goes up. And I would expect to recover a piece of that or perhaps all of it in our pricing equation. But again, we'll see what the market allows and what we can demand from it.I know one of the factors is noninterest-bearing levels, right, which were down again this quarter. But I'm curious, are you seeing customers still optimize and move balances out in search for higher yield, or is it just back to spending cashSteven, that's actually one of the areas of encouragement to me. I mentioned the deposit betas had really moderated in recent weeks. I would also say the same is true of noninterest-bearing deposits. If I looked month by month since the disruption in the spring, the decline in noninterest-bearing deposits has slowed up every month and it was essentially flat from August to September. I'm not saying it will always continue to be flat, but I do think that these corporate treasurers manage their own cash levels. They're starting to hit that floor where they need a certain amount of cash to run their businesses and we're really seeing a slow up as a result. We think they've squeezed that orange about as much as they can.Now, could there be a little bit more to go  Yes, it's possible. But we do think that the trend is our friend in this case, and we're really seeing a flattening out of the noninterest-bearing decline. So, I don't see a lot of decline occurring at this point in time, probably a little bit more, but I've seen -- I think we're well past the worst of it.If I could squeeze one final one in. I hear all the comments around moderating expense growth in 2024. But if we step out, if we look at this quarter, revenues down 9  year-over-year, expenses were up 11  year-over-year. We know why. But earnings are down 30 . As you guys think about the next year, are there levers to pull to start generating more meaningful operating leverage  Or is it just a tough environment and you have to just wait for the yield curve to improve and other things  Or do you sense we need to do more here and there's other levers we could pull to get at least earnings heading into a more favorable direction  Thanks.Well, Steven, I would just say in general, as a company, we are always committed to delivering positive operating leverage. Short term, that's a bit more challenging as you just outlined for us for all the reasons that we know. But two things there. One, first and foremost, we are focused on top-line revenue growth, and we believe we've got great momentum there with the things I outlined to you previously, whether it's product expansion and capabilities, treasury management, capital markets, et cetera. We continue to add talent in many other areas. We just had a very successful list out of a wealth management team in Southern California and the expansion into the Southeast, but also just adding depth in the existing markets that we operate in. And I do believe that we will continue to drive fee income, and that loan growth will return for us in 2024. We'll provide more guidance at our fourth quarter earnings call. So, we're focused there on the revenue side.And then secondly, we are going to be focused on the expenses and we've done that historically well as a company. And we are going to be careful to strike the right balance between sort of short-term expense management and sort of the longer-term investment in the company.So, I can't promise sort of when did that sort of positive operating leverage equation tilt. But it's our objective and we are very focused on delivering positive operating leverage for the company and for our investors long term.Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris McGratty from KBW. Your line is now live.Good morning, Chris.Great. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Jim or Curt, maybe on the  100 billion going back to that, you are about 15  below that. How are you thinking, I guess, within the budget for expenses  Like what needs to be spent to be compliant for  100 billion  I guess what's already been spent that you could kind of grandfather in  And then also, can you remind us on the pension expense  I think it's tied to the 10 year, and just remind us the magnitude of how you're thinking about it  This year was a big year. Thanks.Chris, I'm going to take the beginning of that question on the  100 billion target. And I'll let Jim address the pension issue. We, obviously, with the significant build-up in deposits, we were getting closer to the  100 billion mark, which we really never thought was maybe a sustainable situation that we had a lot of build-up in liquidity because of sort of stimulus and monetary policy overall. So, that has pulled down as we've moderated some on the RWA side of the equation. We are very comfortably right now below that  100 billion mark at  86 billion.And if you just look at organic growth, which has always been our focus as a company, it would take us some time, we think, to get back over the  100 billion mark. So, it's important that we are positioned to be over  100 billion in terms of regulatory compliance and what would be required to be a Category IV bank. And we've had a project and initiatives underway for some time. We're probably 40 , 50  through sort of what would be necessary for us to comply in terms of the technology and sort of infrastructure to support that. But we've got some time to sort of make that happen. But it is one of the expenses that has applied some additional expense pressure for us sort of longer term.I made some comments previously that I think at one of the investor conferences just around M A. And just -- maybe just to be clear there, nothing has changed for us in that equation. Getting close to  100 billion really does not change whether we would do M A or not. We were focused, first and foremost, as I said earlier on organic growth. If the deal came along, it still has to make great strategic sense for us. And again, we think we can sort of manage where we are today and we've got some time to sort of evaluate the landscape longer term. But I don't anticipate any sort of pressure on the  100 billion level at least for the foreseeable next couple of years.Yeah. And I might take that even a step further. Chris, you mentioned 15  below. We do plan on repaying more debt in the fourth quarter. We'll get the full quarter effect of what we did in the third quarter. So, we do see cash and purchase funds coming down another  4 billion in the fourth quarter on average on an lending basis, more like probably a  1 billion or  1.5 billion. So, we are well below the  100 billion. Now, as AOCI comes back and we make -- we have loan growth, we'll start moving back towards  100 billion, but as Curt said, we're probably a few years away from that.And I'll just say that in terms of what we're focused on in terms of complying with  100 billion as it might impact expenses, we're only focused on that subsection of the requirements that potentially take more than a couple years to make sure you're comfortable with. So those things that have a longer tail to them, we are focused on working on, and that will be one of the expense pressures we have to offset. But we don't feel like we need to jump into it entirely in terms of getting ready at this point in time. A lot of the requirements, we can wait until we're a little bit closer to  100 billion.In terms of the pension question, pension counting is one of our favorite topics and a great one to waddle through. A lot of variables there. But interest rates are the key one, market performance in general, but interest rates most specifically. If you go back to our K, we do have a sensitivity in there that shows that for every 25 bps rate change -- and the 10 year is a pretty good proxy for our liability and the assets we have offsetting that. Every 25 bps translates to about  11 million of expense. So obviously, we strike that on 12 31. There's been a big step up since then.But I would also say there are other variables that are likely to make us come in below what that sensitivity would suggest. Most importantly, we have a number of advertised credits from past actuarial assumptions that we outperformed on. And so we will outperform that sensitivity, but a lot of variables involved there. So, that's something we'll have more clarity on as we approach the end of the year.That's really helpful. Thanks, Jim. Just one final one in terms of the targeted, I guess, level of cash and bonds on the balance sheet. You haven't reinvested the bonds in the last year. Remind us that, either as the percentage of earning assets or maybe an absolute level, where you could ultimately see those levels shrinking down toYeah, that's going to depend on just the overall composition of the balance sheet, how close we are to  100 billion, as it might relate to liquidity rules and debt requirements. But I would see us moving closer towards  14 billion,  15 billion securities, probably closer to  14 billion. So, we have a ways to go. And what that might suggest is we're likely not going to be buying securities at least for the next couple of years.Great. Thank you.Thank you, Chris.Thank you. Next question is coming from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.Manan, good morning.Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments on AOCI. I mean, I think you noted that you haven't added any swaps in the books this year, given that the 10 year is up, another 50 basis points this quarter. How are you thinking about managing AOCI risk hereWell, at this point, we don't feel like we have to do anything synthetically to manage it. We're okay with where we're at based on the burn-off that we see over the next couple of years, and really more importantly, the burn-off over the next five years as we potentially become a Category IV bank. And so, at this point in time, we are comfortable with where we're at.We do think that as we move closer towards Category IV, we will consider modifying our strategies to maybe shorten the duration of the securities, whether that be with what we purchase or doing something synthetically. But for the time being, we don't feel compelled to do anything. We're comfortable with the burnout that we see over the next few years.Got it. So, as -- there's clearly some volatility on the long end of the curve. Does it make sense to use the same DV01 for AOCI that you saw this quarter and then apply to changes in the 10-year in future quarters to figure out the AOCI risk thereI think that's a pretty good proxy. Yeah, you can see a little bit of movement one way or the other, but I think it's a good proxy for future rate changes.Got it. And then maybe finally, just on the -- I think you mentioned a 37   pull-to-par   ph  on unrealized losses over the next couple of years. How is that impacted by the rate environmentWell, that 37  considers the curve as it stands today, so not just spot rates, but where the curve is. So, to the extent, the entire curve shifts up or down, that will have an impact on that burn-off. But for now, this obviously contemplates the entire spectrum of the curve.In the sense that if the curve moves higher, then the pull-to-par will be longer, and if it moves lower, then the pull-to-power will be soonerThat's right. And we do have a sensitivity on that on Slide 14 in the bottom right, so you can see what 100 bp movement would do one way or the other.Got it. All right, thank you.Thank you, Manan.Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brody Preston from UBS. Your line is now live.Good morning, Brody.Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask, could you give us a reminder, I think it was the GEAR Up initiative that you had in the past, could you remind me what the -- if you happen to know what the total kind of, I guess, expenses you kind of took out of the run rate or kind of like -- I'm just trying to remember what you did in the past.Yeah, Brody, I would not go back through all that detail with you. I might just say that in general, that GEAR Up was a combination of expenses, but also some revenue enhancement opportunities that we focused on. Some of that was around capability. Some of it was around pricing strategies, et cetera. And it was not just a single year impact. It was an impact that we -- a program we put in place to improve overall efficiency, and what was -- at that point a very low rate environment.So, if you're looking at sort of applicability to today, I mean we're a bigger company in terms of our overall revenue base as an organization and our expense base as well. And so, we're going to think about this in a thoughtful way on a go-forward if you're kind of driving to sort of what expense reductions we might look at and look at things that really minimize anything associated with revenue and customers and really try to focus on areas real estate, sort of our technology spend that we might be more careful with, vacancy rates in terms of headcount, et cetera, and we'll have more to potentially share as we get into the outlook for 2024.Got it. Okay, thank you for that. I wanted to ask a couple of questions to Melinda. Melinda, you said -- you talked a little bit about the multi-family and the migration there, that the sponsors have kind of stepped up to cover any shortfalls. When you say shortfalls, do you mean like the multi-family properties that are falling below 1 debt service coverage ratioIt could be. They are in the process of being leased up and so they're behind schedule. But the biggest driver right now in the multi-family space in terms of any kind of a shortfall is really because of the rising rate environment. The majority of the loans are floating rates, so they've been absorbing the rate increase of 500 basis points over the last four, five quarters. And so there could be a shortfall in an interest reserve that we require during the construction phase or a debt service coverage during the lease up phase as those are going into stabilization.Got it. Are there any markets that you look at across your footprint and say maybe there's new supply coming on that might exacerbate any of these issues  Like any that come to mind in particularYeah, I think the market where we've seen the most challenge and the most migration, again, reminder though that the migration has been very manageable and criticized loans in the commercial real estate book are still relatively low. But the migration is really concentrated in the California sub -- some of the sub-markets, Northern California being the most impacted at this point and then Southern California. So, we're watching those really, really closely. And again, the customer base there and sponsor base, I would consider, exceptionally strong. And we have tenured colleagues that know how to manage through this.So, we feel really good about our strategy there. We feel really good about the product set. But multi-family has had a tremendous amount of supply come to market and there's more to come. So I expect that we'll continue to see some modest level of migration in that portfolio.Got it. Okay. And I know it's a very small portfolio for you guys, but do you happen to have what the reserve is on the office portfolio at this pointWe don't have a reserve specifically on the asset classes, but we do have coverage ratio for the commercial real estate book as a whole, and it's 1.58.Okay, got it. And Jim, I just wanted to follow up on the swap question, the swap that you said you got forward starting coming on that'll outpace anything that's maturing that, that's all reflected in the '24 kind of walk up on the swaps book that...Absolutely, it is...Okay. Great. I just wanted to make sure. Then just last one for you. I know it's a smaller portion of the book, but for the true fixed portion, not the swapped floating portion, can you walk us through what the maturity schedule looks like over the next 12 months  And kind of what the yields are that are rolling off versus what current origination yields are right nowYeah, it's really a relatively small part of our book, and I don't see it having a big impact on yields next year. I think somewhere in the appendix, you'd surmise fixed rate loans organically speaking are about 8  of our book. And they have pretty long maturities, up to 12 years on average. So, you don't see a lot come up for repricing every year. We might see  300 million come up in '24 to use a kind of an average. And they are priced below our current loan yields. So, there is some opportunity there, but I wouldn't see fixed rate for pricing having more than a couple of bps of impact on our loan yields next year. But there is a little bit of -- there is a favorable impact.Do you have any security maturities that are lumpy and lower yielding at any point in the next 12 monthsWe have our normal, what I'll consider to be smooth, roll-off of MBSs, and we do have some treasuries maturing over the next 15 months, but I would say those aren't necessarily lumpy, we see a little bit in most quarters. So, we obviously are going to benefit in 2024 from securities maturing as we redeploy that either in the cash, earning much higher yields, or avoid purchase funds. So, net-net, we will see a benefit from fixed asset repricing next year, a tiny bit from loans. You'll certainly get a nice lift up from securities. Fixed rate swaps actually go the other direction, but the net benefit will be favorable in 2024.Got it. Thank you very much for taking my questions, everyone.Thanks, Brody.Thank you. Next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now live.Good morning, Ken.Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the loan book, on the business line basis. You're not under any kind of like dieting, so to speak. But after you got out of Mortgage Banker this year, there's a couple of these lines that are getting a little smaller over time like tech and life sciences and equity fund. Just wanted to ask like how much of that is environmental  And do you envision taking a harder look at any of the loan categories that you have in terms of what you're thinking about in terms of future growth opportunitiesHey, Ken, this is Peter. Yeah, we've got some of our businesses that have kind of continued to drift down this quarter and quite candidly probably will into the fourth quarter and maybe even the first quarter. But we don't really see any additional changes to the lines of business that we're in. We do feel really good about the portfolio on a go-forward basis.I do think that in the environment with increased expectations around profitability and pricing and just sort of managing our balance sheet, some businesses are impacted more than others. But as we get into next year, we'll try to get a little more guidance on what we think loan output looks like for 24. But I suspect a few of these businesses that you've kind of seen creep down here as of late, probably be another quarter or two before we start to go the other direction.Overall, with our general portfolio, middle market, business banking, small business, our pipelines there are still pretty good, relatively. It depends on the geography a little bit. And we're trying to add customers and add new business in that space as we get into the end of the year and into next.Got it. Great, thanks. And my follow-up is just on the expenses. Can you just explain like the kind of the write-back on the modernization this quarter  How does that mechanically work  And then just making sure that we understand that the fourth quarter guide is built on the all-in 3Q number  Thank you.Yeah, Ken, the modernization expenses were actually a net credit because of the real estate gain that you saw in the third quarter that we noted on the expense slide. That was offset by some expenses, but modernization expenses were a net negative  14 million or  14 million credit for the quarter. We would expect that to be a little closer to zero for the fourth quarter. We may have an additional real estate sale that could give us something in the low single digits of millions, but overall I don't expect modernization to be a big driver of fourth quarter expenses.Okay. Got it. Right. So that -- okay. And then the fourth quarter guide is built on the -- aside from the deferred comp that you don't expect to repeat, the fourth quarter expense guide is built off of the  555 million   phThat's right.Yeah. Okay. Got it.Thank you.Thank you, Ken.Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brandon King from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.Good morning, Brandon.Hey, good morning. Just putting the pieces together, how are you thinking about balance sheet growth next year, particularly with earning assets  Are you kind of looking to keep things stable, or could we see some incremental growthBrandon, it's Jim. I'll start off and Peter may want to chime in here. But we've been very focused on stabilizing the funding base and the liquidity base in recent months, as you know. We've had a lot of success there. We're actually in better shape than we actually thought we would be back in the spring with the loan-to-deposit ratio of 80 . I think it was right now as being in a period of recalibration. We're focused on getting the right mix of customers, right mix of businesses, getting the right pricing.And then, we expect this to be at some point -- in 2024 to be at a point where we start regrowing loans at a more normal pace again. We're not quite there yet, but we expect to be there at some point in 2024 with loan growth. But right now, we're still going through that period of recalibration, whether it be getting more certainty around our deposit base, getting the right mix in terms of business lines. But we do anticipate some type of balance sheet growth at some point in 2024.Yeah. Brandon, I might just add to what Jim said. I mean, we're also seeing a lot of, I would say, caution in our customer base. There's a lot of headline risk, I think you might say, as we go into next year. And Melinda talked a lot about credit, but we're prepared that it could be a tougher economic environment that we'll just navigate successfully. We always have as a company really well. So, what that looks like for loan demand, per se, is probably to be determined.I mean, we'll give some more guidance, as we've mentioned, on loans when we get into the fourth quarter call for next year, but we do think we'll get back to loan growth next year. I think we just don't know necessarily what that looks like just yet with the environment, with interest rates where they are, and to the extent that we enter a more challenging economic environment, we'll have to navigate that. And again, it also depends on business by business what that may look like in geography by geography.Got it. And then, could you speak to deposit seasonality flows  What are your kind of expectations near term  And just how close do you think we are to maybe a normal seasonality trendYeah, Brandon, seasonality has really been a tough one the last couple of years. The typical seasonal trends that we see amongst different business units, whether it be loans or deposits, it's kind of gone out the window. So, we're waiting to see whether or not those return back to normal seasonality patterns. We're in a higher interest rate environment and to what extent a different liquidity environment too in terms of overall liquidity in the economy. So, it remains to be seen if we do return back to those typical patterns that we've seen in the past.As I mentioned, we may have a very small bit of seasonality assumed in our outlook, but not a lot. So, we do see some potential for upside there. But frankly, it just feels like the deposit seasonality, much like many other patterns, remains to be seen in this new paradigm as to whether or not we return back to the old normal or not.All right. That's all that I had. Thanks for taking my questions.Great. Thank you.Thank you. Next question coming from Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.Good morning, Peter.Good morning. Just going back to the '24 expense outlook, does that already contemplate some expenses initiatives  Or as you go through the budgeting process, there's opportunities for maybe some additional expenses versus that guidancePeter, it's a bit of both. We haven't been sitting on our hands, so to speak, and have been looking at opportunities to slow expense growth and to be more prudent. We have some other things that are still in process as we think about sort of the planning process for 2024. So we'll again have more to share potentially as we get into the fourth quarter earnings call.Okay. And then just one housekeeping. Just, what was the end-of-period balance on the Mortgage Banker loans  Just curious how much is left to run off.Yeah, Mortgage Banker, I mean, for the quarter, we were at  900 million, a little bit lower than that for ending, I don't know...I think period-end was around  650 million.Yeah, something...Yeah. So but -- we've communicated there, Peter, that we expect the balances to be pretty minimal by the end of the year. Period-end might be a couple hundred million.Yeah. Okay. Thanks.Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Curt Farmer. Please go ahead.Again, I just would say I'm very proud of our performance for the quarter. Always proud of our colleagues and how they are delivering for our customers every day. And thank you again for your interest in our company, and I hope you all have a great day. Thank you.Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",2,2023-10-20T12:32:07.000-04:00
Why Markets Were Thoroughly Confused After Fed Chair Powell's Key Speech,"Fed watchers who analyzed Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Economic Club of New York are likely confused. Powell's prepared remarks provided a mix of contradictory views on the Fed's policy tightening. His remarks both implied the potential endThe unclear messaging created market confusion, conditions that suit traders the most. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S P 500 all broke below their trading range by noon on Oct. 19. Importantly, the small-cap index, Russell 2000 , resumed its steep downtrend that began in July. Small-cap firms are the most sensitive forward indicators for the stock market.How should readers interpret Powell's mixed commentary  Not much has changed in the Fed policy stance since the Fed Chair's game-changing . InPowell said that the economy might not have experienced the full impact of the central bank's policy tightening. While recognizing the very resilient economy, interest rates do not negatively affect all sectors. Later, he , as expected, sees the effects of higher rates.The Chair recognizes that the magnitude of the impact of tightening does not have precision. The Fed does not know how long the lags between tightening and the impact on the economy would take.Powell explained that the Fed focuses on short-term rates in its monetary policy. It will need to let long-term Treasury yields play out. On the day, the mid to long-term Treasuries traded above the 52-week high.  Market Data on the toolbar and then select  bonds.Expect heightened bond yield volatility next. Market participants previously waited for the 10-year Treasury break out above 5.0 . This is an expected . As the demand for Treasury securities weakens,  find the , yields will continue to climb. 5.5  to 6.0  is the next milestone for the 10-year yield.In response, the mortgage market already prints . This is a fixed rate not seen in 23 years.Powell said that inflation risks could resurge. Evidence that suggests persistently above-trend growth would warrant further tightening of monetary policy. In addition, if tightness in the labor market stops easing, it is another risk that supports a restrictive rate policy.The Fed is firm on its commitment to achieve inflation of 2.0 . In the Sep. 2023 Consumer Price Index report, the  is above the 2.0  target.Much to the frustration of income investors, the Federal Reserve will carry out its rate policy carefully. Interest rates will remain higher for much longer than markets expect. REIT investors who bet on a pivot  rate cut  in the summer paid a heavy price. Realty Income , for example, tried to break out in July. By September, the stock fell from  54- 56 to a low of  48.42. Its attractive dividend rose again as shares fell. Its dividend yields 6.18 .The  the rate at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. Hutchens Center reported that this declined by around 3.4  since 1972. However, the Fed did not offer to estimate where the neutral rate stands.Since the Fed thinks the neutral rate is currently not tight. That is, interest rates are not above the neutral rate and therefore do not have a contractionary impact on the economy. Despite the rate hikes, the loose monetary policy still has a stimulatory impact on the economy. By stimulating economic activity, inflationary pressures will persist.Powell echoed what readers said for months about the excesses of government spending. Powell said that the fiscal deficit is on an unsustainable path. The Fed inferred that high long-term treasury yields would weaken the government's fiscal spending.Spending on defence gets plenty of attention. The Department of Defense has a . When the cost of interest on debt exceeds the defence budget, the public will shift its focus on cutting the country's debt. The Treasury Department paid a record  in the last quarter of 2022.Markets rewarded patient investors exposed to the defence sector. Stocks like Lockheed Martin  and Northrop Grumman  are up sharply in the last month.NOC and LMT stock rose after the Hamas invasion of Israel. Powell mentioned that geopolitical tensions are highly elevated. They introduce risks to global economic activity. Elliot Investment Management founder Paul Singer echoed Powell's concerns. The  markets are not pricing on the far more dangerous world today. Despite recent geopolitical tensions, stock markets barely reacted.Markets are complacent because their valuations and volatility do not reflect the real economy. For example, job cuts boost stock prices because companies save money. Yet big job cuts hurt the economy. They will eventually hurt the demand for goods for many firms.Stocks have yet to allow negative market sentiment to mount. Still, stocks are starting to price in the reality of weak demand. A few weeks ago, fears grew that weaker disposable income would hurt the demand for goods. Proctor   Gamble , Coke , and Pepsi  are among the firms that traded lower. More recently, KO and PG stock began to rebound.The electric vehicle market is not so lucky. After cutting prices to sustain its market share, Tesla  reported weak profit margins. CEO Elon Musk warned shareholders . The truck EV will lose money until it reaches critical volume levels. Until then, the truck is not prosperous for Tesla. Rivian , Fisker , and Lucid  are among the firms that are nowhere near achieving economies of scale. Those firms new to the EV market will continue to lose money for every vehicle sold.Markets have always been confusing. Powell's key speech added to that sentiment, creating further uncertainty. Markets hate uncertainty. Combined with rising Treasury yields, Powell's comments will set up further downside for stocks.Please  me for my view on the economy.

PDO Approaches 14% Yields As Fear Approaches Again,"While the S P 500  and Nasdaq  are up 13.17  and 29.48 , respectively on a YTD basis, the rally has been fueled by big tech. Many sectors have been crushed in 2023 as the following ETFs are allBack in February, I wrote an article on PDO  and discussed why I was adding to my position. The article covered PDO's historical pricing, its discount to premium history, and why PDO was interesting from an income-producing methodology. Since the article was published, the macroeconomic landscape has experienced significant changes. Not only is inflation still an issue, but rates have continued to increase, putting additional strain on the areas PDO allocates capital. I wanted to follow up on my previous article and discuss what's occurred, what can still go wrong, and why I am still bullish on PDO's future. is a closed-end fund  CEF  from PIMCO that utilizes an asset allocation strategy among multiple fixed-income sectors in the global credit markets. PDO's investment mix includes allocating capital in the global credit markets across corporate debt, mortgage-related and other asset-backed instruments, government and sovereign debt, taxable municipal bonds, and other fixed, variable, and floating-rate income-producing securities of U.S. and foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers. PDO is a leveraged fund through reverse repurchase agreements and obtains its borrowed capital through bank loans, commercial paper, other credit facilities, and other transactions. PDO's exposure to reverse repurchase agreements is 43.87  of its total managed assets, and its current total effective leverage is 44.58  of total managed assets.  went public on 1 29 21 at  20 per share, and since then, its share value has declined by - 8.83  -44.15  while generating  5.39 of income.The  was actually created by CNN in an attempt to track the overriding emotions driving the stock market at any given time. The index is measured on a scale of 0-100 and is constructed from 7 indicators, including market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand. In February, the Fear   Greed Index entered extreme greed levels prior to the Regional Banking Crisis, which took the index to extreme fear within the span of a month. Things got more bullish upon the artificial intelligence  AI  renaissance that emerged as extreme greed was reached again at the beginning of June and lasted the majority of the time until July 31st. Since the end of July, the Fear and Greed Index has embarked on a downward trend, and we're currently tittering in between fear and extreme fear.Despite the Fed pausing and becoming more data-dependent in recent months, they have taken rates higher at a pace not seen since the early 1980s. Their dual mandate of stabilizing prices and maintaining maximum employment overrides what the stock market wants. The Fed is in a difficult position because if they tighten too much, they can cause a recession and wreak havoc on banking, credit, and the overall business environment, which can work against their goal of maintaining maximum employment. The Fed has taken rates to a level where the current  yields 5.4 , and the 10-year  4.61  while the cost of capital continues to increase. Mortgages are at 10-year highs over 7 , while  are at 10-year lows.PDO's largest underlying assets consist of corporate bonds and notes, convertible bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes, Non-Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, asset-backed securities, and Sovereign debt. As we have seen in PDO's share price, the rising rate environment has destroyed shareholder value. Higher rates are often negative for funds such as PDO because existing bonds and MBS become less valuable. Hypothetically, If you purchased a bond with a 5-year maturity rate in 2021 that came with a 3  coupon and the same 5-year maturity bonds today have a 5.5  coupon, the previous bonds will be less valuable because they have a lower yield. As rates go up, the new bonds issued have larger yields, causing existing bonds to trade at a discount. A perfect example of this concept is looking at a chart of TLT. The rising rate environment has caused TLT to decline by roughly -38  since the Fed started tightening with the bonds in its underlying portfolio declining in value as new debt was issued with higher coupons. The same concept holds true for MBS products, as these are investments in debt to produce yield. When rates increase, so does the interest paid on mortgages, and older MBS products with lower-yielding debt can't be sold for as much as new debt with higher yields.PDO hasn't increased its  since July of last year, and its yield continues to increase for the wrong reasons. PDO's assets are throwing off the same levels of income, but its cratering share price continues to push its yield further into the double digits. While PDO has a portfolio that exceeds  1 billion in assets, they are not as valuable as they once were. A rate environment that continues to rise or stays higher for longer isn't optimal for PDO because a portion of the fund's underlying assets will continue to be less valuable than those issued over the past year that come with higher yields. PDO is an income play, and if the Fed tightens too much, it could cause companies to default on their debt, whether that's in the form of issued bonds or mortgages. The bear case for PDO has merit, and its success is predicated on several economic factors outside of its control. PDO isn't an investment that will be right for everyone, and there is a level of risk that could increase if rates go higher.The stock market is the one place where an overwhelming number of people don't like discounts, regardless of whether you're at a supermarket or Best Buy . People want to pay lower prices for products because it leaves additional money in their pockets. The stock market is different, and when the market declines, we enter periods of fear and extreme fear. While some individuals think about the value of their assets declining, I look at things as an opportunity to purchase shares of equities at a lower price than I was willing to pay previously. I invest for the long term, and when I am allocating capital outside of retirement accounts, I have a 5-10-year horizon for the investments unless something makes me change my investment thesis. While there are certain factors that don't paint the best picture for equities in the short term, I think we're at a point where there are some great long-term opportunities if you are willing to take additional risks.It's no secret that we're experiencing tighter financial conditions, additional geopolitical risks, and diverging growth cycles. PIMCO has navigated global multi-sector credit markets for several decades and has been successful in managing investments through different cycles. As the data indicates that we're at the end of a tightening cycle, focusing on discounted fixed-income assets could be beneficial as they are starting off with higher yields if the underlying fundamentals are relatively strong. PDO is managed by  and , and by investing in PDO, I am putting my belief that they are able to sift through the discounted market and position PDO to benefit from shifting monetary policy. In 2021, Ms. Pier won the Investing Excellence in the Rising Talent Morningstar award, and prior to joining PIMCO in 2013, she was a senior credit trader at J.P. Morgan. Mr. Ivascyn won the Morningstar award for fixed-income fund manager of the year in 2013 and was inducted into the fixed-income analyst's Society Hall of Fame in 2019. I think that the fixed-income markets will turn over the next 2 years and that Ms. Pier and Mr. Ivascyn can lead PDO higher.Core CPI continues to fall, and it has now reached its lowest level since September 2021. The  is now forecasting an 11.8  chance of a .25 bps increase in rates in November and a 31.4  chance for a .25 bps increase in December. Overall, the percentages of another rate hike continue to decline, and as CPI continues to decline, there is less of a reason for the Fed to increase rates. Looking out to the end of 2024, CME Group has the highest conviction that rates will be between 450 - 475 bps and a 63.3  chance rates will be between 4 - 4.75 bps.The rising rate environment has caused mortgage applications to hit their lowest point in over a decade as rates reached their  since 2000. The Fed has left the door open for another rate hike based on the data, but even if we get another hike in 2024, all signs point to a Fed pivot in 2024.  has remained under 4 , and  has fallen for 6 consecutive months to 4.1 . We're headed into an election year, and there are elevated chances that the Fed will face political pressure from both sides of the aisle to lower rates, as no elected officials want to go into an election cycle with a restrictive economy. Credit has been tightening, and the average consumer has arguably been hurt more by rising rates than inflation. Seeing a 5  increase in the stores isn't fun, but the tightening credit market has significantly increased interest on credit cards and made buying a home out of reach for many Americans. On the business side, the cost of capital has increased, so businesses are less inclined to expand, and there is a wall of debt coming due that needs to be refinanced. In some instances, the unit economics of refinanced debt at higher rates could turn some assets upside down, causing the operators to hand unwanted assets over to the banks, which could cause unemployment to skyrocket, recession, and a banking crisis.My prediction is that the Fed will pivot in the first half of 2024 if Core CPI continues to fall into the low to mid-3 range. When rates decline, yields on newly issued debt and bonds will also decline. As this cycle progresses, we should see bonds and MBS products appreciate as the yield spread between older-issued debt and newly-issued debt tightens. I believe that the older assets with lower yields in PDO's portfolio will regain some of their lost value and that the newer assets that they have invested in at higher yields will trade at a premium as future debt will have lower yields.PDO hasn't been a stellar investment from an appreciation aspect in 2023. The data indicates we are at the end of a tightening cycle, which is bullish for funds such as PDO. I think there is a long-term opportunity in the fixed-income markets for appreciation and to establish an above-average yield on capital. If the Fed pivots and the yield spread between newly issued debt and older debt tightens, then PDO's underlying assets should appreciate, causing the yield PDO generates to decrease. I have to trust that PIMCO's team has positioned PDO to benefit from where economic conditions are headed, not where they were. Based on everything I have looked at, I plan on adding to my position in PDO, and while some will say I am trying to catch a falling knife, I am looking at this as an opportunity to possibly buy at the bottom when there is more fear than greed in the markets.

Google: Steep Plunge Unveils My Strong Buy Conviction (Rating Upgrade),"I  Google   stock in late July 2023 following its second-quarter or FQ2 earnings release back then. Although it continued its advance through its highs in October 2023, the steep decline after its recent As such, GOOGL revisited lows last seen in late July 2023 as investors assessed near-term headwinds in Google Cloud's progress and a possible slowdown in the advertising market.The contrast in Google Cloud's performance against Microsoft  Azure's stellar earnings release was notable. Accordingly, Google Cloud posted a revenue growth of 22 , discernibly below Azure's 29  increase. As such, concerns have been raised about whether Google could be  in the cloud computing space, given Microsoft'sMicrosoft's advantages in the cloud computing space are well-recognized. I had  that the market has likely priced in its AI leadership, given its well-diversified enterprise customers. Furthermore, the partnership with OpenAI has further boosted the appeal of Microsoft's  as customers seek more cost-efficient Microsoft bundles to adopt AI solutions.Despite that, Google's advertising business demonstrated that it has recovered from the worst of last year's problems, justifying its late October 2022 bottom. Given GOOGL's remarkable 33  increase over the past year in total return basis, it's arguable that the market has attempted to price in Google's ad business recovery.Notwithstanding the recovery, Meta Platforms  and Snap  spooked investors that there could be higher execution headwinds in the near term. Meta noted  in the beginning of the fourth quarter, which correlates with the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict.  As such, investors are likely pricing in worsening geopolitical uncertainties not reflected in previous estimates.As such, I assessed that the recent selloff is justified to reflect these risks. Also, it's an opportunity for last year's dip buyers to cut exposure, given the remarkable recovery from last year's lows.The Wall Street Journal, or WSJ, reported that Google  a further  1.5B investment in AI company Anthropic, bringing its total committed funding to  2B. Structured as a convertible note, Google could convert it into equity during the  next funding round.  Keen investors should recall that Anthropic recently announced a  by Amazon  as the Andy Jassy-led company looks to advance its generative AI ambitions.Therefore, it seems like the Google-Amazon rivalry could intensify further as they hedge their bets against the market leadership of Microsoft-OpenAI. However, with Anthropic also committed to using Amazon's AI chips and services, it remains to be seen how this power-play between Google and Amazon could play out. Still, the move corroborates that the Microsoft-OpenAI collaboration is likely leading as their rivals scramble to catch up with the King of SaaS.A recent  report also stressed Microsoft's leadership, as the company is expected to ship 76K  high-end AI servers in 2023, accounting for a shipment share of 44.2 .  That metric  is higher than the combined shipments of the second to fifth-ranked players,  including Google, in second place with just over 20K shipments.Despite that, I assessed that GOOGL's valuation remains highly favorable. Its risk reward profile has improved further after its recent collapse. At a forward EBITDA of 10.7x, it's priced at a marked discount against its 10Y average of 12.6x.While the market is right to reflect near-term headwinds, I believe it also represents a fantastic opportunity for patient investors to pick up the pieces as GOOGL falls back into undervalued zones.Google is still the advertising behemoth. Its robust performance in Q3 demonstrated that it's well-placed to continue dominating its smaller peers in the search and streaming space.Its cloud business has faced near-term challenges against the leadership of Microsoft.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2023 10 00 AM ETKathleen Quirk - PresidentRichard Adkerson - Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCory Stevens - Technical services and engineering and construction groupAlex Hacking - CitiChristopher LaFemina - JefferiesMichael Dudas - Vertical ResearchCarlos de Alba - Morgan StanleyBill Peterson - JPMorganAlex Terentiew - StifelBrian MacArthur - Raymond JamesLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Operator InstructionsI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am.Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported our third quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman andGo ahead, Richard.Good morning. Yes, good morning. Thanks, Kathleen. As Kathleen said, she's going to review our operations and financial results for the third quarter. Big picture, we had very strong operations performance and this was really notable in face of a number of challenges we faced at different locations around the world. Once again, Team Freeport answered the bell and  rang through   ph .Stating the obvious is a complicated geopolitical and macroeconomic world. Freeport family around the world is sad for the poor people in Israel, in Gaza, and in the Ukraine and praying for a resolution to those conflicts. Macroeconomic factors with higher interest rates are negative for the price of copper and Freeport's equity. It goes without saying our business by design, by strategy, is correlated to the price of copper in response to the recent lower copper prices. We are supported by having a strong balance sheet, which we're committed to maintaining, and by having the ability to manage our capital cost and operations to be responsive to the price environment. We remain very confident about the long-term outlook for copper and for our company's equity. The current situation does nothing but bolster the longer-term outlook for copper prices as a commodity and for our future returns to Freeport shareholders.We look forward to answering your questions and I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to review our results.Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on slide three where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong execution. Production results across the portfolio were solid, totalling 1.1 billion pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold during the quarter.Our copper sales were 8  above our estimates going into the quarter, and despite strong gold production, our third quarter gold shipments were slightly below previous estimates. That reflected timing associated with some administrative approvals in Indonesia, but this is expected to turn and set up for higher gold sales in the fourth quarter.Our unit net cash costs on a consolidated basis averaged  1.73 per pound in the third quarter that was similar to the year ago quarter. The increase compared to our guidance of  1.61 per pound largely reflects the impact of export duties in Indonesia, which we continue to review and discuss with the Indonesian government.With average copper prices of  3.80 per pound in the quarter, we generated EBITDA of  2.2 billion. Our operating cash flows, which were net of  500 million in working capital uses totaled  1.2 billion, and those exceeded our mining capital expenditures, totaling  800 million, which exclude capital associated with our smelter project totaling  400 million in the quarter, and that's being funded from proceeds that we raised last year in a financing transaction.We're making steady progress on the smelter projects in Indonesia. The construction project on the new greenfield smelter is 84  complete, and we're on track to begin ramping up during 2024. Richard talked about our balance sheet, our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape. Excluding the net debt associated with the smelter projects in Indonesia, we ended the quarter with  800 million in net debt. As we approach the end of 2023, our team remains focused on continuing strong and safe execution of our operating plans. And we expect to have another quarter of strong production results. And we're going to continue to advance several important initiatives to drive long-term value in our business.Moving to the next slide, slide four, we talk about copper markets. And as Richard mentioned, the long-term fundamental outlook for copper remains compelling, characterized by rising demand associated with global investments in electrification and limited supplies. In the short term, copper prices have been impacted by macro sentiment tied to rising interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and sentiment on the global economy.Copper inventories on exchanges have risen in recent weeks, and that follows a multi-year period of declines. When we look at the overall inventories on the exchanges, they remain low by historical standards and in relation to the growing size of the market. The reality on the ground, when we look at the macro sentiment, we also need to look at the reality on the ground. And the new structural demand drivers for copper are mitigating traditional cyclical uses.In the U.S., several of our customers are reporting growth in power cable and building wire for utilities and data centers and rising demand from the automotive sector. There are pockets of weakness tied to residential housing, but this is being offset in other sectors. China's consumption continues to grow despite the country's weak property sector, supported by massive investments in wind and solar and growth in electric vehicle production. And there are recent signs we're seeing that economic activity is picking up in China. We're also seeing growth in copper consumption in India, which has historically used less copper per capita than other countries. We can't predict short-term macro forces that have heavily influenced the market, but our conviction for the long-term fundamental outlook remains strong. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification and Freeport's well-positioned as a leader in the global copper industry.When we look at the long-term, we're looking at the next several years where demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge. The recent weakness in price combined with higher capital costs to develop new mines are making it more difficult to justify new project development, which is essential to the future.With this backdrop, we believe the current price is not sustainable and prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're going to take a long-term view and also be mindful of the short-term pressures on the market.Moving to the next slide, on slide five, we want to highlight some of the key operational drivers for our business during the quarter. In the U.S., our leach innovation initiative where we're deploying new operating practices to traditional leaching is showing tangible progress. Incremental copper from these incentives totaled 46 million pounds in the third quarter. This is 90  of our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum. We see ongoing opportunities for additional scale as we aggressively advance this highly valuable initiative.Additionally, we're continuing to focus on enhancing productivity in our U.S. mining and milling operations. We know there's opportunity here to improve and it's a key focus area for us. At Cerro Verde in Peru, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged over 430,000 tons per day during the quarter. That was a new quarterly record. You will recall this is a site that was designed at 360,000 tons per day. Overtime, our team has found ways to improve efficiencies there. We are really proud of the Cerro Verde team.At Grasberg, our mill rates averaged 207,000 tons per day for the quarter, processing high grades of copper and gold ore. The production for the quarter exceeded 400 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold that was in a single quarter, demonstrating the size and scale of this operation. We had several days of the mill throughput in excess of 220,000 tons per day. And a highlight of the quarter was the performance of Grasberg Block Cave. We mined from that ore body over 130,000 tons per day, on average. We installed a new gyratory crusher at the Grasberg Block Cave, which gives us the ability to process more material from that large ore body. And we recently reached new records of over 160,000 tons a day.We're working to complete the new SAG mill at Grasberg. We're expected to complete construction by the end of the year. And that'll give us more opportunities in the future to ramp up our mill rate even further.Turning to slide six, we talk about our growth initiatives. And as we look at this situation where we have growing demand for copper over the next several years, and the limitations and the high capital intensity and risk for greenfield projects, our strategy is really focused on development of extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunity. We characterize our growth in near-term, medium-term, and longer-term development options.On the near-term side, the initial target of 200 million pounds per year of copper from our leach initiative has essentially been met. And now we're focusing on sustaining it and scaling it further. On prior calls, we discussed our initiatives to retain more heat in the stockpiles. And those activities are continuing. A big driver of the success in the last several months has been on our Leach Everywhere work, where we're applying solution to areas of the stockpile which have not previously been leached.We're also conducting targeted drilling to inject solution to areas within the stockpile where solution may have been blocked over time. And our data and modeling can now provide information that targets specific areas of opportunity. And we're gearing up to do this more at scale. We now believe we can scale these activities and double the incremental copper to 400 million pounds per annum over time. This is just from applying our operating practices at a larger scale without relying on new technologies. We're also continuing our work on the new technologies front. And that's going to give us the opportunity with success to reach our ultimate goal of 800 million pounds per annum from this initiative over the next three to five years.Remind everybody we have 40 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles that's already been mined. This is not in our reserves. And it's an opportunity for us to get recovery from this copper that previously was thought to be waste material. This initiative has the best economics of anything in our portfolio given its low capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. And we're pursuing it very aggressively.Our productivities in the U.S., which I mentioned earlier, are focused on rebuilding the experience of our workforce. We've had a large number of new hires in recent years. And we need to rebuild our skills and experience, enhancing our practices to achieve better equipment performance and reliability, and taking advantage of new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened during the pandemic.By increasing our productivity in the U.S., we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year from our existing assets with limited capital investment. We're also continuing our work on a potential expansion of the Baghdad mine in Northwest Arizona. We're completing a feasibility study. And we're taking some steps now to enhance optionality for the future, including making some investments in autonomous haulage in our mining operations at Baghdad. And we're advancing investments in our tailing infrastructure for the future. We are setting up Baghdad expansion project as an option for the future. The timing of it will depend on market conditions. We're looking at the increased capital cost requirements for projects and consider that. We're also looking at the availability of labor. And we'll make all those reviews before finalizing our decision on the timing of this project. But it's a very large resource for us. We've got significant reserves spanning over 80 years there and a good opportunity for expansion in the future at the right time.We also have a major opportunity for expansion at El Abra mine in Chile. This is a very large resource that could support a concentrator on the size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde several years ago. We're retesting the economics to update project capital costs in light of the recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're planning investments in water infrastructure to support the current operation and provide optionality for the future.Again, this is about options for expansion at the right time. And we've got the portfolio with a lot of option value within the Freeport portfolio. Our Kucing Liar development in Grasberg is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production by 2030. The huge ore body ramping up to 550 million pounds of copper and 560,000 ounces of gold in the next decade. We're also conducting some additional exploration in the Grasberg district where we have identified some potential below our deep MLZ  Ph  ore body.We're continuing to advance discussions in Indonesia for extension beyond 2041. That would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. Longer-term, we're focused on a major opportunity that we have in the U.S. at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. And we continue to see the Safford District with the potential to add another cornerstone asset of scale in the U.S. We're in an outstanding position as we look at our large resource and reserve position and the experience of our team to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach. And we're going to be focused on executing projects so we can create value for shareholders.Slide seven provides our three year outlook for sales volumes. You'll see this is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've increased our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds. And that reflects the updated shipping schedules expected in Indonesia. There's no material changes in guidance for 2024 or 2025. We do believe we have some upside to these numbers with continued success in our leach efforts and our work on productivity enhancements in the U.S.We're turning to our regional data on slide eight. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. The Americas, including North America and South America, comprise about 63  of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales. Indonesia represents 37  of our copper sales and all of our gold sales. The Americas volumes are similar to a prior forecast. And our sales estimates from Indonesia have been increased to reflect the shipping schedules that I mentioned earlier.On a consolidated basis, our unit net cash costs for the year are forecast at  1.63 per pound. It's slightly above the prior forecast of  1.55,  0.07 of that relates to export duties, which remain under discussion with the Indonesian government. We've also incorporated some higher costs for energy compared with the prior forecast. And after moderating in the first half of the year, we're seeing energy costs, particularly for diesel fuel, rising. We're continuing to work to enhance productivity to mitigate the cost increases we've experienced since 2022, really across the board for labor, our contract maintenance services, equipment component costs, and a series of input costs that have risen. And we're working hard to try to mitigate those through effective cost management and productivity enhancements.Turning to cash flows on slide nine, we model our results for EBITDA and cash flow for 2024 and 2025 showing a price range of four to five dollar copper. We've got sensitivities on the page so you can use for looking at the changes based on changes in input costs or copper prices. The annual EBITDA would range under these scenarios from nearly ten billion dollars per annum at four dollar copper to fourteen billion dollars at five dollar copper and operating cash flows would range from seven to ten billion dollars under these assumptions.With long live reserves and large scale production, we're well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth and that will provide opportunities for organic investments and cash returns under our performance based payout framework.On slide 10, we show our current forecast for capital expenditures for 2023 and 2024. 3.2 billion total for 2023 is similar to our prior estimate and our capital for 2024 is 3.9 billion compared with the prior estimate of 3.8 billion.For 2024, we've added some discretionary capital to commence a new project in Indonesia to transition our energy source from coal to clean air LNG over the next three to four years and we expect to start that project next year. The discretionary projects total a little less than  2 billion over 2023 and 2024. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50  of available cash that's not distributed. We've got some details on those projects in the reference materials.Slide 11, we've included some updated pictures of the smelter project in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking. It's being executed very efficiently. We're making steady progress toward completion. For the Greenfield smelter, we're now 84  complete on construction and we expect to begin commissioning the project by the middle of next year and ramping up to full production by the end of the year.We're also nearing completion of an expansion project that we're doing with our partner to expand the existing smelter in Indonesia. We expect construction to be completed by the end of this year in 2023. We're really pleased with the strong execution of our internal project team and our outside contractor to contain costs and meet schedules in a very complex environment for major project development.On slide 12, I just wanted to update you on some climate initiatives. We published an updated climate report during the third quarter, which is available on our website. But I mentioned in Indonesia we're advancing plans to develop, to transition our coal to LNG. We have plans to develop a 265 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle facility and that would replace the coal units that were developed there over 25 years ago. The project has a cost of roughly  1 billion and the economics, as we looked at it, would eliminate the cost to refurbish and expand the existing coal units over time.The incremental economic cost of this project is roughly  400 million. Importantly, the transition would reduce significantly PT-FI's greenhouse gas emissions. And together with other initiatives PT-FI has undertaken, the total reduction would be on the order of 60  compared to the 2018 baseline. It's a very exciting project for us looking forward. We're also very pleased to report that we have a new power purchase agreement in Peru at Cerro Verde that will allow Cerro Verde the benefit of 100  of its power from renewable sources in 2026.And finally, on slide 13, we wanted to reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is strong. We've got strong credit metrics, significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. At the same time, we've distributed over  3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, and we have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. We've got to continue to focus on the current situation, though, and we're going to continue to monitor current market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our team is really experienced in navigating challenging conditions while maintaining a focus on pursuing long-term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely, and efficiently.That concludes our prepared remarks, and we appreciate all your attention and interest, and we'll now take your questions.Operator Instructions  The first question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.Yes, morning, Richard and Kathleen. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on U.S. operations. Could you maybe discuss the cost performance there  That seems like it's a little bit higher than guidance and how you see that going forward.And then secondly, just on production, just so I understand, production this  Indiscernible  is about 340 million pounds. Does that include the incremental 46 million pounds from the new leaching  Is that all in the U.S.  And I guess if so, that sort of implies that production without those pounds would be below 300 versus like 370 million last year. So, maybe just some comments around that and how you see the leaching, impacting the production profile there going forward. Thanks.Thanks, Alex. I mean, your question is right in terms of the performance in the U.S. of the base business. We're continuing to experience some challenges on productivity. We've got, we've been hiring people. We've got a lot of new people in our workforce. And so we're very focused on improving the productivity in the U.S. We're focused on maintenance. We've had some challenges with premature failures and some maintenance challenges that we're getting caught up on. We've also had a lot of increased costs related to component parts. We've had some increases in the cost of labor, particularly contract labor. You've probably seen all the activity in Arizona outside of copper with a lot of investment in various industries. It's a very competitive market. So the cost rises in North America have been higher than what we've experienced elsewhere. Of course, we've also had the benefit in international locations of the stronger dollar, which offset some of the labor cost impact. So you see that more in the U.S. But you're right that without the leach pounds, the incremental leach pounds that we accomplished year-to-date, we would have had lower production. And what we need to do is really get both of those flywheels going at the same time because the more we place, and we've been missing some of our placements in terms of the mining rates and the placements on the leach piles, the more opportunity we have to get more out of it through these leach initiatives. So it's a big focus of Josh and our whole team to really work on getting productivity up. If you look at grades, we're in a period right now at Morenci where we've got low grades. And the hallmark of Freeport has been to manage costs very well, given the low grades we have. But we've got to work our way through that and get our flywheel moving again to get productivity up.In terms of the leach pounds and the impact on cost, what really needs to happen with the leach project to really start seeing the impact on unit cost is enough confidence to be able to increase our reserves. And that will allow us to essentially, in the financial results, see lower unit costs as we add reserves and we're spreading costs over a larger number of pounds that economy of scale will start to come through. So the more confidence we get in this, the more we're able to actually put these opportunities into reserves and have enough confidence to do that, that's when you'll start to see the impact on the net unit cash costs. But I don't know if that was a long answer, but did that answer your questionYes, that was a great answer, Kathleen. I really appreciate all the color. Thanks so much and good luck with everything.Thanks, Alex.Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Hi, Richard. Hi Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about El Abra, which has tremendous potential. You've talked about it for a long time. You could build a big mill project there. With the clarity now around Chilean mining taxes, I would assume that's helpful. And also, I'm not sure if you've looked into the recent double taxation treaty, which I think for U.S. companies makes Chile potentially a more attractive investment. So wondering first kind of how you're thinking about that now and what we can sort of expect if you do progress in this project in terms of timing, capital cost scale, and then maybe as importantly, your partner's ability to help fund whatever you develop there, because I assume it's going to be a capital intensive project. I'm not sure Codelco has the capital to contribute alongside you with this. So how should we think about that  And again, does that double taxation treaty between Chile and the U.S. affect the economics of this project to potentially drive an investment decision  Thank you.Thanks, Chris. Both of those items that you mentioned, the recent clarity around taxation in Chile and the issue between the treaty between the U.S. and Chile are both helpful. Quite frankly, if that hadn't been resolved, the latter had not been resolved, that would have posed a big challenge for us in developing the project. But that's been resolved. And so now we're really turning to the economic side of the equation. And we've been watching what's been going on in Chile with other major projects. We did a lot of work on this project, on the El Abra project, and it has good economics, but we want to retest those economics with current capital costs. And that'll be something that we've already started working on, but that's something we really want to get our heads around is, does it make sense  What's the timing given rising capital costs  I mean, you've seen really significant cost blowouts in Chile in recent time. And we want to make sure that we can deploy capital effectively, efficiently in this market. And as Richard was talking about, the copper price today doesn't really support new investment, and so - of significance. And so our focus really has been in this kind of environment on what we can do to be less capital intensive while continuing to advance our options and create optionality in the portfolio. Our plans in Chile currently are to invest in some water infrastructure, desalinization project that would allow us to extend the life of the current operation, and then that would give us optionality for the bigger expansion. And so what we're really doing now is trying to advance these things so we have optionality, but we're not wanting to commit to major, major, multi-billion dollar projects in the current environment. We all see this looming deficit coming, but the current prices just don't support big new investments like this at the current time. We know that will change over time and we want to be prepared at the right time to bring this project on.Permitting takes quite a while and Chile is on trying to streamline permitting. We're encouraged by that. In terms of the Codelco question on financing, they're very positive about the project and they've indicated to us support for it at the right time and we'll figure out financing this at the right time when we go forward. But right now we don't have to make that decision.That is very helpful. Thank you.Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.Good morning, Mike.I'm going to be following up on some of the other questions. I get the sense that access to labor, contracting, rising interest rates, raising the hurdle rates for capital investment, do you think that this has pushed out whatever expectations of maybe Freeport s longer-term or medium term investments or the industry's investments given these dynamics, especially the copper price, which as you indicated, I think everybody agrees, wouldn't support this type of investmentRichard, do you want to take that oneSure. I think there's no question about it, Mike. As I said, our revenues and those of other copper producers are correlated to prices. As I talk with a lot of people, and I was just at LME last week, I was with a group of senators and congressmen in Washington the night before last. With the new cost structure, people's historical views of copper prices need to be adjusted. I mean, at one point,  3.50 or  4.00 copper price was considered to be a very strong price, but with the effects of inflation, it's not the same.And so you have to look at both of those together. And then the thing that's really striking to us, and you can see this in a number of other projects by companies around the world, is that capital costs inflation is significant and persistent. You can see from our own numbers, particularly when diesel costs dropped earlier, they've ticked up again some. But I thought we had good performance with our operating cost measures. But then when you get into this issue of major projects, the capital costs are really significant. We really are motivated to invest because we have strong conviction about the future of copper prices, but at the same time, history has taught us that it's best to be prudent in the way we commit capital.You might could incrementally improve returns if you were more aggressive near term, but we retain all these projects. We don't lose the opportunity, but we, and I believe others, are going to be prudent until they see how this current situation around the world with China and inflation and central banks activities, and now we've got the increasingly complication of geopolitical events going on. And that's why I made my comment at the outset that this does nothing but bolster the future supply deficit that the industry is facing.So it's a two-edged sword. We'd like to go forward, but we've concluded it's best to be prudent. And with the industry, I believe others will as well, and that just means that supplies are going to be limited for the future, the time when copper demand will be growing.It sounds like discretion is the better part of valor. Thank you, Richard.Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Oris Waukadal  Ph  with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning.Good morning.I'm wondering if you can share any expected timeline for reaching any kind of conclusion in Indonesia with respect to the new export royalty rates and potentially the life extension there beyond 41.Well, the issue on the duty, you're talking about the duty, the situation there is that, as you're aware, our IUPK says that we're not subject to duties once the smelter gets over 50 . And the government issued some new regulations earlier this year, and this not just applies to Freeport, but all exporters for copper that are required to have smelters that are required to pay a 7.5  duty. And it's a sliding scale depending on how much progress you've made. We have raised the issue with the government, and they are reviewing the issue. They're also reviewing our progress of the smelter, and we're going to continue to work cooperatively with them. I want to just remind everyone that there's alignment of interest to a large degree there because the Indonesian government state-owned company owns 51  of PT-FI, and also PT-FI pays taxes. So the impact to the government of these export duties is also a significant item.So we've got support from our partner there to help us work through this issue with the government, and we're going to continue to -- I don't have a definitive timeline, but we're continuing to engage in discussions to address this. The extension discussions are also continuing. Our partner, MIND ID, is also very supportive of extending the operation. One of the really significant benefits that we've had in the new structure since 2018 where the government owns 51  is there is a better understanding of the time it takes to develop new resources or extend the resources. And so I think all the parties are aligned in that it makes sense to continue this operation beyond 2041.We made a lot of progress in developing a framework with the government on what the terms of that extension would be. A big catalyst for us is getting the smelter advanced and completed, and that, I think, would be a good catalyst for us to be able to continue to extend those operations out for the life of this resource. But conversations are ongoing. Indonesia is in an election cycle now, and so there are other things going on in the government. The government has a lot of priorities that they're balancing. But in terms of the want to and will of getting this extended to be able to continue the benefits that are very significant to the government of Indonesia and the people of Papua, there is good support for doing this. And we're working very hard to try to get it done as soon as possible, but the timeline is not under our control.Thank you for the color.Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Yes, good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So the question I have is really on the discussion on the Indonesian funding, the Indonesian projects funding. Just to revisit, the smelter is now being paid by proceeds from the PT-FI senior notes and the revolving credit line. I just wanted to check if that is something that will continue as it is right now, and what about the funding for the other CapEx projects, KL, and other expansion of the Crusher and the new SAG mill there. Is that going to also be paid by these senior nodes and the internal cash regeneration  Or do you expect your non-controlling partners to contribute cash for those projects  And then maybe associated with this is how should we think about the dividends paid to non-controlling interest going forwardWith respect to your question on the first topic, the Smelter project is being debt financed. And so we raised  3 billion in financing last year in long-term bond financing at the PT-FI level. So the economics of that, even though it's consolidated on FCX's financial statements, the economics essentially are borne by PT-FI shareholders. And we have a revolving credit facility as well to supplement that. So the Smelter, and that's why we look at it separately, it doesn't impact the cash flow we have at the FCX level that's available for distribution because it's being funded through these proceeds.With respect to other capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded internally at the PT-FI level. So when we look at the projects we're doing to complete the new SAG mill, when we look at the copper cleaner project, all of the capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded with that subsidiary's internally generated cash flows, which is very significant. And so, yes, as you increase capital there, it does reduce the dividends that come out of PT-FI. But these are really good projects that PT-FI has the ability to fund with its cash flows and distribute substantial amounts to its shareholders.In terms of the dividends there, that's really a function of what the performance of the business is. We have a policy, a dividend policy at the PT-FI level where all of the available cash flow is distributed to shareholders and FCX gets 49  of that and MIND ID gets 51 . But that's the policy that we're following and expect to continue to follow.All right. Thank you, Kathleen.Your next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Yes. Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. And nice job on execution given all the challenges out there. My first question is actually a bigger picture question tying to an earlier question. So, if you take into account this broader inflationary environment, increased project financing cost, I guess where does pricing need to be and how sustained does that need to be for Freeport and maybe even industry if you want to comment on that, but specifically for Freeport to support projects such as Baghdad expansion or El-Abra as examplesWell, we're updating our capital costs now for El-Abra. Previously when we ran the economics several years ago, it's been a few years ago before the pandemic when we outlined the potential for the project, today's price would have worked fine. It would have been a good return. But there were other factors that led us to put the project on hold. In today's world, we need to retest those economics. I mean, just look at the recent project in Chile of how much that cost increased and it's a huge, multi-billion dollar impact. And that impacts our thinking and that impacts economics. So, we don t think we know the economics we ran previously don't apply currently.And so, we've been doing some work, we've been doing some additional work on the resource and we've got some positive things that have developed since then that will help the economics, but this capital cost inflation is a real issue and it's something that we need to keep in mind.On the Baghdad project, this is a project that with El-Abra, these are new reserves. So with El-Abra, it would allow us to produce reserves currently in the ground where we don't currently have infrastructure that can produce those reserves. At El-Abra, I mean at Baghdad, it's a different analysis. At Baghdad, we can produce those reserves over 80 years or we can double our processing capacity and produce those reserves over a shorter period of time. And so you have to look at the capital cost and how that interplays with it being an acceleration of production rather than new production.So we're looking, we're completing the feasibility study. The costs we believe are going to come in higher than what we expected them to and so that will have an impact on us. The other thing that will have an impact on our decision will be the availability of labor and whether we can execute that project efficiently. We're doing some things now to create options. We got the autonomous plans to put in autonomous haulage at Baghdad. It's our first mine in the U.S. that will do that and that's exciting for us and that creates options for us in the future. And we're doing some work, some early works to give us options there. But the numbers don't work. I think if you ask people in the industry, what it takes, people are going to tell you it's over  4 to develop new projects.But every project is different and that's why when we look at this leach opportunity, the potential to add 800 million pounds of copper with very low capital costs is very compelling and so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the near term during this uncertainty to expand our production but it's going to be through innovation, automation rather than high capital intensity. And we'll continue to test that and that will continue to evolve but that's the current thinking is that right now the copper price is not enough to support a major investment in a big expansion or a greenfield project.Well understood and thanks for that color. I guess just on the second question on working capital, so how should we think about the cadence of working capital through the balance of the year given exports have now resumed in Indonesia  Are you still expecting a slight use for the yearYes, it's a use but we expect some of that will turn in the fourth quarter. Some of what we had in terms of the inventories and receivables will turn but we are expecting a use for the year.Okay, terrific. Thank you.Let me just add one quick. Hang on, let me just add one quick comment to support what Kathleen is saying. People, and I understand it if you're doing overall industry analysis, you're looking for what is the incentive price that triggers new production but Kathleen made the point that each project is different and then each company's situation is different. One of the strong things about our business is that because of our production levels, our resource base, our ability to add to production with things like leaching but beyond that more with being more efficient with technology working our assets harder and so forth.We don't face the same pressures from reinvestment risk that some other companies face but also other commodities face because of shorter reserve lives. And that's one thing I like so much about our business is that it gives us that flexibility to not have to take risks, not have to press things during uncertain economic times but as I mentioned earlier, to be just more prudent about how we run our business. It's a great strength of our industry to a certain degree, but of Freeport as a company, because of our strong production base and long-lived  Ph  properties and the ability to maximize production out of our existing properties by doing things smarter and using technology and working assets harder.Thank you, Richard.Our next question will come from the line of Alex Terentiew with Stifel. Please go ahead.Hey, good afternoon or morning, everybody. Just two quick questions for me. First, I just wanted to follow up some of the comments here on Indonesia with the smelter export duty. Any changes, latest changes in the regulations that would change your view on whether you expect the export duty to go to zero once the smelter is builtAnd then the second question, just circling back on the leach expansion, 800 million pounds over, if you can get there in three to five years, I mean, that's a pretty impressive number. I just wanted to get some more details from you if I could, just on the cost for that. I mean, the U.S. operations have been running around, call it, 270 a pound or so. Is that a fair cost for us as well  Or, I mean, would the operating cost be higher but much lower capital costs  Just trying to get a sense of what the upside is for that sort of potential.Yes. On the duty issue, the duties are paid on concentrate exports. So, once we get the smelter done and ramped up, we will have no more exports of concentrates. We'll be, we'll be producing copper cathode and gold, the actual metals. So the export duty only applies to this intermediate, step of concentrates. So, there hasn't been anything in terms of we're still working with the government. Right now, the export license is through May. And so, we've still got to work with the government to work through this issue beyond May of having a ramp up period. We'll still be shipping some concentrates, exporting some concentrates during the ramp up. But we're going to work cooperatively with the government to make sure that those that continuity continues.With respect to the leach pounds, not every application is the same. But on average, we expect these leach pounds to come in at roughly a dollar per pound. And so, that is, that's why we're so excited. Most of this is in our U.S. business. And so, it'll bring down, if we're successful, and we're able to put this into our reserves, it'll bring down our average cost in the U.S. over time. And I'll just ask, Corey Stevens on the line, and he and his team are leading this initiative. And just wanted to ask Corey if there's anything that we didn't cover on leaching that you want to make points of that hasn't been discussed so far.Yes, Kathleen. I guess the one thing I would just add or maybe just emphasize is some of the, the momentum that's been able to build around this effort, really around these executable known technologies has been significant. And so, we've been building, quarter-over-quarter. And now we've got line of sight to the 200 million. But really, the portfolio gives us sustainability going forward into the future and builds this foundation that, I can see it significantly building from there. And then you've got a whole other portfolio of innovation work, whether it's additives or alternate flow sheets or, really leveraging temperature at that next level that the team is really excited about. So super focused on disciplined execution, that the team is super energized, and looking forward to the future.Yes. And so there's a lot of value in this opportunity. And we see it, we can feel it. And we're pressing forward. But as we talked about earlier, we've got to get that going, at the same time we get our productivity, our key performance indicators improved in the U.S. And that's a big focus as well. So those two things we believe will generate a lot of value in our U.S. business and it's not capital intensive. So that's really our primary focus right now is on getting those two things going at the same time. And we've made great progress on the leach front. We're making progress on the productivity initiative front, but we've got more work to do there.Yes, those are impressive numbers on the production and the cost front. So best of luck to you and your team.Thanks Alex.Your final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question just goes back to the export duty. The 147 million you incurred this quarter, two things, I assume that going retroactive back to March 29th when it technically was scaled down. So you're sort of paying two quarters. And the second thing is the text talks about incurring it. Have you actually paid it on a cash basis or is it just a payable as you kind of sign work through all thisIt was a go forward duty. So it wasn't based on retroactive. So go forward duty. And 7.5  of the exports values were assessed. Some of it's been paid, some of it's not been paid. And there's a process in Indonesia where just like any other process where you have disputed amounts or amounts that you're objecting to, you can go through a process and pay it, but you pay it with that advisory that it remains disputed. But for financial accounting purposes, given just the uncertainty of how it would all play out, we have accrued those costs. And so we've expensed those as we go. If it gets resolved, that'll get favorably, it'll get reversed. But at this point, we're accruing for these costs pending the ultimate outcome.Great, thanks. Just to be clear, because last quarter, yes, I'll follow up with David. Because just last quarter, the export duties were zero on the cost per pound. So that's why I was just trying to figure out exactly how this is working. Yes. I can follow up with David.Just remember, Brian, we weren t exporting for a fairly substantial period of time there. We had this administrative delay for even having any exports. And that's when our inventory built up so much, we were able to sell it down. But we went for, what was it, Kathleen, about six weeks without having any exports. And so the duty is paid when it s export.Yes, the new regulation didn't come out to June, July time frame. And so the second quarter, we didn't have duties. It was this June 10th date that triggered some new regulations. So you're right that we didn't have duties in the second quarter. So the duties that you're seeing in the third quarter relate to the third quarter shipments.Great. Thanks very much. That's very clear. And thank you, Richard. That's very helpful as well.Thank you.With that, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.Well, thanks everyone for your participation. And we're available if anybody has any questions or comments. And just talk to David. And we'll look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress.Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Flight-To-Safety Assets: Are They Really Safe?,"Nothing like the threat of Armageddon to bring people back to their gold-buying senses. What legions of companies advertising the legendary appeal of gold could not accomplish since the May 2023 peak of around  2070 per ounce, a savage attackOn January 21, 1980, the price of gold hit an all-time  at that time  high of  850 an ounce. Back then, there were plenty of good reasons, as appear to be the case today, to own gold and to shun stocks. On February 13, 1980, the Dow Jones Industrials closed at 903.84. Today, gold closed at  1996.00. The Dow closed at 33,035.93. BTW, during that 43-year period, gold never paid a penny in dividends.I know these are particularly disconcerting times for all of us, but I would urge caution before making an investment in gold. The end of the world is a very rare event.Bitcoin is a mystery to me. First, I have never seen a coherent argument as to why, with its volatility, it would be considered a currency or medium of exchange. Secondly, what is it backed by  I know on the dollar that the answer  full faith and credit  of the United States doesn't hold water with many, but  has been a feature of the world economy for many years, and it appears to be relatively stable and does the job in settling transactions.Yes, there is a scarcity factor with cryptocurrency. The vast array of cryptocurrency alternatives somewhat mutes the scarcity argument. Why would you want to own it unless you thought there would be someone down the road willing to pay you more for this electronic, albeit secure  supposedly , token than you paid for it. It appears to be a risk asset without the asset backing or revenue-generating ability of most common stocks.It does not seem to be a safe store of value either. If you paid  60,000.00 for one Bitcoin in December 2021, you might be a bit wary of that claim. If you did, hopefully you don't need that money for some other purpose today.Finally, there has been much speculation about the SEC allowing the creation and sale of an exchange-traded fund  ETF  that invests in cybercurrencies. The SEC continues to ponder the question. .   CNBCIf allowed, the cryptocurrencies would definitely pop, but nothing I've said above will have changed. Again, lacking understanding of the crypto world, my only response would be it appears in the future misery will love company.Since the bottom of the bear market that ended in March, 2009, everytime the alarm bells were sounded on potential economic weakness or geopolitical risks, buyers would show up for the 10-year, pushing the price up and the yield down. That has not happened this time, as the yield on the 10-year has pierced 5  on the upside. This would not be the case unless there were confidence on the part of the sellers that the economy was in pretty good shape  besides 'higher for longer' ... also, as horrible as the current Israeli Palestinian war is, it would indicate that there appears to be comfort that it will not widen.The weakness  selling with the yield rising  in the Treasury would not seem to be symptomatic of fear, a flight to safety or the overall extreme negativity in the media or investing public.I have seen numbers that indicate as much as 60-75  of daily stock trading activity comes from computer-generated, algorithmic trading. These are not thoughtful human beings parsing out the information but machines programed to search for key words or phrases and act on them. There is absolutely no discernment going on here. When the computer reads  higher for longer,   equating to recession or economic weakness  it might be a seller of economically sensitive stocks and a buyer of names that might be immune to weakness in the economy  wink wink, tech and . This is eerily familiar as the type of trading activity we saw after Covid-19 burst upon the scene. It is also reminiscent of the  era of the 1970s. The wise thing to do now, as it was in those two instances, is to reverse the current computer play... sell Mag-7 and buy economically sensitive.Never has there been a more glaring mismatch of the facts on the ground for energy and the current trading pattern on the commodity and energy stocks. After the Hamas weekend raid on Israel on October 7, West Texas Intermediate crude spiked  3 a barrel the next Monday, closing at  85.97. That seemed to be an overreaction based on how the facts on the ground have changed dramatically since the first Arab Oil Embargo 50 years ago. However, the computers and human commodity traders knee-jerk reacted differently. As clearer heads have prevailed, the price of WTI has drifted back to  84.80. It now trades back and forth on economic slowdown concerns from the US and abroad, tempered by the continuing developments in the Middle East.All of this totally ignores a secular change in the way oil-producing countries and companies have decided to run their businesses. With the continuing emphasis on moving to cleaner energy, these companies and countries have addressed and answered the question,  What do you do when your gravy train begins to dry up  The answer is  stop investing in new production, curtail investment in existing fields, and maximize and redirect cash flow. This is why oil prices should remain reasonably stable, if not gradually increase. This is not a new topic for Kort Sessions. On June 6, 2021, we published .There is clear evidence of this inclination in two recently announced major energy transactions   and .Exxon  and Chevron  are the gatekeepers. They are buying cheap reserves in the ground and will decide if and when to develop them. If this continues, the oil industry will began to look like the airline oligopoly. The carriers  oil companies  control the seats and routes  production  with the idea of keeping the planes full and profitable. Unbelievably, I've not heard of this issue being raised by the media. Nonetheless, if allowed to go forward, with most of the players not really seeing the bigger picture, it should be a big plus for the energy sector.Today, market participants were selling supposed guaranteed safe bonds  this shouldn't be happening unless the economy is doing better than expected . The recent upheaval in the Middle East and fear of recession should mean that Treasuries should get a strong bid. Stocks  including Mag-7  are declining, while gold and crypto continue in the ascendent. The Mag-7 stock decline makes sense  way overbought and over-owned and, in some cases, overvalued . The carnage in mid-cap, value and small-cap stocks does not make sense. Ascendant cryptocurrency and gold do not make sense with the yield on the 10-year heading north.I'm confused.Are you",32,2023-10-26T07:30:00.000-04:00
Wacker Chemie AG (WKCMF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Wacker Chemie AG  Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 10 00 AM ETJoerg Hoffmann - Head, IRChristian Hartel - CEO   PresidentTobias Ohler - CFOThomas Swoboda - Societe GeneraleRikin Patel - BNP Paribas ExaneCharles Webb - Morgan StanleyChetan Udeshi - JPMorgan Chase   Co.Andreas Heine - StifelJaideep Pandya - On Field Investment ResearchWelcome to the Wacker Chemie AG Conference Call Q3 2023.  Operator Instructions . Now I hand over to Joerg Hofmann, Head of Investor Relations.Thank you, operator. Welcome to the Wacker Chemie AG conference call on our Q3 2023 results. Dr. Christian Hartel, CEO, and Dr. Tobias Ohler, our CFO, will take you through our prepared slides momentarily. The press release, Q3 presentation and detailed financial tables are available on our web page under the Investor Relations. Please note that management comments made during this call include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements in today's press release, the presentation and our recent annual report regarding risk factors. All documents mentioned are available on our website. ChrisHi. Welcome, everyone. Group sales reached EUR 1.5 billion with an EBITDA of EUR 152 million. Both are down sequentially and year-over-year, declining prices in solar grade poly and commodity silicones were the biggest contributors to this decrease. Across the board, the chemical industry reported low demand for its products, while the pressure from imports inflation and high energy costs remained high. We do not see a recovery in demand over the last quarter. As a result, our managing on chemicals today is essentially unchanged. And since the presentation of our second quarter results at the end of July. In silicones, we faced weak demand for specialties without an economic recovery. We pushed volumes into standard gradesIn , we are actively integrating the ADL and Wacker teams at the site in . With the acquisition, we gained access to much needed fermentation capacities to serve the growing demand to sustainably produce dietary and food ingredients. As expected, costs for the upcoming mRNA facility and digitization projects held back earnings. Polysillicon delivered a positive double-digit EBITDA figure despite China's low market price for solar-grade polysillicon. Demand for our solar polysillicon outstrips our contractually evaluable volumes this and next year. Yet a potential part of our volumes remain under legacy terms tied to the China domestic index. Our semi business remained resilient, seeing both solid prices and volumes. We saw strong demand from our semi customers committing to very long supply agreements. This summer, we announced that we will increase our hedging capacities for semi by 50 . When good for order in 2025, this will allow us to improve our mix further and increase the resilience of polysillicon. Looking at our sustainability initiatives. Baker was recently nominated as one of the finalists for the German Sustainability Award in the chemicals category. While conserving energy and resources has always been a top priority at Wacker, we have increased our commitments and aim to achieve net 0 by 2045. This nomination recognizes our efforts already made to reach this ambitious target. We see a strong business case for sustainability. Wacker's long-term success depends on providing sustainable and innovative solutions to our customers. Sustainability keeps us focused on efficiency and strengthens our relationships with key customers. I'm happy that our external stakeholders and pain partners increasingly recognize our activities. One brokerage recently named Baker, an ESG leader in their coverage universe. Thank you for recognizing our efforts here. Looking at the next page now, our guidance. We see full year EBITDA at the lower end of the earnings range which we communicated in July. We expect EBITDA between EUR 800 million and EUR 900 million with sales of about EUR 6.5 billion. Markets have been weaker than we expected. Our customers remain cautious. In polymers, we face uncertainty from the construction markets. In silicones, order intake is not showing improvements. We continue to have limited visibility in both segments with our customers shifting to just-in-time order. This makes it difficult for us regarding both production planning and forecasting. Even though we continue to face considerable headwinds, I'm confident we will successfully tackle the challenges ahead. We have an excellent team at Wacker. But more, we are well placed strategically. Our strategy 2030 provides us with goals, faster growth, high profitability and better resilience in light of constant change. While adapting our modular investment strategy to the changing environment, we remain committed to the path. We continue to grow in the regions close to our customers. We recently announced a new EUR 150 million specialty silicone investment in China will be ready for order in the second half of 2025. Sanjiang, one of the Wacker's largest fully integrated production sites. From here, we supply the rapidly growing Chinese market with a wide area of downstream silicon products such as sealants, customers, margins and fluids. And two weeks ago, we actually celebrated 30 years of Wacker being in China. We continue to drive our business sustainable development forward. Investment in our future growth is vital to realizing the opportunities ahead of us. But major challenges persist. In addition to weak demand, the combination of unfavorable German policy choices and the fallout from geopolitical events such as the war in Ukraine, keep energy costs up. We believe the conflict in the Middle East will result in higher uncertainty and may delay in economic recovery. Energy intensive industries in Germany remain burdened by high power costs and supply needs to be more secure. We see that renewables will answer this problem, but we need short-term measures to support the industry through this transitional period. In Berlin and Brussels, much talk has been about an industry power price and the reshoring of critical raw materials and industries. Unfortunately, until now, it remains only talk while other regions act. Now to Tobias for details on Q3 results.Thank you, Chris. Welcome, everybody. For the third quarter, we reported sales of EUR 1.5 billion, down nearly 30  year-over-year. We continue to see weak end market conditions, low demand for specialties weight on utilization rates, particularly in silicones. While polymers also saw weak demand, we continued to benefit from net pricing. polysillicon saw much lower prices for solar grade materials due to overcapacities in China. High energy prices continued to burden us, particularly in Germany, globally, this year's energy bill will still be twice as high as before the hike last year. All these effects work their way through the P L from top to bottom. The gross profit margin was 13 , down from almost 23  last year. EBITDA contracted to EUR 152 million earnings per share came in at EUR 0.56. During these challenging market conditions, we have increased our focus on controlling costs and are implementing additional short-term measures on top of our existing programs. This covers personnel costs, technical spending, direct materials and all discretionary spend. We must consider all options to run as efficiently as possible. As Chris mentioned, we now see our group full year sales and EBITDA in the bottom half of the communicated ranges. I will walk you through our expectations for each segment after I address the balance sheet on the next page. Our balance sheet shows strong financials with about EUR 1.4 billion in liquidity and about EUR 4.7 billion in shareholder equity. Our net working capital position is about EUR 100 million lower than at the end of last year. We have achieved meaningful reductions in inventory as we continue to reduce our stock levels. We actively work with key suppliers to match our needs with current market conditions. As our sales grew rapidly, we invested significantly in working capital over the past 2 years, as demand slows and prices received, we expect this to unwind supporting cash flow. Our financial borrowings have been constant at about EUR 1.5 billion in the last couple of years. with similar levels of liquidity. This has resulted in a net interest charge of EUR 15 million to EUR 20 million annually this year, we will end with a positive net interest figure of around EUR 5 million. Essentially, this comes from increased deposit rates while interest rates on borrowings were fixed in time and remains the same. Our financing portfolio is well diversified across lenders with maturities between 2024 and 2030. We are solidly financed with EUR 1.4 billion in liquidity and fully undrawn syndicated loans of EUR 600 million. Moving on to silicones. Sales decreased to about EUR 670 million down nearly 25  year-over-year. The decline was mainly due to much lower specialty volumes and due to prices in standards. Sequentially, sales were somewhat lower. We see continued weak demand in all regions and some negative pricing effects in some specialty products. Silicones EBITDA was unchanged compared to the preceding quarter at about EUR 50 million. No output and high silicon metal costs helped back earnings as with the preceding 3 quarters. With low demand in specialties, our product mix adversely moved towards a higher share of standards. We have updated our silicone outlook. From today's perspective, we do not see a demand recovery in the fourth quarter of this year and rather assume year-end management of some customers. With a low volume turnover, headwinds from trailing higher raw material costs continue longer than anticipated. While we have reduced our silicon metal stock position significantly work still needs to be done here. We now expect full year sales between EUR 2.7 billion and EUR 2.8 billion with an EBITDA margin of about 8  versus our previous margin expectation of around 10 . Polymers reported sales at just below EUR 400 million, down around 20  year-over-year. Sequentially, sales were down about 5  at similar volumes. The much lower revenues were driven by the development of selling prices, which we adjusted to reflect our raw material costs. Despite demand remaining particularly weak in Europe, the EBITDA was much higher year-over-year and at the same level as the preceding quarter. As a reminder, the previous year's quarter was held back by a planned turnaround. The main factors driving the consistently strong results throughout 2023 has been net pricing and our efforts to defend margins. For the full year, we have left our polymers outlook unchanged. We expect sales between EUR 1.6 billion and EUR 1.7 billion with an EBITDA margin of around 17 . Despite considerably lower volumes, our absolute full year EBITDA will be comparable to last year's record result. Although polymers demand has stabilized recently, we remain cautious about European construction markets. In BioSolutions, sales came in at EUR 77 million. Lower prices and volumes for some established chemical products offset sales growth in biopharma. As in our Chemicals segment, we see weak demand and inventory management of our customers for these products. EBITDA in the third quarter was minus EUR 3 million, earnings continue to be burdened by upfront costs related to the German pandemic preparedness plan. For the full year, we have updated our BioSolution sales outlook. Demand has been weaker than expected. We now forecast a low single-digit percentage sales growth down from a high single digit previously. Our EBITDA forecast is unchanged. We expect a result below last year. Please remember that we carry substantial costs today from our new M A center in Halle and will see revenues in mid-2024. While we currently see a challenging funding environment for many smaller biotechnology companies, we continue to see a strong growth outlook for advanced medicines. Thousands of new molecules are under new development and will need a CDMO partner such as Wacker to bring these therapies to market. In polysillicon, we reported third quarter sales of about EUR 340 million. EBITDA came in at EUR 46 million. Compared to the preceding quarter, both sales and earnings contracted meaningfully. This was primarily due to the steep fall in the market prices for solar-grade polysillicon in China at the end of the second quarter of this year. Another factor was lower volumes in the third quarter as maintenance in our U.S. facility resulted in lower output. The solar market is now differentiating product by origin. We expect this trend to continue, and we see more demand for our polysillicon than we currently contractually have available. We still have significant contractual exposure to the Chinese domestic market price today. We are actively addressing this and work to change nearly all our solar volumes to the ex-China price by the end of next year. We have updated our polysillicon outlook. We now see sales at about EUR 1.6 billion and an EBITDA between EUR 300 million and EUR 350 million. The lower range is due to the lower volumes as we perform maintenance in the U.S. facility and due to trailing price effects from the end of Q3 market price indices. Looking at our net financial debt, Page 10. The first 9 months of this year, we generated approximately EUR 630 million in cash flow from operations. Our cash conversion improved markedly compared to last year, where inflationary pressures resulted in a significant investment in working capital. We see this now unwinding with raw material prices declining. Cash flow from investing activities came in at EUR 550 million, primarily representing investments and M A as we expand our capabilities and capacities in line with our 2030 strategy. Including the dividend payment of about EUR 600 million in May, we ended the first 9 months with a low net debt of about EUR 160 million. So yes, our investments are high at a time of weak demand. On the one hand, these investments represent decisions taken before the slowdown, but they also include recent decisions. I see this as a clear sign of confidence in our markets. We want to be prepared when market conditions improve and markets pick up. We are completing maintenance today and making the needed investments to support our customers' growing demand for innovative and sustainable solutions. These new capacities will allow us to service our customers better once demand recovers. As Chris said, our development work with customers continues to expand further and improve our specialties portfolio. So let me wrap it up before we start with the Q A. We continue to see challenging markets. The anticipated recovery is delayed, and our visibility still remains low. This makes both internal planning and external communications demanding. I expect many of you will be looking for comments on how 2024 may develop. We will stick to our usual approach to guidance. We will communicate our 2024 full guidance when we publish our full year 2020 fee results in March next year.Operator, we are ready now to begin the Q A.Operator Instructions . And the first question comes from the line of Thomas Swoboda from Societe General.Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions, please. Firstly, on 2024, I perfectly respect that you don't want to give guidance. So it would be very helpful if you could discuss the building blocks, you might be seeing already for next year  My second question is on your legacy quality silicon contracts in China, you have repeated today that you are looking into those contracts. My question is regarding the progress. Have you made any progress on revising those contracts during the quarter. Thank you.Thomas, to be honest here, yes, you are digging into 2024. But as I said, it's too early for guidance, but what you can read from our outlook for the year-end is obviously, we assume a slow start into next year. And if you translate that a slow start into the year, that obviously also means a weaker first half is likely. The second item would be the discussion on our input costs on, mainly on raws. Raws should come in lower as we had seen a decline throughout the year, obviously, but watch out. And you know that I'm also on the cautious side. The same goes for our own selling prices. I mean, they also have been on a decline throughout the year, so we have rather low exit rates. For sure, as I mentioned also in the speech, we will be very stringent on cost. So cost contingencies will be very important. So we will top up our efforts here. But then the final questions, and we are in the midst of the discussion here still is how to assume the volume pick up. We haven't seen it. So it's a highly debatable, yes, figure. So the question is really what magnitude can we expect  I mean we have seen some inventory correction in this year, which should be over. And finally, end market should pick up somewhat. But there's a huge discussion in the organization about how much. So as I said before, we are not there yet, but these are about the building blocks for guidance will be given in March, but possibly 2024 mirrors a bit 2023, just with a weaker first half and a stronger second half. But I think that's what I would be ready to share today.Okay, Thomas, and on your second question on the you call it legacy contracts or contracts that are tied to the inside China pricing index. So what we reported is that within this year and also end of last year, we achieved yes, I think, quite a remarkable change in the contract structure. But we also said there is still a substantial part of contracts under the Chinese index. So we could keep on discussing with our customers to convert these contracts to the outside China index, which we believe is the value of our material. And you can imagine with a lot of contracts, I mean, there are different durations. And obviously, it's easier to change terms if you have a contract ends and you start a new contract. But nevertheless, we also continue discussing -- heavily discussing and negotiating with customers that have existing and running contracts to change these to these new terms. And yes, as I said, we achieved a lot this year. And latest by the end of last year, next year, we will probably shift all the volumes to the new pricing model.And the next question comes from Rikin Patel from BNP Pariba.I too on the guidance. So first in polysilicon, your new guide implies a sequential step down in Q4. I suppose given you had maintenance in Q3. I'd expect volumes to be up sequentially  And given you also price at a lag, I'm just curious why you're seeing a step down in Q4. And then in silicon, I know you've covered the demand weakness and continued, I guess, negative sentiment in that market. But again, the sequential step-down does some quite significant even if I adjust for seasonality. So I'm curious just what the moving parts are there  And if you could give any sort of indication on what operating rates are across your plants and silicones, that would also be helpful.Okay, Rikin, this is Chris. I'll start with your first question on the polysillicon guidance for Q4. So actually also what Tobias has mentioned in his speech, at the end of Q3, we also saw declining prices for polysillicon, which is now dragging down into Q4. So the main effect is really lower prices for solar poly in Q4. And yes, we also remain a little bit cautious on the December numbers in China. On the volume side, volumes in Q4, we believe, are similar to the numbers in Q3 and in the Q3 numbers were affected by some maintenance, which is also dragging into Q4.And on silicon, Rikin, Tobias speaking here, for Q4, we originally had expected some more stable demand. We continue to see low demand. And that specifically affects also the portfolio of our specialty customers. They act short term, they act cautiously. And for that reason why we see October coming in similar to September. We are cautious on year-end, and we see some inventory management effect of some customers. So that means running our upstream at a high level. Overall, the mix, the product mix would be affected negatively why the strategy is on specialties, we just plan balance it with standard products. This goes then in parallel to still higher costs for raw materials. We had expected that with higher turnover, we would get through those, yes, high-priced inventories sooner. But with the pushout of volumes at our suppliers, we sometimes also have to bear trailing prices when we take the volume at a later point in the year. And yes, finally, maybe another element that will sequentially be a burden on Q4 is center prices will still be a drag. They have stabilized recently. We noticed that. There has been a small uptick in China. But as exit rates in Q3 are lower, we also expect the average in Q4 to be lower than the average in Q3. So all put together, this makes us very cautious on Q4 with respect to silicon.And the next question comes from Charlie Webb from Morgan Stanley.Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just one following up on Thomas' question on the polysillicon contracts and shifting those away from the China reference price. Could you give us a sense of -- versus '23, what proportion of volumes have you had successful renegotiation of terms as we think of 2024 and what maybe come more towards the end of '24 in terms of when the timing of these contracts to come up. Just trying to understand the phasing of that shift in terms of what that might mean. And then second, just on that same point. Just what do you think is a sustainable premium for non-Chinese poly  What is that offshore price, that kind of sustainable premium you think as you're kind of going through this negotiation. So two questions there. And then if I could just sneak one other one in. Just earlier on in the call, you mentioned that Europe hasn't really acted to protect industry, German industry the solar industry. What is the latest  Obviously, we do continue to hear more talks around the resilience bonus and such forth. But just any sense on where you think things are for Europe as they look at the solar value chain would be great.Okay, Charlie. Yes, let me start with your first question on the poly contract and the shift. I can just give you some rough numbers on that. I mean, keep in mind, a year ago. So at the end of 2022, almost all these contracts were based on the inside China Index because this new index was not just -- I mean it was just beginning to start. So therefore, almost all of our contracts were based on this Chinese terms. Now during this year, as I mentioned, a lot of efforts were going on. We could switch substantial amount of customers to the new indexing. Although we don't disclose an exact number, I think with an estimate of around 50-50. I think it's a good -- quite a good estimate to go forward. And as I said before, to Thomas, during next year, our aim is really to go into a range of 0 to 100 to shift all these contracts to the non-China index. So that will be the first part of your question. Well, the second question, just what's kind of the pricing level, I mean this is always quite a challenge for polysillicon, hard to judge. What we can say is, and Tobias mentioned in his part, there is a very high demand for this material, which is made outside of China, and therefore, are staying there is a substantial premium possible. Yes. Then on your question on the industry power price and reshoring update, could talk for hours now, but I won't. We have been in very intense discussions also in recent weeks. Maybe you've seen there was a meeting with the German Industry Association, chemical industry aviation with -- together with the German chancellor some minutes and some has of the regions that was end of September. We made a lot of pressure. There were high expectations. The outcome was, at that stage not satisfactory, and therefore, discussions are going on. We keep pushing for this industrial power price in Europe, in Germany, there's a broad coalition now also with trade unions from the chemical side, from the metal side, also the industry aviations of these industries altogether. So broad coalition for introducing this. And recently, this week, the German Ministry of the Economy and Vice Chancellor Habek, he published a paper industry strategy for Germany, it's clearly stated that an industrial power price or a bridging -- Briton strong price would be an essential tool for keeping Germany as an attractive industry site, very good paper in my view. So everything is prepared. It now comes up to the government to make a final call. And it's always a tough time to predicting political decisions. What we do here is that in the middle of November, there will be a decision on the final budget for '24. Is that final, Don't ask me, but there's at least another milestone, cornerstone where we hope to get a clear decision. Today, in the news, you could read just a few hours ago, that there was a new -- what you call it, estimates. There's a new estimate on German tax payers. And that says in the next 5 years, there will be EUR 25 billion more on taxes paid versus the last assumptions. So actually, that would equal the industrial power price, EUR 25 billion. And I hope Mr. Lindner is moving a bit faster than he has been before.That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up on your first comment around pricing and it being a very tight market for you guys in terms of people wanting your product more than you have available. I mean, do you sense that across the board when you look at the math and you think about the U.S. market and other markets where your product has that premium, do you sense that there's a chance that pricing move to kind of reinvestment economics. Do you think it will behave that wayWell, I think at the moment, I would say it's very much driven by what you say is the U.S. regime on imports for the solar modules, proving that it's forced labor free that certainly drive the driver for the high demand of this material that could definitely go in the range of reinvestment. But I think that at the moment, not really the question. The question is more supply and demand that drives the price in my view.And the next question comes from Jaideep Pandya from Fit Research.First question is on the tax credits that you potentially are eligible for in the U.S. Could you give us some sense of what sort of volume should we be calculating the tax credit  And would it be applicable also for semi. And given you haven't got anything for 2023, could 2024 have two payments instead of one payment. Second question is really around your raw material and energy bill. So can you just give us some color on where you are with regards to your raw material inventory drawdown and sort of what deflation you would have got this year if you hadn't been sitting on this inventory. And on the energy side, what sort of hedging have you done on electricity and on GAF for 2024. And then the last question really is around the polysillicon sort of debate. I mean if we think about the international market, do you see that the market is going to remain tight for the next 2 years or so because there is quite a lot of non-Sinjiang capacity coming in China, which could potentially use non-Sinjiang silicon metal and actually be eligible for the U.S. or the European market. So do you think that the  20 REC sort of floor that they have signed, is the floor  Or do you think that yes, there is a 1-year window or 2-year window, maybe and then international markets will also be flooded with sort of non-Sinjiang polysillicon from China.Jaideep, Tobias here, I would try to your first three questions. First, on tax credit. Yes, we expect those to have an impact next year. But the -- as we equate, they will depend on the production volume in the U.S. And unfortunately, as we described, we had a shutdown in the first quarter. And then as we reported in the third quarter, we also had a planned maintenance, and that turned also into a larger maintenance. So we have not had full production. And we run mostly on semiconductor, which is a more demanding product specification so that the overall volume is not  indiscernible  plate capacity of 20 kt as we had designed the plant for solar capacity. So for that, that means that the numerator for calculating the credit is lower than 20 Kt, but we expect to file with the tax return -- tax filing in the second quarter and claim credit. I'm then normally conservative how to account them for '24. But if it gets approved, I think we would also see a good accounting approach to, yes, take it also for '24 as a credit before then filing again in '25, the tax. On raw materials, your second question, we had seen a significant decline in silicon prices. I mean this is the biggest raw material for silicones and polysillicon. And we have seen a significant decline for all polymers raw materials. I'll start with the polymers we have a net positive pricing, as you know, and that supports our profitability significantly in 2023. For silicon our pricing on the sales side was driven by supply and demand, and we talked very much also about that weak environment for specialty volumes. So we were burdened by the high silicon metal prices. If you remember, silicon metal prices shot up from '21 to '22 by a factor of 2. I mean, for short-term also by a factor of 3 and 4. And now throughout the year, silicon prices have halved, roughly half, but throughout the year, and that has not hit yet our P L. We fully hit the P L as we still work through the inventory. And we do everything to clean up 2023 to get a much better start in '24 but that's a lot of work. I must say because the volume turnover is lower with a lower demand environment. To your third question, hedging of power, we have different hedge levels. We are significantly hedged. That means more than 3 4 for gas, it's still very attractive prices. for 24, and we are hedged slightly above 50  for power for electricity for next year. So then, I mean, it very much depends how our spot price is developing because if you would believe that spot prices would not be lower than today's forward prices, we should hedge. So that's a bit unknown. Today, there is a risk premium for buying forward contracts. The question is, is that risk premium then justified if you come to the actuals or does it go away as it has gone away throughout this year if you remember what hedges could you have bought last year for '23 and how spot prices have developed on the electricity side. So that's for power.Okay. And , on the -- your question on the Sinjiang Poly, well, first of all, I think we have to state that already today, I mean, there's not only Sinjiang polyvaluable in China. There are already capacities outside of their province, which would due the material and obviously have no influence on the pricing. So at the end of the day, I mean, it's hard to say because CBP in the U.S., they are looking at the whole value chain and they want to have that certified. And the big question mark is what kind of certificates they would accept. So it is not only the polysillicon where they would need a certificate where it's produced but they would also need a certificate of the raw materials, which would be essentially the cards and also the coal where that is produced. And the big question mark is if a Chinese certificate would be sufficient for CBP to be accepted. At the moment, we don't see that. And therefore, I think the question is not really about is it these new capacities coming up in non-Sinjiang. I think it's more a general view on Chinese capacities and the certificates made by the Chinese players.If I can just ask one follow-up on this topic. When you're talking about the shift of contracts, can you give us some like qualitative color is -- are these new customers that you're going away from the China for China to the industrial price, be it in the U.S  Or are these actually Chinese customers who are willing to accept international price because they want to service more international markets  Or is it a bit of bothWell, it's kind of -- it's a little bit of both. It's a mixture. And I mean, as you know, the Chinese play an important role in the whole solar value chain. And therefore, of course, they play a role also in these markets, but they are also a non-Chinese player that show interest. So it's a mix of both.And the next question comes from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan.I just wanted to follow up on your comments on polysillicon because I'm very confused. If I heard Chris, you correctly, you said already 50  of your polysillicon contracts are indexed now this year to ex-China pricing  I mean if that's the case, why is your polysillicon profitability so low in Q4  It's like EUR 25 million, which should be your profitability in semiconductor business. I guess your solar business is not even making money in Q4. So I'm very, very surprised if that sort of contract shifting has been achieved that the profitability of polysillicon is not better at least on guidance in Q4  That's the first question. Second question I had was I just wanted to understand, you sometimes give us this book-to-bill numbers for some of your businesses. And I think it's just useful for us to know how that is tracking across your two main chemical divisions today, which are silicones and polymers as you think about it into Q4. I mean, I don't want to we know the seasonality, but I'm just looking at more the underlying. Is there any spark in that book-to-bill  Is it going above one or anything that would be useful. And the last question on your BioSolutions business. Can you remind us how much should we be modeling in terms of earnings or contribution from your agreement with the German government next year in terms of contribution to BioSolutionsOkay. Chetan, I'll start with the first question on the polysilicon. Yes, what we said is not roughly, but half of the material is still indexed to the Chinese index and the other 50  is not. Yet we've seen also, as we mentioned, at the end of Q3, a lowering of prices for both these indexes and that's also what we put into our guidance for Q4. So lower prices. But also keep in mind, compared to the previous quarters, especially Q2, we see lower numbers, lower volumes in Q4, which is comparable to the Q3 numbers. And these two effects or lower pricing for solar grade material, but also volumes at the same level lead to this decline in EBITDA. And I think there's -- yes, I mentioned we are maybe a little bit cautious on the December pricing. But that's the reason why we see these numbers a little lower, yes.On the second and third question, book-to-bill. I mean, yes, we do look at that, but we have seen there some false starts throughout the year. So we are very cautious. That's why we look at a different or a diverse set of metrics, also volume because -- and that's by product because we also need to watch out for are there any mix effects that would have an impact. So from what we are seeing, it's flat. There's no uptick in demand. And that's why we -- in addition to that, we bake in some seasonality towards the year-end. But that, especially in the silicone business for the reason that our specialty focused portfolio customers will be cautious towards year-end. If they do not have a clear outlook into '24. And for polymers, it's the normal seasonality from the construction activities that we see. So to your third question on BioSolutions and how much we expect from the mRNA contract with the German government we expect that to start mid-next year. So we are good with the investment in the second quarter. So we won't have the full year effect, but it is a significant contract. I think we do not disclose the overall revenue, but account yes, account for it starting mid of next year.Can I follow up just last clarification. Your polysillicon business for the solar market, is that profitable right now in Q4Chetan, we don't report below the segment level.I'm just curious because I can estimate all of your profitability today in Q4 just from your semi business. So I'm just curious, is that the right assumption that your solar business hardly makes money right nowWe stay to our -- we stick to our policy, sorry no more information below the segment level.And the next question comes from the line of Andreas Heine from Steeple.Two from my side as well. I try again on 2024 on BioSolutions. So the last 2 years, you had integration costs, digitization costs and preparation and prestart costs, is 2024 normal year  Or is that where we have to -- where you have to absorb, again, additional factors, additional negative factors. And the second is actually on the net working capital, so it was down 6 , as you mentioned, sales are significantly more down. So do you have to do also on your end substantial cleaning on your inventories  Or how do you see this progressingOkay. Andreas, I will start with the first question by solutions for 2024 be and what you call a normal year. Well, as Tobias just mentioned, I mean, we are planning to ramp up for the pandemic plan for the mRNA side in Halle in the end of Q2 time frame. So until then, I wouldn't call it normal because then it would be more normal on this facility is running. But also keep in mind, we are also in the middle of a transformation for the business. We are integrating site in Lyon, ADL. Holiday is coming and so I would expect that during this year and to the end of the year of 2024, we would see much better results also from all these efforts we put into the business. We believe in these opportunities, we believe that the great opportunities that we also acquired. It's I think it's very clear also to say that the current squeeze in the biotech funding scene is giving us a headwind. So therefore, a pipeline of projects might be delayed in one or the other case, but also what I would like to mention, I mean, if you look at the Q3 numbers, it looks like there's kind of substantial growth. Keep in mind that our BioSolution business today has also a significant part of legacy business, which is down to a comparable level with a lot of chemical business at Wacker, but also in the rest of the industry and the biopharma business is actually progressing quite well. And this is also part of these numbers. So we remain committed. We remain optimistic about our plans, but we are still in the middle of that transformation, and I'm optimistic that by the end of next year, middle to end of next year, we see a much better performance.Andreas, on your net working capital question for we are not there yet. So it's a pretty detailed item for the guidance. But let me think through the moving parts. I mean we've made a significant progress, but just take the example of silicon metal. We reduced it by 1 3 from end of last year to today. And we are going to cutting it by 50  towards the year-end. And that definitely has a significant effect if you then also include the price effect on silicon metal. I believe going forward into '24, we should have still some opportunity also in the long supply chains of -- especially of silicones to still reduce volumes. And we would also see some price down effects from raw material and energy costs. But on the other hand, if the demand picks up, you build, again, inventory and you need to make sure that your delivery times are appropriate, and that will be then a countering effect. And in addition, when sales pick up, receivables also will go up. So there are quite some moving parts, especially in a dynamic environment. So please yes, allow me to be cautious not to give you a number for '24 today. So we are still in the working. It will be -- I mean, there will be definitely an effort. That's what I can say, an effort to release cash from net working capital, and there will be also projects working on inventory targets, but there will be many moving parts if the demand finally picks up again.But is it fair to assume that especially in these very complex value chain in silicon, so you have thousands of different grades, that the underutilization will continue quite a bit because you run down your inventories, you have also unfinished goods, is that too negativeIt's a super complex value chain. So yes, that would lead to some still running in low utilization. But that on the other hand, that's why I was referring to when it picks up, you need to make sure that you have your intermediates ready for the downstream plants to produce and that makes it a bit tricky. But it is a fair observation that our inventories volume-wise, are still higher than before the pandemic. They were super low during the pandemic. And then they -- I mean, that went up through that through those very strong years that we experienced in '21 and '22.And if I may squeeze in a third one on silicones. You mentioned that you produced the standard products to fill your capacity to have a decent utilization rate. At this currently very low prices, do you still have a positive gross margin on standard productsYes, we definitely only do it when we have a positive margin. If not, we should.And we do have a follow-up question from Jaideep Pandya from on Field Research.Sorry to jump on to Andreas' line of questions on silicones. I just want to understand your -- as per your guidance, you're going to lose about 700 million of sales this year and about 620 million and 630 million of EBITDA. So it's almost like a one-for-one sales to EBITDA ratio. You've alluded to quite a lot of these factors. But just want to understand, even if demand remains at current levels, if you don't see a major pickup, should we think that if standard prices have stabilized and specialty prices don't fall dramatically because these are specialties. The raw material benefit alone should get you to sort of back to the at least 350 million level, i.e., towards the 10  to 12  margin rate, not the sort of 20  or 18  to 20 , which you used to do, but at least somewhere in between the current extremely low profitability and sort of the mid-cycle level profitability. Is the raw material sort of savings enough for that  Or you would need improved utilization as well for that to happenAs I said to Thomas, at the very beginning of our Q A, we are not at guidance yet, but we talk through the moving parts and you mentioned two of them, the input costs and the sales prices. And as I said before, I would be cautious. I mean, yes, we have lower exit rates in the input costs, which give us a relief. But on the other hand, we also have lower exit prices for our sales prices. And that makes it tricky. So I don't want to comment on your calculation for that reason for that exact reason.And if I just ask a second follow-up on polysilicon, how is the inventory level in the hubs  I mean, what we are hearing is China will have a very strong Q4 installation-wise, and inventory levels are low how do you see inventory levels and therefore, near-term pricing, when I say near term, meaning Q4 or Q1, what are the chances that we remain sort of around these levels  Because obviously, you guys are penciling in a lower price. But some of your Chinese competitors are actually saying the other way around. So what do you see with regards to inventory levels in ChinaWell, I mean, what we do see, Jaideep, is, as you mentioned, there is a high demand on the installation side. I'm cautious if there is a big pull on the polysilicon side. I think there's some inventory also on the modules. So that's the reason why we said we are a little cautious on the pricing side on December, but it all depends on how much material are actually used. And I would like to add maybe one comment also on the silicon side. I think not giving you more detailed information as Tobias, of course. But I think the main question is really the demand side. when that is picking up. And as we said several times now, we don't see it now in our books picking up. On the other hand, I mean, if you talk to our teams on the development side, working together with the customers, I mean all these projects are going on and new projects are coming into that pipeline. So the intrinsic interest in that material in these specialties is there. But again, as we don't see it in our books today, we don't pencil it into our calculations.There are no further questions at this time, and I hand back to Joerg Hoffman for closing comments.Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Wacker Chemie. You see our upcoming events for next year at the back of the slide deck. As every year, you should expect us to publish preliminary results towards the end of January or early February next year. Please note that our next conference call on results are scheduled for March 12, discussing full year 2023 results. We also plan on holding a Capital Market Day in June at our main site in Germany Burghausen again. In the meantime, don't hesitate to contact the IR department if you have further questions.",0,2023-10-26T17:05:26.000-04:00
MP Materials: Geopolitical Wager On REE Industry Fragmentation,"MP Materials  is a distinct company operating in a niche market. It is among the few rare earth element  REE  miners with operational mine in the Western Hemisphere. MP plans to become a fully integrated companyREE, along with uranium, are truly geopolitical instruments to assert power. A few countries and state-owned enterprises dominate its production. The dominant players are China in REE and Russia in uranium. Those commodities are trump cards in the hands of their ruling elites. However, these pronounced imbalances present an excellent opportunity for asymmetric investments.The group of elements on the row labeled  lanthanides  on the periodic table ofThese elements are collectively known as  rare earth  since they were initially discovered in uncommon minerals and were difficult to extract. They are not particularly rare findings in the Earth's crust. Many high-tech applications rely on rare earth elements, such as electronics, renewable energy technologies  including wind turbines and electric vehicle batteries , catalysts, and more. This is because of their unique characteristics. They are also used to produce powerful permanent magnets, which are crucial for many modern technologies. The image below shows the significant purposes of REEDue to the importance of rare earth elements in various industries, their supply has strategic significance. For example, the magnets in some of America's commercial and military equipment and Virginia-class attack submarines are made from REE.The world depends heavily on China for various materials, including REE.China dominates in extraction and processing. The quote from an published in Politico summarizes itMP Materials Corp. is one of the few producers of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere.The The image below from the last company's  shows the stagesMP Materials' operations center is the Mountain Pass Mine and Processing Facility the concentrate production at this facility is marketed to Chinese refiners. About 15  of the rare earths produced globally are produced by the Mountain Pass mine, which started operating again in 2012 after years of idleness.MP Materials' Stage 1 operations sell concentrate products to Shenghe Resource Holding for further distribution to other downstream refiners in China. Except for MP Materials' refining capabilities  which are currently undergoing renovation as part of the Stage 2 project  and one other plant in Malaysia, there are few downstream rare earth refining factories of scale outside of China. This reality is the main driving force behind MP Materials' goal to reintroduce this vital industrial capability to the United States.Stage I provided a solid foundation with concentrate production, while Stage II was about refining. By converting to supplying rare earth elements, particularly the highly sought-after NdPr oxide, the company is positioned to capture a larger market share and demand higher prices. By focusing on NdPr oxide, MP Materials is effectively chasing these expanding industries, possibly ensuring continuous demand.The  with Sumitomo Corporation of America demonstrate MP Materials' growth potential. These partnerships provide broad revenue streams and a solid business plan to withstand market fluctuations. In essence, Stage II will highlight MP Materials' transformation into a market leader for rare earths on a global scale.Additionally, the business has started construction on a brand-new manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, where the Mountain Pass minerals will be transformed into metals, alloys, and magnets.With the  between MP Materials and General Motors , a significant turning point in the transition toward electrification has been attained. Thanks to a long-term supply agreement, the Ultium Platform from GM will have a dependable domestic source of crucial rare earth materials. This will begin a new age of American independence in the electric vehicle supply chain.The company s shareholders are worth special mentioning. The image below from  shows who are the major shareholders in MPJames Litinsky is MP s CEO, owning 10.3   of the company shares. Besides that, he is the CEO and founder of JHL Capital Group, the largest shareholder. JHL is an alternative investment firm. More interesting is the third largest investor  Shenghe Resources. As stated by , Chinese enterprise among the shareholders represents risks considering the tensions between China and the US and the crucial importance of REE for the US defense industry.The company balance sheet is impressive, considering the declining revenues and significant investments in expansion. The table below shows the liquidity and solvency metrics. The data is from the The liquidity ratios are among the highest in the mining industry. The CAPEX was a significant drag, as seen in EBITDA-based ratios. However, investments in PPE  plant, property, equipment  will bear fruit in the long term.The last months were thought for commodity producers, including MP. The image below shows the Q2 resultsThe company highlighted record Stage 1 production for the quarter despite a planned maintenance downtime. However, the declining commodities prices adversely affected the company s revenues. I want to point out the growth in production and sales volumes. As a commodity producer, MP does not have pricing power, and increasing output and sales are the only two variables they can control. They are the only source for the company's long-term growth, apart from the spot price. However, the latter is out of control for the miners.The chart below shows the financial metrics from the With growing demand and tightening supply due to the strategic importance of REE, I expect their prices to rebound in the following months. As long as MP keeps its production costs stable, its profit margins will grow, thus improving the company s bottom line. On top of that, the progress to Stage 2 and Stage 3 developments will add diversified revenue streams.The chart below compares. MP s profitability metrics with the industry and its five-year averageDespite lousy performance from the last quarters, MP maintains higher-than-average profitability metrics. What I like is the Capex to sales ratio. It is a long-term indicator of the company s future revenue. MP CAPEX Sales exceeds ten times the industry average and the company s five-year average.Going deeper in detail in the image below, I weigh MP s metrics with Energy Fuels  and Lynas Rear Earths. The former is a fully integrated producer of uranium and vanadium in the USA, while the latter is Australia's largest REE miner.As seen, MP has the highest profit margins. In the long run, the margins and free cash flow matter the most. Expecting growing tensions between China and the West and  to ban REE exports, their prices will soar significantly.MP Materials does not have pricing power, and its business is capital-intensive, focusing on tangible assets. These features make the use of cash flow-based valuation methods dangerously misleading. On the other hand, the company has yet to generate free cash flows for now, and using the DCF methodology will obtain misleading outcomes.I calculate NAV as followsThe table below shows the results. All data is taken from MP's last report. The numbers are in thousands of USD.Valuing MP against its peers is challenging because they are almost nonexistent. I used earlier UUUU and LYCFT for measuring profitability. To estimate MP s relative standing, I use those companies again.The juxtaposition is imperfect due to the unique positioning of every enterprise. However, comparing MP to polymetal miners such as BHP or Rio Tinto is less misleading. Using EV Sales and Price Cashflow, MP is in the middle.MP Materials is a geopolitical wager betting on exacerbating REE supply issues. As an upstream company, MP carries all risks inherent to miners.The company has profound expertise in operating the Mountain Pass mine. That said, the geological and metallurgical risks are minimal. MP has an incredible balance sheet for a mining company, mitigating the financial risk. The company has extra liquidity to serve as a buffer and provide funds for the company s expansion. Economic growth, interest rates, and inflation represent the economic risk. China, as a source of demand, has a significant role too. The political risk is the major contributor to unknowns in MP s operations. It has twofold implications.The role of REE in the US defense sector is crucial, and dependence on Chinese enterprises for refining REE concentrates carries notable risks. Shenghen ownership is deeply disputable and has been raised as a danger to national security.MP Materials is a curious company comparable to  . Both are pivotal for the US defense industry and national security while depending on China and Russia for raw materials and processing. MP is positioned uniquely to become the sole fully integrated producer in the Western Hemisphere. The company has the financial resources to achieve its goals. Its balance sheet has enough liquidity to keep MP out of trouble while expanding its business.The price compared to NAV is high, but I use PPE book value. The company s PPE is complicated to evaluate due to its distinct nature. There are not many REE operations outside China and Malaysia with public records. Hence, we can estimate PPE value using a sales comparison approach.Despite the higher stock price and last quarter's poor financial performance, I give MP a buy rating due to its positioning to become the leader in the REE industry. Buying MP stock is a long-term investment with at least 24 24-month horizon. Any price declines are welcome to add to the position.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, IBM's Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Thank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation.As the operator just mentioned, I'm Patricia Murphy, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website.Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is includedSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.Thank you for joining us.Before we start, let me address the outbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism. We are also saddened over the loss of innocent livesLet me now turn to our business performance. In the third quarter, we had solid growth across revenue, profit and free cash flow while delivering innovations and positioning our business to capture future opportunities.On the broader trends we are seeing in the market, technology continues to serve as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Businesses and governments around the world are looking for opportunities to address demographic shifts, make their supply chains more resilient and improve sustainability. More recently, geopolitical events and the reality of higher for longer, add to the growing uncertainty. Technology helps organizations better deal with the many challenges they face.We see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants to leverage technology to offer better services, scale more quickly, and fuel growth without increasing their footprint. This has been driving demand for technologies that boost productivity and competitiveness, like hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Overall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the headwinds, and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP.In this past quarter, we saw good revenue growth in Software and Consulting. In Infrastructure, more than a year into the product cycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to help clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments, and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions.We also continue to position our business for the future  launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills, and focusing our portfolio. We have been taking concrete actions to deliver productivity in our own business. All of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients' most pressing needs and has a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter results are another proof point.Typically, at this point, I'd talk about hybrid cloud and the progress we have made. Hybrid cloud remains vitally important to our clients and to our business. Given the inflection in AI and more specifically generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we're approaching this opportunity.We believe that generative AI will be multi-model, with clients using a combination of IBM's models, other company's models, their own proprietary models and open-source models. This hybrid approach to AI is similar to the hybrid approach to cloud. Let me give you an overview of the capabilities we have been building.Our generative AI software stack starts with Red Hat OpenShift, which serves as the foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment. Data services help make their data ready for AI. watsonx is the core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We are providing models that address specific domains such as code, language, and cybersecurity, among others. Our AI assistants include the watsonx Code Assistant to augment developers, watsonx Assistant to augment customer service agents and watsonx Orchestrate to augment employees.This quarter, we introduced new AI capabilities for our clients and partners. We unveiled Granite, a multi-billion parameter foundation model on watsonx.ai, which excels in both language and code. We also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for Z, to help clients accelerate the modernization of mainframe code and apps. It's fueled by a 20-billion parameter model and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java. There are hundreds of billions of lines of code written in COBOL, so the opportunity is significant.Looking forward, we plan to launch watsonx.governance before the end of the year, that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance through the AI lifecycle. This is a key consideration for clients as they go beyond early proof of concepts into real deployments.To bring our AI capabilities to life, we have more than 20,000 data and AI consultants, including a center of excellence for generative AI. Our teams help clients navigate the AI landscape, from crafting a strategy, understanding how AI can be used and deploying AI responsibly. These consultants also provide valuable real-time feedback to our product teams. As in hybrid cloud, our ecosystem across GSIs, ISVs and hyperscalers plays a critical role in bringing generative AI to our clients.In the work we are doing, clear patterns are emerging in terms of the AI enterprise use cases. Based on extensive feedback and trials to date, three have risen to the top. Code modernization, customer service and digital labor all have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits. We have also seen this internally, as we apply our AI capabilities to areas such as client support, HR, IT optimization and source-to-pay, to automate a significant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people.Our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI was in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. The interest is larger, with thousands of hands-on interactions with our clients. These are across our largest clients and smaller clients, which lays the groundwork for future watsonx opportunities.Let me close the discussion on AI by talking about a couple of client examples. Dun   Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting and software capabilities, fueled by watsonx, to help their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions. IBM and EY also just announced a new solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate, to enhance EY's People Advisory services.We continue to bring innovations to the market in areas other than AI. This includes new innovations to our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, Red Hat OpenShift, which was recognized recently by both Gartner and Forrester as a leader in container management. We completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In quantum, we are making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance and materials.In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and have good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology. We continue to take portfolio actions to increase our focus on hybrid cloud and AI. And we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value. All of this reinforces my confidence in our future. We're executing a strategy that closely resonates with our clients' needs, and this is propelling our business forward. Three quarters into the year, we are well positioned to deliver on 2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow.Now, to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim.Thanks, Arvind.I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered  14.8 billion of revenue,  2.3 billion of operating pre-tax income, and  2.20 of operating earnings per share. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated  5.1 billion of free cash flow.Reported revenue growth was 4.6 . This includes just over 1 point of growth from currency translation, which is significantly less than the currency rates suggested in July. In fact, currency movements over the last 90 days impacted our third quarter revenue by about  250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5 . As is typical, I'll focus the discussion on constant currency.Arvind talked about clients' priorities in today's environment, which are driving solid growth in our Software and Consulting offerings. I'll remind you, Software and Consulting are our two growth vectors, and together make up about three quarters of our revenue base.Software revenue was up 6 , as clients leverage their data for insights and automate their IT in a hybrid environment. We had good growth in both Hybrid Platform   Solutions and Transaction Processing revenue.Our Consulting business had another solid quarter with 5  revenue growth, strong signings performance, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.15 over the last year. We are capitalizing on our continued momentum in the market, as we help clients get value from hybrid cloud and AI and leverage our strategic partnerships.Our Infrastructure revenue was down 3 , with growth in zSystems. More and more we are seeing clients embrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries. This growth was offset by declines in Distributed Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support.IBM's revenue growth, together with a good portfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives, generated strong margin, profit and free cash flow performance. Operating gross margin expanded 160 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a year-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points. Despite that headwind, our margin expansion was broad based, with improvements in every business segment.Driving efficiency and productivity has always been part of our operating and financial models. These ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application environment to digitally transforming our business processes by applying AI at scale. We are ahead of pace to achieve our target of  2 billion in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do, I am pleased with our progress.The combination of our revenue and margin performance yielded strong profit growth. Operating pre-tax profit was up 17  to  2.3 billion. We generated  1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and over  5 billion year-to-date, which is up  1 billion versus last year. Free cash flow growth through the first three quarters was driven primarily by cash sourced from our operating profit performance. We also had working capital efficiencies driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year.In terms of cash uses, year-to-date we spent about  5 billion on acquisitions and returned  4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our resulting cash balance at the end of September was  11 billion. That's up over  2 billion from year-end, but with the acquisition of Apptio in the third quarter, cash is down over  5 billion from June. Our debt balance is now  55 billion, also down from June.Putting this all together, our business fundamentals are solid, with sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business into the future.Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6 , with contribution from Hybrid Platform   Solutions and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base, which is about 80  of our annual Software revenue.In Hybrid Platform   Solutions, revenue was up 7  with growth across Red Hat, Automation and Data   AI, as we execute our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI.Red Hat revenue was up 8 . We continue to deliver good growth in OpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter. Clients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach with annual bookings up 14  in the quarter. This includes double-digit growth across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible, partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services.IT and business automation are top client priorities, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. This quarter, our Automation revenue grew 13 , with pervasive growth across all business areas. We had strength in AIOps and Management driven by good performance in Instana, Turbonomic and now Apptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity.Data   AI revenue was up 6 . Growth areas include Data Fabric and Customer Care as enterprise clients are both preparing for and adopting generative AI solutions, leveraging watsonx. We also grew in Asset   Supply Chain Management as we help enterprises run sustainable operations.Security revenue declined 3 . We delivered growth in security software driven by Data Security and Identity   Access Management. This was more than offset by declines in managed security services.Looking across these businesses, our Hybrid Platform   Solutions ARR has grown to  14 billion, up 7  since last year.In Transaction Processing, revenue was up 5 . Throughout this year, we've been talking about how the success of the last couple of zSystems cycles is driving demand for this mission-critical software. This, together with price increases, contributed to year-to-date growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in Transaction Processing.Moving to profit for the Software segment, we expanded gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin was up 120 basis points, even while absorbing over 2 points of impact from currency. We continued to deliver operating leverage, driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter.Our Consulting revenue was up 5  with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. With another quarter of strong signings, as I said, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that enable cost savings and productivity. These results are a proof point that we are well positioned to meet these needs in today's complex environment.IBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI can be used to automate tasks, make better decisions with speed and improve customer experiences.We've made a series of AI announcements over the last few months demonstrating continued advancement of our strategic partnerships. We are providing clients with the opportunity to accelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI responsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination.Today, our strategic partnerships account for about 40  of Consulting revenue and have continued to grow double digits across revenue and signings. In aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was up over 40 , and signings essentially doubled year-to-year. Additionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment has continued to grow at a double-digit rate, with over  1 billion of signings in the quarter.All of what I've just mentioned, from market demand, to how we're positioned and partnering, to our investments to drive growth, is reflected in our overall Consulting revenue performance. You can see that play out across our three lines of business.In Business Transformation, revenue grew 5 , again led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to the growth.In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1 . Growth in cloud-based application development and modernization work was partially offset by declines in on-prem application-focused projects.In Application Operations, revenue grew 7 , driven by both cloud application management and platform engineering services. In platform engineering, we help clients design an application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale.Moving to Consulting profit, we expanded gross margin 150 basis points. Pre-tax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10 . Our year-to-year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased labor costs and about 1 point of pre-tax margin impact from currency.Moving to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 3 . Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was flat, while Infrastructure Support declined 7 .Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems grew 9  in a seasonally smaller revenue quarter. z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles after six quarters of availability. The program strength reflects both growing enterprise workload requirements and the economic value at scale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation. In fact, installed MIPs capacity for Linux on Z has grown more than four-fold over the last decade. Clients continue to value the security, resiliency and hybrid cloud capabilities of the zSystems platform.Distributed Infrastructure revenue was down 6  as compared to a strong growth in last year of 21  as we introduced innovation across Storage and Power10. This quarter, we had growth in Power offset by declines in Storage.In the Infrastructure segment, we had strong gross and pre-tax margin performance. Pre-tax margin expanded 350 basis points, reflecting benefits from portfolio mix with our zSystems performance and productivity, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency.Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to talk about our expectations before we go to Q A. Just about two years ago, we introduced Today's IBM, a more focused business with a platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Since then, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and our talent base, and drive productivity across our business. The result is a business that addresses today's client needs, with a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter performance reinforces this progress with 3.5  revenue growth, gross and pre-tax margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation.Now, with three quarters of the year behind us, we are holding our full year view of our two primary financial metrics, revenue growth and free cash flow. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth of 3  to 5 , and free cash flow of about  10.5 billion, that's up  1.2 billion over last year. We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of Software and Consulting. We still expect Software revenue growth at the high end of its mid-single digit model, and Consulting revenue in the 6  to 8  range.Infrastructure revenue, of course, reflects product cycle dynamics. In total, with one quarter to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of IBM's 3  to 5  range.We are making great progress in our productivity initiatives. The work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us more nimble by simplifying and streamlining our processes and operations, but it also frees up spend for reinvestment, provides financial flexibility and delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance. We continue to expect about a 0.5 point of operating pre-tax margin improvement, and we see a mid-teens tax rate for the year.Our free cash flow performance has been driven primarily from our profit performance. Through the first three quarters, we're up  1 billion year-to-year, and we've delivered nearly 50  of our full year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While, as always, we are reliant on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve about  10.5 billion for the year.As I look specifically at the fourth quarter, with the recent currency movements, we now see currency to be neutral to a 1-point headwind to revenue growth. That's nearly  600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. That's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution in Software and the large z16 transactional performance in Infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business.Bring it all together, we've clearly got a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, a business well-positioned for the future.Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started.Thank you, Jim.Before we begin the Q A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation. And then, second, I'll try this one last time, but I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow time for more people to participate.Operator, let's please open it up for questions.Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference.  Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. And I will stick to Patricia's one last time  ask one question only  rule. I guess, Arvind, there's a lot of macro concerns out there to say the least. I'm hoping you could spend a little bit of time just talking about when you talk to your customers and you, I'm sure, engage with a lot of the Fortune 500 companies. Given this macro environment, how are they shifting or prioritizing their IT budget dollars  And I fully understand everything you're talking about generative AI and how beneficial it's going to be, but given the macro environment, given the constrained IT budgets, I guess, where are they taking money away from to fund these investments  I'd love to just understand the customer feedback you're getting and how is the priority changing as they go forwardHi, Amit. So, thanks for the question. And it's actually wonderful to talk about this. So, generative AI, just for me to very quickly reiterate the use cases, we found that our clients were really climbing on to on code, on customer service, and on, I'll call it, general digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function.So, if you look at code, to a person, every one of the clients said, we don't intend to get rid of any developers, but this allows us to take care of the tech debt that we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive. Amit, I'll kind of point out, most enterprises are very quick to realize, if you are more productive, that means you have a competitive advantage to your peers. And if they have a competitive advantage to their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor. That's an incredible long-term competitive advantage.When you go to customer service, there is a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100 . But there is probably a 20  to 30 . If you can have more calls, more chats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people. So, there is both. Also, I'll point out to our audience, AI does not get tired. It doesn't get angry. It doesn't get upset. So, there is a NPS improvement you get along with it.And then on the third one, on digital workers, there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4 , 5 , 10 , not 20  30 , 40 .So, in the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern might have caused a pause in some other environments. The AI side, and to be candid, the hybrid cloud side, offers them a way through that without having to decrease their ambitions for next year. And I think we're seeing every one of them play to that. And I think that these are more fundamentals, these are more core processes than some of the other areas that people were worrying about two or three years ago. When two or three years ago, people were worrying a lot about, what do I do to keep all our employees happy  And can I add up all the tools for that  I think there's much less of a focus on that area.Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.Next we will hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed.Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering if you could comment a little further on the Red Hat deceleration in 3Q. Jim sounded like, was driven partly by consumption-based services that were somewhat weaker. Are you still expecting Red Hat growth in that 11  to 13  range for the year  And can you unpack some of the software elements in the fourth quarter between Red Hat transaction processing and perhaps Apptio  Thank you so much.Yeah, thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're very pleased overall with our Software segment performance growing 8 , actual 6  at constant currency, really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board. Automation led Red Hat at 8 , as you said, and I'll come to that in a second, but data and AI overall. Really underpinning all that is like we said, starting the year  one, a very strong solid recurring revenue base, high value, 80  of that portfolio, by the way, growing mid-single-digit growth, you see that play out in our transaction processing that we call the growth factor  and then also our hybrid platform and solution business,  14 billion ARR that's growing high-single-digit overall.Now within that, you see Red Hat. Red Hat we talked about in the prepared remarks. First of all, Arvind and I would acknowledge, we came in a couple of points below our expectation. And I think that's an execution discussion overall. Embedded in that, where did it come from  It came from -- because I think this is very important, it came from the consumption-based services and offering side of the equation, which by the way is about 20  of our portfolio, shorter duration overall, and it went from last quarter high single digit, which is about what the model is, to low single digit overall.If you look at that and compare that now, let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80 . That is our subscription-based business. That's our RHEL franchise, industry market leader, that's Red Hat OpenShift, and that's Ansible. We had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which again, subscription-based business model, we talked about all year long, we were going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services by the way. If I extract out that 20  portfolio services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19  overall. 110 -plus NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19 , OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40  with RHEL growing double digits.So, putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now when we look at fourth quarter, we're only building into our model -- again, Software at the high end of our segment model, we're only building in high single digit. We have to continue to monitor what happened to us in the third quarter, get the team focused on execution. But I would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in the third quarter, and by the way, another good pipeline in the fourth quarter, we feel very confident in the long-term posture of Red Hat growing double digits. We just got to get through and monitor what's happening to us on the services side.So, thanks very much for the question.Thanks, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed.Yes, thank you for taking the question. Jim, it sounds like your guidance for Q4, given you expect revenues at constant currency to be at the low end is somewhere around  17.3 billion, which is quite a bit below normal seasonality despite the fact that you have Apptio and you had strong services signings. So, I'm wondering if you could, a, confirm if that's sort of the number that you're suggesting  And was there some transactional pull forward in mainframe from Q4 to Q3 this quarter  Or are you expecting some deceleration in transaction processing  Maybe you could kind of confirm the number for Q4 and then unpack it a little bit as to why it's below normal seasonality. Thank you.Great. Toni, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it. And I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question given it's her last call leading and piloting, and we thank her for all her efforts, but we'll have more time to celebrate in January.But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top-line revenue growth, 3  to 5 , albeit, as we said, low end. And that's just practically speaking given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance, fourth quarter, as we just executed in third quarter, constant currency revenue growth, right  Let me unpack that to your point.First of all, at the macro level, historically, we would generate quarter-to-quarter about  2.9 billion-ish of revenue. Last year, by the way, we did  2.6 billion, up quarter-to-quarter in revenue. That  17.3 billion number in that ballpark, you're not too far off, is about equivalent to last year. It's about  2.6 billion.But I would tell you one thing underneath that, Toni, is we've seen a very different dramatic change in the currency FX U.S. dollar strengthening. To tune about  300 million, if you go look at the math, back into '19, 2020, 2021. So, underneath it, pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter performances last year, which by the way, I would highlight, was the peak of our ELA cycle last year and it was our strong first fourth quarter in a z16 environment. We're going to match that even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward.One last thing that I'll put and then I'll get into the color is, on a profit basis, although you didn't ask that, historically, profit, we generate somewhere, if I remember correctly studying over the weekend, about  1.3 billion quarter-to-quarter. You look at our operating pre-tax margin, which we recommitted 0.5 point for the year, that puts you in a profit range of, I don't know,  1.7 billion,  1.8 billion quarter-to-quarter. So, you see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business.So, you put all that together, we still believe we have a very confident year at that 3  to 5 , by the way, led by Software, delivering 3 points of that IBM growth. Consistent, I would say, very good performance competitively in Consulting, driving about 2 points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure around the product cycle downside, we said beginning of the year and we're consistent, it's about 1 point hurt to IBM. And then, you got the divestiture impact of about 0.5 point. You put all that together, I think that's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model.Okay. Sheila, let's go to the next question, please.Next we will hear from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Yeah, thank you for taking my question. It was great to hear about some of the quantifiable success that you've seen in generative AI so far. But maybe flipping that a little bit, whether it's through early consulting engagements or customer conversations, where are you seeing some of the choke points that might hold up people from deploying as fast as they want  And whether it's through foundation models or some of your other tools around the governance side, kind of how that's developing your R D to develop solutions for those problemsYeah, thanks. Let me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people have are coming around, are these models accurate  How accurate are they  Do they result in things that may cause long-term liability  People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's code writers are suing some of the producers of large language models.You alluded to governance. That comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term. Coupled with this are some people's concerns. If you add their own private data into a model, now what happens to the model  Where is it protected  Where does it stay  Do others learn from itSo, if you begin to unpack all of that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM produced, we will give you indemnification, meaning, we are confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train, what is being used to be output, and we'll stand behind the same indemnification as we provide for all enterprise software. As you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open source models. But we believe that that takes care and that is why we are so excited about code and customer service to start with, because that's where we believe that people can benefit from this indemnification.Talking about the governance and the life cycle side, people are also worried about some of the long-term deployment, because an enterprise may well deploy a model for five or 10 years. So, the governance tools that allow you to keep a lineage of the data, used to train a model, and then, for those adding private data, we give them a commitment that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else, helps to mitigate some of the fears and uncertainty around those issues.I do believe that this is going to play out well over the next few years, but I also want to point out there are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks. If you're giving a quick website response, you could well use a model that may have some of these risks, because the danger in using any of those other areas is small. So that is how it's playing out right now.I expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024 going into full production across the world of whether you use the word large language models or foundation models or generative AI.Great. Thank you, Matt. Let's go to the next question, please.Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. My question is on Consulting. I was very surprised to see 32  bookings growth after 24  the prior quarter, 7  the prior quarter. It's really diverging from your perceived rival in consulting  Accenture   ph . And I was just wondering what the reasoning you would say is behind that.And then, Jim, with regard to those bookings, what does that do for your revenue visibility for Consulting, not only for the fourth quarter but for early next year  I would think the good book-to-bill might make you feel pretty confident about that 6  to 8  and continuing. Thanks a lot.Ben, thanks very much for the question. As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in Consulting, not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6  to 8 , which gave us confidence to reiterate that. But also the fundamentals of that business, right, we talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So, all in all, pretty pleased overall.When you look at the bookings overall, I mean, let's just put some statistics. Let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall, because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have about this book of business going forward into fourth quarter and into '24. We're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation, application modernization, and where there's real technology value, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback.Is there pressure on discretionary-based activity and that like  Absolutely. But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall. But that has enabled us to grow 30 -plus. By the way, it's strongest bookings quarter we had quite a period of time and now we've got a trailing-12 month book-to-bill of 1.16 I think the strongest in about two-and-a-half years overall.Now, underneath that, what's going on  One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth. Signings were about 50  year-over-year. Hyperscalers underneath that, 2x signings. Our hybrid cloud and application modernization, Red Hat, we signed north of  1 billion alone in the quarter. Now that's  10 billion inception to date. We got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely. So, I think from that aspect, you look at the top-end growth, we feel pretty confident about the 6  to 8  for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth factor of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024.Now, with that said, headwinds wise, yeah, listen to every other services consulting company, there are macroeconomic challenges, without a doubt, uncertainty, but we got to go out and compete every single day here. And duration, I would say, not only we had great signings growth, we're monitoring our backlog realization. Our duration, by the way, this year has went up by a couple of months, but that revenue will play out over time. And all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share. I'm pleased with the team.Thank you, Ben. Sheila, let's go to the next question.Our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I'll stick to the one as well. Maybe Jim, this is for you. You didn't change your software consulting guidance ranges for the year. I think you had a minor benefit from Apptio closing early in 3Q, but you now expect a full year constant currency revenue growth to be at the low end of the 3  to 5  range. And so, I'm just wondering, should we now think about software consulting to grow at the lower ends of those ranges that you provided earlier, especially now kind of given some of your Red Hat comments  I'm just trying to understand what has changed underlying the different segments to get to kind of that new view on total revenue in constant currency  Thank you.Yes, thanks, Erik, I appreciate the question. So, similar to -- I think Toni asked something similar to this overall. When you look at IBM, 3  to 5 , just practically speaking, one quarter to go, we said, oh, it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range.Now, let's talk about it by segment. Software, you dial back 90 days ago. We said that we were very excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio. We said that we expected that to close in early fourth quarter. Team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid-August. But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually given our first half performance, both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also in our transactional book of business. We actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it -- and by the way, we said Apptio would be about 0.5 point on the full year. Now we closed it, what, a month, month-and-a-half earlier  Okay, so that 0.5 point of contribution on Apptio might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year. We still feel very confident. By the way, through three quarters we're up 6.5 . That's above our mid-term model.Yes, we have the peak wrap on ELAs last year, but very interesting, underneath our third quarter year-to-year performance, we're growing transactional revenue. Very different profile than what we started out in January, which I think prudently we said we expected transactional revenue was going to be a headwind to us. What's happening  The new innovation we're bringing to market is actually creating much more volume of new ELA content that by the way is contributed about 1.5 point of growth above our expectation. And we're also getting great  closing in   ph  NRR of 7 points versus history. So, we think like we just finished above our model in third quarter on constant currency on Software, we said in the prepared remarks, we expect a pretty similar fourth quarter at the high end overall, so we're maintaining Software.If you look at Consulting, we said 6  to 8  overall. By the way, year-to-date, we're up 6 . Actually, 6.4  to be exact. And we look at fourth quarter overall, we just talked about in Ben's question, our strong bookings, our book-to-bill at 1.16, the tailwinds on hybrid cloud around strategic partnerships, I think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance.Okay. Very good. Let's go to the next question, please.Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.Thank you. Jim, you provided some good detail on free cash flow year-to-date. And the question really is, are there any early indications on what non-operating items could impact free cash flow next year, working capital, cash taxes, et cetera, as well as how restructuring actions this year may flow into earnings and cash flow as well over the next several monthsYeah, David, thanks for the question overall. We'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow, but I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's two important metrics, revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We called out  10.5 billion, by the way, up  1.2 billion this year off of last year where we grew  2.8 billion year-to-year. And we said that's above our annualized model.Our annualized model is about  750 million   ph  per year coming on off the I E and the business fundamentals. You look through the third quarter, we're up now  1 billion year-to-year. We're at  5.1 billion, very high quality by the way. Of that  1 billion,  700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall, so that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth and our operating leverage and productivity we're driving in this business.And as I said all year long, I was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now let's say it again, when we look at that  1.2 billion free cash flow growth year-to-year, we're going to get most of it through cash source from profit, read that about  800 million to  900 million, and we said that we would get working capital efficiency this year. Why  Because of our 4Q '22 opportunity gap that we missed. And we called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes. Yes, we're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds. But you look at the underlying  1.2 billion free cash flow growth, it is a high quality, fundamentally driven out of our revenue growth and operating leverage.Now, you look to '24, we'll spend a lot more time on cash tax, a lot of that is going to be predicated on where we actually finished fourth quarter overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we've got to earn the credibility and discipline here closing out a free cash flow quarter, by the way, that's  5.4 billion.Very good. Sheila, let's take one last question.Our last question will come from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe Arvind, if we could just circle back on this well-worked topic of AI, could you maybe just take a very high-level approach at how you're seeing customers evaluating adoption, and how that might impact the nature of contracts within the Consulting business and feed the watsonx platform  Maybe initial read on adoption rates in view into how Consulting could be the tip of the spear there  Thank you.All right. Thanks, Brian, for the question. So, Consulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only, because some clients do have enough expertise inside to do things on their own.As we approach clients, trying to use, I'll call it, a big public chatbot to perhaps improve some service is not where they look to us, and we've been very clear that's not where we are going to go, and we do not actually serve up any of those services. However, I'll take maybe some quick examples as I go through.So, with a large, I'll use the word financial services company. They want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers. They actually use their own proprietary languages, not only the common languages that are available outside. They are then asking the question, who can I trust to augment their model, give it to me, and I don't really want to get into all the details of how I might use it, but I want them to provide the technology.In this case, Brian, we would work with them to augment the model using their language and their data and their code snippets. We would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100  that that leaks nowhere else. They would take back the model. It now becomes an as-a-service deployment in their private cloud infrastructure, and we monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software.I'll take another example that we are building out with Dun   Bradstreet, and I mentioned that briefly on the call. In that case, it is consulting led. They want to work with consulting to use watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka helps D B monetize their data better. So, in that case, it is absolutely consulting led. I think without consulting, we would not have landed that deal.Let me go to others, because there are also examples where our Consulting team is using both what's available with Azure OpenAI, as an example, to go win deals because they have built up their expertise. They've also built up expertise on Amazon's Braket platform, and they're going forward with winning deals on those. In that case, they're coming in with the methodology, with knowledge, with the thousands of trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms, and they are working with the clients to go do that.I think these are all examples of what is working. I think you are trying to also ask is it going to be Consulting or is it going to be Software  Look, we didn't say much on the call on this topic. We just characterized it as low hundreds of millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else, think of that as maybe half and half between Consulting and Software, which does tell you that a couple of points of growth for both those units came from the generative AI that we've been putting out. And I think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now. And we are certainly expecting and planning that that will only increase as the quarters go on.All right. So, let me now wrap up the call. This third quarter performance reinforced our confidence in the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients in today's environment. We're excited of the opportunities ahead of us, and I look forward to taking through -- you through our continued progress and our view of 2024 in January. Thank you all.Okay, Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",0,2023-10-25T20:00:11.000-04:00

What Affects The Price Of Gold: Conventional Wisdom Vs. History,"People buy gold and silver for a lot of reasons. For jewelry and adornment, for numismatic  coin collecting  purposes, to store wealth, limited industrial applications, to protect against inflation, and to guard against geopolitical turmoil and related threats to fiat  government-issued  currency. As it relates to investing, the list is narrowed  theFirst, it must be stated and underscored that there is nothing special about gold that makes it magically go up in value in response to inflation. Gold is a commodity, and like any other commodity, its price rises and falls according to supply and demand dynamics  with plenty of interference from gold futures speculation . In other words, the price of gold only goes up if people are willing to pay more for it. And, as inputs, commodities tend to be the first to feel inflation's power.Because it has been repeated so often that gold protects purchasing power from the ravages of inflation, it could be a classic instance of the tail wagging the dog. When people hear that inflation is high or going to be high, they flock to gold to protect their purchasing power thus driving the price of gold up. That increase in price then makes it look like gold did indeed track with inflation, but it wasn't the inflation that caused it. It was people buying gold due to inflationary fears. It's correlation but not causation. There have been  where gold went down in spite of inflationIn other words, trying to time the market and get in and get out of gold according to inflation reads and inflation expectations could result in considerable money loss.However, using gold as a store of value over extremely long periods of time could indeed achieve the desired result. This chart explains it allWith notable periods of divergence, gold and to a lesser extent silver have both kept pace with inflation. But the problem with this is that we have instruments that allow us to  pace inflation with zero periods of divergence, TIPS and I-bonds. So gold and silver become lesser vehicles if matching inflation is the stated goal. Another issue is that tracking with inflation via gold, silver, TIPS, or I-bonds means that the real return is still 0 . Purchasing power was maintained but wealth did not increase. If you can use an asset that BEATS inflation, why not use itGold and silver are non-productive assets. More than perhaps any other asset class, the value of these is inherently tied to how much someone else is willing to pay for it. Beyond limited use in industry and electronics, gold is just a mineral. Unlike stocks which represent proportional ownership of an entity that produces  and can produce more of  things that humans use, need, want, and demand, or real estate that serves a critical function to giving people a place to live, work, eat, etc., gold just sits there. As Warren Buffett said, sure you can fondle gold, but don't expect it to respond.In summation for this portion, yes precious metals can protect against inflation but only if they are held for the long term. But maintaining purchasing power is a far lesser goal than actually building wealth, so if you have to hold something for the long term anyway you might as well buy stocks or real estate, whose returns smash gold and silver.I am of the opinion that investing in precious metals for the inflation aspect alone simply isn't worth it. If you want to match inflation, buy TIPS or I-bonds. Better yet, beat inflation by investing in stocks and real estate for the long term. However, when coupled with a second factor, allocating a modest portion of one's overall portfolio to precious metals makes sense.Let me put it bluntly  if something like World War III starts up and the United States loses, our currency will almost certainly collapse. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the hot situation in Israel, and China's objective of someday re-taking Taiwan, plenty of folks are prognosticating about an outbreak of widespread war involving major powers. If the U.S. does not win that conflict alongside allies, don't count on being able to buy TIPS or I-bonds. If things get especially bad, don't count on your dollar bills being worth much more than the paper they are printed on. That is the doomsday scenario, a picture often painted by the  gold bugs .In that scenario where a strong government doesn't exist to issue and back up a fiat currency, silver and gold will be the likely fallback for a medium of exchange.An  describes it well. The U.S. dollar is....War could easily upset the value proposition of the United States.Even without a war or any doomsday scenario, the U.S. dollar is facing unprecedented challenges to its status as the world's reserve currency. This is due to the world becoming increasingly concerned about the U.S. capacity to meet debt obligations, alongside a rising China and other nations that would rather not bow to the dollar for settling global trades.At a BRICS summit earlier this year  BRICS   Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa , this theme was  by several world leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin said,  The objective, irreversible process of de-dollarization of our economic ties is gaining momentum.  President Xi Jinping of China was recorded as promoting  the reform of the international financial and monetary system . If any such  BRICS currency  comes into being even a decade from now, having gold and silver could very well act as a store of wealth insulated from any impact on the U.S. dollar. This is especially so if the rumors are true that any such BRICS currency would be backed by gold. It's worth noting that the past two years have seen  by central banks of various nations the world over.What happens to the price of silver and gold during periods of major conflict, threats, and social economic unrest  A few examples.Let's start with the most recent first, looking at a period that encompasses the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, indicated by the first and second red dots, respectivelyYou could make the case that gold shot up in response to COVID commotion, but you could also argue that the surge was simply a continuation of a previous bull trend that started two years earlier. The Ukraine situation saw gold soon then-after plummet by 19 .Next is The Great Recession which started in December of 2007, indicated by the red dotHere too the case could be made that the global shock resulted in a flight to the safety of gold, where prices pushed up by  200 in a few short months. However, the surge was short-lived. Before year end the price of gold had dipped below the recession start price, then starting a slow march upward that matched the global economic recovery.Now we look at September 11th, a day that changed the world. The price of gold went up by  20 in the immediate aftermath, but the settled back down quickly, flattening for a few months, and then slowly climbed through subsequent years. If this amounts to a flight to safety, it was cool and calculated. More of a meander to safety.Looking at WWII, where Germany invaded Poland in 1939  first red dot  and then when Japan brought the United States into the conflict in 1941  second red dot , both were in the midst of a significant fall in the price of gold. Global unrest indeed, but no surge in gold.The final example from the Great Depression certainly makes the strongest case for gold being a wise investment in instances of economic shock. From  360 to  800 in just a couple yearsThis list was not intended to be exhaustive. And it is certainly beyond the scope of this article to try and surmise fully why the price of gold behaved as it did in each given instance. The point is that significant events by themselves don't seem to send gold in a particular direction. Trying therefore to invest according to some potential doomsday event is an error, if history is any indicator. It's a mixed bag.But let's talk about an instance where there was no single shock to set things off, but rather a series of smaller events and conditions combined to create a climate that may have contributed to the meteoric rise in the value of gold that happened in the 1970sFrom  280 to  2,600 over ten years is a 25  annual growth rate. What a decade. What was going on that might explain some of the rise  Some things that have plenty of resemblance to today- Cold War with Russia- Stagflation- Oil embargo and subsequent energy crisis- Iranian hostage situation, with 60 US citizens taken- Russia's military posturing and invasion of Afghanistan- Yom Kippur or 4th Arab-Israeli warEerie, is it not  Replace a few words or names and those bullets basically describe today. None of those things individually had the same scope as WWII or the same shock as 9 11, but taken together they clearly pushed people's investing dollars into a perceived safe haven, gold of course.Now, to be perfectly clear, I am not predicting some meteoric rise in gold. Far from. Who knows what will or will not happen  However, it does underscore the importance of diversification among asset classes with an informed proportion of the portfolio sitting in precious metals, more so perhaps in instances where many monetary and socio-geo-political elements are in play.I am no gold bug. If I wanted to achieve one thing with this article, it was the hope that I could dampen the voices of the firms trying to make a profit by using current circumstances and in my opinion, using scare tactics to get people to buy precious metals. There is simply no proof that gold reliably spikes as a result of inflation and or big global events. That being said, it is one basket in which folks should have an egg or two as part of a long-term strategy of preserving wealth. Other baskets are real-estate, stocks, bonds, other commodities, and perhaps even a dash of foreign currency. No one knows what the future will bring on the U.S. or global stage. Therefore, touching various asset classes is wise. Limiting overt exposure to any single one is key.Fear of missing out and fear of loss should not be drivers of investment decisions. Data should drive investment decisions. I hope I provided here data that could round out the picture a bit and prevent folks from doing anything drastic. Buy gold and silver, but do so in a measured way that agrees with your overall life situation and goals.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Major, Yet Subtle BYD Developments Investors Haven't Paid Attention To","BYD OTCPK   has been the most successful legacy automaker in navigating through the transition to electric. By leveraging its appeal in the Chinese auto market, as well as the competitive advantage that comes with its verticallyYet BYD's stock has underperformed broader markets over the past month despite its blockbuster delivery numbers. The stock is down aboutThe modest performance continues to underscore the impact of several headwinds. They include BYD s exposure to multiple compression risks facing high capital-intensity auto manufacturing businesses under the risk-off market environment despite their high growth nature. This headwind has been further exacerbated by the incremental drag of historically lower multiples attributable to the parts manufacturing sector, which is also priced into the stock to reflect BYD s role as a leading supplier of batteries for both the auto and consumer electronics market. More importantly, ongoing geopolitical risks remain a significant overhanging discount factor on Chinese equities, overshadowing the fundamental resilience of names like BYD.However, BYD s expanding reach across the EV manufacturing supply chain and across various vehicle types and pricing segments are expected to reinforce its roadmap in becoming one of the most efficient and competitive players in the increasingly electric and digital economy. The stock has largely traded in line with auto parts manufacturing and supplier multiples like that of , but increasing consolidation of EV market share in China and abroad underscores potential for an upward multiple re-rate from current levels.BYD has orchestrated one of the fastest and most successful transitions to electric relative to its legacy auto manufacturing peers at home and overseas. The company  of its legacy ICE models in early 2022, becoming not only the  first mainstream automaker  to do so but also the first to maintain market share gains at a profitable beat under the transition.Specifically, BYD s monthly delivery volumes have been forging new records at a consistent pace since. BYD finished the third quarter with deliveries of  in September, representing a run-rate that could boost annual sales beyond its 3-million-vehicle target by the end of the year. Having already delivered more than 2 million vehicles  or more than 1 million BEVs  in the first nine months of 2023, with consistent double-digit sequential growth, BYD s full-year delivery guidance of 3 million vehicles seems almost conservative.The results underscore BYD s advantage in capitalizing on China s auto boom led by the transition to EVs over the past several years. Thanks to the company s ability to vertically integrate manufacturing at scale, and the Chinese government s generous financial incentives, the BYD brand has been able to maintain its reputation for affordability and quality in the transition to electric, which has successfully captured the likes of China s mainstream market. Specifically, BYD s vertically integrated business model, which spans the manufacturing of cars as well as some of the key components within them, has enabled its transition to electric both smoothly and profitably at scale, compensating for the capital intensity that comes with the endeavour. Recall that BYD has long been a manufacturer and supplier of leading EV battery technologies, including the  battery launched in 2020 which can currently be found integrated in foreign rival EV models, including Toyota s      and Kia s   for the Chinese market.The competitive advantage highlights the divergence from struggles observed in global ICE automakers historically favoured by the Chinese market, including GM  and Volkswagen       . Many of BYD s foreign rivals are only now starting to allocate capital towards the build-out of internal supply chains, while also struggling to attract sufficient demand needed to achieve economies of scale. The challenge to maintain internal profitability without compromising on affordability for consumers has been gradually displacing the market share of foreign automakers. And much of this has transitioned to the benefits of BYD, as corroborated by its  to becoming  China s top-selling car brand in the first quarter , ousting VW by widening margins.BYD s cost advantage, enabled by its vertically integrated business model at scale, has allowed it to consolidate share within China s auto market   the largest and fastest growing in the world. Despite the aggressive price war launched by leading rival Tesla, which has led to  across more than 40 auto brands in China this year, BYD has maintained competitive gross profit margins of more than 18  in the second quarter, up by more than 100 bps sequentially. In addition to gradual margin expansion, BYD s vertically integrated business model has also allowed it to take share of its rivals  growth and profits by being a key supplier of critical EV technologies   most notably, its batteries, which commands  of global market share and makes BYD the second largest supplier in the industry.The company s recent introduction of two additional premium brands   namely, Yangwang and Fang Cheng Bao   is expected to further its TAM. The two newly launched brands aims at penetrating the RMB 1  million  137,000  segment. Specifically, the Yangwang brand has debuted with two battery electric models   the  and the    with prices starting at RMB 1,098,000, subsidized by a RMB 8,000 rebate by BYD if the deposit is paid before December 31, 2023.Meanwhile, the Fang Cheng Bao  hybrid SUV unveiled at the Chengdu Motor Show in August is estimated to boast a starting price between , with the brand currently accepting pre-orders with a RMB 1,000 deposit, despite limited details on the production and delivery timeline. The brand has also hinted at  including the  Super 8  SUV and  Leopard 3 . The Fang Cheng Bao flagship SUV is expected to debut with a hybrid powertrain, taking advantage of the segment s increasing appeal in ChinaDespite the premium price charged, BYD has not relinquished its reputation for affordability in the two luxury brands. Current purchases of the Yangwang U8 comes with an attractive portfolio of post-sales freebies, including 10-year free in-vehicle 5G data availability, 8-year free roadside assistance and 3-year free roadside charging services, in addition to the RMB 8,000 rebate on eligible purchases before December 31, 2023. By leveraging its vertically integrated production strategy to enable significant cost efficiencies, alongside an attractive value-for-money proposition to attract demand from prospective buyers, BYD effectively broadens its appeal and reach to a greater audience across the Chinese auto market with the two new sub-brands.As discussed in , the strategy largely differs from BYD s upstart peers in the Chinese market. While many of China s local EV brands have started off business by penetrating the higher priced segments in an attempt to bolster profit margins and pave the way for supporting a capital-intensive journey into auto manufacturing, BYD has shown success in doing the opposite. Both Yangwang and Fang Cheng Bao are likely to drive further consolidation in China s premium EV sector, given BYD s brand reputation among local buyers. Specifically, the upper tier 1 and tier 2 Chinese economies, which have remained the most active drivers of EV adoption in the region, continues to show significant headroom for growth   EV penetration rates  in the more affluent Chinese regions, with plug-in SUVs being the best-selling vehicle type, underscoring favourable tailwinds for Yangwang and Fang Cheng Bao s initial go-to-market strategies. Taken together, the two sub-brands stand a good chance at complementing the mass market BYD brand in further displacing both domestic and foreign rivals  market opportunities and aid further expansion of its own local market share. This will inadvertently drive greater scale to BYD s vertically integrated business model, and enable a sustained trajectory of profitable growth over the longer-term.In addition to broader electrification tailwinds at home, bolstered by BYD s mission-critical role in the provision of supporting innovations, the company has also  identified the global business as a new avenue for growth . Since expanding its passenger vehicle sales to international markets in 2021, BYD now sells in more than 54 regions, with export volumes reaching new records. BYD reported a  mix of overseas deliveries during the third quarter, accelerating from 5  in the second quarter.With plans to further expand its presence across the APAC, EMEA and Latin American regions, BYD s overseas strategy is likely to become a  key volume driver  and complement its rising market share dominance at home. Specifically, Chinese imports currently account for 8  of Europe s EV sales. Current market forecasts anticipate the figure to jump to  by mid-decade, bolstered by the appeal of Chinese EVs  affordability to prospective buyers in Europe, with prices being on average 20  cheaper than local EU-made models. This has incentivized the European Commission to launch a year-long probe into  Chinese subsidies for EVs in a bid to ward off a flood of cheap imports . Dubbed as  anti-subsidy actions , any findings could potentially lead to the imposition of import duties on Chinese EVs aimed at levelling their prices to domestic offerings.However, BYD executives have recently played down the risks of the ongoing EU investigation, citing that the current EV adoption and competition trends in the region are a function of the broader . Even in the event that an anti-subsidy import duty is imposed by the EU government, BYD is likely to weather the headwinds better than other home-grown Chinese rivals given its strong balance sheet and efficient cost structure. BYD s presence in the overseas passenger EV markets also outperforms its local peers by wide margins, which further reinforces its prospects of becoming a global staple brand, similar to its mass market peers from Japan and Korea. BYD is currently one of the best-selling Chinese brands in Europe, with the  Atto 3  SUV being the  in Sweden over the summer. And the company likely has  volumes over profitability  as the near-term strategy in its overseas playbook, with an aim to first bolster its reputation in international markets, then expand their scale in markets beyond China.Meanwhile, BYD s relatively limited presence in the North American passenger vehicle market is likely to be compensated by its commercial footprint within the foreseeable future. BYD is currently a key seller of electric buses to the North American market, taking advantage of opportunities ensuing from governments  zero-emissions targets pledged in recent years. Market data shows that the electric bus market in North America is primarily consolidated among five players, with BYD being the . This highlights BYD s expanding global reach, despite its decision to not partake in North America s passenger EV opportunities, citing the  as one of the barriers to entry.We believe BYD s decision to focus on commercial opportunities in the North American market is a prudent choice. It allows the company to leverage the commercial ties it has been building in the region since  ago, while also enabling an observation period on the performance success and mishaps of emerging mass market peers like Vietnam s   to better gauge North Americans  preferences before planning an entry to the market.BYD continues to underperform its local EV peers, despite massive outperformance on key performance metrics spanning delivery volumes, sales growth, and profitability.Instead, the stock s performance appears to mirror its parts manufacturing peers, which are valued at a much lower multiple due to their high capital intensity and slim profit margins.The relative comparisons highlight not only the geopolitical risk discount factor on Chinese growth equities, but also the drag of inherently lower valuations attributable to the parts manufacturing sector on BYD's stock performance. But with its sales mix rapidly shifting to an auto-dominant stance, which alongside expanding auto sales growth is likely to aid further gross profit margin expansion through scale, we see BYD s potential for an upward valuation re-rating from current levels.This prospect is further complemented by BYD s introduction of new sub-brands aimed at the premium segment as well as its rapidly expanding international strategy, which will enable TAM expansion and drive further volumes and scale to the broader business.Given BYD s currently leading fundamental performance as the largest manufacturer of BEVs and second largest manufacturer of EV batteries, as well as its prospects of maintaining a sustained profitable growth trajectory, the stock warrants a higher multiple in line with the industry average. Even at the blended EV and battery manufacturing P S multiple of 1.9x, BYD's stock shows upside potential of more than 70  towards  52.In addition to valuation considerations on a relative basis to its peers, we believe BYD is also well-positioned to take advantage of an impending shift in macroeconomic factors in favour of Chinese equities. Admittedly, Chinese equities have taken a toll in recent years, burdened by significant discounts attributable to their elevated geopolitical, regulatory and macroeconomic risk exposures. However, we see several potential near-term tailwinds that could alleviate pressure on Chinese equities, particularly BYD given its strong underlying business fundamentals Following Fed Chair Jerome Powell s reaffirmation on policymakers  support for a  rate environment, alongside recent economic data that continues to portray resilient financial conditions, the 10-year Treasury yield has surged towards 16-year highs of  last week. The rising yield has generally incentivized demand for the dollar over the past year, given the appeal of returns on U.S. Treasuries relative to the sovereign debt of other countries, including China.Specifically, the U.S.'s latest monetary policy tightening cycle has led to the largest  between American and Chinese sovereign debt. Historically, the yield on China bonds has led that of U.S. Treasuries. But the tides turned following the Fed s latest rate hike cycle, which clashed with Beijing s need to loosen its monetary policy in an attempt to save China from its post-pandemic economic slump. The yield gap on 10-year notes issued by the world s two largest economies, with U.S. Treasury in the lead, has reached a 16-year high of more than 160 bps over the summer, and now exceeds 200 bps. This has accordingly weighed on the performance of the yuan as the dollar strengthens. And the yuan s underperformance  or the dollar s strengthening  has historically been correlated to weaker performance in Chinese equities   equities remain the  asset class in China, and the yuan s weakening has largely made it more expensive to partake in their growth prospects.However, with the U.S. 10-year yield repeatedly contesting, yet failing to breach the 5  threshold in recent weeks, markets are likely not buying into the Fed s higher for longer narrative. This is in line with  economic conditions, despite recent data that shows continued  in the labour market, which could potentially tip it into a downturn. While the timeline of an ensuing loosening of monetary policy remains uncertain, recent trends of resistance on the surging long-end Treasury yield underscore the market s expectations for normalization towards lower levels within the near-term, and reflects relative investor optimism on what  higher for longer  potentially entails. This makes a potential near-term tailwind for the yuan, which could alleviate some of the adverse pressure on Chinese equity valuations and unlock pent-up gains in BYD's stock, underpinned by its fundamental outperformance over the past year.The potential for normalizing Treasury yield could also discourage net carry trades. Specifically, traders have been increasingly shorting Chinese equities over the past year, not only because of their relative risk exposures but also because of the favourable mathematical set-up of the trade. The differential between surging Treasury yields and fees paid on shorts have resulted in a positive net carry, which makes the downside bets on Chinese equities a profitable undertaking. But expectations for normalizing Treasury yields could potentially  this incentive, and unleash greater volatility, and potential short squeezes, to markets   particularly Chinese equities like BYD, which have been heavily shorted over the past year. The compressed Chinese equity valuations continue to reflect their exposure to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the region. However, economic performance is likely to start lapping an easier prior period comparison relative to the impact of a high base felt over the past year.This is in line with , albeit modest, relative to pre-COVID levels observed over China s latest Golden Week holiday in celebration of the establishment of the PRC. With the market s focus still being on the  to lift the Chinese economy from the impact of a broader property slump and soft post-pandemic consumer spending growth, the impending shift towards a more favourable base effect in the coming months has likely yet to be priced into the cohort s valuations. This could be another potential near-term tailwind for underperforming Chinese stocks underpinned by robust fundamentals like BYD.BYD continues to demonstrate itself as a key driver of consolidation in the global EV market. Not only is it going after incremental share gains in the Chinese EV market with two new premium sub-brands, but the company is also looking to capture expanding opportunities overseas while partaking in competing rivals  prospects by being a key component supplier at the same time. BYD also boasts the competitive advantage of executing its long-term growth roadmap at a profitable pace, underpinned by successful vertical integration of production at scale.From a valuation perspective, BYD is also likely on the verge of an inflection point. We see prospects of a potential upward valuation re-rate given the rapid shift in sales mix towards higher-margin vehicle production and sales. Despite the overhanging headwinds facing Chinese equities, BYD has, time and again, demonstrated durable competitive advantages capable of driving a sustained profitable growth trajectory. BYD s fundamental strength remains a key accretive factor to the stock s valuation prospects in our opinion, which makes it well-positioned to realize pent-up gains when broader market conditions permit.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

XES: The Equity Version Of Oil,"Oil has been surprisingly strong in the last couple of weeks and looks like it may stage a sizeable rally here. This is happening as unemployment isWhat if I'm wrong  Could energy stocks now get some real play  The SPDR S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services ETF  is an exchange-traded fund  ETF  that provides a comprehensive way to gain exposure to the dynamic Oil   Gas Equipment   Services sector. The fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors and seeks to match the performance of the S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services Select Industry Index, beforeThe fund has recently shown some good strength relative to the broad Energy ETF .ETFs offer diversified exposure, minimizing single stock risk. However, it's still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. XES allocates its portfolio entirely to the Energy sector. It's a fairly concentrated fund with just 31 holdings. Weightings aren't overly concentrated overall though.Against broader Energy exposure, the fund has mixed results historically. It did extremely well in 2022 as it surged over 62 , and has some strong performance here. Because this fund is so closely tied to the performance of Oil itself, this should make sense. If Oil does continue higher, this is the equity way of playing the commodity's strength. I think this is important to emphasize as it really is highly dependent on Oil prices gaining ground.While XES is a viable option for those seeking to outperform the Energy ETFs segment, there are other ETFs in the space worth considering. The iShares U.S. Oil Equipment   Services ETF  tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment   Services Index, while the VanEck Oil Services ETF  follows the MVIS U.S. Listed Oil Services 25 Index. This is really a question more of preference as these funds still share the same factor sensitivity to Oil.It's important to remember that while XES provides a unique opportunity to invest in the Oil   Gas Equipment   Services sector, it also comes with its share of risks. These include factors like market volatility, sector concentration, and geopolitical events that can disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies.Ultimately, I think this comes down to a question of whether Oil breaks, or if we are in a stagflationary environment whereby Oil is less sensitive to a global slowdown due to years of structural underinvestment. I'm not a believer in that thesis thus far for a host of reasons outlined in my prior writings. Regardless, I think it's good to consider having a portion of a portfolio in a part of the market like this, with the caveat that it's a play on Oil which could falter in a credit event.Are you tired of being a passive investor and ready to take control of your financial future  Introducing The Lead-Lag Report, an award-winning research tool designed to give you a competitive edge.The Lead-Lag Report is your daily source for identifying risk triggers, uncovering high yield ideas, and gaining valuable macro observations.

Scared Money Don't Make No Money (The Halloween Edition),"Believe it or not, I get some of my best writing ideas while I m working out early  5 00 am  at the gym.I suppose it s because of the adrenaline that provides enhanced focus and mental clarity.This pastI was preparing  mentally  knowing that many people watching the webinar would want to know why they should buy REITs right now.I m sure you re thinking about that right nowAlso, because I get frequent messages from Seeking Alpha, readers oftentimes ask me questions regarding the underperformance of REITs over the last year-and-a-half.Rightfully so  see below .I m sure many of you are holding REITs right now and wondering whether you should keep holding them. Here s what theThe sentiment for real estate today is clearly fearfulIn a Barron s interview this weekend Seth Klarman said,As many of you know, I lived through the Great Recession as a real estate investor, which means that I can truly attest to the fear that I encountered when banks failed, jobs were lost, and many REITs were forced to cut their dividends.Does this look familiarThis chart  above  shows REITs   using Vanguard Real Estate ETF    from late 2007 through April 2009.One important factor to consider when comparing REITs in 2008 to REITs in 2023 is leverage levels.Over the last 15 years there has been a push to reduce leverage and to have an improved capital stack.Balance sheets matter today, even more so during periods of rising uncertainty, higher borrowing costs and lower availability of capital. REITs operating with higher financial leverage adds financial risk into the return profile of real estate.As we found out in 2010 through 2020, leverage can enhance returns on the way up, but it can also exacerbate negative returns on the way down.If you don t know this by now, you should know that more highly levered vehicles are likely to experience more drastic declines in equity values versus those that have taken a more prudent approach.Most REITs that we re recommending right now falls into the latter camp, with leverage  measured as the ratio of debt to total assets  at a more than two-decade historic low of just 28 .This represents an 18  decline compared to the end of 2007 and a 37  decline from the peak of the Great Recession.However, REITs have not been immune to capital market uncertainty and mortgage market turmoil.Which is why it s critical to focus on the stocks with rock solid balance sheets and high-quality management.These two are correlated by the way.A good management team knows that a strong balance sheet will have debt laddered out, such that it spreads refinancing risk over several years.The weighted average maturity of debt of REITs today is approximately 7.3 years, versus just 5.3 years at the end of 2007.In addition, many REITs have been benefiting from fixing a large proportion of their debt at the more attractive funding rates of recent years, with a typical range between 75  to 95  fixed-rate debt today.According to Morgan Stanley Research, only around 11  of total REIT debt is maturing in 2022-23, at an average rate of 3.3 . Refinancing into a higher rate environment assuming a rate of 6.0   would only be a roughly 2.5  headwind to cash flows.Now, there are certainly outliers worth mentioning.Like   an a BBB  rated balance sheet that recently announced a dividend cut after its plan to spin off 59 office properties and sell another 87. We suspect the net lease REIT will slice its dividend by around 10   to around  3.75 per share from the current  4.27 per share .Many of the other dividend cutters we ve seen recently have been predicted by the iREIT  team.And we expect to see more dividend cutters in the months ahead.Now, as I said earlier, I get a lot of inspiration from my early am workouts at the gym  Anytime Fitness , and this week I was listening to  Scared Money  by J. Cole and Moneybagg Yo.Now, even though I wrote the Rap Review for my high school newspaper  many decades ago , I won t bother to break down the lyrics and the beats right here.However, the song is inspirational to my article today, because the phrase  scared money don t make money  is the reason I want to use phrase in the context of taking calculated risks.I m sure some of you are perfectly happy with making 5  in high yield savings account, and there s absolutely nothing wrong with that  I have  20  in cash right now myself .However, I have much more clarity in the REIT sector  because I live and breathe it  and I can sense an incredible opportunity unfolding that will allow me  and my family  to retire richThe game is all about taking calculated bets and not getting mesmerized by the so-called  sucker yields  or  value traps .Realty Income  is now yielding 6.3 .Shares are trading at  49.00 per share with a P AFFO of 12.3x.As you can see above, Realty Income is cheaper today than it was during COVID-19.Shares traded at 8.1x during the Great Recession, however by comparison, Realty Income has much better fundamentals today than it did in 2008-2009.Today Realty Income is A-rated with healthy leverage   net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x and fixed charge coverage of 4.6x.Analysts estimate Realty Income to grow by around 4  per year in 2024 and 2025  without M A .The valuation is compelling, and we believe that the combination of 6.3  yield, 4  growth, and price appreciation could result in annualized returns of 25 .Agree Realty  is now yielding 5.5 .Shares are trading at  54.32 per share with a P AFFO of 13.8x.As you can see, Agree is trading below its COVID-19 low of 17.2x.I want to point out that while Agree traded at 4.5x during the Great Recession, the company had heavy exposure to non-investment grade tenants like Borders  29  exposure in 2009  and K-Mart.Over the last decade or so Agree has done an exceptional job of diversifying the business model with high quality tenants. In addition, the balance sheet is in much better shape.As shown above, Agree s balance sheet is BBB rated and the company has no material debt maturities until 2028.At the end of Q3-23 the company had  957 million of liquidity with a bet debt to recurring EBITDA of 4.5x. The fixed charge coverage  includes principal amortization and the preferred dividend_ was a very healthy 5.1x.Similar to Realty Income, analysts are forecasting lighter growth for Agree in 2024 and 2025  3 . Also, like Realty, the upside for Agree is compelling   an attractive 5.5  yield, 3  growth, and price appreciation   that results in a forecasted annualized total return of 20 .American Tower  is now yielding 3.7 .Shares are trading at  171.99 per share with a P AFFO of 17.6x.While American Tower was formed in 1995 it didn t convert to a REIT until 2011. As you can see  above , the REIT is trading at the lowest multiple in its history as a REIT.The company has an investment grade rated  BBB-  balance sheet and has reduced its floating rate debt balance to below 11 , increased liquidity to  9.7 billion, with an average maturity of over six years. As of Q2-23 the company s net leverage was 5x.American Tower reported solid Q3-23 results with broad-based upside and 2023 guidance was increased  midpoint increased from  9.70 to  9.79 , including a 50bps bump to organic billings growth from 5.5  to 6.0 , highlighting the value of the globally diversified portfolio.Analysts forecast growth of 6  in 2024 and 8  in 2025.iREIT  likes American Tower s potential here   with the 3.7  dividend, 7  growth and price appreciation resulting in total return upside of 20  annually.Differentiation is the essence of value creation.This is how REITs responded in 2009 through 2011.To be clear, we re not calling it the bottomIn fact, another rate increase is likely still in the cards.While the Fed will keep its key interest rate on hold on Nov. 1, it may wait longer than previously thought before cutting it.What does this meanBe selective with the investments that you make and focus on balance sheets.Insist on quality.No matter how big the yieldWarren Buffett explains,Finally, remember that...Author's note  Brad Thomas is a Wall Street writer, which means he's not always right with his predictions or recommendations.

Albertsons And Kroger Will Not Likely Merge As Planned,"We've written about the Kroger Albertsons merger since it was first announced as . In , we expressed our doubts about whether the merger could be effected.This is to update and reiterate that view.The recent announcement that Kroger It shouldn't.First, Khan is already skeptical of such divestitures in pursuit of mergers and even wrote a law review  in the Harvard Law and Policy Review   11 HLPR 235  2017  of the Albertsons and Safeway merger of 2015 that could be somewhat analogous to the Kroger Albertsons merger.Writing about the merger in 2017, then- Professor Khan and her co-author wroteChair Khan reiterated those reservations again, as SA News Editor Joshua Fineman  just last week. is not a listed entity, so its financial wherewithal is not readily determined. However, according to  it has about 160 locations, doing business as independent franchisees and retail stores under the  Grand Union ,  Piggly Wiggly  and other Adding 413 retail grocery stores to such a small chain - with a requirement to purchase up to an additional 237 stores, according to Grocery Dive, should the FTC require it - should give the FTC pause, given the 2015 Haggen experience.Second, and little remarked upon by analysts, is how the merger will likely create a , or single buyer, in the market for grocery workers in many markets. While the merger partners have repeatedly asserted that they'll treat their employees, whom they call  associates  fairly, C S Wholesale has a rather hostile view toward union workers and a limited union worker footprint. For example, its tuition assistance benefits are explicitly We already know Kroger workers who were surveyed last year are struggling to make ends meet. As we wrote in May,Grocery workers are among the lowest paid workers in the country, earning, on average,  the  for a family of four. Monopsony can only have a further deleterious effect on grocery workers' wages in small towns and so-called  food deserts  in urban areas that both have limited grocery shopping - and employment - options.Finally, this all come in the context of the 2024 presidential and Congressional elections with an incumbent administration that has focused heavily on what it calls  equity  and that has heavily endorsed workers in labor unions. Moreover, the Secretaries of State of seven states, including the  swing state  of Arizona, have questioned the merger, as has Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont. Attorneys general in California, Illinois, Maryland, and Nevada - all part of the Biden Administration electoral college base - have either commenced actions against the merger or are considering it.It seems almost certain that offloading the 416 store locations -- and even more -- will not suffice to appease Chair Khan, and she has seemingly hinted so. Moreover, Chair Khan's expressed concerns about  economic inequality , as related twice in the first two sentences of the abstract of her HLPR article, likely indicates that the monopsony that would result in the merger will receive extraordinary scrutiny.Kroger and Albertsons have said they will pursue the merger through the courts, but that would take several months and, perhaps, even years.This merger is dead.Instead of trying to  shoehorn  a challenging deal that is anathema to the current administration, I think it would be preferable for Kroger, Albertsons, as well as C S Wholesalers, to collectively spin-off as many as 500 more  i.e., beyond the 600 that were to be spun-off in the original merger plan  of their stores and distribution facilities for shares of a new public company. In turn, these shares can be distributed to their own shareholders and member owners as a public company. The new entity, independent in all respects, but with strong commercial ties, could still enjoy many of the logistical advantages of the original merger with licensing and supply contracts, but still be a sufficiently independent enterprise that it will not draw hostile regulatory scrutiny._______________________________  The views expressed, including the outcome of future events, are the opinions of the firm and its management only as of September 19, 2023, and will not be revised for events after this document was submitted to Seeking Alpha editors for publication.

"Geopolitics and interest rates are moving the market, not earnings","Earnings results from reports have not mattered in the last two weeks for investment markets.

ZIM Integrated: The Dividend Lesson (Rating Upgrade),"The thesis of this article is twofold and both are relatively straightforward. First, I want to summarize the lessons I've learned from   as a dividend investor. Second, I wantIn the early part of 2023, I wrote  to caution readers against ZIM. During that time, the overall sentiment on ZIM was bullish and my view was considered contrarian. One of the key reasons for the bullish view was the dividend yield  more than 100  at that time . Of course, even the bulls won't expect such dividends to last. Therefore, the gist of the bullish argument was that the dividend can last long enough to compensate for the risks.My view was simply that it wouldn't be because of the strong headwinds in shipping rates and volume. Indeed, the company kept bleeding cash. The dividend cut came sooner and deeper than expected. ZIM investors suffered large total losses  see the chart below .Looking forward, the picture is still gloomy. I do not expect the company to earn a profit in the next 1 2 years either in terms of accounting EPS or free cash flow. As such, I do not think there will be dividends either in the next 1 2 years  and ZIM's dividend guidance is was to pay out 30 50  of its net income annually . Global shipping rates and volume are still near a cyclical bottom  see the next two charts , and I anticipate the situation to persist longer given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties  e.g., high inflation and the possibility of a recession  and geopolitical conflicts  e.g., the Russian Ukraine war and the Israel Hamas conflict .However, as to be elaborated on next, I do see a few positive signs in development. At the same time, I believe the stock's current valuation  about 0.22x of its tangible book value  has also priced in all the negatives. As seen from the chart below, inventory level has recovered strongly in the recent six months across all major shipping categories  manufacturing, retail trade, and wholesalers . In the meantime, the global shipping volume this year  the orange line in the right panel  has also recovered substantially from the bottom level compared to 2020  the dark red line . By eyeballing the data, in the first half of 2023, the global volume has recovered to be about the average in the past five years between 2019 and 2023.A full recovery could take longer due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks I just mentioned. However, if the shipping market does recover, I see ZIM as well-positioned to benefit because of several differentiating features in its business model. The top differentiators in my view are its focus on a global niche strategy, its relatively young and agile fleet, and its use of digital technologies.ZIM operates in several selected trade routes, in which it has a sizable market share. I expect such focusing on a niche to enable ZIM to offer more competitive rates and services to its customers once the overall climate changes. ZIM also has a relatively young and flexible fleet, which allows it to adapt quickly to changing market conditions such as routes and operation schedules as needed. Finally, in this mature sector, ZIM is a player that emphasizes the role of new technologies more than the average in the way I see things. It uses digital solutions to improve its efficiency and customer service  such as booking and tracking .The picture is not all rosy and ZIM is not out of the wood entirely. There are a few key risks associated with ZIM. Some of these risks are common to the shipping sector and some of them are more unique to ZIM. The common risks include the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks mentioned above. Other key common risks include environmental regulations and government policies. Shipping companies who operate a global fleet have to navigate  apologies for the pun  a web of environmental regulations and government policies from different regions countries. A change in these regulations  for example, new regulations on emissions or export control  could increase their costs or disrupt their operations.In terms of risks that are more unique to ZIM, three top ones come to my mind. First, ZIM has a higher exposure to the spot market than some of its larger competitors, making it more sensitive to fluctuations in the spot market. Second, its niche strategy mentioned above could be a double-edged sword. It helps to specialize but at the same time could also make it more vulnerable to economic downturns in specific markets. For example, if there is a recession in the U.S., ZIM could be disproportionately impacted, as the US is one of its largest markets. Finally, also due to its niche strategy, it's more reliant on several key customers, which causes concentration risks.However, my view is that these negatives have already been fully priced in at the current price levels. The next chart shows ZIM's price-to-tangible book value  P TBV  ratio in recent years. As seen, its current P TBV ratio as of July 2023 is only 0.221x. This is a level that is far lower than its historical averages as seen in the chart and also the average ratio for the shipping sector  whose average P BV ratio is about 2.3x as of this writing . Also, it is important to note that TBV only includes the assets that are more liquid assets and can be more accurately priced than those included in BV  such as goodwill and intellectual properties . In the meantime, ZIM is taking steps to mitigate some of the risks mentioned above in my view. For example, ZIM is reducing its exposure to the spot market by entering into longer-term contracts. It has also been investing in new technologies and fuels to reduce its environmental impact.All told, I am still seeing strong headwinds for ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. in the next 1 2 years due to both shipping rates and shipping volume for its key routes. I do not expect positive earnings, free cash flow, or dividends in the next 1 2 years. However, I now begin to see some positive signs afoot. Furthermore, I view ZIM as well-positioned to benefit once the tide turns thanks to a few differentiating factors in its business model. Finally, the stock's current valuation is so compressed that the negatives have been factored in the way I see it. These considerations led to my upgraded rating of HOLD from my earlier rating of SELL.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

Gold: The Safe Haven Asset Could Lift Off As Geopolitical Risks Worsen,"The Middle-Eastern conflict erupted over the weekend as Hamas militants launched an unprecedented coordinated surprise assault on Israel's border towns. As such, it could give gold  bulls renewed fervor on its recent bottoming process, benefiting SPDR GoldThe conflict between Israel and Hamas could  to escalate into a regional conflict, undermining the global economic recovery that's still fending off challenges from elevated inflation and interest rates.Iran's alleged participation in Hamas' detailed planning and support could trigger a military response from Israel's defense forces, worsening the geopolitical tensions and possibly leading to another oil crisis.As such, the war premium has risen significantly at an inopportune time for the equity markets   as buyers attempt to shake off September's weakness into a seasonally strong Q4.Notwithstanding the intensifying tensions, I have already anticipatedWhile I'm emotionally affected by the escalating conflict that has seen thousands of lives lost between the Palestinians and the Israelis over the weekend, I recognize that it could also be a moment of respite for gold holders.Gold is widely recognized as a safe haven asset. It last surged toward its highs in May 2023 but was decisively rejected at a critical resistance zone. Astute operators would have observed the  triple threat  bull trap  false upside breakout  in underlying gold prices at the  2,090 level. As a result, GLD was also battered, falling nearly 12  through last week's lows.Notably, it formed a bear trap  false downside breakdown  on its weekly chart, attracting dip buyers looking to help GLD bottom out. With the war premium rising due to a potential escalation in the Middle Eastern conflict, it could help GLD recover its momentum at a crucial time. As such, I believe it's a significant opportunity for high-conviction investors to consider buying its steep pullback, as they anticipate a further re-test of its May 2023 highs.As seen above, GLD has collapsed back into its 200-week moving average or MA  purple line  and re-tested its February lows. However, GLD's price action indicates a subtle bear trap, as dip buyers returned with conviction toward the close of last week's trading  pre-conflict .Furthermore, GLD remains well above its October 2022 lows, which I expect to stay robustly defended. With the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, I anticipate more robust buying sentiments for investors seeking the allure of gold's security. It should also take some sheen off the spike in bond yields, helping to mitigate recent headwinds from bond sellers.A further support zone at the  160 level is possible but unlikely for now. With gold oversold, I expect a liftoff in buying momentum that could see gold outperforming the market in the near term.Have constructive commentary to improve our thesis  Spotted a critical gap in our view  Saw something important that we didn t  Agree or disagree  Comment below with the aim of helping everyone in the community to learn betterJR Research is a seasoned investor with a background in economics.

"TLT: The Fed's Response To War, Oil Crisis And Inflation","The 30-year US Treasury bond yield recently surpassed 5 , hitting a 20-year high.Last week, Fed Chair Powell commented that further rate hikes may not be needed if Treasury yieldsMarket probability trackers show investors easing rate hike expectations in December 2023 and January 2024 post-Powell's remarks. The market appears reassured that bond yields climbing may substitute for some of the Fed's policy tightening.For investors, the key question now is whether Treasuries like iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF , down 18  year-to-date, is becoming a safer investment again.To evaluate the risk-reward of TLT, we will analyze the two biggest drivers of Fed policy -1  Inflation and2  Regional conflictsFirst, the chart below clearly shows the Fed funds rate  red line  is more volatile and drives the direction of the 30-year Treasury yield  blue line .When the Fed cut rates to zero during the pandemic, the 30-year yield fell in tandem. As the Fed has hiked aggressively, longer yields have followed higher. This close relationship demonstrates Fed policy is the primary determinant of long-term yields.Inflation indirectly impacts bond yields by influencing Fed decision-making. When inflation rose faster than expected earlier this year, it prompted more aggressive Fed tightening.Digging into the inflation data, the main stubborn categories left are energy, food away from home, and services like shelter and transportation.Notably, shelter and transportation services account for the largest CPI weightings at 32  and 8  respectively. Within shelters, owners' equivalent rent  OER  and actual rents make up the bulk of the category.OER essentially measures how much it would cost a homeowner to rent their owned property. It captures components like prices, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.Rents are still rising in inflation reports partly because rent contracts are typically negotiated on 12-month terms. So the CPI calculation includes a mix of existing lease rates and new higher prices.However, the charts below suggest both US house prices and rent growth are now decelerating. Rent growth is slowing faster than purchase prices because the supply of houses available for sale keeps decreasing, while the supply of rentals is growing.Nevertheless, over the past 50 years, the ratio of home prices to median household income has reached an all-time high. This raises questions for investors about what could potentially prevent the Fed from reducing interest rates next year. Even though housing prices are growing at a slower pace, affordability remains a significant concern.Further, even if the record mortgage rate has caused a significant decline in mortgage demand, it appears that we are still at a very high level of demand when compared to historical levels. This suggests that if home prices do not decrease as rapidly as expected, the Federal Reserve does not appear to be concerned about the declining housing demand resulting from higher mortgage rates.The question at hand is whether the deceleration trend in CPI, alongside elevated prices for durable goods like housing and cars, warrants the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates next year, or if 2024 marks the beginning of a more sustained period of higher rates.Based on historical experience, the Fed has tended to prioritize regulating inflation over considering affordability issues for households. Another way to address the affordability issue is by having households with lower interest rates have more debt on their balance sheets. This also explains why the long-term Treasury yield is constantly declining since adding more debt is the only option to address the debt issue.The US household debt to GDP ratio is at an all-time low. This therefore supports the Fed's decision to cut interest rates in 2024 once the CPI reaches its goal.Despite recent drops in home prices and rents due to slowing demand, OER continues pushing higher. One of the major driving forces is the rising insurance costs.Insurance appears to be particularly sticky for some reasons. The insurance industry is highly concentrated, with a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index consistent with high concentration levels. This grants insulation from competition to aggressively raise prices.With insurers holding monopoly power in a constrained market, they can perpetuate inflation through periodic rate hikes. Many of them do so by monopoly in a single region state as illustrated by  data.Although regulated by the government, insurers can still obtain approval for large increases by citing higher costs. For exantly secured approval for 30  home and 23  pet insurance increases. Insurers are maximizing increases allowable under caps by pointing to inflation, climate change, and other cost pressures.This poses a serious drag on consumer spending power since wage growth trails insurance inflation badly. In September 2023, for instance, auto insurance continued to grow at a very high rate by 11 .Therefore, until service components like shelter and transportation move down materially, the Fed seems unlikely to pivot on rates. Services inflation remaining sticky and elevated prevents the clear disinflation the Fed needs to see. Besides the housing prices, any durable decline in insurance costs would be a signal potentially capping yields.A second factor for Fed policy is geopolitical risk. With US forces ready to engage militias in Syria and tensions escalating with Iran, investors are weighing the potential fallout.Three scenarios warrant consideration  one where the United States becomes involved in a war, another where the United States refrains from engaging in war but faces an oil crisis, and a third where the United States avoids both war and an oil crisis.Conventional wisdom suggests war raises Treasury demand as a safe haven asset, lowering yields. But reviewing past wars shows inflation has instead often spiked.During World Wars I and II along with the Korean War, inflation frequently hit 15-20  as massive war spending strained resources.The chart below illustrates how the US budget deficit ballooned to -30  of GDP during World War II, fueling widespread inflation.Today's deficit projections already show a widening trend even without a new war, reaching an estimated -10  of GDP by 2053. Many investors such as Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio worry this debt trajectory is unsustainable. By 2053, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 180 , well above the World War II peak of 100 .With structural deficits stretching budgets even absent conflict, a new major war could be financially disastrous. This deterioration of US credit quality would normally pressure Treasury yields higher.However, as a matter of fact, during past wars like World War II, the Fed has intervened by essentially suppressing yields through Treasury purchases to fund government spending needs. So despite high inflation eroding real returns, nominal yields have often fallen or remained low due to Fed intervention.While we may not be experts in matters of war, if we simply assess the added capacity of the US government to respond to a conflict, the situation today may not be as dire as it appeared in 1970. US defense budget as a share of GDP is falling, reaching a record low of 3.5 , while overall spending is rising, reaching a record high of 800 billion in 2021. This implies that the US government can raise its defense spending if necessary.While large wars would logically pressure inflation higher, historical precedent shows the Fed has resisted this by maintaining artificially low rates. Therefore, the ideal scenario for bond investors could be if the US is at war and the Fed starts purchasing bonds once more.This is the most probable scenario as the Fed remains sidelined for now, keeping rates elevated until inflation moderates further.The high cost of commodities is a primary justification for many increases in living expenses. The prices of meat and oil red  are at a 52-week high and those of agriculture, metals, and natural gas are at a 52-week low green , which is one approach to assess the total situation.We believe that the Fed is winning the war on inflation, but how long the Fed must maintain its high-interest rate will depend on the price of oil and sticky CPI components.Apart from the cost of housing, used automobile prices are currently declining more quickly.This makes it more advantageous for service CPIs like insurance and maintenance costs to decrease. Two forces the regulation price cap and the durable price decline will limit the capacity of service businesses to raise prices.Thus, the Fed's plan to cut interest rates in 2024 remains intact. Consequently, TLT holders may benefit from this.The black swan event is definitely the oil crisis again and without a total war. As demand for oil is still increasing in 2023 as it reached 100 million barrels per day level, this suggests that in the event of an oil crisis only, this will continue to push oil prices higher because the demand for oil has not materially deteriorated as a result of higher rates. In addition, since the US is not involved in the war, the Fed has no reason to buy bonds to bail out the US government but can be pushed to increase rates further to as high as 20 . Thus, we see the black swan event of TLT downside as significant.Recent increases in long-term bond yields appear to reflect growing concerns about the potential for an oil crisis due to escalating regional conflicts in the Middle East. This suggests that the rise in long-term Treasury yields is not just a result of investors demanding higher returns to compensate for inflation, but also factors in heightened geopolitical risks.While an oil supply disruption could exacerbate inflationary pressures, there are signs that overall inflation may be peaking. The Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes over the past year seem to be having a cooling effect on some previously red-hot sectors like housing and used cars. This is contributing to slower inflation in goods.Meanwhile, potential catalysts like a Biden-Xi meeting in November offer an upside for bonds if tensions deescalate. So some short-term trading opportunities may emerge.But even if the Fed is expected to cut interest rates in 2024, there is still a sizable downside risk to TLT in the case of an oil crisis. On the TLT, we would be neutral.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

I Just Made Northrop Grumman My Second-Largest Investment,"I wasn't planning on writing another article so soon on  after I covered the company on September 10 in an  with the title Since then, shares have risen 12 , making it one of the best performers in my portfolio.I'm not writing this article just to tell you how well NOC is doing. That would be a waste of everyone's time.No, since early September, a lot has happened that requires coverage.As a result, I added so aggressively to my position that NOC is now my second-largest investment.While these numbers will change, as I'm planning new investments in non-defense industries, I have used the past few months to load up on investments that, I believe, will allow me to grow my dividend income and beat the market on a prolonged basis.Northrop Grumman is one of these stocks.As we have a lot of new developments to discuss, let's dive right inAs I have mentioned in almost all of my defense-focused articles, I am not buying defense companies to benefit from war. The opposite is true, as I invest in defense companies with high-tech capabilities that keep people safe and prevent war in the first place.One of the reasons why most defense analysts are so optimistic about the Ukraine war remaining contained is the fact that it's surrounded by NATO nations with capabilities that would make any attack from Russia too costly to even attempt.This is an  I used in my prior article to show that  beats .Additionally, the other day, a defense insider told me that defense companies themselves prefer peacetime. While that may not sound logical, wartime is not beneficial for defense companies. In times of peace, it is much easier to hike prices and focus on key areas without being forced to research or produce certain products. It's also much easier for supply chains and margins.Having said that, Northrop Grumman is a technology company.The company generates more than half of its money from Space Systems and Mission Systems. Just a quarter of its revenue last year came from Aeronautics Systems, which includes the next-generation bomber, B-21 Raider.Essentially, NOC is involved in everything ranging from missile defense and commercial space operations to multi-domain warfare support, F-35 fuselage production, Advanced AI, supercomputers, and related services.While innovation is hard to quantify, I sometimes joke that NOC is more innovative than all FANG stocks combined.These capabilities have set NOC apart from its peers.Over the past ten years, NOC shares have returned 470 , beating the S P 500 by a huge margin. NOC has also beaten all of its major defense-focused peers. However, it needs to be said that both L3Harris Technologies  and RTX  went through major mergers over the past four years.A big part of its returns were buybacks and dividends.With everything said in this article so far, now is a great point to dive into what the company said during last month's Morgan Stanley Laguna , which was attended by Northrop CEO Kathy Warden.While some companies often reveal just a bit about their future during these conferences, Northrop pretty much discussed any topic that I have covered in the past, which is one reason why I'm writing this article.For example, the company highlighted its strong sales growth of 7  year-to-date, with a projected 5-6  sales growth for the year at the midpoint of its guide.Warden also emphasized the company's strategy to expand margins, aiming for a 20  compound annual growth in free cash flow over the next two years through 2025 and doubling the free cash flow by 2028. DoubleAs one can imagine, this substantial free cash flow expansion creates opportunities for capital deployment and value creation for shareholders.Northrop mentioned a focus on returning 100  of free cash flow to investors this year, including share repurchases and dividend increases.I have little doubt that most of its free cash flow in the years ahead will also end up in investors' pockets  both directly via dividends and indirectly via buybacks .It also helps that the company has a net leverage ratio of less than 2x EBITDA and a BBB  credit rating, meaning it does not need to prioritize its balance sheet over shareholder returns.During the conference, Kathy Warden expressed confidence in Northrop Grumman's growth prospects.Despite the 3  cap in the Department of Defense  DoD  budget, NOC foresees strong growth, especially in areas like nuclear modernization and space programs.International opportunities, especially in Europe, are expected to further strengthen growth. The strong backlog and international contracts provide a robust foundation for Northrop Grumman's positive outlook. The company went into this year with a  79 billion backlog.NOC also expects that the continuing resolution will end up going into next year, meaning it expects higher approved defense spending.Based on this context, last week, Israel was attacked, leading to a further complication of global geopolitics. Western nations are now involved in two conflicts  the one in Ukraine and one in Israel, which could launch a ground offensive into Gaza soon.We're seeing exactly what I was afraid of a while ago. While I didn't predict that these exact things would happen, we're seeing increasing tensions between nations supporting Russia and China and NATO allies. While it needs to be seen how bad things get in the Middle East, we're not at a point where defense spending has to be a priority, even if it's just to modernize existing equipment.UBS seemed to agree when it  NOC shares this week.As reported by Seeking Alpha  emphasis addedAs we can see, the bank highlighted some points that I have been focusing on as well, including NOC's advanced products and services and the need to increase targeted defense funding.The bank also showed that it expects NOC to outperform its peers in terms of growth. While the stock is trading at the highest multiple among its peers, it is expected to erase that premium over the next four years.Furthermore, as part of risk management, the company is not bidding for the contract to build the next-generation air dominance program  NGAD , as it believes it is better suited to be a supplier. As I already own a company that generates a lot of money from a single project  Lockheed Martin's  F-35 , I'm very happy with this decision.Instead of focusing on the NGAD, Northrop Grumman used the aforementioned conference to express confidence in various opportunities within the aerospace and defense sector.Warden highlighted their involvement in programs like F A-XX and collaborative combat aircraft  CCA  as potential growth areas.The F A-XX is going to be the successor of the F A-18, which can often be found on aircraft carriers as the backbone of the Navy's air capabilities. Northrop is competing with Lockheed and Boeing , which is building the current F A-18 fighter.They also noted the potential for growth and competitive advantage in autonomous aircraft, leveraging the company's expertise and experience in the field. While it needs to be seen how much funding emphasis autonomous defense products get, I believe this will turn into a cash cow for NOC over the next few decades.Given NOC's growth trajectory, there's no point in using the company's current valuation. After all, UBS data showed that the company is currently trading at a huge premium.Using the company's expected 2028 free cash flow yield, the stock is trading at 17.9x free cash flow. This would bring the valuation back to the pre-pandemic normal.Even beyond that, it is highly likely that NOC maintains high-single to low-mid-digit annual EBITDA and free cash flow growth.The current consensus price target is  500, which is 6  above the current price. UBS gave the stock a  555 target, which is 17  above the current price.I agree with that target and will add to my NOC position on potential corrections down the road.On October 26, the company is set to release its 3Q23 results. The market expects  5.75 in EPS. This is based on eight estimates. The company has gotten one downside revision and one upside revision over the past four weeks.Personally, I don't really care if the company slightly beats or misses this number. What I care about are the company's comments regarding the items listed below.Given that the market has priced in a lot of inflation headwinds since last year, I believe that if the company has positive comments regarding inflation and orders, we could see a stock price rally after earnings.My substantial investment in NOC, making it my second-largest portfolio holding, reflects my confidence in the company's future.NOC's innovative approach to defense, focusing on high-tech capabilities, positions it as a vital player in ensuring NATO safety and security.Their emphasis on innovation, spanning from missile defense to AI and space systems, sets them apart from their competitors.The company's strong financial performance, marked by consistent buybacks and a robust dividend growth strategy, underpins my confidence in its long-term potential.With a positive outlook for growth, especially in crucial sectors like nuclear modernization and space programs, NOC remains a key component of my investment strategy in the defense industry.Despite its current valuation premium, I see NOC as a promising investment with potential for substantial returns in the future.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Billionaire Ray Dalio Says World Order 'Radically Different' Next Year: Our Picks,"The world order is  and this has significant ramifications for how investors should think about allocating their capital, according to recent statements by Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will break down his recent remarks, discuss our perspective on the changingBillionaire hedge fund investor Ray Dalio recently advised investors toAt a minimum, Mr. Dalio was clearly referencing the dramatic changes that emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will have on our world in the coming months and years. Moreover, when taken together with many of his other recent comments and , he was also likely referencing the world's rapidly evolving geopolitical status quo. The geopolitical status quo is going through several tectonic shifts right now, including increased power for the global South and East, a growing rift behind China, Russia, and their allies  such as Iran, North Korea, and a plethora of developing nations  and the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and several other developed countries.Moreover, countries like India and Brazil are growing in geopolitical power and influence as well, particularly through vehicles like BRICs, which are even exploring the potential of launching their own gold-backed currency to serve as competition for the U.S. Dollar. Last, but not least, while the United States remains the leading global superpower by many metrics, it is clearly declining in power and influence relative to China, forcing it to lean ever more heavily on its partners and allies across the world in order to protect and project its interests on those respective regions. The two most glaring instances of that in today's world are the growing roles of Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines in countering growing Chinese influence in East Asia and European partners in resisting Russia's expansionist efforts in Ukraine.What does all of this mean for investors according to Ray DalioMoreover, he stated that he thinks that the biggest mistake many investors make isWe agree with Ray Dalio on each of these major macro observations, though we differ from him on some of the details on how to specifically invest.The world is certainly changing rapidly and the rate of change is only increasing as technology rapidly evolves. This acceleration in economic change is going to be particularly acute moving forward given the growing role of artificial intelligence in developing new technologies, which streamlines and speeds up the process of previously time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks such as looking up information or putting together code to perform core programming functions on new software development. These tasks can now be performed in seconds thanks to the power of new artificial intelligence tools such as Chat-GPT and similar tools that mega-cap tech companies such as Microsoft , Amazon , Apple , Alphabet , and Meta  are investing so aggressively in.Moreover, companies like Tesla  are developing very highly advanced real-world artificial intelligence that could very soon result in fully autonomous driving capability  which - once fully scaled - will unlock untold billions of dollars in hours that were previously wasted on transportation  as well as highly productive humanoid robots that will be able to replace many of the menial, low-wage, low-skill tasks previously done by humans.When you add in the further employee time and corporate expense savings from the growing work-from-home movement and the enterprise-wide productivity enhancements being driven by the data analytics and machine learning platforms of companies like Palantir Technologies , and the deflationary and quality improvement potential awaiting the global economy is immense. The changes bound to flow from these innovations are likely to radically alter our world year after year moving forward.Moreover, this rapid technological change along with the powerful and widening ideological differences among the world's major powers are likely to lead to an increasingly fractured world order in the months and years to come.What these two major factors - rapid technological change leading to major economic upheaval and industry disruptions and the fracturing global order under two competing major blocs led by the United States and China - mandate is that investors diversify against the uncertainties that both bring. Ray Dalio is spot on about the necessity for intelligent diversification and that the past success of a strategy, asset class, or market does not in any way guarantee its future viability as a prudent path to long-term wealth compounding.Where we differ somewhat from Mr. Dalio is the specifics on where to invest. He appears to be very bullish on Asia, including China. Politics and ethical implications aside, investing in Communist China has little appeal to us from a pure financial standpoint because - while valuations certainly look appealing on paper - the country's decades-long  of accounting fraud and the Chinese Communist Party's growing interference in the economy  e.g., its major disruption of Chinese tech giant   make it uninvestable in our view. Moreover, the  of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the massive carnage that would likely follow for the Chinese economy add an additional huge and hard-to-quantify risk for Chinese investments.That said, we do agree with him that diversification is important, including away from markets and securities that have performed exceptionally well in the recent past. As value investors, we try to tune out the noise that comes from recent stock price momentum and instead focus on comparing an investment's intrinsic value to its current market price. This has generally steered us away from an overallocation to technology stocks  or even investing in the S P 500  directly and instead towards higher yielding value stocks that have sold off disproportionately to the rapid rise in interest rates over the past few years. Moreover, we are emphasizing defensively positioned, high-quality businesses within the high-yield value category that are well-positioned to thrive in the face of rapid economic change from technological innovation and a potential recession in the near term. Examples include Enterprise Products Partners  and Brookfield Renewable Partners   energy will always be needed regardless of technological innovation and the contracted nature of these businesses makes them highly recession-resistant .Moreover, given the aforementioned major geopolitical changes going on, being diversified into precious metals like gold  and silver , securities that profit from massive spikes in volatility  such as Virtu Financial , and an opportunistic allocation to - in our view - deeply undervalued Latin American alternative asset manager Patria Investments  are prudent. We like PAX because it has considerable exposure to Brazil and Mexico - which are growing global economic powers and are poised to benefit from the West's ongoing decoupling from China - as well as due to its accrued performance earnings which currently constitute a whopping  20  of its market cap and will likely be distributed as dividends alongside its already hefty dividend yield that comes from strictly fee-based earnings.Mr. Dalio expects the world to change dramatically as soon as next year and predicts that it will continue to change radically year after year following that. We agree that rapid change is coming and that it is very difficult to pick the winners and losers, especially in the technology space. As a result, we think that diversification and an emphasis on value is prudent and - given the substantial and growing geopolitical risks facing the global economy - diversifying with these in mind is particularly prudent.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Enphase Energy Outshines The Competition,"It is a rare event that high quality companies go on sale. Companies with an established track record of continuing to grow earnings can often maintain their lofty valuations, even during broader market sell-offs. As such, when these kinds ofAs a result of an ever-evolving business model, effective operational execution, shareholder-friendly management, a dominant position in a highly concentrated market with robust barriers to entry, and a historically attractive valuation, ENPH s common equity offers a very compelling risk-reward profile.ENPH s main product and major source of revenue is easy to identify  the solar inverter. This is the component in a solar energy system that switches over the DC produced by solarA traditional solar inverter  aka a  string  inverter  has all of the solar panels in the system plugged into it. This is not ideal, because if there is a problem with the inverter then the entire panel system may be unable to produce power. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify issues with individual solar panels. A good way to think about this problem is like putting Christmas tree lights up. If one individual bulb goes out, the entire string of lights will not light up., July 2023ENPH sets itself apart by offering a . The difference here is that a microinverter is mounted on the back of each individual solar panel. While this does add some cost for the solar user, there are several advantages. Microinverters on the back of each panel make it so that the performance of one individual panel does not impact how the other panels perform. If there are issues with individual panels  shading, malfunction, connection, etc. , they are easy to identify. In its early years, ENPH specialized in microinverters and now as a result they are on their 8th installment of their microinverter  IQ8 , capable of converting up to 384W of power per panel.However, ENPH is far from just a solar inverter producer. The second half of 2020 brought a major announcement in business strategy. As CEO Badri Kothandaraman said in his ,  Enphase is rapidly evolving from being the world s leading supplier of microinverters to becoming the world s leading home energy management systems provider.  Since this announcement, ENPH has added new products which complement their solar inverters in the form of storage  IQ Battery series , , and home energy management software and hardware. All of these new product developments have created new revenue streams, cost synergies for installers, and high switching costs as a barrier for competitors.ENPH Investor Presentation, July 2023The most recent pivot in business strategy has come in ENPH s expansion into European markets. The increase in home energy prices in Europe resulting from the Russia invasion of Ukraine has made for very effective timing on management s part. ENPH now sells their microinverters in Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Poland. Additionally, IQ batteries are now being shipped to Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland. While the majority of net revenues still originate domestically  58.723, to 41.27 , based on , the expansion into European markets has been a resounding success. Per the 2023 Q2 Earnings Call, European revenues grew 25  sequentially and almost tripled year-on-year. This has been a very effective strategy, as this growth in revenues has kept earnings afloat during a time when US sales have stagnated.ENPH Q2 2023 SupplementalThe evolution of the business model, product differentiation, and geographic expansion have combined to make ENPH a dominant force in the renewable energy space.Investors should be choosing businesses that operate in less competitive markets. Less competitive markets have a fewer number of businesses operating in them  i.e. fewer competitors , robust barriers to entry, high switching costs, and stable market conditions for the businesses already operating in those markets. This should result in low business turnover and steady market shares. With even mildly effective business execution, these conditions should result in consistent and strong profit generation over several years.All of these characteristics are clearly observable in the solar inverter market in the United States. ENPH and SolarEdge Technologies  operate in one of the best examples of a duopoly that exists. Together, these two businesses take up  for solar inverters in the United States. With significant secular and , the market for solar inverters and other solar energy-related products has a long runway of earnings growth ahead of it.Essentially, both companies produce solar energy solutions and systems. Both company s core product is a solar inverter, where ENPH makes microinverters and SEDG makes string inverters. , the most significant difference between the two companies is the markets they serve. ENPH has more of a residential focus, while SEDG has a greater presence in the commercial market.As was previously mentioned, both ENPH and SEDG are the nearest peer companies for comparison, but that does not mean they operate in identical markets. ENPH has more of a residential focus, while SEDG has more of a commercial focus . In terms of a total addressable market  TAM , it s almost certain that the residential solar market offers more total dollars to be had. With an estimated , the residential solar market simply offers more opportunities to grow earnings than the commercial market. In the coming years, ENPH will be able to capture more of a very concentrated and fast-growing market.While each business is promising in its own right, the objective of this research is to illustrate how ENPH is the more effectively run business. To achieve this objective, a range of financial ratios will be used to compare the two companies. Some of these financial ratios will be rear-facing in the form of trailing twelve months  TTM . However, other more pertinent ratios will require considerations from the most recent earnings reports  i.e. Q2 2023 . The obvious limitation here is that one quarter s results are not necessarily an indicator of a more well-run business. Furthermore, ENPH s third quarter results are due to be released on October 27, while SEDG s will be released on November 6, 2023. As a result, some of these ratios are subject to change.Liquidity is the ability of companies to meet their current liabilities  forms of debt due within one year  with current assets  designed to be used in less than a year . In increasing order of strictness, the typical measures used for liquidity are2. Quick ratio  This is a slightly more strict measurement, as it removes inventory from consideration. This may be useful, as inventory may not always be completely convertible into revenues or cash. Both companies actually mentioned inventory build-ups recently in the Q2 earnings calls. As a result, this might be the most important liquidity ratio on this list.3. Cash ratio   This is the strictest measure of liquidity, in that only cash or marketable securities that can be quickly converted into cash are considered. This less frequently used ratio is typically not available on financial research websites, so it must be derived from the most recent financial statements.It s clear that each of these companies do a great job of managing their short-term finances. ENPH comes out on top as the slightly more liquid business. While generally a more liquid business is an indicator of management effectiveness, it is possible for a business to be too liquid. This would mean that the management team is passing up opportunities to create value for shareholders.An analysis of liquidity is relevant to the investment thesis, as the ENPH management team recently announced what they plan to do with their excess liquidity. One of the most significant pieces of news from ENPH lately was the announcement of a whopping  1 billion share repurchase program. This was announced on July 27, when shares closed at the day at  166.8., Seeking AlphaThe phrase  the value we see in our stock  is key here. Immediately following the Q2 earnings release, shares continued to decline and have traded in a channel between  130 and  115 since mid-August. If management saw value in shares at a price at or greater than  166.80, that value increased even more as the share price has dropped further. If we assume that even half of the  1 billion has been used since the Q2 earnings call at an average price of  150  both are conservative assumptions , then the management team could have made at least 3,333,333 shares outstanding disappear. That would be almost 2.5  of the 136,689,000 of the current shares outstanding. As share repurchases boost EPS by making the denominator of the equation smaller, ENPH shareholders will soon be owning a larger piece of the earnings pie. Hopefully, the upcoming ENPH earnings report for Q3 provides some additional information on how much of the share repurchase program has been used since the Q2 announcement, and at what average price.This is likely, as the Q2 earnings call did contain information on a prior share repurchase program that was previously announced.CFO Mandy Yang, ENPH Q2 Earnings Call 2023, Seeking AlphaWith two share repurchase programs announced and either completed or in process, and multiple insider purchases by both  and  recently, these are about as bullish signals as an investor could get that a management team thinks their common equity is undervalued.Equity investors should not just be choosing businesses who are in sound financial health. Highly profitable businesses who have the capacity to continue to grow earnings should be prioritized.ENPH has a clear competitive advantage when it comes to profit marginsCompare these to SEDG s profitability marginsOne of the best indicators of how well a business model is functioning is the asset turnover ratio. It measures how well a company s assets generate revenue. A higher value indicates a business that is more efficient at generating sales from the assets of the business. Per Seeking Alpha,Return on Capital  Both companies operate in a capital-intensive industry, where research and development and effective product development are crucial. As a result, Return on Invested Capital  ROIC  might be the most important financial ratio on this list. This ratio measures how effectively the management team is allocating the capital generated from the issuance of equity and debt. A higher value for ROIC indicates that the management team is more effective at taking financial capital and allocating towards profit-generating business activities.In a less competitive market that essentially functions as a duopoly, a higher ROIC signals that one business has a competitive advantage over the other. At , SEDG has an impressive ROIC in its own right. However, ENPH s cash flow generated from investments in the business dwarfs SEDG .A substantially higher ROIC value for ENPH is not only important when considering the capital-intensive nature of this industry, but perhaps more importantly it is a strong predictor of future earnings growth.Cash Flow Accrual Ratio  While it is important to measure the total quantity of earnings to judge past performance, the earnings quality of a company needs to be considered as another method for evaluating the potential for future earnings growth. A ratio that is useful for judging earnings quality is the cash flow accrual ratio, calculated by  net income - free cash flow    average operating assets. This ratio is an effective measure of earnings quality, as it assesses the extent to which free cash flows contribute to the profits of the company. With most financial ratios related to profitability, the way to interpret the values generated by the ratio is  the higher the better  rule of thumb. However, as the accrual ratio subtracts free cash flow  which investors want a lot of  from net income, it s actually preferable to see a low accrual ratio. In fact, a negative accrual ratio is a strong indicator of very quality earnings, as that must mean free cash flows are greater than net income. The cash flow accrual ratio is usually not made available on most financial research websites, and must be derived from the financial statements of companies.Operating assets are those assets which are useful in the core business of the company  i.e. making solar energy products . Operating assets include items such as property, plant, and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and various intangible assets. Here s how the math works out for each companyENPH  Q2 2023 financial results  For this reporting period, ENPH had  157.19 million in net income, and  225.2 million in free cash flow. Using the above framework, ENPH had  1,356.5 million in operating assets. Therefore, ENPH s accrual ratio    157.19 - 225.2    1,356.5   -.05.SEDG  For this reporting period, SEDG had  15.1 million in net income. The cash flow accrual ratio requires the analyst to subtract free cash flow. However, SEDG actually had negative cash flow of  170,304,000 during Q2 of 2023. This renders the calculation a bit of a moot point here, as the intent of the accrual ratio is to determine how well free cash flow contributes to net income.SEDG Q2 2023 Earnings SupplementalNegative operating cash flows are a potential sign of a threat to the business model, and should be interpreted by investors as something to avoid in a new acquisition. With a negative cash flow accrual rate, ENPH has the massive advantage here in the quality of their earnings.These ratios clearly indicate that ENPH is the higher margin business, with earnings compounding more quickly, and a more efficient asset structure. All of these attributes become more significant when a company effectively has only one other competitor.At the time of this writing, ENPH s shares trade at  101.59. The last time ENPH shares hit these prices was October of 2020. . Currently, EPS is  3.98. Safe to say, ENPH has grown rapidly since the last time its shares were this at this price.ENPH currently trades at 28.56x earnings. , the 5Y historical average P E for ENPH stands at a sky-high 114.57. During the time that ENPH has been a GAAP profitable business, the only other time that ENPH s shares have had a lower P E ratio was during the March 2020 pandemic crash. The P E bottomed out at just under 19x earnings before increasing by over 12 times this amount in 2021.The obvious limitation of the P E measurement is that it is not forward-looking, as it does not consider the future earnings growth of the company. Forecasted EPS growth for ENPH is robust at  over the next five years. For this reason, the PEG ratio is the more effective measurement here. The PEG ratio is calculated by TTM PE   diluted YoY EPS growth. While valuations by PEG vary by sector and even industry, the smaller the number indicates cheaper earnings and stronger growth potential. A value of less than 1 is used as a benchmark for identifying growth at a reasonable price. Per Seeking Alpha, ENPH s PEG currently stands at a paltry .17.Readers may note that an intrinsic valuation has not yet been attempted for ENPH. Relative valuations based on share price multiples can be useful for identifying attractive entry points or for comparing competitors, but the best attempts at valuation contain both a multiple valuation and an intrinsic value calculation. I hope to overcome the limitation of this analysis in a future article.Despite ticking all of the boxes for  growth at a reasonable price , ENPH s common equity shares do come with notable risks. The most current risk to the business is the elevated borrowing costs, which were mentioned in the Q2 earnings call. CEO Badri Kothandaraman reportedENPH Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Seeking AlphaAs ENPH offers residential solar systems where the total price is often high enough for most customers to require loan financing, ENPH s products have effectively experienced an increase in price as . With the recent messaging from The Federal Reserve Board of Governors being  higher for longer , it s reasonable to expect that the above problem will likely persist through 2023.ENPH has also experienced . These have been followed by further share price declines, and could continue .Even though there are significant barriers to entry to the solar energy solutions market, that does not mean that these barriers are impenetrable. Both ENPH and SEDG have been earning impressive profits, and the duopoly is unlikely to last. Notably, Tesla  has entered the residential solar energy market in recent years.Finally, ENPH s beta now stands at 1.51. With a share price that is 1.5x the volatility of the S P 500, ENPH s common equity has lost approximately 65  of its value from the all-time high in late November of 2022. Between geopolitical risks and the possibility of further interest rate hikes, a decrease in the S P 500 would very likely coincide with a proportionately larger decrease in ENPH s short-term share price. Potential new ENPH investors should have a long holding period, and be psychologically prepared for violent sell-offs. With Q3 on the horizon, potential investors seeking an entry point may want to wait until the results of the Q3 earnings call, which will undoubtedly contain significant new information.Yet, none of the above risks are any indication of a threat to the underlying business model. A temporary decline in earnings may be in process already, but investors who buy and hold for the long-term will be purchasing a fast-growing company at a very reasonable price.ENPH shows excellent operational performance on some of the most important financial ratios, has a sizable share repurchase program underway, and possesses the dominant market position in a duopoly. At historically low valuations, ENPH s shares offer substantial upside with minimal risk to the business.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

SP500: Five Days Later - I'm Short Again (Technical Analysis),"Just last week, I  the on S P 500  and went tactically neutral. Specifically, I closed the naked short call position on S P 500 futures My strategy at the time was to evaluate the potential for the end-of-the-year rally, or to re-short the key breakdown below the 4200 level. But this is what happened over the last 5 days - the S P 500 spiked by about 200 points. Here is a 1-month chart.On a 5-year chart, the S P 500 touched the key support at the 200dma level, and bounced strongly to the 100dma resistance  red line . More importantly, the 50dma  green line  is at the same level, and crossing the 100dma - this isSo, I covered the short position at the 200dma support since I did not anticipate an imminent breakdown. In my playbook, the trigger for the 200dma breakdown would have to be something major, such as an imminent recession. Given the strong labor market, I do not see an imminent recession yet.Recently, the Fed officials have been talking dovishly, suggesting that the Fed could be done with increasing the interest rates - and the Federal Funds futures have priced the Fed pause accordingly. The fact that the U.S. economy is still growing strongly, and that the Fed seems to want to pause the interest rate hikes, increases the probability of the end-of-the year rally.Thus, tactically, it seemed appropriate to cover the short position, especially the out of money naked call option.So, the bounce happened, quickly just like the  bear market  rallies are - quick and sharp. And the bounce stopped at the key resistance. Thus, rather than waiting for the 200dma breakdown, I re-shorted at the resistance. Again, my choice was to short the Dec call option, 4400 expiration, which actually was the  in the money option  at the time of the transaction.Essentially, this call option doubled from around 50 to around 100 over the last 5 days. Thus, when priced at 100, the option has the breakeven point at SPX 4500. So, my new bet is that S P500 will close below the 4400 level for full profit, while at the 4500 level, the trade is breakeven.This is not a bet that the S P500 will crash, it's more of a bet that it will not go much higher from these levels. This is appropriate for now, until S P 500 revisits the 200dma resistance and the 4200 level, at which point the probability of crash increases - if the support is broken accompanied by a fundamental trigger.First of all, what caused the selloff in the S P 500  from late July  The July selloff was triggered by the decision by the BOJ to allow JGB yields to increase to 1  - the tweak in BOJ monetary policy. This triggered the trend of higher 10Y yields due to the fears that Japanese investors would start selling US Treasuries .Since then, there were several events that contributed to the rising U.S. long-term interest rates. Most importantly, the US Treasury increased the size of bond offering due to the rising U.S. fiscal deficit - and the auctions were weak, which supported the theme that the foreign demand for US Treasuries is waning. Thus, the higher supply of Treasuries has been met with a lower demand - and that's been causing the increase in the real yields.The increase in real yields is not good for the overvalued stock market, and thus as the 10Y yields continued to rise, the stock market continued to fall, mainly due to P E valuation contraction.So, what caused the bounceAfter the blowout labor market report last Friday, the bond market initially sold off, which is a normal reaction - a tight labor market might require  higher for longer  interest rates to bring inflation down to 2 .However, the bond market is notoriously famous to reverse on the labor-report-Friday, so it reversed last Friday, possibly as some traders took profit on the short bond positions.But then over the weekend, a horrible attack on Israel happened, which caused some flight to safety to Treasury Bonds, and the 10Y Treasury Bond futures continued rising  lower interest rates .Here is the chart of Dec 10Y Treasury Bond futuresFurther, the bounce in bond prices  lower interest rate  caused a weaker USD , here is the chart of the Euro futuresThe two major headwinds for the falling stock market since late July have been  1  higher yields  and 2  a stronger dollar. Both of these reversed after the attack on Israel due to the fight to safety to US Treasuries. Thus, the stock market bounced strongly.The failure to breach the resistance at 100dma on 10 12 was due to  1  a hotter CPI report  and 2  a weak 30 Treasury Bond auction. The yields increased, the USD strengthened, and the S P 500 sold off.We are in an inflationary environment due to the labor shortage and deglobalization. Plus, the process of deglobalization appears to be turning violent with severe geopolitical escalations. In this environment, the supply of Treasuries, which is only going to increase, will continue to meet lower demand, and thus interest rates will continue to rise, until a very serious recession. In addition, inflation will continue to be well above the 2  level, and the Fed will find out it will be very hard to pause the interest rate hiking cycle. This is a bearish environment for stocks.Over the near term, I expect the  round-trip  back to the 4200 level due to the higher yields, and a stronger USD - it's still the same theme. Once we're at the 4200 level, we need to monitor what could cause the breakdown - which is the next phase of the bear market. Or we bounce again   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Buy Alert: Why I Just Massively Increased My Gold Position,"While I focus mostly on high yield investments like MLPs , REITs , BDCs , renewable energy Yield Cos, alternative asset managers, and utilities , I have recently been massively increasingMoreover, even if China does not invade Taiwan for many years to come, if ever, we still believe the outlook for gold is quite bullish. In this article, we will discuss these reasons.Hayman Capital Management founder and CIO Kyle Bass - who is also a China expert - recently that Communist China is likely to invade Taiwan by the end of 2024. He believes that the markets have not even closely priced in this risk because they believe that the economic cost of such an attack is sufficient to deter CCP leader Xi Jinping from launching such an attack. However, such calculus assumes that Xi is a rational actor that is motivated by economic factors. In reality, the CCP has shown repeatedly that it is far more concerned with maximizing its domestic and international power than in maximizing its GDP.As Bass pointed outUnfortunately, however, unlike Putin's war in Ukraine, if Xi were to invade Taiwan, it would have devastating consequences for the global economy and could very possibly bring on world war 3.Why is China increasingly likely to invade Taiwan sooner rather than later  There are four main reasonsSo, why is gold a good hedge against a Chinese invasion of TaiwanFirst and foremost, gold would almost certainly outperform the broader stock market  in such a scenario, especially if the United States and Japan joined the fight in some capacity. I view the U.S. and Japan joining the fight as being very likely given that the CCP would likely want to launch a pre-emptive, devastating attack against U.S. naval and air forces in the region stationed in Japan and Guam in order to delay the U.S.'s ability to intervene militarily on behalf of Taiwan and potentially inflict such heavy and sudden losses that the American public may shirk back from entering an all-out war with China. If China struck U.S. forces on Japanese soil, the Japanese would inevitably suffer some collateral damage and would be very motivated to join the war alongside their American allies.The reason that this scenario playing out would hurt the stock market so much is that the U.S., China, and Japan are the world's three largest economies by GDP and are also the world's three largest economies by amount of global trade they participate in. On top of that, Taiwan is the world's main production center of semiconductor chips. Last, but not least, some of the largest companies in the world are headquartered in the United States and are heavily reliant on China and Taiwan for producing and selling their products. Tesla  and Apple  come immediately to mind as examples. These businesses, and thousands more like them in China, Japan, the United States, and around the world would immediately suffer massive impairments in the event of a war over Taiwan. In fact, some  put the immediate destruction to the global economy at  2.6 trillion, with the Rand Corporation predicting a global depression and a decline in U.S. GDP of at least 5   which is twice the decline experienced during the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis .Moreover, confidence in the U.S. Dollar could take a major hit, especially if its military suffers major losses. This is because - even if it prevails eventually over the Chinese military  which is far from guaranteed  in the conflict - its ability to project power around the world and secure international trade will likely be significantly impaired from the heavy losses it will inevitably incur in such a war.Meanwhile, gold - a proven safe haven during periods of economic distress and geopolitical uncertainty - would likely catch a very strong bid during such a crisis. Moreover, central bankers would likely be forced to slash interest rates in an attempt to calm markets and prop up faltering economies  not to mention reduce the financing cost of financing such a huge war . Immense money printing would also likely take place as part of paying for the war effort against the CCP. All of these factors point decisively to an extremely bullish scenario for the price of gold.Even if saner heads prevail and Xi is dissuaded from invading Taiwan, gold still enjoys a fairly bullish setup becauseIt is not often that I make major asset allocation decisions based on a macroeconomic and or geopolitical prediction. However, in the case of gold, it appears to have an extremely attractive risk-reward profile at the moment given the growing likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as well as the other seemingly irreversible macro trends of runaway deficit spending in the U.S., negative real interest rates over the long-term, and the rising popularity of gold as an alternative to the U.S. Dollar as a global reserve currency.As a result, I am significantly increasing my allocation to gold right now.
