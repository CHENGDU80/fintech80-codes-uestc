Exxon Mobil: Is It A Good Dividend Stock?,"Is Exxon Mobil  a good dividend stock  The oil major made big news last week when it agreed to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources  in an  valued at  59.5B. This isPerhaps due to the XTO overhang, the market didn't seem to appreciate the PXD announcementMoreover, many retail investors look atIf you have been exposed to academic finance, you may recall the Miller and Modigliani  that without taxes, transaction costs or asymmetric information about management's intentions the dividend policy should be irrelevant for stock performance and valuations. The only thing that should really matter is the quality of the company's future investment opportunities. For example, one of the highest performers over the last few years has been Tesla  Elon Musk's company isn't known for paying dividends but the market  rightly or wrongly  puts a very high value on its investment opportunities.The Miller and Modigliani  are of course oversimplified. Investors pay taxes and transaction costs  a regular dividend may also reduce the asymmetry of information by constraining management's ability to invest in negative present value projects. Last but not least, many individual and institutional investors simply need current income. You could theoretically generate income from a non-dividend paying stock by selling shares at regular intervals but that as noted carries its own costs.In practice, companies that pay greater dividends tend to be more mature businesses with limited reinvestment opportunities. Dividend paying companies also typically come from less cyclical industries such as consumer staples  or utilities . You could probably say that a fixed dividend is a signal of management's confidence in the stability of the business. Buybacks and variable dividends also return capital to the shareholders but management isn't obliged to maintain them in bad years.Importantly, a very high dividend - or a dividend that can only be supported at the expense of increasing leverage - doesn't by itself make for a good dividend stock. If anything, leverage supported dividends may indicate the underlying business is more cyclical than what management wants to project. The dividend may also be at risk of being cut, i.e., the stock may be a  dividend trap.At the end of the day, oil   gas is a cyclical industry and producers can't control the price of their output. For this reason, large U.S. independents like Marathon Oil , APA Corporation  and Occidental  have prioritized buybacks while others focus on special or variable dividends.Exxon and other majors like Chevron  have more generous fixed dividends because their sheer size and integration across the oil and gas value chain provide for greater diversification that dampens cyclicalityThat said, integrated energy may be safer than standalone upstream plays, but it's still riskier than defensive sectors like consumer staples.It depends on your time horizon. Exxon has steadily grown its dividend for now 40 years  this is on par with a defensive stock such as Procter   Gamble However, a nice  dividend growth series doesn't mean the dividend was safe all along the wayOver the last 10 years the payout ratio has varied from -250  to  250 . The financial leverage also tends to yo-yo a bitUnsurprisingly, the dividend coverage and leverage are inversely related to the stock price drawdowns which have exceeded 25Should you care about drawdowns if you're a buy-and-hold investor though  I would say yes. Even if you never sell any stocks, you still have to decide when to buy more and most people make repeated contributions to their portfolio over time rather than invest a lump sum once and forever. To illustrate this point, I ran a backtest that assumes you started with  1,000 in January 2001 and invested another  1,000 each month thereafter, all the way through September 2023. I compared Exxon to PG, as a typical consumer staples company, and to Devon , as a more risky, upstream player. I assumed all dividends were reinvestedUltimately, XOM and PG got you to a similar place but arguably PG did so with fewer sleepless nights. A XOM-only portfolio was more stable than Devon but still lacking compared to a pure defensive stock.Here are also the XOM drawdowns underwater periodsIn 20 or so years, there were 3 drawdowns of 25  or greater with underwater periods of 2, 3 and almost 8 years  In contrast, PG had only one drawdown of 25  or more that continued for three and half years.So does this mean XOM is bad dividend stock  No. However, it shows that it should be managed actively.To some extent yes. The  dividend discount model  or DDM is one of the basic valuation tools that can be applied to a dividend paying company. Exxon grew its dividend from  0.23 per quarter to  0.91 over the last 22 years. This implies a CAGR  compound annual growth rate  of about 6.5 . Assuming 10  cost of equity, XOM may be close to its intrinsic value  however, note the sensitivity to minor changes in the growth assumptionWe have been trading in a  100- 120 range for over a year now, so the DDM approach isn't very useful.A simpler approach is to look directly at the dividend yieldHistorically, for Exxon it has averaged about 3 . At the  110 or so stock price now, XOM yields 3.31 . For the yield to converge to its historical average, the stock price would need to appreciate to  120. The caveat is that a 3  yield in a 5  risk-free rate environment isn't the same as a 3  yield when the risk-free rate is close to 0 .The problem with the DDM is that Exxon is a capital intensive business. A dividend paying consumer staples or utility company can focus on maintenance capex with predictable returns. This is why we can base our valuation considerations on the dividend. Exxon certainly has maintenance capex too but oil fields get depleted and new ones need to be discovered and developed. The success of Exxon's business is more sensitive to its capital allocation decisions, whether they are poor, as XTO, or good, as many consider Guyana to have been.Exxon's ROCE  return on capital employed  may therefore be more informative as I have discussed in a different Prior to 2008, Exxon achieved higher ROCE compared to the 2009-2021 period when adjusting for the oil price. It looks that 2022-2023 may have broken away from the  lean  period and are more consistent with the profitable years before 2008. This is why I am bullish long-term on the stock.Tactically, XOM's stock is a bit in no man's land right now. We've been stuck in a  100- 120 range for over a year. I would be more comfortable recommending a buy if we were closer to  100 or moving back up after hitting  100Secondly, in the last few days we have seen another geopolitical conflict unfold, this time in the Middle East and oil went up on the risk premium. However, most geopolitical events start with a spike in oil prices early in the crisis  e.g., 1991 Gulf War, Russia-Ukraine last year  after which the impact fades. Barring an escalation involving more actors that may bring us to WW3  XOM stock won't be my primary concern if that happens , I would expect oil to give up some gains. This may affect XOM's stock price too although it may also not given equities have not fully participated in the latest oil rally.In summary, I do think  140 is possible but I don't have a view if we are going to see  100 or  120 first. Personally, I am long XOM but trimmed 25  of my position at  120 when we failed to break above that level for the third time in a row this year.Wall Street's average target is  132, which makes sense, but note the dispersion around the averageThe  274 by the way seems to be a data feed error. It is the target an analyst  to Pioneer based on a XOM target of  118 and the exchange ratio agreed in the all-stock deal. Nevertheless, the range of forecasts is indeed broad.The short answer is no. The XTO deal didn't derail the upward trajectory in Exxon's dividend and I don't expect the PXD one to do so either. If you seriously consider opening an Exxon position, I encourage you to check out the entire acquisition , but here I will focus on just one slide that shows some of the strategic rationale for the dealWhile Pioneer is known to be one of the U.S. independents with longest shale inventory runway  perhaps 15-20 years , the deal isn't just about the upstream aspect. Pioneer will also be integrated into Exxon's downstream infrastructure which should reduce further the volatility of the combined company's cash flows. So, if something does change, I think it will be greater diversification cash flow stability which is helpful from a dividend perspective - to the extent of course things can ever be  stable  in energy.XOM has been a reliable dividend player but that doesn't mean the dividend was always safe. Investors need to differentiate between ex ante and realized risk. Just because we lucked out doesn't mean things couldn't have gone badly. Currently, XOM's business is improving structurally  higher returns on capital, adjusted for the oil price  so that bodes well for the dividend too.However, while Exxon is much safer as an investment than a pure upstream oil and gas player, it isn't a buy and forget stock. Despite the diversification that comes with the integrated model, energy remains a volatile sector. Even if you never sell stocks, deciding when to buy XOM will be more consequential for your long-term returns compared to the impact of the entry point on an investment in a traditional defensive stock.

BHP: Why Metals And Mining May Be The Best Hedge For Your Oil Stocks,"How does BHP Group Limited , one of the largest diversified mining companies globally, fit into an energy investment thesisDespite the exceptional 2021-2022 run-up, energy continues to offer some of the best value opportunities - particularly among stocks withThat, in a nutshell, is my energy thesis which is probably shared by many others too. However, I constantly reevaluate this reasoning and ask myself what else needs to hold true for my energy investments not to work out. The answer I inevitably come back to is that we would need to see a massive acceleration in the electrification trend that would at least displace the transportation component of oil demand. Perhaps emerging economies like India  INDA  manage to bypass the wider adoption of ICE vehicles and directly go to EVs - or maybe the decarbonization in developed countries happens quicker due to technological breakthroughs.I personally remain skeptical the energy transition will be completed by 2050 because the entire decarbonization project appears to be more based on ideology and political incentives than on sound economic planning that takes into account the physical realities. For example, cloudy countries in Northwest Europe keep installing solar panels  this makes little sense from ROI perspective but perhaps helps electioneering politicians score more points with an  environmentally conscious  voter base. In either case, for my energy thesis to be wrong and decarbonization to succeed on the 2050 timeframe, the world would require massive amounts of critical metals and minerals and even net-zero proponents as the IEA acknowledge this. This naturally points to the mining industry as a  hedge  if oil gets phased out faster - and within mining, BHP is one of major players with exposure to several critical resources.BHP's mining portfolio has shifted over the years, but, after the  to Woodside , currently the group focuses on the If the world wants to cut down on fossil fuels quicker, it has to consume a lot more of BHP's products, at least in the next few decades, to build out the new infrastructure that would support a low-carbon economy. Mining itself is very energy intensive, so to some extent producing the metals and minerals necessary for decarbonization will require even more fossil fuels, but let's assume that's only a short-term effect and in the long-run net fossil fuel use will still drop.BHP is certainly not the only miner out there, but I think the company has several advantages that make it stand outBHP's year-to-date return is a negative -7.2 , but let's be clear - the only reason for this year's underperformance are fears over China's economy. Yet, the government in China is already focusing on stimulative measures and there are signs that investors' China sentiment may have bottomed. The markets are also forward looking, so commodity futures and BHP's stock will reprice way before the economic indicator data starts improving. As much as China remains the main risk, the inevitable turnaround in the China narrative may also be the catalyst that takes BHP higher.The short answer is that the world will need a lot more of everything. The Tesla  in your garage only substitutes one type of non-renewable resource for a different one. Running away from oil and gas means crowding into the mining sector, and we know what happens when much higher demand meets finite supply. To the IEA's credit, their , entitled  Mineral requirements for clean energy transitions , tried to quantify these exact megatrends.The IEA distinguishes between a  stated policies  scenario  STEPS , associated with a slower energy transition, and a  sustainable development  scenario  or SDS , which implies even faster decarbonization. The chart below shows the projected 2040 growth factor from 2020 demand levels, by resource typeCopper demand, of relevance to BHP, is expected to grow by a factor of 2x to 3x, depending on how quickly the energy transition moves  In 2020 the world  23.5 million metric tons  or MT  of copper so this is no small deal.The IEA explainsOn the production side, the IEA warns of the forthcoming challenges  my highlightsBeyond the electric grid, solar power capacity will also be a demand driver per the IEAMaybe not as bullish for silver and silicon but copper is again the common denominator.Wind power, in turn, will drive both copper and steel  iron ore  demand. I recently  the woes of wind giant Ørsted which is exposed to the rising cost of materials. And wind infrastructure requires a lot of materialGoing back to the IEA's projectionsMetallurgical coal itself isn't a direct input for electrification but indirectly steel production  blast furnace  still requires its use.Finally, nickel, another of BHP's inputs is also a  for the energy transitionIn sum, the energy transition guarantees the demand for BHP's outputs. Let's examine next the supply side.During its 30 June 2023 financial year, BHP produced the following quantitiesTo put these numbers into contextIn addition, per BHPFor the June '23 year revenue and EBITDA were weighted towards iron oreHowever, this can change quickly with the price of the underlying commodities. Compared to Rio Tinto  and Vale  which are even more heavily weighted towards iron ore, BHP is much better diversified.While copper was only 30  of BHP's revenue, BHP as noted is one of the largest producers globally and has a 57.5  stake in the largest copper mine globally. These assets may prove quite valuable in a few years as  behind what is required for the energy transition. For example, copper producer Hudbay Minerals Inc.  sees demand outpacing supply as early as 2025 The supply concerns are shared by S P which sees  despite high profits in the industry The causes, according to S P, include permitting and financing difficulties among othersEnergy transition advocates need to understand these realities. Moreover, just as with oil exploration, capital underinvestment can't be undone quickly  S P's research emphasizes the long lead times  average of 23 years  that it has taken historically to move from discovery to productionThe work on the Quellaveco mine, owned by Anglo American  started in the 1960s  By the way, this is another reason to focus on a mature company like BHP and avoid junior miners who may be years away from attaining production.The costs of incremental supply have also been trending up  the  curve gets quite steep as you approach the 20 MT rangeNote that to BHP's advantage, Escondida is one of the lowest cost assets out there.Finally, I wanted to mention a chart from the well-known  which suggests that inventories are also at multi-year lowsG R bring in the ESG dimension as another limiting factor for the industryTherein lies one of the ESG paradoxes too  even though de-carbonization is the number one ESG priority, the ESG hurdles sabotage the energy transition by cutting access to the metals and minerals that are needed to make it happen. However, just as in the fossil fuel world, this will hand the advantage to the owners of already developed assets.BHP produces iron ore and metallurgical coal, but the ultimate driver for both is steel. According to the Steel producer ArcelorMittal  is In particular, steel inventories are lowJust as with copper, much of the future steel demand will come from the According to CleanTechnica  citing also an ArcelorMittal studyThis assessment is  by ArgusThe Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. is also expected to be big  for steelNickel is of smaller significance to BHP, but it's worth noting it's also one of the key enablers for the energy transition. The IEA study already discussed here expects 60-70  of nickel demand by 2040 to be driven by  clean energy.According to the companyGiven even in the midst of the Covid pandemic copper held above  2 lb, BHP's primary assets look well positioned.Copper is in contango, due to near-term demand weakness, but the prices remain quite high historically and are way above BHP's breakeven costAccording to BHPThe main concern over iron ore currently is ChinaEven today with all the China negativity, iron prices remain above BHP's breakevensInterestingly, JPMorgan  r based on improved iron ore outlook in 2024Narrative can drive the price, but the price itself is also a signal and it may suggest the worst for China is overIron ore prices have indeed come down a lot from 2021 but technically still look to be a in a multi-year bull market since 2016While short-term metallurgical coal is facing some headwinds, BHP is optimistic for the medium and long-termIt is the familiar theme - the demand will stay high but regulatory issues are hindering investment. The major uncertainty in the short-term is, of course, China. Ironically, in the long run the energy transition may again drive a preference for the specific grade of coal mined by BHP.Australian coking coal is down from the 2022 peak but is doing pretty well compared to the pre-pandemic yearsWhile Nickel is less important to BHP as a revenue driver, BHP's nickel production is quite important for the energy transition. According to the companyThe challenges appear limited to the near-termNickel prices are down from the recent highs but still well above the 2016-2020 lowsBHP is relatively undervalued compared to the broader sector, at least focusing on enterprise value multiplesThe 5.8x EBITDA multiple is consistent with how the market has valued the company over the recent yearsTo be clear, I don't necessarily expect the multiple to re-rate higher but rather see the gains coming from higher EBITDA in the future as energy transition demand drives up the prices for BHP's outputs.Conveniently, BHP provides in its filings a sensitivity table that shows how EBITDA would change with changes in the prices of the underlying commoditiesStarting off the forward EBITDA estimate of about  27 billion, I show the implications for the stock if copper prices and iron increase back to their recent highs  copper above  5 lb and iron ore about  150 tThe upside can be quite significant and I think BHP has good prospects of trading around  80  mid-point between the copper and iron ore scenarios  by the end of next year. This is about 40  upside and is more than what Wall Street projectsI am of course expecting that the underlying commodities will trade higher in a year compared to the futures curve.The main near-term risk ahead of copper and iron ore is ChinaThe situation in China is obviously not good and the financial media coverage is as bad as it could be. However, at some point  I think sooner rather than later , the government in China will step up the stimulus measures and the economy will rebound. They simply don't have another choice, especially with the complicating geopolitics.On the flipside, commodities seem to be waiting for the slightest signal from Beijing to rally. As reported by Seeking Alpha a In my view, it is only a matter of time before we see further accommodative measures and copper and iron ore will react quickly.Long-term the bigger risk is that governments in the West realize that the energy transition project is too expensive and backtrack on their de-carbonization pledges. However, as I am recommending BHP as a  hedge  within an energy-oriented portfolio, I am not really concerned about this possibility.Lastly, I want to highlight BHP's governance and dividend policy. Mark Twain infamously defined a mine as  a hole in the ground with a liar on top  and it is indeed of utmost importance that management's incentives are aligned to the shareholders. BHP has  corporate institutions to ensure transparency and the company is quite exemplary in terms of its public reporting, including voluntary reports that aren't mandated by regulators. As one of the largest companies in Australia that also maintains listings in the UK, US  through ADRs  and South Africa, BHP is watched by many pairs of eyes. This is likely true of other large mining groups too, so the distinction I really want to make is from junior miners who are more likely to have higher governance risks.BHP also has a robust dividend policy that mandates a minimum of 50  of net profit has to be paid as dividendsSeeking Alpha reports the forward dividend yield as 5.62  which compares well to the peer sectorFor BHP's 30 June 2022 year the yield was higher due to the special dividend which distributed the proceeds from the sale of the oil business. However, the regular yield of 5-6  is not bad either. It is consistent with what you can earn on T-Bills so even if BHP's stock doesn't take off, you are at least covering your opportunity cost.While my portfolio emphasizes energy stocks  oil and gas , there is always the possibility that de-carbonization limits oil demand earlier than what energy bulls expect. However, for that to happen, there must be a massive call on the metals and mining sector to supply the resources needed for the energy transition. BHP, as one of the largest diversified miners with low-cost resources, offers a good  hedge  for the energy thesis. Moreover, even if you don't buy into the energy thesis, BHP could be a good inflation hedge and also pays a dividend that covers the time value of money.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Out-Of-Favor Enbridge Shares Are A Buy (Rating Upgrade),"  shares have finally fallen out of favor of late, along with the entire Canadian midstream cohort. They have steadily sold off throughout theInvestors previously granted ENB a halo due to its quasi-monopoly position in Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin egress via its Mainline system. However, the reality is that the regulated price-setting mechanism eliminates any sustainably high return on capital earned from its dominant market position. In fact, in recent years, ENB s average return on capital has only slightly exceeded its cost of debt.ENB s persistentlyENB is the largest midstream operator in North America. Its operations are focused primarily on liquids and until recently the company has focused its expansion on its U.S. Gulf Coast facilities. These investments likely offer more attractive returns on capital than ENB's Canadian investments, so we viewed them as a smart use of capital.More recently, however, new management under Greg Ebel has changed course. On September 5, ENB  its deal to acquire three utility assets from Dominion Energy . The company's move away from liquid midstream operations initially caught observers by surprise, but the market s reception turned more positive as analysts digested the deal. Despite the overwhelming support for the deal, however, ENB s stock continued to fall after the announcement.We like the deal. For one, it provides relatively attractive returns on capital, which ENB will need as it confronts a higher interest rate environment. The market values the acquired assets  cash flows at a slightly higher multiple than ENB s historical valuation. The company can therefore deploy large sums of capital at attractive returns relative to its legacy assets, and its investments are likely to be well-received by the market. U.S. utility assets will allow ENB to deploy large sums of capital, which will help it move the needle with regard to long-term EBITDA growth. While the deal has yet to close, we believe the Dominion assets are a net positive addition to ENB s existing system.Even though sentiment toward Canadian midstream is in the dumps, company fundamentals have been stable and in some cases have improved over the past few quarters. ENB offers a case in point.First off, its cash flow has been stable. What the company has sacrificed in terms of its return on capital, it has gained in terms of cash flow stability, as demonstrated by its operating cash flow below.ENB s cash flows will also remain largely insulated from the impact of inflation. ENB investors can rest assured that operating cash flow will remain supported in nearly any macro oil market or economic scenario.ENB s stable cash flow can support a large debt level, which has caused debt to grow at a rapid clip. For the most part, EBITDA growth went hand-in-hand with growing debt balances, but by 2021, ENB s leverage ratio increased significantly above 5-times, verging on an uncomfortably high level.However, ENB s leverage situation is changing for the better. By far, the most significant recent development for its shareholders over recent quarters has been the company s inflection from net consumer of cash flow to generating a cash flow surplus. This means it has internally funded its expenses, growth capex, and dividends without the need to raise debt. The following table shows ENB s cash flows since 2020 and how they ve improved in 2023.The chart below shows the company s cash flow deficit inflecting to a surplus in the first and second quarters.If continued, this cash flow inflection should be a game changer for ENB shareholders. Companies like ENB, which generate low returns on capital, cannot continue to spend forever on new growth projects and fund those projects with long-term debt, particularly when the cost of debt is rising as it is today. Instead, they should pare back their growth capex which in recent years has run at ludicrously high levels for ENB and use excess cash flow to pay down debt. Without a growing debt balance, new projects set to come online over the coming quarters and years can increase Adjusted EBITDA and lower the leverage ratio to comfortable levels for shareholders.ENB s cash flow surplus demonstrates management s commitment to reining in leverage. The chart below shows the recent progress in doing so and illustrates how swiftly leverage metrics can improve for a prodigious generator of cash flow like ENB.Management targets a leverage ratio of 4.5 to 5.0-times, so ENB is back in the clear with regard to leverage. What's clear is that ENB s current leverage ratio should not have caused its stock s recent selloff. Given how management plans to finance the Dominion asset acquisition, we don t expect the deal to significantly add to ENB s leverage.The other positive development for ENB shareholders has been the new management s tack toward returning excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. If the company is in fact inflecting to a sustainable cash flow surplus, shareholders will want to be sure that uninvested excess cash is delivered back to them in an intelligent manner. At the moment, with ENB shares being valued at multi-year lows amid stable or improving fundamentals, share repurchases offer a particularly attractive alternative.In the first half of 2023, ENB spent its excess cash on asset acquisitions, but the Dominion utility acquisition will likely be the last one for some time. ENB also spent on share repurchases, which is more constructive for shareholders. At the very least, it shows the new management s intent to allocate capital intelligently for shareholders.We also expect ENB s excess cash flow to be delivered to shareholders through increased dividends, continuing ENB s impressive long-term track record, as shown below.Our ENB valuation implies little downside risk and significant total return upside from the current price of  44.50. With regard to appreciation potential, the shares possess 21.3  upside to our price target of  54.00.Our EV EBITDA valuation implies that the shares offer 11.6  total return upside through next year, which increases to 56.9  by 2027.Dividends comprise a large portion of the total return, and we believe ENB s safe and large 8.1  yield is particularly attractive.Our valuation doesn t account for the Dominion asset acquisition. We expect the transaction to add to ENB s intrinsic value over time. As such, we believe our valuation excluding the assets is more conservative.Our valuation is also conservative due to its 10.5-times EV EBITDA multiple. ENB has traded at a multiple closer to 11.5 in recent years, so a reversion to a higher trading multiple would result in additional upside for the shares.It s taken a while for us to come around to Enbridge Inc. shares, but the recent selloff has done the trick. We recommend the shares for conservative investors, as the large dividend yield should be safe and substantially shielded from the impact of inflation. Income investors should make the contrarian move and buy out-of-favor ENB shares for the long term.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation.

Baytex Energy Offers Big Upside And A Growing Dividend But Beware Of The Risks,"  isn't an obvious  energy income  investment. It currently pays a  0.09 per share dividend on its stock, which generates a 1.6  yield. That's not even inAt the moment, BTE shares don't reflect this possibility, so investors seeking income generated from higher oil prices could consider buying them now in anticipation of a higher dividend.In recent weeks, BTE transitioned to paying out 50  of its free cash flow for debt repayment and 50  in a mix of dividends and share repurchases. We estimate that at current oil prices, BTE generates a 30  free cash flowAt oil prices above US 80 per barrel WTI , we expect BTE to pay out  0.25 per share annually as a dividend, which would generate a 4.5  yield on the current share price. As the remaining free cash flow is used to repurchase shares, the number of shares outstanding will decline over time and free cash flow per share will increase. Consequently, BTE's capacity to pay dividends on a per-share basis can grow as long as WTI remains above US 80 per barrel and BTE shares remain undervalued by the market.From a capital appreciation standpoint, BTE shares offer multi-bagger potential due to the huge amount of free cash flow generated at higher oil prices. Our price target for the shares is  9.50, representing a 73  upside from the current price.The challenge in analyzing the investment merits of BTE equity lies in the company's Eagle Ford assets. The long-term economics of depleting shale assets is receiving more attention, and investors have to be comfortable with the prospects for BTE's shale acreage to continue generating free cash flow. Particular attention must be paid to the longevity of the assets reserves and the sustainability of their current production mix. We address both issues in this article.BTE is a Canadian-domiciled oil-and-gas E P that derives half its revenues from several oil-rich basins in Alberta and Saskatchewan and half from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. Its assets are shown in the .BTE shares have been well known among Canadian oil investors for the company's tremendous cash flow torque to higher oil prices. As oil prices increase, its cash flows grow more rapidly than most of its peers. Of course, the flip side is that as oil prices decline, BTE's cash flow falls more rapidly.On February 28, BTE  it would acquire Ranger Oil for C 3.4 billion  US 2.5 billion . In the deal, BTE paid Ranger shareholders 7.49 BTE shares plus US 13.31 in cash for each Ranger share, which represented a premium of 7.4  to Ranger's closing stock price the previous day. BTE also assumed Ranger's debt.To finance the deal, BTE paid  732.8 million in cash and issued 311.4 million new BTE shares valued at  1.3 billion, or  4.26 per share. The newly issued shares increased BTE's share count by 54 . It funded the cash portion through borrowings on its credit facility, a two-year term loan and the issuance of  800 million senior secured notes due 2030. The deal closed on June 20, 2023.The deal was transformative to BTE. After it closed, the company's Eagle Ford acreage was comprised of two largely contiguous blocks, allowing for optimal development and lower costs per barrel.  shows that its acreage is located primarily in the oily part of the Eagle Ford play, depicted in green.The deal has clear benefits for BTE shareholders. It modestly extends the company's proved-plus-probable reserve life for oil, natural gas, and NLGs by approximately one year to 12 years. It also boosts the oil weighting of BTE's Eagle Ford production.The before and after  pro forma  metrics for BTE's Eagle Ford acreage are shown below.Importantly, the acquisition increases the percentage of Eagle Ford production that BTE operates. With greater control over its Eagle Ford operations, management can drill at its own pace and work to improve drilling techniques. We've heard an unsubstantiated-though we believe credible-claim that BTE's management believes it can improve the productivity of the legacy Ranger acreage through its operatorship of the property. CEO Eric Greager was previously the CEO of Civitas Resources , a Colorado-based shale E P. No doubt his experience can prove valuable in optimizing BTE's Eagle Ford drilling. Improved productivity holds the potential for improving shareholder returns and turning the Ranger deal into a bargain purchase.The deal improves BTE's realized crude oil pricing by enhancing its access to the U.S. Gulf Coast while it increases BTE's light oil production in its total production mix. Light oil near the Gulf Coast fetches a US 2 per barrel premium over WTI.As part of the deal, management pledged to increase the amount of capital BTE will return to shareholders. The company had not paid a dividend since 2015 in order to focus on debt reduction. After the deal, BTE shifted to allocate free cash flow on a 50 50  mix between debt reduction and dividends share repurchases. It instituted an annual dividend of  0.09 per share, which equates to a 1.6  yield at BTE's current market price.Management instituted a new debt target of  1.5 billion. Once it reduces debt to that level, it will transition to paying out 75  of free cash flow in the form of dividends and or share repurchases. Management has guided to production growth of 3  to 5  over the next few years.Despite these positives, investors panned the deal since it was announced. After a short-lived rally, BTE's stock declined by more than 25  over the ensuing months. Only recently has it recovered to its pre-deal price in the mid- 5 range. Over the same timeframe, the major Canadian E P index, the iShares S P TSX Energy Index ETF  is up 12.1 .BTE's price action since the deal begs the question of whether the market perceives problems with the Ranger assets. The main contenders would be issues relating to Ranger's reserve life and the sustainability of its production mix between crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, and dry natural gas.Shareholders could have extrapolated production trends ongoing in the greater Eagle Ford to BTE's future production. For instance, Eagle Ford production peaked in 2015 and has since declined by 60 . BTE should have no problem maintaining its production over at least the next five years. Its oil reserves are substantial, while future extensions to its proved reserves should allow it to replace a significant percentage of produced reserves.Perhaps more concerning for Eagle Ford oil producers is the increasing percentage of natural gas relative to oil in the basin's production. The gas-to-oil ratio has climbed since oil production peaked in 2015, as shown in the .Since natural gas is a lower-value product than crude oil, an increasing percentage of gas in a production mix can hurt an E P's financial results. If investors began to suspect that an E P's production was about to get gassier, they would send its shares sharply lower. The same would happen with BTE.To investigate the prospects for BTE's acreage becoming gassier, we looked into the asset quality of Ranger Oil's predecessor companies, Penn Virginia and Lonestar Resources.The legacy Penn Virginia assets are superior to BTE's legacy acreage due to their relatively high oil cut of more than 70  and their low operating costs. Fortunately, these assets represented roughly 60  of Ranger Oil's reserves. Penn Virginia's production and reserves both demonstrated stable oil weighting over many years, and its current reserves imply it can continue to do so.We're more concerned about the legacy Lonestar Resources acreage. These assets are inferior to BTE's legacy Eagle Ford assets.Lonestar initially targeted natural gas and NGLs for development. For years prior to its acquisition by Penn Virginia, it had grown its natural gas production rapidly to prove up its acreage. Year after year, most of its discoveries and extensions were of natural gas. Then in 2016, Lonestar purchased oil-weighted assets from a defunct Sanchez Energy. The deal increased the oil weighting of Lonestar's reserves and production. But the increase only proved temporary. Despite the Sanchez asset acquisition, in the following years, Lonestar's production and reserves became progressively gassier.These are the assets at greatest risk of exhibiting increasing gas content. Fortunately, they only represent 20  of BTE's Eagle Ford reserves. We therefore don't see them as an obstacle for BTE to maintain its oil weighting over the next five years.On balance, we believe the Ranger acquisition improves BTE's prospects for maintaining its Eagle Ford production, as well as the oil weighting of its production mix. We consider it to be a net positive for long-term shareholder value.We don't believe the decline in BTE's stock is attributable to real or perceived problems with Ranger's assets or production prospects. Rather, it was likely due to BTE's decision to take on debt to finance the acquisition. The new debt increased the risk to shareholders amid an oil-price downturn. In addition, investors were probably disappointed by the company's new capital allocation plan, which calls for allocating 50  of free cash flow to dividends and share repurchases. In doing so, it will reduce the pace of debt reduction just after the company tripled its net debt balance.Another negative that may have caused the stock's swoon was the large number of shares that BTE issued at a severe discount to its intrinsic value in order to fund the acquisition of assets of arguably lesser quality. The deal also limited BTE's ability to benefit from today's high oil prices due to its requirement to hedge 40  of its oil exposure for 12 months to secure financing on acceptable terms.Lastly, the market may have drawn ominous parallels to BTE's disastrous acquisition of Aurora Oil and Gas in 2014 at the top of the previous cycle. That deal saddled BTE with onerous debt obligations that put its equity at risk for the next six years.We value BTE shares in the range of  8.50 to  10.50. Our price target is the midpoint of the range, or  9.50, which implies a 72.7  upside from the stock's current price of  5.50.We value BTE from two perspectives  the free cash flow yield on its equity at a given oil price and the discounted cash flow net to shareholders over the company's life. All our valuations assume that the AECO natural gas price is  2.50 per mcf and that the WTI-WCS differential is  16.50.Turning first to the free cash flow yield, the results for BTE are nothing short of spectacular. The shares possess tremendous free cash flow torque to higher oil prices. The table below shows the amount of free cash flow the company generates at different oil prices.Using a generous 12  free cash flow yield for valuation purposes, at US 85 per barrel WTI, our estimates imply that BTE shares offer 112  upside.With regard to BTE's free cash flow downside, we estimate that free cash flow goes to zero at US 58.33 per barrel WTI.BTE's free cash flow yield is relevant for income investors because the company is currently allocating 50  of its free cash flow to a combination of dividends and share repurchases. If it allocated half of the 50  of free cash flow to share repurchases and paid out the other half to a common dividend-a portion of which will be fixed and the remainder variable-the company would pay an annual dividend of  0.35 per share with WTI was sustained at US 85 per barrel. The stock would yield an attractive 6.3  in such a scenario. The significant amount of share repurchases underway in such a scenario would rapidly shrink the number of shares outstanding, increasing free cash flow per share for the remaining shareholders and leading to larger dividend payouts per share in the future.We estimate that with oil at  80 and the company allocating 50  of free cash flow toward debt reduction, it will reach its  1.5 billion net debt target in two years and one quarter. That timing shrinks to one year and three quarters at  85 per barrel and to one year and a half at  90 per barrel. Once BTE has achieved its debt target, it will pay out 75  of its free cash flow to shareholders.Turning to discounted cash flow valuations, our conservative scenario assumes that oil remains at  80 per barrel and that BTE increases production by 3  through 2028 and then keeps production flat thereafter. It also slashes BTE's terminal value by two-thirds to account for the possibility that the company's production declines or becomes gassier after year 10. All our scenarios employ a 12  discount rate and a WTI-WCS differential of  16.50.This valuation implies the shares are worth  8.68, representing 58  upside from their current price of  5.50.To further address the risk of BTE's production becoming gassier, our next scenario illustrates what BTE's free cash flow would look like with WTI at US 80 per barrel, but with BTE producing 75  liquids-35  of which is heavy, 45  of which is light, and 20  of which is NGLs-and 25  natural gas. These assumptions are in contrast to our estimate that BTE will produce 84.4  liquids-of which we assume 59.5  is light crude, 26.0  is heavy crude, and 14.5  is NGLs-and 15.6  natural gas. This severe scenario implies that the shares are appropriately valued.Incidentally, BTE's current free cash flow yield using these assumptions stands at 14.3 .Of course, this scenario won't actually occur, but it illustrates what would have to happen to the company's production mix to justify its current stock price.The next discounted cash flow implies that BTE shares currently discount US 73.32 per barrel WTI, a far cry from today's price of more than  90 per barrel.Our bullish scenario values BTE shares with WTI sustained at US 85 per barrel. This scenario reduces the terminal value by half. It values BTE at  9.78, implying 78  upside.For more extreme scenarios we don't consider in our value range or price target for BTE shares, at US 90 per barrel WTI, our discounted cash flow valuation implies the shares are worth  11.62, representing 111  upside from their current price of  5.50. At US 100 per barrel WTI, we value the shares at  15.28, implying 178  upside. Both valuations use a 12  discount rate and cut BTE's terminal value in half.Clearly, all the reasonable valuations imply significant upside for BTE shares. The valuations based on free cash flow multiples indicate multi-bagger potential. And our discounted cash flow scenarios that incorporate a 12  discount rate and reduce the terminal value illustrate the substantial upside.Baytex Energy Corp. has emerged from its Ranger acquisition with its operations split 50 50  between the Eagle Ford shale and various oil-weighted plays in Canada, which include some of the most economic locations in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. The company's operational risks stem primarily from its Eagle Ford acreage, so we dedicated most of our analysis to the region. Over at least the next three years, we expect BTE's Eagle Ford results to exhibit flat production and a stable commodity mix. Meanwhile, its Canadian production growth will drive companywide production growth of 3 -to-5  per year, in line with management's guidance.Our BTE valuation and price target point to 72.7  upside from the current price. In fact, the shares possess upside potential at WTI prices greater than US 73 per barrel.We're less confident about BTE's production more than three years out. For this reason, we currently wouldn't recommend investing in the shares for more than a three-year holding period.Investors must be careful to balance BTE's potential returns with its risks. For one, investors should be wary of the downside of BTE's torque to oil prices. Operating leverage works both ways  cash flow grows rapidly as oil prices march higher, but it also shrinks rapidly as prices fall. BTE's debt load and reduced free cash flow at lower oil prices will significantly increase its risk to shareholders if prices fall below US 65 per barrel WTI. Due to this risk, investors who prioritize the safety of the principal and seek to avoid permanent capital losses at sustained low oil prices should avoid the name in favor of more conservative E P holdings. Even investors who wish to own BTE for the next few years should only make the shares a small part of their investment portfolio due to the risk of loss if WTI falls below US 65 per barrel for more than a year.Investors who can bear these risks in mind should consider BTE shares for their explosive upside amid current oil prices and for their potential over the coming quarters for paying a large and growing dividend.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences - Part 2: Natural Gas,"This follow-up article discusses the macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy toPerhaps the most important element in the massive increase in U.S. energy production is the growth of natural gas production in the time period we are considering  2007-2022 . In this period, the table below shows the increase in billions of cubic feet  BCF  of both gross withdrawals and dry gas production inTo understand the increasingly important role of natural gas, it is important to first reference some history. Before that, we want to lay out some relevant terminology. Natural Gas, not surprisingly, is a gas until it is cooled to an extremely low temperature. It is measured in cubic feet at sea level  volume increases or decreases with pressure . It is typically priced in units of thousands of cubic feet  MCF .Conveniently, one thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals 1.036 million BTU  one author has a friend who considers this  one of the proofs of the existence of God  and this makes certain calculations easier  for example, a trillion cubic feet is roughly equal to a quadrillion BTUs or a Quad . Natural gas is produced often containing natural gas liquids such as propane and butane and these liquids are removed at natural gas processing plants which are often operated by MLPs. After this removal, the resulting dry gas is the product most commonly used by consumers.First, a little bit of simplified but instructive history. Natural gas has gone through several phases in terms of how it is viewed by policymakers  these phases have been  1  nuisance  2  luxury  3  necessity  and 4  national security. At first, it was a dangerous byproduct of petroleum extraction and was usually  flared.  In fact, one way in which the Texas Railroad Commission could reduce petroleum production and thereby raise prices was by using no-flare orders. Natural gas began to be used in cities, but this was largely  city gas  produced from coal.It dawned on someone that the gas being flared could be hooked up to these networks, and pipelines started to make their way across the country. All of this was happening back in the days when things could actually be planned and built before NEPA and NIMBY restrictions. So far, so good.Then, the Supreme Court ruled that wellhead natural gas production was subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, and the FPC  now named the FERC and at one time almost renamed the FUC  started to regulate the price that could be paid to natural gas producers. The  experts  at the FPC argued that there was a finite amount of natural gas in the ground and that keeping prices at a lower level would limit production. There were various estimates, most of which projected that we would have already run out of natural by now.This policy orientation slowly began to produce a shortage, which became more severe when oil prices rose sharply in 1973. Natural gas and petroleum products were substitutes for one another as home heating fuels, fuels for power plants, and in other applications. As oil prices rose, more and more users wanted to switch to natural gas which was regulated at much lower prices. In addition, producers focused their efforts on wells showing promise of oil production rather than those showing promise of natural gas production. The situation was complicated by the fact that gas which was produced and consumed in the same state  intrastate gas  was not price regulated, leading natural gas to be more expensive but also more available in those markets.A complex mess emerged   loved by lawyers and lobbyists, but hated by the public. Each interstate pipeline had  curtailment  proceedings in which customers would argue their comparative worthiness to receive the natural gas priced below the levels of economic demand. One point was widely agreed   natural gas could never be used  under a boiler   i.e., to generate electricity . At one point in the interstate market, we came close to  losing towns  due to a cold January, and customers were told that it was patriotic to turn down the thermostat.Finally, starting in the Carter administration and continuing in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, wellhead natural gas production was deregulated. First, deep gas, then  new  gas, and finally all gas. It was confidently predicted by the  experts  that in 1984-85, when  new gas  was deregulated, there would be a monstrous  fly up  in gas prices. Just the opposite occurred, and gas became plentiful.As more and more natural gas began to be produced and as customers found that it was a reliable energy source, natural gas consumption and production increased. Now that natural gas could be used to generate electricity it gradually became a kind of  default  choice as a generating fuel. The electric industry has gone through various phases in terms of strategies for generation. In the early years, coal dominated. Then, there was a phase where it was trumpeted that nuclear power would take over and make electricity  too cheap to meter.For a whole series of reasons, this did not play out and after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, it became prohibitively expensive to build new plants. At one point, residual oil started to replace coal, and in some cases natural gas  remember that we thought we were running out of natural gas    but the 1970s oil price shock ended that. In the late 70's, the government was encouraging  coal conversion    which involved having utilities stop burning oil and start switching to coal.Now, in the 90's we began to see a halting but increasingly steady shift to natural gas. Coal was bad for global warming, oil was expensive, and nuclear was no longer on the table so natural gas was all that was left. Improvements in technology allowed for a reduction in the heat rate  the number of BTUs necessary to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity  from around 10,000 for conventional plants to 6-8 thousand for new combined cycle plants. Natural gas power plants were also much easier to site and less expensive to build than coal or nuclear plants. The table below gives total electric production and the natural gas share in 1977, 1990  right after deregulation , 2007, and 2022 all stated in billions of kilowatt hours.Gas has increased its share enormously and that is the main reason that the domestic consumption of natural gas has increased. The table below provides natural gas consumption in the U.S. and net imports  the minus sign in 2022 means net exports  for those years in billions of cubic feet.We have been fortunate to have a massive increase in domestic production just at the time when natural gas was needed by the electric power industry. More recently, that increase in production has enabled us to become the world's largest LNG exporter and to help alleviate Europe's problem associated with the cessation of natural gas imports from Russia. Natural gas has now reached the point where its production has become a critical national security factor.The concern with global warming has led to a push for the deployment of energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. These energy sources   mostly solar and wind   generate electricity but are not easily if at all deployable to directly provide transportation, heating, and other end-use services. Even if a massive amount of energy could be generated by the deployment of these technologies, there would still be carbon emissions from fossil fuel use as heating, transportation, and other end-use fuels.As a result, climate activists have determined that a very high priority is the rapid electrification of the economy. This takes the form of mandates, prohibitions, and subsidies all favoring the replacement of gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles, and the replacement of natural gas use for heating, cooking, and other purposes with electricity. This electrification, it is assumed, will make it easier to reduce carbon emissions as solar and wind electricity production expands.At the same time, there has been strong pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants because of coal's very high carbon dioxide emissions. In the period between 2007 and 2022, the amount of electricity produced by coal plants has plummeted.It should be noted that there is also a general trend in developed economies for a higher and higher percentage of total energy consumption to be in the form of electricity. This trend is completely independent of efforts to combat global warming. The table below provides  solely for purposes of trend comparison  the total U.S. energy consumption in quadrillion BTUs and the total electricity production in terms of billions of kilowatt hours in 1950, 1975, 2007, and 2022.Over this 72-year time frame, total energy has increased by somewhat less than a factor of 3 while electricity consumption has increased by a factor of a bit less than 14. Even in the past 15 years, electricity consumption has increased while total energy has decreased slightly.Not surprisingly, climate activists have been somewhat more successful in their electrification strategy than they have with the actual deployment of renewable energy. The deployment of power plants and the necessary transmission facilities requires large-scale capital investment and is subject to intense and determined opposition that can stretch out the process or stop the project. While no one is going to sue me for buying an electric car, they are very likely to go to court to stop the production of the electricity necessary to power the car.All of these factors   the retirement of coal-fired power plants, the push for electrification, and the delay in the deployment of renewable sources of power   have created a massive opportunity for natural gas to expand its use as an electricity-generating fuel. The table below shows the billions of kilowatt hours produced by coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind in the years 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2022.Natural gas has become the leading electricity-generating fuel by a large margin. This past July we recorded the highest demand for natural gas at power plants in history one Wednesday and then the record was broken on the very next day. An interesting thought experiment would be to imagine what things would be like without fracking. We would almost certainly have had to import massive amounts of LNG which would have been much more expensive and one of the major issues in our society would have been the outrageous increases in electric rates.It is always dangerous to predict the future of energy consumption and production. However, it is reasonable to assume that policy provisions as well as long-term trends will increase the consumption of electricity in the near and intermediate future. It is also reasonable to assume that there will be continued pressure to shut down coal-fired power plants and that there may be some nuclear plants getting so old that shutdown becomes necessary. Of course, there will be increased output from solar and wind, but in that connection, the 2023 data so far shows no significant increase from comparable months in 2022. Wind may be moving up a siting cost curve having used up the sites where the amount of the wind resource, ease of construction, access to grids, and a low level of NIMBY opposition made costs reasonable. To a lesser extent, the same thing may be happening to central station solar.For this reason, one of our authors believes that distributed solar is the renewable technology that will grab the biggest share of the market going forward. Even with a massive expansion of solar and wind, the intermittent nature of these technologies will require a large and reliable base load capacity on the system and the phase-out of coal will remove many of the plants that supply such capacity. Natural gas is the only viable alternative in the near and intermediate term.In the long term the electrification of the entire automobile and SUV fleet would consume roughly 1 trillion kilowatt hours per year or roughly 25  of current U.S. electricity production  this is based on an assumption of a 7 to 1 kilowatt hour to gallon of gasoline ratio which may be optimistic . This massive increase in electricity consumption will add to the trends described above by requiring large-scale increases in generating capacity.Thus, viewing the U.S. energy market in isolation, it is almost impossible to imagine that there will not be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for the generation of electricity. This will more than offset losses in demand due to the conversion of natural gas heating and cooking to electricity. In fact, such conversions are very likely   in the near and intermediate term   to result in increased natural gas being burned in power plants rather than in residences. The leader of the electrical supply team at the EIA  Energy Information Administration of the DOE  has said that  Almost anywhere in the United States, any incremental increase in electricity demand is met with a fossil resource.In the early part of this century, there was considerable activity on the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico planning and building LNG terminals getting ready for the  inevitable  need for the U.S. to import massive amounts of LNG because of the factors discussed above. As time passed the amount of gas produced through fracking surprised policymakers and began to produce a massive surplus. Plans were drastically revised, and in some cases LNG facilities were retooled so that they could operate as export facilities.In addition, methanol production  a technology for turning natural gas into a liquid that can be mixed with gasoline  methanol is extensively used in China  started to be planned for the area. Several major plants are now in production.The Ukraine war and measures preventing or at least dramatically reducing Russian gas sales to Europe created a powerful demand for LNG, and the U.S. was ready to jump into the breach. LNG exports have been increased and when added to the methanol production and export, now constitute a major portion of total natural gas output.The international market   in which the U.S. is now a major player   is complex. There is a considerable amount of  stranded gas  in countries subject to boycotts and sanctions. Iran and Russia could both be massive exporters in a completely free market. There is also natural gas in Latin America which is not being produced due to political factors. Some European countries could engage in fracking if they chose to do so. So, it is possible that in the intermediate or long term, U.S. exports will face competition from new sources.On the other hand, most developed countries  with some notable exceptions  face the same dilemmas in determining how to generate electricity that we face here in the US. Coal is available but disfavored due to carbon emissions. There is public opposition to nuclear. The intermittent nature of solar and wind requires a base load complement. As a result, there is likely to be an increasing demand for natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity in other nations.There may be political pressure against LNG exports both by those who believe that a ban would reduce domestic prices and by those who disfavor fracking. However, our allies need the additional gas. In addition, U.S. production is likely to be cleaner than the foreign production of gas or coal which would replace it   especially as strict U.S. restrictions on the leakage of methane in the process of production and transportation are implemented.While the export market may be more volatile than domestic demand, it is likely to be active and available to U.S. producers for a considerable time. It is ironic that, in a sense, we have done a full 180. From considering natural gas to be a finite resource on the brink of exhaustion and therefore viewing its use to generate electricity as a despicable waste, we now view it not only as our primary source for the generation of electricity but also as a source of revenue due to constantly increasing exports. This illustrates the tremendous difficulty of long and even intermediate-term energy projections. It is very easy for the  universal consensus  to be mistaken.The price of natural gas is volatile because its domestic use is weather sensitive. As a heating fuel, it benefits from a colder-than-normal winter. As an electricity-generating fuel, it generally benefits from a warmer-than-normal summer due to the importance of air conditioning demand. The best way to play this is to look for companies that earn money at least partly based on throughput or have a stable source of demand.In assessing other MLPs, investors can discover the percentage of revenue that is gas-related and can make a reasonable assumption that it is relatively stable. It is likely that the market has not fully digested the implications of the massive shift in the U.S. energy picture and there is still a considerable amount of money to be made.If you want full access to our Model Portfolio and our current Top Picks, join us at  for a .We are the largest income investor and retiree community on Seeking Alpha with  6000 members actively working together to make amazing retirements happen.

AMLP: A Good Inflation Hedge With Lower Volatility Than Most Energy Investments,"If you believe energy prices and inflation will be higher for longer but prefer to avoid the volatility of upstream oil and gas equities, the Alerian MLP ETF  may be an investment vehicle toBut why invest in midstream MLPs  Three reasonsThat said, if you purchase the units of PAA, EPD or MPLX directly, you will achieve a better yield because the fees charged by AMLP are rather high. However, besides the diversification benefit, the ETF also provides a  wrapper  around the K-1 forms issued by individual MLPs. While receiving a K-1 isn't the end of the world, many investors prefer to avoid the tax complexity.AMLP may be particularly attractive if you think the Fed is approaching the end of its tightening cycle and we are headed into financial repression, i.e., lower, artificially managed interest rates while inflation has not fully receded. Historically, just as other high-yield investments, MLPs have underperformed when interest rates were high. However, this time, perhaps because it is still recovering from the pandemic sell-off, AMLP has held up surprisingly well. If the Fed  pivots  in the face of rising fiscal deficits, I would expect AMLP to eventually re-rate higher.Midstream assets ought to do well in an inflationary regime because they are  hard assets  and also represent critical infrastructure - there is no substitute. The only threat could be a rapid transition to renewables but that is simply not realistic as pointed out by EPD in a  presentationFurther, as , upstream production is getting more gassy and this puts more pressure on the midstream segmentAs the Permian's gas output is growing, it is good to  that Appalachia is already constrained by offtake capacityThis promises for an interesting dynamic. Both U.S. LNG export capacity and upstream gas production are growing, but the midstream capacity that links the two is lagging behind. I think this is good for the owners of the existing infrastructure.In fact, the midstream bull thesis extends beyond energy to petrochemicals as wellThe U.S. has excess ethane  which, after getting cracked into ethylene is a basic petchem building block  and managing the oversupply will put further premium on storage and export terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast.While some midstream companies are organized as C-corps  similar to most traded stocks , others are MLPs or publicly traded partnerships. Unlike C-corps, MLPs are passthrough entities from federal income tax perspective, which theoretically results in a lower cost of capital.A good  is MPLX, which is  by Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC is the GP  general partner  in the MLP that is responsible for the commercial decisions. In this case, MPC isn't only the GP, but also owns 65  of the common units - the common unit holders are basically the  limited partners.  In MPLX's case, only 35  of the common units are owned by investors and traded publicly, but there is no reason why that percentage can't be different. MLPs can also have preferred units.While not all MLPs are linked to a corporation, in the MPC-MPLX setup the MLP gets a lot of revenue from the sponsor, i.e., MPLX provides its infrastructure for MPC's use. This usually happens under long-term agreements with minimum payment obligations to shift risk away from the MLP to the sponsor. The GPs may also frequently have  incentive distribution rights  which act similarly to carried interest and increase the GP's returns after certain return hurdles are reached by the common unit holders.As the GP controls the MLP from a commercial perspective, the partnership agreement has certain safeguards to protect the common unit holders. Usually all available cash above some minimal level has to be distributed quarterly. Unlike a REIT, the distribution requirement is not tax-driven. However, similarly to a REIT, an MLP must derive at least 90  of its income from  qualifying activities   operating midstream energy infrastructure is of course a qualifying activity .The MLP structure limits the upside for the common units, but the idea is that there is also protection on the downside - and, mostly, the entire setup is intended to facilitate cash distributions in a tax-advantaged way.MLPs target U.S. retail investors. Unlike stock dividends, some of the MLP distribution is considered a  return of capital  and decreases the cost basis of the units. This can have the effect of deferring tax on distributions until the investors sell their units.For other market participants, the MLP structure MLPs have generally been losing popularity. One culprit is perhaps the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  back in 2017, which diminished the tax advantage. However, even prior to that some industry players such as Kinder Morgan   their MLPs. In the KMI example one concern was the increasing incentive distribution right payment that resulted in the MLP paying out more cash to KMI than to the common unit holders  the MLP structure was also said to constrain growth.In any case, besides Kinder Morgan, there are a number of other midstream players organized as C-corps  you don't have to invest in MLPs to gain exposure to the sector.The quality of an ETF is as good as the underlying investmentsAfter PAA, MPLX and EPD, the next largest holdings are Energy Transfer , Western Midstream Partners  and EnLink Midstream . These top six holdings make up about 75  of the ETF.Currently Seeking Alpha analysts rate each of these MLPs as a  buyDistributions have been slowly growing since the pandemicThe coverage ratios are goodCash flow multiples are considerably below their pre-pandemic levelsIndividually, AMLP's holdings appear to be reasonably good investments.Distributions fell in Q1 2020 and reached their low point in Q1 2021  since then, they have been steadily increasing. Minor quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are probably associated with special distributionsAMLP is less volatile than an upstream ETF such as the SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF  and drawdowns have been more mutedAMLP did experience big drawdowns in 2014 and during the pandemic, though  that still weighs down on the long-term historical returnsThe 0.85  fee charged by the ETF isn't low either, but that is probably the price if you really want to avoid the K-1sIt is worth pointing out that a from Global X  with a similar no K-1 benefit charges a lower fee of 0.47 . The two ETFs track closely each other although MLPA has slightly underperformed AMLPThe MLPA yield is also a bit lower. Ultimately, AMLP and MLPA cover similar investments, but the holding percentages are different.I started buying AMLP back in 2020 and my average cost basis is currently about  26. Right now, I would probably wait for some correction before I put new money in although AMLP recently seems to have broken above its post-pandemic  rangeI rate AMLP a  hold  which is exactly what I personally am doing.

W&T Offshore: A Q3 Beat Could Be A Catalyst For This Undervalued Stock,"W T Offshore  is small and undervalued offshore oil and gas producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Based on a recent precedent transaction, the implied value of W T's hydrocarbon reserves could be at least  1.5 billion which significantlyWhile W T has struggled this year due to unexpected operational problems and weaker oil and gas prices, the stock seems to have found a bottom in April and has since been hovering in this support regionWith the  Holy Grail  drilling prospect out of the picture until 2024, WTI is still in search of a catalyst. In the meantime, the renewed strength in oil prices In the medium term, rising natural gas prices and oil prices proving they are able to hold their current levels will provide further tailwinds going into 2024.Value  can mean different things to different people but it is usually associated with low pricing multiples. Seeking Alpha  the company  A-  on valuation based on how W T's ratios compare to the peer sectorHowever, while  A-  looks pretty good, it doesn't capture W T's full potential. These ratios are based on flow measures  EBITDA, EBIT, Sales  and W T is currently underperforming on these dimensions due to Yet, while investors value current profits, an oil and gas company is also a claim on the underlying reserves. Therefore, a company can also be a value stock if it trades at a discount to its net asset value  or NAV . In my view, this has indeed been the case and W T's discount to its NAV is significant.The  its  PV-10 , a standardized NAV measure commonly used in the industryProved reserves or  1P  was estimated at  2 billion. Adding probable reserves increases this figure to  3.4 billion. This compares to an enterprise value of  845 million. Even focusing conservatively only on the  producing  portion of the 1P reserves suggests a PV-10 of  1.4 billion.The PV-10 though follows a standardized methodology that uses backward-looking pricing so it isn't the same as a market value. However, W T's  of producing assets in the U.S. GoM provides another angle from which we can look at this.Part of the reason W T delayed drilling its Holy Grail prospect was to conserve cash that could be used for opportunistic acquisitions. It seems the company was indeed able to find suitable assets to acquireThis suggests W T paid about  10.0 per 1P boe or  6.3 per 2P boe  applying these metrics to W T's legacy reserve base implies a NAV of about  1.5 billionMore of the acquired proved reserves are producing relative to legacy W T and the oil content is higher, but on the other hand the acquisition is only 2  of W T's size. Scale typically drives a premium so you could also say the  1.5 billion estimate is rather conservative.Based on W T's capital structure, for the enterprise value to get to  1.5 billion, the stock price would need to increase from  4.14 to  8.65 for a 109  gain. The Wall Street target reported by Seeking Alpha is even north of my estimateFrom a value perspective, W T has the potential to double. The question is what could prompt the move up.WTI is expected to report on November 1. According to Seeking Alpha, the consensus estimates are revenue of  129 million and EPS of  0. However, both oil and natural gas are tracking above the summer forecasts, so the setup for a  beat  is favorable.The Q1 production issues  by now. Based on management's mid-production guidance plus the realized Q3 marker prices  assuming historical pricing differentials , I estimate Q3 revenue at  137 millionIf revenue is a beat even by 5 , very likely EPS will be a beat too. Further, given W T cut its initial capex guidance for the year and 2023 is rather light on plugging   abandonment expense, I wouldn't be surprised if free cash flow comes out good too.Looking further ahead to Q4, W T would exit 2023 at about 3x EV EBITDANote that while 50  of WTI's production is gas, the oil price is still more important as a revenue EBITDA driver. WTI doesn't have oil hedges. Gas is still 2 3 hedged but that mattered more in 2022. For Q3 and Q4 I don't expect significant hedging losses.Short interest remains highThat could be a risk which can drive the price lower but it could also be an opportunity that can magnify the effect of a Q3 beat. Given WTI has been in the same support region since April, I am starting to think that we have run out of potential sellers.Gas prices brought WTI down from  9 last time but there are numerous signs that US natural gas  has bottomedThe major risk is perhaps oil heading back down to the  60s. Yet, when oil did do so in late March and again in early June, W T was still in the same  3.50- 4.00 range. So I'm not sure how much downside is left.W T Offshore is undervalued relative to its asset base. From a valuation perspective, the stock price could double. A Q3 earnings beat could be a possible catalyst.

"Energy Transfer's Operations Shine, But Risks For Unitholders Remain","  posted an impressive operating performance in its . The company set throughput records in every segment but those related to crude oil. The table below shows the dramatic improvement overAs impressive as these results are, note that longer-term comparisons are distorted by acquisitions, so the outsized improvement relative to 2020 and 2021 are less relevant gauges of performance.The record throughput gains in Q2 didn t translate to improved financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA of  3.12 billion fell by 3.3  from the previous year and 9.1  from the previous quarter, while the company missed consensus expectations of  3.21 billion by 2.8 .Like operating results, longer-term financial results are also distorted by acquisitions. The company s  9.1 billion of acquisitions over the past two years make itThe culprit behind ET s EBITDA miss during the quarter was its commodity price exposure, particularly with regard to natural gas and NGLs, with ethane having the biggest impact.With natural gas prices down 70  and NGL prices down 45  from the year-ago quarter, the commodity-sensitive portion of ET's EBITDA took a hit. Approximately 10  of EBITDA is exposed to commodity prices. For the second quarter, that amounts to  312 million of EBITDA, so it s not surprising that EBITDA missed expectations by around  100 million.Results are expected to improve in the second half of the year. Management narrowed ET s full-year 2023 guidance to  13.1 to  13.4 billion while keeping the midpoint the same as its previous guidance.Among other positives in the quarter were management s new target of 3  to 5  annual distribution increases. ET also has growth projects underway that will contribute to EBITDA and cash flow over the coming years. Its Mont Belvieu Frac VIII fractionator is expected to enter service in a few weeks, while its Nederland export capacity expansion is on schedule to be completed in mid-2025. Other notable expansions likely to enter service over the next few years include a new Permian Basin processing plant and a capacity addition to the Gulf Run Pipeline.ET is still pursuing its Lake Charles LNG project. Management expects to file a new export authorization with the Department of Energy this month. ET has already entered into 3.6 million tons per year of LNG offtake agreements and has lined up potential equity partners. Lake Charles shows potential for adding to EBITDA by 2028.These positives are offset by negatives that pose risks to ET unitholders.First, the company s leverage ratio ended the quarter at a lofty 4.5-times. Despite its recent success in bringing the ratio down from more than 5-times, leverage remains too high for unitholder comfort. Consider that Enterprise Products Partners , which also operates a large-scale diversified midstream business, operates with a leverage ratio of 3.0-times, the low end of management s target range of 3.0 to 3.5-times.ET s high debt load relative to EBITDA is one reason its units trade at a discounted multiple relative to peers. The market knows that in the past, ET management has overextended the company at great risk to common unitholders by running up debt to fund overexpansion and excessive common distributions. ET s currently elevated leverage increases the risk that management will do so again.For ET, reducing debt would do more to increase the unit price than distribution increases. A lower debt balance would reduce risk to equity owners and increase the cash flow multiple at which ET units trade.We would prefer management to continue prioritizing deleveraging, but its commentary indicates it s back to expansion mode. Judging from comments made on the second-quarter earnings call, we put management s capital allocation priorities as expansion, deleveraging, distribution growth, and unit repurchases in that order.What came through most clearly on ET s second-quarter conference call was that management is downright giddy when it came to expansion. It mentioned  acquisition  11 times,  expansion  16 times, and  growth  25 times over a span of 48 minutes.ET s enthusiasm for expansion has been costly to unitholders. For one, ET s expansion has not increased its return on capital, though it has increased its financial and operating complexity. For ET, there s no  knitting  to stick to  every midstream asset is fair game in its quest for greater size. Such undisciplined expansion runs the risk of being reckless if EBITDA synergies don t materialize or if assets aren t properly integrated.Second, ET s expansion has resulted in unitholder dilution, as deals are funded through the issuance of undervalued units. Most recently, ET issued 44.5 million new units at approximately  12.36 per unit as part of its  1.45 billion  in April. We view ET units as being significantly undervalued, so the acquisition s cost is more than meets the eye from management s promotion alone. In this deal, the 1.4  dilution is closer to 2  in terms of value per unit.In addition to acquisitions, ET will continue to expand by pursuing new growth projects. Management bumped up its annual growth capex estimate to the range of  2 to  3 billion and even mentioned that it hoped growth capex would exceed  3 billion. In light of the company s leverage, these comments don t inspire confidence that management will avoid the errors of its past.We re maintaining our Energy Transfer LP Buy rating and our price target of  15.25. Midstream analysts tend to assign higher price targets than ours, with the average around  17 and the high at  22. In our view, the risks in the picture make us comfortable with our lower valuation. Unless circumstances change for the better, we plan on selling our units when they reach our price target and we can find attractive alternatives.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation.

Transocean: Let's Do The Convertible Bond Math,"I recently wrote about the improvement in Transocean's  credit prospects and what it could mean for the equity.One  watch area  that I identified were Transocean's convertible bondsAs I pointed out, all convertibles are now in the money and this may imply up to 20  dilution for the equity holders. Interestingly, during the subsequent , RIG's management also emphasized this pointGiven we may now theoretically exit Q3 at northOne view is that everything is already priced in  clearly, the potential dilutive effect has been known since  when these bonds were issued. From accounting perspective, Transocean even records a liability associated with the  moneyness  of the exchange featureHowever, what I want to show is that, abstracting oneself away from what is or isn't priced in and just looking at the intrinsic value of the shares, the exercise of the conversion options would potentially reduce this intrinsic value by 5 to 10  in most scenarios. While not immaterial, I think that 5 to 10  is small compared to the fundamental uncertainty over how much Transocean's underlying assets would be worth in, say, 2025.In other words, the conversion by itself shouldn't really change your bullish or bearish stance on the stock although short-term buying opportunities could arise if the bondholders who avail themselves of the conversion option also seek to divest their newly minted shares. Interestingly, a corollary of the balance sheet mechanics is that if you are very bearish on Transocean, the conversion should make you relatively more bullish.Finally, while in the long term the conversion could be a wash for the equity, what is undisputable in my view is that it will be very bullish for the non-convertible debt, especially for the junior bonds which currently rank below the convertibles. Despite the spread compression I described in my prior article, these junior notes still offer an attractive yield for what at this point isn't that much risk.A convertible bond can be seen as a combination of a straight bond and a call option on the equity. We know from the theory that the early exercise of an option is never optimal, but it's not unusual that institutional factors may dictate otherwise. For example, distressed debt investors may rather get their money out and put it into another investment consistent with their mandate than retain long-term exposure to Transocean's equity. As the conversion options are now deep in the money, the primary driver for future bond gains would be the equity itself.Insider Perestroika already converted a lot of its debt in Q2 and this was already noted in a  from JuneNow that the 10-Q is out, we can also see the corresponding growth in the share countIf the remaining options get exercised this quarter, going into the next quarter we are looking at a little more than 900 million outstanding shares.As the conversion substitutes debt for equity, the expected 20  dilution doesn't mean that the intrinsic value of the shares will drop by 20  too. To quantify the effect, we need to have a view on the fair value of the asset side of the balance sheet.To make things easy, I am going to assume an average value of  450 million for the 27 active floaters. As it's an  average , you'll have units such as the Titan and Atlas well above and older units below that mark. I will assume zero value for the 12 stacked units. If these assumptions don't seem reasonable to you, don't worry  I also ran a sensitivity analysis that shows how the impact of the conversion changes with the asset values.Given various estimates from offshore drilling earnings calls that suggest up to  1 billion cost for a newbuild, I don't think  450 million is aggressive, especially as I don't include any contracted backlog either. In total, my assumptions suggest fixed assets value of  12.15 billion, which is still below the latest net book value of  16.92 billion. Perhaps as additional reference point, Deep Value Driller AS, a company listed in Norway that owns a single stacked 7G ship, currently being reactivated, is trading at an enterprise value equivalent to about  250 million.So let's first compare the  before  and  after  conversion balance sheet for my  450 million per active rig scenarioSo here the intrinsic value drops by 8 . Again, remember these are intrinsic values. If you subscribe to the efficient markets hypothesis, you could argue that the price you observe in the market already corresponds to the post-conversion  7.89 value from the example  which, if you reverse my process, should tell you what the market thinks about the average rig values .Now, as promised, let's see what happens as we vary the average rig value from  250 million all the way to  600 millionFor the scenarios that I see as plausible, we are looking at a 5 to 10  effect. If you are very bearish on Transocean  which means you think its rigs are worth very little , the conversion should even make you slightly more bullish.At first glance, the conversion option's effect on the equity is quite significant. However, I would argue that we are still facing much uncertainty about what Transocean's drillships would be worth a few years outOver the last 5 years, Transocean's enterprise value has moved within a  - 30  band from its average, and the equity range is even wider due to the leverage effect. Comparatively, a 5 to 10  one-time move shouldn't reverse your bullish  or bearish  thesis.One can also run this exercise from an earnings per share perspective. Exchanging the convertible bonds will reduce the interest expense, but increase the number of shares over which the earnings are spread. However, the convertible bonds carry lower interest rates and Transocean still reports a net loss, so this calculation would be less informative.I would think that if we go from 766 to 913 million shares, the average daily volume should also increase, all else equal. However, so far I am not seeing thatIn fact, the daily volumes have fallen from Q1. The short interest has been relatively static since last September, when the convertibles were issuedIf some of the short interest was meant to hedge the convertibles, the effect of the debt conversion may be even more muddled.With all this said, I am not hugely concerned about the remaining convertible notes getting exchanged. In fact, bondholders exchanging and cashing out could even create some buying opportunities. For me personally, my average cost basis in Transocean's equity is  3.44, and I would consider adding more if we get down to  6 againI won't engage in any sophisticated technical analysis, but I think the  6 level has been good support for the stock so far this year.While the impact on the equity depends on what you think of the market value of the drillships and what is already priced into the stock, there should be little doubt that the non-convertible debt is the big winner. This is especially true of the junior bonds because the convertibles have senior guaranteed statusFrom the junior bondholders' perspective, the conversion is removing a layer of higher priority debt above and replacing it with lower ranked equity. That must be credit positive and we are talking 10  of the overall debt. I would contend that is less likely to be priced in because the demand for debt is strongly influenced by its credit rating due to institutional mandates. I don't think the credit rating agencies would make any move before the conversion is actually effected.I myself maintain a long position in the April 2027 notes. As I write this, the ask yield on these notes is 11.615 although it was north of 13  when I purchased them. I intend to hold these notes until maturity or until they are called.Generally, as I pointed out in my prior article, spreads on all of Transocean's traded debt are narrowing, implying a reduced likelihood of financial distress. Here is, for example, the chart for the November 2025 senior notesDoes 279 bps  latest data point  look to you like distressed debt  I don't think so. Check out Carvana  if you don't believe me. For me, the upgrade from the unflattering  CCC  rating is no longer a question of  if  but of  when.Transocean's management has now said that the convertible bondholders are looking into exercising their options. This means we may exit Q3 with a little more than 900 million outstanding shares, up from the current 766 million.I think the long-term effect on the equity may end being a wash. First, some of this should already be priced in. Second, we are talking about 5 to 10  changes in the intrinsic value of the shares which is much less than the fundamental uncertainty over what RIG's drillships will be worth a few years out.What should be clear, though, is that if the conversion happens, the non-convertible debt will be further de-risked, especially the junior notes that currently rank lower than the convertibles.

Cenovus Energy: This Variable Can Turbocharge The E&P Rally,"Seasoned energy investors have been beaten up so many times that optimism can be hard to muster. But that doesn t mean we shouldn t consider some unusually bullish cases for our equities. E Ps, in particular, could undergo a multiple re-rating that pushes theirA quick comparison of Surge Energy s ,  stock market valuation today vs. 2014 shows that valuation multiples are on entirely different planets. Consider that in 2014, Surge traded at a 6.93  free cash flow yield and a 7.45 multiple of enterprise value to funds from operations.Today, Surge trades at a massive 22.12  free cash flow yield at  80 per barrel WTI and a lowly 3.34 multiple of enterprise value to funds from operations.In Surge s case, applying the 7.45 EV FFO multiple from 2014 would put its Canadian-listed shares at  26.13. CompareHere s a similar chart for another Canadian small-cap E P, Bonterra Energy .Bonterra s stock is selling at a particularly steep discount due to the risk stemming from its high debt load. But a re-rate back to its 2014 multiple would send Bonterra s stock from today s  7.48 all the way to  32.61, representing appreciation of a whopping 336 .The upshot of the valuation gap that exists between today and the more bullish times in the past is that if investor attitudes towards E Ps shift in a positive direction, the room for multiple expansion is enormous. Moreover, today s higher oil prices mean that a slide in the opposite direction to a lower rating is not likely.The situation illustrated with Surge applies to most small-cap Canadian E Ps. The situation also applies to large caps, though to a lesser degree, as high-quality large-cap Canadian E Ps currently trade at a much higher multiple than small caps. Cenovus Energy , for instance, trades at a 6.05 EV FFO multiple at  80 per barrel WTI versus Surge s 3.34. Still, CVE possesses a substantial valuation discount relative to its 2014 level. Back then, CVE shares traded at an 8.06 EV FFO multiple and a paltry 2.04  free cash flow yield. At  80 per barrel WTI today, its 2014 EV FFO multiple would send its Canadian listed shares from today s  27.86 to  44.42, a 59  return. While the return isn t on par with Surge and other smaller Canadian E Ps, it s not shabby by any means.We can t know exactly what event would bring about a multiple re-rating for oil and gas E Ps. A severe global oil supply outage might do the trick. Or perhaps a shift by investors away from the renewables craze would catalyze a re-rate. It appears we re already heading in that direction, given the recent news surrounding wind project failures and mounting opposition to new projects from local residents. The electric power emergency unfolding in Texas is also helping to turn popular sentiment against renewables, as the large-scale replacement of coal power plants with wind and solar power installations caused the crisis. When the last bona fide emergency occurred during Winter Storm Uri, renewables proponents blamed rolling outages on natural gas, from freeze-offs and the like. It s going to be much more difficult to blame gas this time around in the summer.In any event, serious cracks in the renewables façade have begun to form, and we believe the push to electrify everything will abate once the true costs financial and otherwise are understood. As it does, we anticipate a newfound appreciation that oil and gas is here to stay and equity investment in the sector is necessary for ensuring its long-term vitality. In our view, this is the most likely trigger for a multiple re-rating for E Ps.Even if a multiple re-rating fails to materialize, improving fundamentals amid higher oil prices should push our favored E P stocks higher. The shares of Cenovus, Surge, Suncor Energy , MEG Energy , Canadian Natural Resources , and Cardinal Energy  are all likely to benefit from higher oil prices alone. Still, the optionality of tremendous upside from a meaningful multiple re-rating can t be ignored. Grizzled oil and gas veterans like ourselves aren t banking on a bonanza, but we re well attuned to the possibility that it could happen. As long as the possibility exists, we recommend that energy income investors maintain at least a small exposure to income-producing E P stocks in the event it comes to pass.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation.

The distribution is well-protected from inflation and is likely to continue to increase annually due to growth, a modest 72  free cash flow payout ratio, and EPD's conservative balance sheet. Overall, the company's financial strength is unmatched in the midstream sector.EPD also repurchased 3.6 million units in the first half at an average price of  25.56 per unit. We'd like to see the company step up its repurchases, but management continues to prefer returning capital to unitholders through distributions.Management reported that the business environment remains favorable. EPD's throughput volumes are dependent on Permian crude oil and natural gas production. The production is gathered by EPD's gathering and processing system. The gathered volumes are transported to its Gulf Coast complex on EPD's long-haul pipelines and others, where it fractionates, exports, and otherwise markets its products.The outlook for Permian production remains strong for years, particularly for natural gas and NGLs. The production growth will translate into higher volumes for EPD's downstream activities. Its sprawling system also opens opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions and complimentary growth projects.From an operational perspective, there are few risks to shareholders due to EPD's strong growth momentum. The most obvious risk for unitholders stems from the fact that the bigger EPD grows, the more its volumes reflect macro U.S. trends. However, the company has used its scale and integration to achieve high margins and high return on capital, and we don't expect that to change. Volumes, margins, returns, and growth should be sustainable as long as the U.S. is growing its oil and natural gas production. Once these slow, EPD will be able to act as a consolidator due to its low leverage profile. At 3.0 times and probably falling from there, its leverage ratio is among the lowest in the midstream sector.EPD's discount to intrinsic value further insulates unitholders from risks. EPD has one of the best long-term growth track records in midstream, but the units on a price basis trade 10  below the price from five years ago. The multiple contraction that occurred can't go on forever. Absent a multiple re-rate, we expect continued increases in free cash flow to boost the distribution yield and unit price.Our EV EBITDA valuation assumes 3.5  Adjusted EBITDA and distribution growth through 2027, which we believe are conservative. Using a 9.5 times multiple, the units are worth  27.55 in 2023, which implies 5.9  upside from the current price of  26.50. The units have 56.5  total return upside through 2027.Our discounted cash flow scenario assumes free cash flow increases annually by 3.5  until 2027 and then stays flat through 2032. It values the units at  30.84, which implies 16  upside.We believe both of these scenarios are conservative, and that distribution growth and potentially a multiple re-rate that reflects EPD's strong competitive position and return on capital can drive the units significantly higher over the next few years.EPD remains the best set-it-and-forget-it equity in midstream and arguably in the entire energy sector. We believe they should be part of every equity income portfolio for their distribution safety, inflation protection, and long-term distribution growth prospects. Unitholders can rest assured that their interests are aligned with its board of directors and management, which as a group own 32.7  of EPD units outstanding. Overall, there's little not to like for investors who prize distribution safety and growth.

The Massive Increase In U.S. Energy Production And Its Consequences For Investors,"There are macroeconomic forces at play in energy that have influenced our stock selection in the sector. There has been a shift for the U.S. from being a net consumer of energy to a net producer. ThisWe've already benefited greatly from a pickup in merger   acquisition activity in the sector with   and   being acquired. There will be more similar opportunities in the future. For now, let's take a look at the macro tailwinds driving the U.S. energy sector.In the past 15 years, U.S. energy production has skyrocketed. Since 2007, we have gone from being a massive oil importer to becoming an oil exporter. We have increased naturalBut today   we don't hear much about this from politicians or in the media. It may be that, with today's political alignment, the Democrats are probably embarrassed by the fact that fossil fuel production grew enormously during the Obama and Biden administrations   and, for other reasons, the Republicans may not be interested in calling attention to that fact.This article deals with the general effects of this development. Subsequent articles in this series will deal with a more detailed analysis of these topicsThe table below compares energy production in the United States in 2007 and 2022. Nuclear and hydro have been left out because they have not varied significantly over this time period.There has been a major decline in coal production, but it has been more than offset by the increases in other energy sources. On a Quadrillion BTU basis, the decline in coal production has been roughly 11.458  while the increases in petroleum, natural gas, solar, and wind production have been respectively 13.969, 17.320, 3.504, and 1.814 for a total net increase of 25.149 Quadrillion BTUs or roughly one-fourth of our total annual energy consumption. This has not been a demand-driven increase in production. During these same 15 years, the annual energy consumption in the U.S. has stayed roughly equal, actually declining slightly from 100.9 Quads to 100.3 Quads. There has been a major shift in the electricity industry from coal to natural gas and renewables. But an equally important shift has been that the U.S. is no longer an energy importer and, in fact, exports petroleum  on a net basis , natural gas, and coal.Back in 2007, the massive U.S. oil imports were adding to our trade deficit which, in turn, was heavily impacted by increases in oil prices. Heading into the Panic of 2008, oil prices briefly reached  145 a barrel and were projected by some pundits to reach  200 a barrel. When you are importing more than 10 million barrels a day,  200 a barrel means more than  700 billion per year in the balance of payments deficits. This has all sorts of potential effects on exchange rates, confidence in our economy, and economic growth.There is a debate as to the impact of higher oil prices on the economy. Some economists suggest that higher oil prices operated as a kind of  choke chain  on the economy so that economic growth led to increased demand for oil, which in turn produced higher prices leading to inflation and thus inducing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates which, in turn, produced a recession. An argument can be made that the recessions of 1973, 1979, 1990, and even 2008 all seemed to appear in the wake of sharp oil price increases. There is no doubt that higher oil prices had the effect of taking money out of the pockets of middle-income  and other  Americans who had to pay more money for gasoline.While the Panic of 2008 was caused by the failure of unconventional mortgages and the securities that were based upon them, the fact that its timing was coincident with a spike in oil prices may not be accidental. Higher gasoline prices would hit middle and lower-middle-income Americans especially hard. Many of the troublesome mortgages were issued based on real estate in the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, and residents of those areas would be expected to have longer than average commutes and spend higher than average amounts of take-home pay on gasoline. The drain created by gasoline price increases may have increased the number of residents who defaulted on the mortgages that backed the securities whose failure led to the Panic.Now that we are no longer major importers of oil, it is still possible for world oil prices to increase and for that to increase U.S. gasoline prices. But there is an important difference. In 2007, the money being spent to buy more expensive imported oil was going overseas and, in some cases, was not easily recycled into the U.S. economy. If we had a major price increase today  as we had in 2022 , the money would stay in the U.S. economy and go to higher royalty payments, higher tax collections in oil-producing states and localities, increased CAPEX by oil producers, and increased dividend payments to owners of U.S. oil companies. This immediate recycling of funds within the U.S. economy may have the effect of reducing the negative impact of higher oil prices on growth and reducing the danger of a deep recession. This may be a factor  although certainly not the only factor  in the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy in the current cycle.It should be noted that the U.S. economy can still be impacted by a cutoff in oil imports or a massive increase in the world oil price. While we are net exporters, the petroleum market is complex, and we still import crude and export refined products. Refineries are generally set up to refine certain types of crude, and transportation economics often leads to imports in one part of the country and exports in another part. Due to this complexity, an abrupt cessation of oil imports would be disruptive, and it would take time and expense to adjust. But the degree of disruption would pale in comparison with the impact we would have suffered in 2007.Now that the U.S. is actually a net exporter of energy rather than an importer, an increase in energy prices will tend to reduce the U.S. trade deficit rather than increase it. This would tend to strengthen the dollar. Most of our trading partners are actually net importers, so their currencies may be negatively impacted by higher oil prices. The net effect in the long term may be a stronger dollar which tends to reduce inflationary pressures.The fact that the dollar is not likely to be negatively affected by the rollercoaster of oil prices, although competing major currencies  the euro or the yuan  may suffer negative effects, is likely to cement the dollar in place as the global reserve currency.The fact that we are no longer dependent upon oil imports will likely enhance our national security. In the 20th century, oil was a major factor in the cause and the course of World War 2. Our oil independence may give us more leverage in confronting various oil-exporting countries  including Russia . The Strategic Petroleum Reserve   originally set up to ensure that our military would have access to oil in the event of a cutoff of imports   now does not really need to serve that purpose. Instead, it can be used to cushion the market from price fluctuations and also to generate profits simply by buying at low prices and selling at high prices. The Biden Administration seems to have adopted this policy.As noted above, the petroleum market is complex, and we should take measures to protect ourselves against the disruption that an abrupt cut-off would entail. It is also the case that many of our allies are net importers, and we would try to help cushion the impact upon them by increasing our exports if their imports were disrupted. But   again   the impact of an import disruption upon us from a national security perspective today would be sharply reduced from the impact we would have suffered in 2007.The above factors lead to certain conclusions from the perspective of investment. They definitely make investment in the U.S. more attractive than investment in markets which would be subject to severe impact from higher oil prices or an oil import disruption. The enhanced resilience of the dollar makes investment in dollar-denominated assets comparatively attractive.The U.S. energy sector also becomes more interesting because of its ability to serve as a source of exports to our allies  especially in the natural gas-oriented sector, certain names should command investor attention.

Why TC Energy Is A Better Buy Than Enbridge,"When we first saw the news that Enbridge Inc.  would acquire Dominion Energy's  utility assets, which we discussed On closer inspection, our analysis shows that ENB won't benefit from a split into standalone liquids and non-liquids companies. In fact, it could cause the company to lose some of the valuation premium it enjoys from its stability and diversification. ENB'sOver the past year, TRP's shares sank as investors grew concerned about the company's high leverage, lack of progress in deleveraging, and a series of operational setbacks that included massive cost overruns in its Coastal GasLink project and an oil spill from its Keystone Pipeline. TRP's selloff caused its shares to trade significantly below our price target.On the evening of July 28, the company  that it would sell its Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf assets for  5.2 billion. Investors were disappointed by the low 10.5x EBITDA multiple that the Columbia assets fetched. The next day, TRP's share price fell as much as 7.6 , to a 10.1x EV EBITDA multiple, the lowest market valuation since 2005 and well below the shares' long-term average multiple of 12.0x, as shown in the chart below.As TRP shares sunk to historic lows, their long-term investment proposition became more attractive. A simple reversion of their trading multiple back to its historical average would spur a significant increase in the share price.To get there, the company would have to show progress deleveraging and improving its operational track record. We believed that both were likely over the coming quarters. However, the spinoff announcement, which was made the same day as the Columbia asset sale was announced, added an interesting wrinkle to the TRP investment proposition. By separating its liquids segment from the rest of its business-which operates primarily in natural gas pipelines and utilities-TRP could eliminate a segment that acted as a drag on its stock's trading multiple. Liquids-focused long-haul pipeline businesses trade at EV EBITDA multiples below 10.0x. By contrast, a pure-play natural gas and utilities business would trade in line with publicly-listed peers at an EV EBITDA multiple greater than 11.5x, well in excess of TRP's 10.1x. Moreover, the two new standalone entities could benefit from greater operational focus and from management teams that are more strongly incentivized to expand in their respective markets.Today, TRP shares trade at a 10.5x EV EBITDA multiple. As such, they still offer significant upside if their multiple re-rates to 11.5x or above.If TRP can complete its Coastal GasLink project, generate strong operating and financial results as it did in the second quarter, and reduce leverage through a combination of EBITDA growth, asset sales, and or paring back growth capex, we believe its multiple can revert back to its former highs. The spinoff makes such an outcome more likely because TRP will have jettisoned its low-multiple, low-growth-but high-profile-liquids assets. The remaining assets will garner a much higher multiple.The following figures shed some light on the impact of TRP's planned business separation for current shareholders. An Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by segment for 2023 and 2024 is shown below.If we apply the appropriate EV EBITDA multiples to these Adjusted EBITDA estimates, we get the following values for TRP's separate liquids and non-liquids businesses.At low EV EBITDA valuation multiples, we estimate the separated entities are worth  55.54 per TRP share, whereas at high multiples, their value increases to  65.72. These prices imply 12.7  and 33.3  upside from TRP's current share price of  49.30.The high-value scenario is consistent with a 14.5x P E ratio. In the years before 2023, TRP's shares traded in a P E range of 14x to 20x.In contrast with TRP, we estimate that ENB shares have less upside in a separation scenario. If ENB's management acquired the Dominion utility assets in the hope of securing a permanently higher multiple after a split of the business, we think they're likely to be disappointed.The underwhelming result for ENB shareholders amid a business split is the same whether we consider ENB's value from the perspective of EV EBITDA or distributable cash flow.An EV EBITDA valuation implies 4.4  upside from the current price of  46.40.A distributable cash flow  DCF  valuation implies little upside based on ENB's capacity to pay a common dividend. If we factor growth capex into the equation, the income prospects for ENB shareholders are essentially the same as they are today.Between 2017 and 2022, ENB's annual average EV  EBITDA multiple fluctuated between 11.8x and 16.7x despite its heavy liquids weighting. The historical multiple is significantly higher than the North American midstream average, indicating that investors were willing to pay a premium for the business. A separated entity could see the shares lose any premium valuation, particularly the standalone liquids business.TRP offers greater upside potential than ENB because, first, its current EV EBITDA multiple of 10.5x is much lower than both its historical average and that of its natural gas-weighted peers. ENB shares trade at a 10.9x multiple, which is higher than liquids-weighted midstream businesses and more closely in line with natural gas-weighted operators.The second reason why TRP offers greater upside potential is that it generates a significantly higher return on capital employed  ROCE  and return on equity  ROE  than ENB. In fact, ENB's ROIC and ROE are so low that we don't see a good reason for its shares to trade at a premium multiple.Note that for TRP, the Keystone XL permit cancellation and Coastal GasLink cost overruns resulted in  6.3 billion of impairment charges in 2021 and 2022. The charges dramatically reduced net income in those years and were the main culprit behind the company's low ROCE and ROE. If we exclude those charges in the calculation of net income, TRP's ROCE in 2021 and 2022 increases to 9.58  and 10.03 , respectively, while its ROE increases to 14.50  and 12.70 . We don't mean to downplay the shareholder value destroyed during those years, but as long-term shareholders, we recognize that the adjusted figures are more representative of future returns.A reversion to historically normal returns on capital will be another factor that will benefit TRP's trading multiple. It may take a few quarters to get there, but in the meantime, we're comfortable with our  54 price target and the 9.5  upside it implies from today's share price.If TRP's management can execute over the coming quarters-and we expect that it will-its share price will benefit from lower leverage, a high return on capital, and a separation into standalone liquids and non-liquids entities. ENB shares, meanwhile, have roughly equal income generation potential as TRP's but have significantly lower appreciation potential due to their higher trading multiple and the company's lower return on assets. Even if ENB decides to split into two standalone entities, its shares aren't likely to benefit.For this reason, TRP is a better buy than ENB. We maintain our  54 price target and Buy rating on TRP shares. Once management demonstrates progress toward its stated goals, such as lower leverage and a completed Coastal GasLink pipeline, we'll consider increasing our price target to a level more closely in line with our EV EBITDA valuations sketched above.Given the high probability of improvement over the next few quarters and a clear catalyst for a higher share price, TRP equity is a very good choice for conservative investors who seek both income and capital appreciation over the long term. Today's low-multiple share price represents an outstanding buying opportunity.HFIR Research is a full-time professional energy investor, active in the sector since 2015 while specializing in deep value opportunities and special situations.

The Beginning Of The End Part III: Green Energy Realities," Economies and their growth are fundamentally reliant on energy. Without it, economic growth would simply not be possible. Energy serves as a pivotal input in the production of goods, the cultivation of food, the transportation of these goods, and nearlyOver time, technological advancements have empowered humanity to devise more efficient means of generating energy. This progression has spanned from human and animal power, to biomass and fire, wood to coal, coal to oil, and now to renewables.These shifts in energy sources mark significant junctures in history, reconfiguring societies, economies, and the environment. They represent substantial changes in the primary outlets of energy harnessed for diverse purposes. Two notable transitions in the history of energy sources include the move from wood to coal, and subsequently from coal to oil. These transitions not only transformed societalWe stand at yet another pivotal moment, and I anticipate that the consequences will be nearly as significant. During this phase, we're witnessing the initial steps towards replacing a longstanding and reliable energy source that our modern economy relies on with another. As I've outlined in my previous articles, such a transition is highly unlikely to be smooth in nature. History has demonstrated that it often leads to more frequent booms and busts, heightened inflationary pressures, and economic volatility.For millennia, wood was the dominant energy source, employed for cooking, heating, and illumination. However, the 18th century saw a decline in wood supplies due to population growth and extensive forest clearing for agriculture and industry. The advent of the steam engine marked a pivotal stride in transitioning from wood to coal. James Watt's enhancements to the steam engine, alongside the ensuing Industrial Revolution, expedited this shift. Coal-fired steam engines fueled factories, railways for goods transportation, and the production of iron and steel.Coal emerged as a viable alternative to wood in the late 18th century. Coal boasts higher energy density compared to wood, meaning it yields more energy per unit volume. Additionally, coal is more easily transported and stored than wood. This transition, which of course helped to propel the Industrial Revolution forward and led to significant advancements, was also marked by major economic turbulence and societal dislocations.In the early 20th century, oil began to challenge coal's dominance. Oil stands as a more versatile fuel than coal, capable of being transported and refined into various products, including gasoline, diesel, and heating oil.The transition to oil gained momentum with the invention of the combustion engine, which helped to increase the demand for oil and refined products. Oil-powered vehicles proved more efficient and adaptable than coal-fired power plants. The discovery of extensive oil reserves in the 19th and 20th centuries, starting in regions like Pennsylvania, Texas, the Middle East, and Russia, supplied the fuel that has driven modern industry and our contemporary high-tech world for the last 70-80 years.These energy transitions brought about both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, they enhanced the quality of life for much of the global population. For instance, coal-fired stoves and furnaces provided more reliable heating compared to wood-burning alternatives. Oil-powered vehicles offered more convenient and efficient transportation.However, these transitions also gave rise to environmental issues such as increased air and water pollution, health concerns, and, as we see today, calls for radical changes to the regulation of industry.Energy transitions have emerged as pivotal historical moments, shaping our societies, economies, and environments. These shifts are marked by changes in the primary energy sources that power our world. From early wood burning for warmth to the coal-fueled Industrial Revolution, and the subsequent dominance of oil in the 20th and 21st centuries, each transition has wielded profound impacts.It is crucial to grasp that energy transitions are not swift processes. The transition from wood to coal spanned the 18th and 19th centuries, covering approximately 200-300 years. The shift from coal to oil took place over about 50-70 years. These transitions were characterized by phases of gradual adoption followed by periods of accelerated change, especially during peak industrialization.The contemporary transition is presenting unique challenges. It is primarily driven by climate scientists and environmentalists warning of widespread catastrophe if society does not swiftly transition away from fossil fuels within the next decade. This presents significant difficulties and physical limitations, both practically and economically.One significant challenge in achieving a swift transition away from fossil fuels lies in the fact that approximately three-quarters of the global population, encompassing regions like China, India, Africa, and South America, are actively expanding their reliance on fossil fuels rather than phasing them out. While Western industrialized nations are rapidly moving away from conventional, steady sources of power such as nuclear, coal, and gas-fired plants, China and India are in the midst of a substantial upswing in constructing these facilities at staggering rates.As of September 2023, China is currently in the process of constructing 95 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, a capacity . India, on the other hand, is working on 27 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, with an additional 24 gigawatts in pre-construction stages. While China and India are actively industrializing and enhancing their energy portfolios to provide affordable energy for their economies and citizens, Western nations are decommissioning coal-fired plants, which played a pivotal role in supplying electricity throughout the 20th century. Since 1990, the reliance on coal as a primary energy source has dwindled from 22.7  to 9.8  today. This percentage is projected to decrease further, with more coal plants slated for closure and replacement by wind and solar alternatives. This shift is predominantly driven by environmental considerations in the Western world, but it also entails significant trade-offs that are not currently factored into climate models, a point we will delve into later.China and India are also at the forefront of constructing state-of-the-art nuclear power plants, while the US and other Western nations have been progressively decommissioning and downsizing their nuclear power capacity over the past few decades. In 2023, the US has reduced its nuclear plants from a peak of 112 in 1992 to 92. In stark contrast, China boasts 55 operational plants with an additional 21 under construction, while India has 22 active plants and another 8 in various stages of construction. Both China and India are leading the charge in nuclear power generation. These nations are adopting a diversified approach in expanding their power and electricity grids, incorporating nuclear, coal, natural gas, and renewables.Unfortunately, the US and Europe are pursuing a curious and almost unthinkable objective of transitioning away from easily scalable baseload sources of power to intermittent energy sources that wholly depend on the weather and favorable climates of certain regions.The challenge facing the US lies in the absence of a well-structured energy transition plan. Instead, the shift towards green energy is marked by disjointed policies at both the Federal and state levels. Many of these policies are implemented through legislation or executive orders, often lacking thorough planning or grounding in engineering and scientific principles. Consequently, new mandates are being issued, resulting in the closure of nuclear, coal, and gas plants, and their replacement with less reliable wind and solar sources.A notable case is California, which exemplifies the consequences of energy transitions driven by political considerations rather than sound science, engineering, and physics. The state shuttered the San Onofre nuclear plant in 2013, with Diablo Canyon set to follow suit in 2030. The Mohave coal plant was closed in 2005. The retirement of the Redondo Beach and Huntington Beach natural gas plants, to pave the way for a transition away from natural gas in favor of wind and solar, has led to an increase in blackouts and brownouts. During the summer heatwave of 2022, the governor urged residents not to charge their electric vehicles during peak hours from 9 AM to 9 PM. The state's electrical grid is ill-equipped to meet its mandates of phasing out diesel trucks and gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030 and 2035.Not only is California's power grid becoming less reliable, but it is also driving up electricity costs. In July 2023, the average monthly residential electricity bill in California was  164, which is more than 22  higher than the national average of  134. California boasts some of the highest utility rates and gasoline prices in the country, with some areas already seeing prices surpass  6 per gallon and many even exceeding  7.The governor and state legislature have passed over 800 energy bills, compelling 5,000 companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks. As these green initiatives and mandates proliferate, the cost of electricity and gasoline is bound to become increasingly burdensome for residents. Rather than reevaluating their energy policies, the state is taking major oil companies to court, attributing rains, mudslides, and forest fires to climate change caused by the oil industry.Moreover, the state government is unwilling to address its own policies that hinder controlled burns for forest debris clearance, adequate water storage provisions, and erosion control. This, in turn, undermines the effectiveness of the state's green policies in delivering affordable and reliable energy, ultimately driving up costs for both industry and consumers. The state's plan to phase out diesel trucks and gasoline engines by 2030 and 2035, if adopted at the Federal level by the Biden Administration, could result in a significant loss of American auto jobs, as the majority of the supply chain for electric vehicles is controlled by China. This is a central concern in the UAW strike, as EVs threaten to phase out numerous auto jobs in the US.Apart from issues of unreliability and intermittency, there are four key problems with the current implementation of green energyLet s begin with scale. Chris Martenson's analysis in his latest book update to the  provides a compelling perspective on what would be necessary to replace fossil fuels. Here are some key considerationsGiven these colossal numbers, it's evident that a single-minded pursuit of renewables is unachievable. This is why countries like China and India are strategically ramping up their domestic energy capacity across all fronts. They get it, we don tWhen it comes to resource intensity our second point above there is a widespread misconception that using renewable sources of energy like wind and solar leads to a conservation of earth s resources. This is a far departure from reality. On the contrary,  green  energy demands a vast amount of mining of raw materials and critical metals. In a monumental study, Professor Simon Michaux, Senior Researcher for the Geological Survey of Finland, estimated that a total of 4.5 billion tons of key metals, encompassing copper, zinc, silver, cobalt, lithium, vanadium, and nickel, would be needed for transitioning away from fossil fuels.To put this into perspective, consider the amount of key minerals required to build a Tesla SSimilarly, for windmills and solar panels, vast quantities of steel, fiberglass, copper, aluminum, and rare earth metals are essential components.Minerals used in building a windmillMinerals used to build a solar panelMoreover, the high-tech devices we use daily, such as iPhones and iPads, also require a significant amount of resources and metals for their production. For instance, a single iPhone contains about 32.5 grams of things like gold, silver, and platinum, while an iPad Pro has approximately 67.5 grams.According to a , here are the estimated amounts of minerals in kilograms required to manufacture specific devicesAs demonstrated above, our modern technological world relies heavily on a diverse array of minerals, encompassing rare earth elements  REEs , precious metals, base metals, as well as materials like glass, lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel.Professor Micheaux's research underscores a critical concern  the current mining efforts, and those in the process of ramping up, are insufficient to support the envisioned green transition.The third challenge to a rapid and large-scale transition away from fossil fuels is, ironically, fossil fuels themselves. One inconvenient fact of green energy is that it depends on cheap and abundant sources of oil.As we just pointed out, the manufacturing of wind and solar requires vast amounts of raw materials such as steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, and rare earth elements, all of which require energy to extract and process. Electric vehicles in particular necessitate six times the mineral volume compared to conventional gasoline or diesel engines.Yes, an EV doesn t directly run on gas but it indirectly requires a large amount of cheap energy in the form of coal, oil, and diesel in order to make one.Graphite, for example, is the largest mineral by weight required for an electric vehicle. However, processing graphite is an energy-intensive process and is done so primarily in China using cheap coal-based power. Electric vehicles are far more expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles, however, their price is already highly dependent on cheap fossil fuels.Mining operations overall rely heavily on robust earth-moving machinery, including excavators, loaders, trucks, dozers, graders, and crushers, all of which run on diesel fuel. At present, it simply isn t practical for a large-scale replacement of diesel-powered machines with electric batteries given the large charging times and higher costs.But this is overlooking a much more powerful point  Oil itself stands as a cornerstone of the global economy, fueling 95  of all transportation worldwide. Virtually every product we purchase today, from groceries to household goods, relies on trucks, ships, planes, and trains for distribution the vast majority of which run on fossil fuels.The majority of our current oil consumption is sourced from 500 major oil fields discovered over half a century ago, constituting 75  of conventional oil reserves  I covered the giant oil fields and their depletion in a previous article, . However, these fields are approaching depletion. The remaining reserves primarily consist of heavy oils  as seen in Venezuela  or unconventional  tight  or  fracked  oil.Over the past decade, American shale has been the driving force behind 83  of global oil growth. However, these shale fields, spanning from the Marcellus to Eagle Ford and culminating in the Permian, are now approaching their peak. The Permian Basin, the final major shale basin, is projected to reach its peak production by the end of this year or the next. The latest reports from the EIA reveal a consistent decline in production in the Permian over the past three months, signaling our proximity to this peak.The IEA, in what I view as an optimistic scenario, considers factors like greater efficiencies and widespread adoption of alternative fuels. This outlook suggests that with concerted efforts, we could facilitate a successful transition to greener energy sources. The primary emphasis is on discovering new fields to replace those reaching their peak, a challenge given the global depletion rate of 8  per year on most oil fields. Unfortunately, new oil discoveries have dwindled over the past decade, with the remaining reservoirs often situated in demanding environments like oil sands, deep-sea reserves, or the Arctic. Shale oil has been the stalwart that saved us over the last decade, driving global oil production growth. As Goehring and Rozencwajg have repeatedly pointed out, just six counties in West Texas have been responsible for 100  of all global production growth, a trend now plateauing. The pressing question is  where will the new oil, essential for funding economic growth, come from  Shale wells face a daunting depletion rate of over 80  within a three-year span, necessitating ongoing drilling efforts to sustain production. As of September, the rig count is down by 11, and it's a decline of 134 rigs from a year ago.In addition to oil, the transition to a green economy demands substantial mineral resources, which, in turn, hinge on extensive mining endeavors. Diesel fuel is irreplaceable for mining operations due to its unparalleled energy density, particularly for the robust trucks tasked with transporting processed materials crucial for EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels. Consequently, diesel prices are poised to rise significantly.As highlighted in this and previous articles, oil discoveries have been declining by decade, as shown belowSource  Our Finite WorldThis decline has been exacerbated by a substantial drop in investment for exploration, a trend originating from the 2014 oil price downturn. Moreover, the administration's stance against fossil fuels is amplifying the costs and complexities associated with oil exploration and drilling. Foreseeably, oil prices are expected to remain in the triple-digit range for a significant portion of the coming decade, potentially further inflating the cost of mineral mining.The transition towards a green economy is further complicated by the fervent anti-fossil fuel stance advocated by environmental groups. There appears to be a dearth of critical thinking regarding the scientific and engineering requisites for mineral production to power a green economy. Despite the notable growth in renewable energy, it's crucial to acknowledge that energy consumption from fossil fuels has outpaced this growth. As indicated in the upcoming graph, energy consumption from fossil fuels has surged by 6.8 quadrillion BTUs from 1990 to 2022, almost doubling the demand seen for wind and solar.Source  Institute for Energy ResearchIt's imperative to recognize that the demand for fossil fuels persists for a reason they underpin the foundations of our technologically advanced economy. Without them, our present world would not be possible. Additionally, little has changed in our energy mix over the past three decades, except for a decline in coal and a rise in natural gas.To achieve Net-Zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, a reduction in fossil fuels' share of the primary energy mix by 62  to 0  by 2050 would be necessary. I will delve into why this scenario is unlikely to unfold and why green initiatives are poised to falter in the forthcoming installment of this series. In summary, the green transition is contingent on the use of cheap fossil fuels to extract and process the minerals essential for its realization. Current policies being pursued are poised to culminate in a major energy crisis and lead to an unfortunate reality check for much of the globe.Much like oil, the minerals requisite for building out the green economy are destined to become more expensive and face eventual decline in output a phenomenon commonly referred to as  Peak Minerals.  The ensuing series of graphs from  serves to illustrate the extensive mineral demand entailed in constructing clean energy.These visuals underscore that an electric vehicle necessitates six times the minerals for its production compared to a traditional gasoline engine. Moreover, in the realm of power generation, wind and solar technologies can require nearly ten times the volume of crucial minerals. In essence, we lack the mineral reserves needed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The shortage is compounded by insufficient mining resources, diminishing discoveries, lower ore grades as existing mines deplete, and a dearth of oil to fuel the mining of raw materials.As further exemplified in the previous graphs, clean energy is highly mineral-intensive, necessitating 6-10 times the mineral quantity for its production and implementation. According to the International Energy Agency  IEA , in their sustainable development scenario, demand for lithium is projected to surge by a factor of 42, graphite by 25-fold, cobalt by 21-fold, nickel by 19-fold, and rare earths by 7-fold. Meeting this escalating demand for metals will require a rise in metal demand from under 10 million metric tons to 42 metric tons by 2050. The pressing question is  where will the requisite metals be sourced to meet this demandA significant challenge facing the West is that these crucial metals are more geographically concentrated than oil production. While oil was distributed across the Middle East, Russia, and the United States, energy transition metals exhibit a more pronounced geographical concentration. China presently exerts dominance in the processing of the majority of these minerals, accounting for 40  of global copper production, 58  of lithium, 35  of nickel, 65  of cobalt, and a staggering 87  of rare earths.In line with a report from the Department of Defense titled  Securing Defense Critical Supply Chains,  China has assumed a pivotal role in the global advanced battery supply chain, claiming 94  of lithium production, alongside a significant share of other materials indispensable for the green transition. As electrification intensifies in order to meet the global elite's 2030 target date, dependence on China is slated to amplify through the remainder of this decade. This reliance raises significant concerns for the U.S. military, as we are reliant on Russia for our uranium, which fuels our nuclear aircraft carriers, submarines, and power plants, and on China for the computer chips that guide our missiles and power our high-tech economy.While the U.S. possesses access to many of these raw materials, mining companies are hindered from exploiting and processing them due to opposition from environmental groups and the Biden Administration's reluctance to open new mines. Instead of cultivating our own reservoirs of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, graphite, rare earths, oil, and natural gas, there is a preference to outsource the extraction of these resources to other nations, for fear of antagonizing influential environmental groups, which vehemently oppose all mining and fossil fuel drilling. The BANANA  Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody  Greens may have an affinity for their EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, iPhones, iPads, and iMacs, but they harbor a deep disdain for the economic systems and companies that produce them.It is imperative to underscore a few of the paramount resources necessary for driving the green energy transition. Let's commence with copper an average electric vehicle necessitates six times the copper compared to a gasoline engine. Furthermore, copper plays a pivotal role in constructing wind turbines and solar panels. Similar to oil, copper discoveries have been steadily decreasing by decade, with lower ore grades necessitating the processing of greater quantities of earth to yield a pound of copper. As evidenced by the graph from S P Global, copper discoveries have witnessed a precipitous decline over the past decade.According to S P, the copper discovered over the last 15 years amounts to a mere 143 metric tons. To put this in perspective, almost an equivalent amount of copper was discovered in a single year back in 1991. Even with fresh investments, copper discoveries are slated to reach a historic low for the remainder of this decade, unlikely to match the prime discovery decade of the 1990s. This decline in discoveries coincides with a surge in demand for the metal, expected to double in the near future.The next metal on the horizon to face a supply deficit is silver a metal with a multitude of applications, from electronics to solar panels. According to recent reports, China stands as one of the foremost global consumers of silver, with an annual demand averaging 6,300 tons. However, China's annual silver production barely reaches 3,350 tons, with reserves estimated at a mere 41,000 tons as of 2020. At the current pace of mining, China's reserves are projected to be depleted in another 11 years.Per the U.S. Geological Survey  USGS , global silver production reached 25,000 tons in 2020, with estimated reserves totaling 500,000 tons. Even more disconcerting is the situation in Mexico, which boasts the title of the world's largest producer of silver. Over the last decade, Mexico's average silver output has been 5,600 tons, with remaining reserves of 37,000 tons. At the current rate of extraction, the country's silver reserves are anticipated to be exhausted by the end of this decade. With silver reserves in China and Mexico facing depletion by the decade's end, the supply of silver could plummet by 15,450 tons, while demand is projected to exceed 30,000 tons.Source  GoldFixAnticipated demand for silver is set to surge over the remainder of this decade, spurred by requirements from green energy, high-tech industries, AI, 5G, clean power stations, EVs, medical technology, space stations, and smart appliances. Given the waning discoveries and reserves, where will this silver be sourced  The prevailing price of silver does not align with this reality, as its value has been suppressed through massive short positions on the Comex and London exchanges. The burgeoning demand is reflected in the premiums paid on sovereign silver coins by investors, which have ranged from 40  to 90  above the spot price of silver.As Guillaume Pitron chronicles in his two must-read books,  and , the digital revolution and green energy transition are highly intertwined. The technological convergence resulting from the integration of these new technologies exerts a multiplier effect on the consumption of metals that humanity relies upon. An aspect that often goes unacknowledged is the environmental toll of digitization and green energy. The extraction and processing of the needed metals for green energy is an inherently dirty process, but many countries are also unwilling to vastly increase the required mining efforts to make such a transition possible. Instead, the West has outsourced its renewable energy needs to countries with less stringent environmental standards, where metals are both mined and processed away from the public eye. Everyone loves clean energy, as long as it comes from somewhere else.In summation, the current energy transition necessitates a significant quantity of critical minerals, which are presently in short supply, anticipated to grow scarcer in the decade ahead, and ultimately poised to lead to resource scarcity and potential resource conflicts.In a forthcoming article, I will elucidate why the timetable for the green transition is likely to fall short, not only missing its target but, more crucially, propelling us toward a major energy crisis. You are already witnessing this in the soaring price of gasoline, elevated utility bills, increased food costs, and the inflationary impact of rising energy prices.Full transparency  we have vested interests in base metals, strategic metals, precious metals, uranium, oil, and natural gas.

Exxon Mobil: Earnings May Be Down But Oil Price-Adjusted ROCE Is The Highest In 15 Years,"Exxon Mobil  posted  that are down sequentially and year-on-yearThe bearish thesis is that the 2022 results were an anomaly sparked off by the geopolitical worries. As oil prices have receded from theThese arguments miss the point. Exxon doesn't control the oil price and earnings will always vary with the commodity. Rather, Exxon's job is to allocate capital among competing assets and maximize its capital returns for any given commodity price realization.When adjusted for the oil price, Exxon's return on capital employed  or ROCE  for 2022-2023 is superior to more than a decade of prior returns. XOM's ROCE to oil price relationship is now more consistent with the late 1990s early 2000s which was a better period forFor this reason, the past several quarters shouldn't be dismissed as a fluke. I believe we are seeing a transformational change that will result in structurally higher capital returns for Exxon over the coming years. From this perspective, stock price comparisons to the 2010s should consider the vastly improved ROCE too.ROCE is a standard way to  value creation in the energy industryThe numerator is net operating profit after taxes, i.e., excluding interest to account for different capital structures. The denominator reflects the total assets of the business, net of current liabilities which can be seen as a non-interest bearing source of financing.Going back to Exxon, I summarize below 30 years of annualized quarterly ROCE data, from 1994 to 2023, plotted against the inflation-adjusted Brent price  for the respective quartersI have highlighted two time periods that stand out as distinct 'clusters', 1994-2008  'pre-GFC'  and 2009-2021  'post-GFC' . Within both periods, there is a linear relationship between ROCE and the oil price. However, for the post-GFC period, ROCE is about 10  lower for the same oil price level.Energy expert  has talked about a 'high' ROCE period from 1991 to 2006, followed by a 'low' ROCE period between 2006-2020. Paradoxically, as Murti notes, most of the low-ROCE period had higher oil prices, at least until 2014, but the returns on capital were nonetheless still poor.One explanation, favored by Murti, is that ROCE is inversely related to investment and the low-ROCE period was characterized by chronic over-investment. However, I think there is more nuance to the story.People forget this, but a few decades ago, Exxon and Chevron , along with the other majors, were valued not just for their oil reserves but also for their know-how. Back then oil-rich foreign countries were perhaps not as technologically sophisticated, so working with the majors offered the best way to unlock the value of their reserves.However, sometime in the 2000s, national oil companies  or NOCs  started displacing the majors as  from 2012Further, Bain noted at the time that NOCs were  becoming increasingly comfortable and adept at procuring human and technical resources from oilfield services companies, which have grown dramatically in size and capability.  In other words, if you are an NOC, why not cut out the middleman and work directly with a Schlumberger  or a Halliburton This dynamic is part of the reason why I am  on the oilfield services component of the energy sector, but with regard to Exxon or Chevron one could also see the post-GFC overinvestment as driven by necessity as much as by greed. If NOCs chose to develop the highest ROI assets by themselves, that logically leaves the lower return prospects for the majors.The good news, going back to the ROCE scatterplot, is that the oil price-adjusted 2022-2023 numbers are moving back to the 1994-2008 'high ROCE' trendline. For five of the past six quarters, ROCE has been much higher than in the 2009-2021 period, when the inflation-adjusted Brent price was similar.This says to me that we are seeing a structural change, which I would attribute to the cost-cutting and optimization efforts that were spurred by the 2020 low-point. Investment has also been lower and perhaps better placed strategically. This bodes well for the future because if the 2020s ROCE exceeds the returns from the 2010s, Exxon's stock price should also be positioned for higher highs than in the prior decade.The ROCE trend I describe mostly applies to the other majors too, but I would note that Exxon has opened a bit of a gap over Chevron and Shell For most of the last two decades, the majors generated consistent ROCE, but Exxon has led Chevron and Shell by about 5  over the latest quarters. Interestingly, Exxon also had an advantage during 2006-2008.An investment in Exxon shouldn't be treated as an outright bet on oil prices. Exxon's function is to maximize the return it generates on its capital for any pricing environment. When adjusting for the oil price, there is evidence that, after a decade of generally mediocre ROCE, Exxon is now generating higher returns consistent with the 1990s 2000s period. If the ROCE trend continues, I would expect Exxon's stock price to reach new all-time highs too.Over the last month we have also seen some signs that energy is turning again from a market laggard into a leaderHowever, it is noteworthy that oilfield services  are outperforming the broader energy sector. I am very bullish on Exxon, but I am even more bullish on the services sector, given that much of the current capex expansion is being fueled by NOCs.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

NextEra Energy: Upgrading To Strong Buy,"Mr. Market, at times, can be irrational. This is not a bad outcome by any stretch of the imagination unless you are a day trader trying to time the market. Every now and then, great companies are beaten down irrationally, presenting long-term-oriented investors with opportunities toWithout a good understanding of the challenges posed by high interest rates, investing in NextEra is nothing short of a walk in the dark. A good place to start this analysis, therefore, is by evaluating how NextEra is affected by higher-for-longer interest rates.First, NextEra Energy, similar to any utilities company, takes on substantial amounts of debt to finance new infrastructure projects, and higher rates increase financing costs. Some of these new projects include building plants, upgrading distribution networks, and expanding into new renewable energy sources. For NextEra, higher rates will result in lower profit margins.Second, NextEra Energy is a favorite among income investors, and its dividend yield has become less attractive amid higher interest rates. Although its current dividend yield of 3.4  makes for good income, it is no longer as attractive as it used to be with the 10-year Treasury yield already surpassing 4.7 . Because NextEra is considered a dividend stock, persistently high rates are likely to hurt the company's valuation.Third, in a rising-rate environment, NextEra's profitability will hinge on its ability to convince regulators to adjust rates, and this reliance on regulatory decisions makes it a less attractive investment choice for long-term-oriented investors. Regulatory processes can also be lengthy and may not guarantee full recovery of higher interest expenses. This can put additional pressure on the company's financial performance.Fourth, higher interest rates can make certain capital projects less economically viable. Utilities often engage in long-term planning and capital budgeting for infrastructure investments. A significant increase in interest rates can lead to the reassessment or postponement of projects, which can affect growth and capacity expansion plans.With NextEra Energy now grappling with higher interest rates, Wall Street analysts are likely to adopt a more conservative approach to earnings projections. Right on cue, earnings estimates for the upcoming Fiscal year have been slashed nine times in the last three months compared to five upward revisions. Of late, we have seen a series of negative earnings revisions.With many analysts continuing to cast shadows over NextEra's short-term financial performance, I would not be surprised if consensus EPS estimates for the next couple of years see more negative revisions, deteriorating the investor sentiment toward the company further.With a good understanding of how rising interest rates adversely impact NextEra Energy, we can now move on to discuss the long-term outlook for the company.As an investor with an extensive investment time horizon, I am hardly bothered by short-term market fluctuations unless I am trying to take advantage of irrational volatility in the market. Although high interest rates will be a massive challenge for NextEra Energy in the next few quarters, I believe this challenge does not pose a permanent threat to the company's prospects. To evaluate what lies ahead for the company, we need to analyze the prospects for both the regulated utility business of the company  Florida Power   Light  and the renewable energy business  NextEra Energy Resources .FPL is expected to invest significantly in infrastructure, including solar generation, storm-hardening, and transmission, which should support a 9  rate of base growth according to the company. FPL has a well-established capital investment plan that provides clear visibility through 2025. This plan focuses on strategic investments in various areas, including renewable energy, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. FPL is actively investing in renewable energy as well, with a strong emphasis on solar power. The company has been adding solar generation capacity to its portfolio, and it has plans to continue doing so. Solar is considered a cost-effective and clean energy source that allows FPL to serve customer demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. FPL has placed a significant focus on solar investments, with plans to add thousands of megawatts of solar generation capacity through 2025. Solar investments not only support clean energy goals but also provide long-term cost stability and reduced reliance on volatile fuel costs.As illustrated below, in the second quarter, new investments drove EPS growth, highlighting the importance of these strategic investments.Population growth in Florida will be a key driver of the demand for electricity in the coming years, and FPL is well-positioned to serve this demand through conventional and renewable sources of energy. According to  from the Census Bureau, in 2022, Florida became the fastest-growing state for the first time since 1957 with population increasing by 1.9  to 22,244,823. Idaho was the fastest-growing state back in 2021.Recent energy consumption data in Florida shows an uptick in energy usage that coincides with the growing population in the state. Florida is the second-largest electricity producer in the nation behind Texas and is also the third-largest electricity consumer behind Texas and California. With the government aggressively promoting renewable energy sources, I believe FPL will have growth opportunities in both the old and new spectrum of energy for many years to come.Let us now turn to the renewable energy business.NextEra Energy Resources, the company's competitive energy business, is a leader in renewable energy. The company has secured desirable wind and solar generation sites with long-term contracts, giving it a competitive advantage in the renewable energy sector. The company is shifting its focus to solar and energy storage, which aligns with the growing demand for renewable energy. NextEra Renewable Energy has a strong track record of originating, developing, constructing, and operating renewable energy projects, which makes it a leading player in the global energy transition.The company is seeing solid demand for renewables and energy storage solutions. Despite challenges such as supply chain disruptions and trade policy risks, the company remains confident in its ability to meet this demand. The addition of new renewables and storage projects to the backlog supports the company's growth expectations. The company boasts a significant backlog of renewable energy and storage projects, totaling roughly 20 gigawatts. This backlog provides visibility into the company's future earnings growth potential through 2026. In the second quarter, the company added 1,665 MW of new renewables and storage to its backlog.NextEra, commendably, is expanding into green hydrogen as well. The company believes that hydrogen can be thought of as another renewables customer class, and it is advocating for a smart hydrogen policy to establish a robust green hydrogen market. This presents a potential avenue for future growth.In summary, NextEra Renewable Energy is well-positioned for continued growth in the renewable energy sector. Its strong backlog, focus on solar investments, and exploration of green hydrogen opportunities reflect a commitment to sustainability and long-term value creation.NextEra Energy, in recent times, has never been valued this cheap. In Mr. Market's defense, interest rates have hardly been this high in recent times as well, so an investor cannot come to a reasonable conclusion purely based on historical valuation levels. For this reason, I used a dividend discount model to estimate the intrinsic value of the company. The rationale behind using a DDM model for NextEra is simple  the company has a dividend growth track record of 27 years, and this growth has been fairly consistent.To allow me to have more wiggle room in my calculations, I prefer to use an adjusted dividend model whenever I use a DDM model to estimate the intrinsic value of a company. The first step in this process is to find the excess income retained by the company last year after accounting for the required retained income to fund future growth. Below is an illustration of my calculation of excess retained income per share.To find the adjusted dividend per share, we will now take the sum of excess retained income per share  1.76  and the actual dividend per share paid last year  1.76 , which comes to  3.52.Using a long-term growth rate of 5.5   5-year dividend growth rate is 11.13  and a cost of capital of 10 , the intrinsic value estimate for NextEra Energy comes to  82.57 per share, which implies an upside of just over 51  from the current market price.NextEra Energy is cheaply valued from an earnings multiple basis today, whether it be from a TTM P E basis or forward P E basis, and the findings of my DDM model confirm the undervalued status of the company. Because the estimated intrinsic value is substantially above the current market price, I feel comfortable investing in the company today even amid rising interest rates.NextEra Energy is finally feeling the wrath of persistently high interest rates. The company, unarguably, will find it difficult to grow in the next few quarters, but its long-term prospects remain intact aided by favorable macroeconomic expectations, demographic trends, and policy support. At the current valuation level, NextEra Energy seems like a great bargain for long-term-oriented investors with an investment time horizon of more than five years. offers a wide range of tools and resources to help you achieve superior investment returns.

"Daqo New Energy: A New Sunrise, But With Some Clouds","Daqo New Energy  is a leading global producer of polysilicon. The company has a number of competitive advantages, including high-quality products at a low cost, strong manufacturing capabilities, and a healthy balance sheet. Daqo is also exposed to a numberIn the last two decades, the weight of China in the polysilicon industry has grown exponentially from less than 5  in 2005 to more than 60  in 2021. The reason behind the growth is the subsidies given by the Chinese government to polysilicon manufacturers, alongside However, protectionism doesn't tell the whole story. Chinese manufacturers, such as Tongwei, GCL-Poly, or Daqo, have moved their productions to landlocked provinces in China, where energy price is lower, allowing a cost-effective production of high-quality polysilicon. Note that the  high-quality polysilicon  is produced only by the largest manufacturers in China, so China has been partly dependent on foreign manufacturers to produce it. Additionally, China focuses on monocrystalline solar wafers to ensure higher energy efficiency than multi-crystalline solar wafers. However, as the industry giants expand , this dependence will likely be erased even more.Furthermore, China aims to change its electricity capacity from coal to solar and wind. It has led China to dominate the global solar panel supply chain. Nevertheless, China is far from replacing coal and gas as the principal  thus, I think the solar energy industry is far from reaching its peak in China.As you see, China is the dominant player in every supply chain step. Moreover, according to , the output of silicon materials in 2022 was only 920,000 tonnes  in China , equivalent to 370GW of silicon wafers, while the wafer production capacity is 621 GW. Consequently, from my perspective, the polysilicon industry can keep expanding its production  in fact,  estimates an annual growth rate of 13.21  until 2028.Nonetheless, this industry is harsh for many producers, as the supply cannot adapt to fast-changing demand, and history shows us many stages of oversupply and undersupply. The process of building a plant and starting production could take , and once the construction is started, it is hard to stop it without incurring significant financial losses.Consequently, when prices are up, incumbents expand production, and new companies enter the market to realize they now have a sizeable idle capacity as demand slows and prices go down. Low prices drive less cost-efficient companies out of the market, which, along with a recovery of demand, increases the prices, and the cycle starts again.Specifically, in 2022, the  polysilicon price soared higher than  35 per Kg, which lures new entrants and China and further expansions of incumbents. However, Chinese companies aim to keep ramping up production even if market conditions do not seem appropriate, as they focus on substituting all the output with cost-effective production. For instance, the CEO of Daqo in 2018 estimated that only a third of all Chinese output was cost-effective in 2017.Seeing the planned expansion by all these companies, it's clear why the Chinese price of polysilicon fell under  10 per kg in 2023, as the new additions ended up in a sizeable idle capacity. As can be noted in the chart below, the price has stabilized at around  10 per Kg after plummeting more than 70 . During this period  1H23 , according to the Ministry's , Chinese companies produced 606,000 tons of polysilicon, an increase of 66.1  YoY. Nevertheless, the demand continues to be strong, as the China Photovoltaic Industry Association revised its forecast for annual solar PV installations in China to 120 GW to 140 GW.Although the price has fallen significantly, I believe that Daqo and other Chinese manufacturers will keep doing fine in the future, as the demand for their products in China will be continuous, as China aims to increase renewable energy sources. Furthermore, Daqo's management estimates to produce between 193,000 and 198,000 MT in 2023, which is an increase of 43  to 48  compared to 2022. Moreover,  estimates that the solar PV industry will add more energy capacity in the next five years  for instance, 239 GW were added in 2022, while it is expected that in 2023, it will rise to 341 GW.Nonetheless, the growth in the solar industry may not translate into growth in the polysilicon market, or at least not all the projected growth, because technical improvements have decreased silicon consumption for solar cells. Hence, if this trend continues, the demand for polysilicon will grow slower than the rest of the solar industry.Additionally, other types of solar panels do not require polysilicon to produce, such as Cadmium Telluride panels, which are cheaper but less efficient than panels based on polysilicon. Hence, they need larger spaces to make the same amount of energy. Along with CIGS and , these new technologies represent a substitute threat for the current multi-crystalline and monocrystalline solar panels. However, according to the , crystalline silicon technologies will continue to dominate the industry thanks to their higher efficiency over thin-film technologies. Still, new technologies may have greater efficiency in the future.Lastly, another risk is the possibility of developing a more efficient process than 'The Siemens process,' which has remained the dominant productive process thanks to the cost improvement developed by the Chinese producers. However, the  has been a permanent contender of The Siemens process, as the former can produce with lower energy consumption but at a price of producing unusable dust that partially offsets the benefits of lower energy consumption.Inside this industry, Daqo New Energy is a leading global polysilicon producer with the following competitive advantagesDaqo New Energy is one of the lowest-cost producers of polysilicon in the world. The company can achieve this through efficient manufacturing processes and economies of scale. Daqo hasn't lost money since 2014  thus, it has endured selling at any price and still be profitable. Daqo New Energy's polysilicon is also known for its high-quality polysilicon, being one of the few Chinese producers that can make high-quality polysilicon, which is why leading solar panel manufacturers use it. Moreover, according to its quarter report, the completion of the Phase 5A polysilicon project has lowered the production cost by 8.3  due to improvements in manufacturing efficiency.Daqo New Energy has a proven track record of manufacturing high-quality polysilicon on a reliable basis. The company uses the latest manufacturing technologies and has a team of experienced engineers and technicians. Daqo New Energy's customers rely on it to deliver a consistent supply of high-quality polysilicon.As of June 30, Daqo held a net cash position of  3,169 million, so the company has an EV negative as its cash reserve surpasses its market cap. The management, taking advantage of this situation, is doing buybacks for a total value of  301.7 million  12.82  of the total market cap .Insiders hold 25.2  of the  CEO Xiang Xu has 7.96 , and Guangfu Xu  Founder and Director  holds 10.2 . Thus, I consider their interests to be aligned with shareholders' interests.The   Longi, Shangji, and Gokin  accounted for 54.7  of revenue in 2022, an improvement from 2020, when they accounted for 83.4. However, I believe these three customers have a unique bargaining power to force Daqo to comply with their requirements, and they may even use their control to manipulate prices.The company's financial records are maintained in RMB, its functional currency. It means the company is exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB. The company does not hedge its operational exposure to this foreign currency fluctuation. This means that any significant depreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the value of, and any dividends payable on, the company's ADSs and ordinary shares. The value of an investment in the company's ADSs will also be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB because the value of the company's business is effectively denominated in RMB. In contrast, the ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars. Fluctuation in the value of RMB in either direction could have a material adverse effect on the company's value and the investment's value.The company's assets are located in, and its revenues are sourced from China. As a result, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties, including fluctuations in GDP, unfavorable or unpredictable tax treatment, expropriation of private assets, exchange controls, restrictions on cross-border transfers of funds, regulatory proceedings, inflation, currency fluctuations, and the absence of, or unexpected changes in, regulations and unforeseeable operational risks. The company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may also be influenced by political, economic, and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China.It's virtually impossible to predict what is going to be the price of polysilicon in the next year or the next decade. Therefore, I'll use a conservative Average Selling Price of  9 per Kg and increase Daqo's production by 13.21 , as it's aligned with projected growth by Mordor Intelligence and lower than the solar industry growth according to Solar Power Europe, which is reasonable knowing that the polysilicon consumption per solar cells is expected to keep falling. The gross and operating margins will be 30  and 23.44 , respectively.As the company keeps expanding its production capacities, the CAPEX as a percentage of the sales will be 20 . The Perpetuity Value will be a P FCF of 10, and the discount rate will be 18.5 , as Daqo is in a perfect competition market with relatively high barriers to entry and low bargaining power toward customers.Note the price selected is close to the ASP of the last months when the competition increased, and there was an oversupply. Moreover, many competitors offered lower prices to increase production and scale to lower costs. However, less cost-effective competitors have left the market or reduced considerably their production, which has elevated the price in the last couple of months. Consequently, the price may be higher than the price projected.Considering a conservative scenario with permanently low prices, Daqo shares are a 'Buy' owing to its large cash reserve relative to its market cap. The margin of safety is wide enough to give some good protection against downside risk. However, investors should be aware that the high NPV is due to cash reserve  consequently, if the cash cannot be returned to shareholders via buybacks or dividends or is invested at a low expected return over investment, there won't be any value in this cash reserve.Personally, I think this is a short-term opportunity rather than a long-term investment. I don't feel comfortable investing in companies that compete in perfect competition markets, are vulnerable to price volatility, and, as a consequence, have low returns over invested capital.

"Ørsted A/S: Don't Buy The Dip, The Wind Industry's Problems Are Structural","I looked at Ørsted A S   in March 2022 when  based on the macro trifecta of commodity inflation, rising interest rates and economic protectionismThe stock is down 50  sinceHowever, it puzzles me that as Ørsted was sliding down, Seeking Alpha analysts published 9  buy strong buy  and only 2  hold  articles, without any new bearish takes, despite the multiple warning signs that offshore wind is currently not a healthy sector. A unifying theme across the bullish articles appears to be that Ørsted is somehow  undervalued  because it was trading at a higher price before.As Ørsted crashed 25  just in one dayEventually, one of the bullish calls will probably be right, but until then you can lose a lot of your net worth by trying to catch the proverbial  falling knife , especially when the fundamentals are against you. So allow me to explain why 18 months later my bearish call on wind energy still stands and why thinking that Ørsted will allow you to profit from the energy transition is rather naive.The main reason why wind and solar stocks are crashing is that, in the first place, they only went up so high due to the massive liquidity wave and zero interest rate policies unleashed by central banks during the pandemic. As liquidity tightened and U.S. rates are now above 5 , there has been a gravitational pull on long-duration stocks that promise to deliver cash flows far out into the future. In this regard, renewable energy is following the path of other Covid bubblesNote the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF  is still up 86  from early 2020, which suggests the bubble deflation process may still have some runway left.Moreover, high interest rates don't just influence wind and solar stocks through the discount factor, but also have a direct impact on the attractiveness of project finance. For example, in a recent article, the Wall Street Journal  that financing costs for solar projects had gone up by 30  compared to a few years ago due to higher interest rates.Without doubt, a second reason for the 2020-2021 outperformance of Ørsted and other renewable energy stocks has been the rise of the so-called ESG investing. ESG is hazy concept, but let's say the idea behind it is that fund managers should be scored not just on the returns of their portfolio but also based on the extent to which their holdings contribute to environmental and social goals, including, of course, de-carbonization.ESG investing has had important repercussions across the investment industry, includingProverbially, you know that a new trend is over when one of the major business magazines proclaims it is going to be the future  forever  and with ESG investing I think we  that point 1-2 years agoThe linked Forbes article cites a PwC prediction that ESG-oriented assets under management are toOne should approach studies sponsored by consulting firms with similar skepticism as the business magazine covers. Ultimately, consultancies are trying to sell more of their services and are tailoring their marketing message to the dominant trend, but that by itself is also a lagging indicator.So what is the leading indicator then  I think it could be Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock , which is the world's largest asset manager, backtracking on whole the ESG investing idea, as featured It seems that we now even have . It's not a perfect indicator, but when someone creates an inverse ETF, it usually indicates there is already sufficient interest in the contrarian thesis.So long story short, I think the times are changing  again  and I see a strengthening push towards evaluating investment performance based on more traditional metrics. Ørsted can ring the carbon alarm bell as much as it likes  see my comments on their earnings call below , but unless they start generating tangible returns, investors may keep them in the penalty box.One of the greatest paradoxes in the renewables landscape is that building out the infrastructure requires a lot of traditional energy. To quote from my prior articleFossil fuels aren't a direct input but definitely an important indirect one as producing materials such as steel is very energy intensive. So is metals and mining in general. Copper is a small portion of the windmills, but new windfarms, especially offshore, require significant investments in electrification that are also copper dependent.As ESG investing has starved the traditional energy and mining sectors of capital, the costs in these sectors have risen, and this is pushing up the commodity price itself. Ironically, more expensive commodities increase the construction costs for offshore wind and others.Governments heeding Ørsted's call for more subsidies  see below  may not be a long-term solution either. These subsidies will be paid out with fiat money, thus fueling the already high inflation. When inflation is high, commodities often appreciate as they act as a hedge. So each way you look at it, something's gotta give.If you want to invest in wind, you have to mind the geopolitics. Initially, supply chain disruptions were driven by the pandemic, but now a big problem are the deteriorating U.S.-China relations. If you want to onshore to the U.S., where Ørsted's most problematic developments are, costs will be higher.The Build Back Better Act  which I didn't believe would pass when I wrote my prior article  is supportive from investment credit perspective, but also adds a lot of preferences for U.S. generated content  the  economic protectionism  piece of my original thesis .The Wall Street Journal  nicelyWhichever way you look at it, this is not bullish.There is certainly something to be said about the  price driving narrative  concept, but at this point there is no shortage of reporting about the problems in the wind industry.Ørsted's impairments aren't an isolated incident. According to the WSJ The culprits, again, are rising interest and materials costs, and there is no indication how these trends would be countered. I am afraid Seeking Alpha's bullish analysts aren't sufficiently educating the reader about these structural issues. There may be a time to be  contrarian  but it's not now when this is just starting to play out.The wind turbine manufacturers delivered quite a bit of bad news this year too. Siemens Gamesa  was among themIn the WSJ's ,  shares plummeted Friday in early trading  in June  after the German energy company withdrew its fiscal 2023 profit guidance following a technical review of Siemens Gamesa s installed fleet and product designs.  According to the analysts cited in the linked articleVestas , another big manufacturer,  either from the concerns over qualityAdmittedly, Ørsted is on the customer side here, but these manufacturing quality issues will undoubtedly also affect the company's execution timelines.There is a lot of debate on , also known as  stillingI wanted to mention this even though it isn't a central piece to my thesis. My view is the evidence appears a little mixed, and, even if ultimately corroborated, this is something outside management's control. However, a robust procurement strategy that can mitigate the rising costs is under Ørsted's control and should be expected of management.Unfortunately, instead of offering a more introspective look at the company's difficulties, Ørsted's CEO opened the  by essentially asking governments  ultimately, the taxpayer or  you , if you reside in a  Western  country  to pick up the tab for the increased costs  my highlightsAn engineering company that is building, say, an airport or a highway under fixed parameters would be expected to eat up the cost overruns, but Ørsted effectively argues it should be insulated from any downside  while retaining the upside  because of the  climate emergency.  Climate at the end of the day is still a public interest project and the rules followed by private operators who execute with public funds should be consistent regardless the cause.Ørsted's focus on more subsidies as the  solution  is also emphasized in the official impairment releaseThis raises some interesting questions because Ørsted remains majority owned by the Danish government. The U.S. Federal and the affected state governments bending their rules to ultimately benefit a foreign government  according to the WSJ, Ørsted wants us a bump from the 30  ITC to  at least 40  may draw quite some scrutiny as the U.S. is headed into an election year.I don't know how this will play out, but my feeling is the U.S. political calculus may not be the most favorable for meeting Ørsted's demands this time around.Ørsted's favorite performance measure appears to be ROCE  return on capital employed . As reported in the , it may be quite high at 13-14However, ROCE can be a bit misleading for cash-negative companies and Ørsted's cash flow has been negative all alongThe capital expenditures are financed by debt, which has steadily increasedCash interest expense is trending up - not only is debt growing but so are the interest rates at which new financing can be obtained.Typically, the rationale for investing in a cash-negative company is the growth, which would translate into positive cash flow further down the road. However, Ørsted's isn't exactly  growingRevenue peaked recently because of the windfall component from the surge in European electricity prices which wasn't sustainable. However, even during that period, Ørsted hasn't able to increase EBITDA which has now flatlined for the last 5 years.Seeking Alpha's  B-   may mislead you into thinking Ørsted is a value opportunity.At 28x forward earnings, Ørsted is hardly  cheap.  The price to book ratio has indeed moderated quite a bitHowever, remember that the book value doesn't yet include the impairments which triggered the selloff on Tuesday. Once those impairments are recorded, the book value will decrease and the ratio will rise again.In summary, nothing here screams  value , especially when considering the deteriorating performance. Rather, I would argue we have an instance of a  bubble  gradually normalizing.I already explained how ESG mandates may have influenced institutional investors to add Ørsted to their portfolios. As for retail, from perusing some of the other articles and comments under this ticker, I get the sense that some bought into the logic that the green energy trend will be good for green energy producers. This is a naive view that ignores the second-order effects I have explained here.In my view, what defines an attractive industry is control over scarce resources that act as  moat  and provide pricing power. The wind developers like Ørsted aren't on the good side of this equation. Pricing is based on offtake agreements with government entities and, as argued, I see little appetite for unlimited subsidies.Ørsted also has little protection from the commodity inflation that increases the cost of its inputs. The contrarian view here isn't to  catch the falling knife  but rather to look further upstream along the value chain where the producers of metals and critical minerals will be able to charge higher prices for their outputs as the energy transition boosts demand.I mean, if you bother to read between the lines, even Ørsted itself  where to look for above-market return opportunitiesI couldn't track down which is the specific installation vessel in question, but it sounds like offshore services is acting as the bottleneck here. The wise thing would be to consider investing in these offshore providers whose services are obviously in high demand.In fact, I have argued before that offshore services providers like Tidewater  or Oil States International , among multiple others, may be surprising winners of the energy transition as they support both oil and offshore wind developments and are currently capacity constrained. So the bottom line is if you want to capitalize on green energy, you need to think a bit outside the box and not just buy the first thing that has  green   figuratively speaking  in its name.The headwinds of high interest rates, commodity inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and geopolitical issues that drive  de-globalization  are hurting offshore wind big time. Add to that the reliability issues reported earlier this year by the wind turbine manufacturers and you don't get a very pretty picture.Ørsted so far isn't showing it has a plan to navigate these challenges except asking governments for greater subsidies. I think the political environment, especially in the U.S. where Ørsted's impaired developments are, isn't currently conducive to these demands as inflation is clearly a bigger priority for voters  granting the company's demands would actually be inflationary .That is why I recommend against investing in Ørsted and waiting for the wind bubble deflation to fully play out. When that happens, Ørsted may perhaps present a value opportunity, but that time hasn't arrived yet.As closing words, I will also emphasize I am not short Ørsted and I don't necessarily recommend shorting the stock. The Danish government may at some point provide a backstop if things go really bad, and even the 50  slide since my last article was marked by a number of counter-rallies that can wipe out your short position.As always, do your own due diligence.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Why Enphase Should Likely Be Valued Higher,"Enphase Energy  is a global leader in solar microinverters. This technology has some major advantages compared with regular solar string inverters. In this article, I will highlight how I believe Enphase will benefit from their technological advantage and why IThere are some defining features which make Enphase's products, and especially their microinverters, stand out in the renewable energy segment.In most residential areas, where there might exist panels oriented in different directions or partial shadow during some times of the day, Enphase's microinverters are an excellent option. The added benefit is the modularity, so you can easily detect if there's an issue with a single individual panel. Enphase's competitor SolarEdge  sells optimizers, which manage the DC voltage and the current in each individual panel. Optimizers also have many of these benefits, but with Enphase's microinverters the DC to AC conversion takes place inside every panel itself. This can lead to higher energy outputs and a lower voltage on the roof.So except for very straightforward situations, Enphase's microinverters are often the best option for a solar installation. In all fairness, it must be said that they are also one of the most expensive options, and whether these additional costs can be gained back depends on the additional efficiency which is reached using Enphase microinverters.I believe these excellent characteristics and the higher price make Enphase's microinverters comparable with Apple's iPhone. Though the microinverters are their flagship product, Enphase also sells EV chargers, batteries and home energy management systems.Let us now take a look at tailwinds and headwinds for Enphase during the coming years.Enphase's main markets are residential and commercial solar systems. In the current era where sustainability and clean energy are becoming more and more important, Enphase is one of the front runners in the solar industry. Although the company does not produce solar panels, it focuses on microinverters, which convert the electricity produced by solar panels from direct current  DC  into alternating current  AC .As some parts of the world have dealt with increasing energy prices in 2022 before and during the war in Ukraine, it is clearly visible that Enphase's products enjoy a positive momentum. In Europe for instance, where electricity and especially natural gas prices skyrocketed, Enphase's sales grew by an  in 2022.This increasing popularity has not only happened for sustainability reasons, but also for energy independency.  of France to double its renewable energy capacity by 2035 underscore this. The global solar market  from  189.5B last year to  607.8B, which creates a strong tailwind for solar companies.For homeowners and companies, solar panel installations are a relatively simple way to decrease the dependency of families and companies on external energy production. Of course, even with Enphase's products, completely decoupling from the grid is rarely possible and most of the time not desirable for consumers. But by streamlining electricity usage, storage and EV charging, one can come a long way in reducing its own dependency on external energy, except maybe for the darkest winter months when not enough solar irradiation is reaching the solar panels on your rooftops.As global electricity grids are modernized to the demands of the 21st century with more EVs, more electric heating and cooling and more home battery systems, Enphase has many products which are considered best in best-in-class.Also, Enphase has a large advantage in that the company makes heavy use of contractors in manufacturing their products, which makes them flexible. The company also likes to mention that they are quite frugal in spending money, which is a benefit, especially in uncertain economic times. As the CEO wrote in his 2022 investor letterThere are also some important risks for Enphase. First of all, new renewable energy installations growth is  partially  dependent on government policy. Solar energy is already profitable without subsidies in many locations, but government subsidies or attractive loans have the potential to move consumers and companies in the direction of purchasing a new solar installation. In some countries, these subsidies are waning. For instance, in my country the Netherlands, a regulation for solar panel owners to subtract your total energy production from your total consumption is slowly being phased out. This was a very attractive regulation which allowed solar panel owners to indirectly 'trade' energy delivered from the panels  the grid  which was usually generated at a time when energy was abundant and cheap, during sunny afternoons for instance  for consumed energy  the grid  which was usually expensive, generated during the night or during the dark winter months .New solar installations can thus be heavily accelerated or slowed down by government policy.Another important area of risks for Enphase is the electricity grid. Usually, solar installations are directly or indirectly connected to the electricity grid. In most countries, this electricity grid is not designed to support many decentralized electricity production connections. When the grid of most modern countries was designed, it was planned to operate mostly with centralized production by a couple of very large power plants  usually coal, gas, nuclear or hydropower . In some places of the world with large electricity production by renewables, the grid is already experiencing immense pressure, and this is expected to get worse if more and more EVs chargers, heat pumps and solar panels are being installed. Stable  needs to be able to supply electricity during the times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. Batteries, water buffers in hydro power plants and  in the future  storage of hydrogen can help, but are currently not enough. In many countries, fossil fuels which can be scaled up quickly like natural gas are often still indispensable, next to a base load of others, such as coal, hydro and nuclear power.Of course, Enphase also sells some  partial  solutions to this problem  home batteries and energy management systems. But for most people and companies, these batteries and systems are not nearly enough to become self-sufficient with regard to energy consumption, and pressure on electricity grids is expected to increase quickly during the coming years. If governments or network operators fail to transform the grids quickly enough, this could limit the installation of future solar installations.Increased competition is another potential risk for Enphase. Relatively recently in 2021, Tesla  also started selling its own solar inverter. Although Tesla sells regular string inverters, being such a large and well-known brand, Tesla could become a strong competitor for Enphase on the longer term.At this moment, Enphase is clearly the market leader of solar microinverters. If more companies enter this market segment, Enphase could experience more competition. Home batteries and power management systems are product segments where there already exists stronger competition.Recently, Enphase's share price has experienced a major downturn, which was more or less in line with many other renewable energy companies.Enphase's share price has cratered from  336 in November last year to the current price of  124.5, which is an enormous drop of 63 . One would expect that a company that is dropping by this much is also performing abysmally on their financial metrics, but this was not the case for Enphase. Let us take a brief look at their At this moment, Enphase is valued at a P E of  let us take the Q2 GAAP EPS and multiply it by 4  124.5    1.15 4    26.96. This seems like a high ratio. But considering that Enphase is a company which has grown both its sales and its earnings very quickly during the last years, I do not believe it is expensive at the moment.In 2022, Enphase  by 69 , they more than doubled their cash flow and slightly improved their margins . During 2023, the company can be expected to reach a lower level of growth, as can be derived from the excerpt of their Q2 financial results above  their GAAP revenue in Q2 is  711M compared with  530M in Q2 2022, which is an increase of 'only' 34 .Let us now make a very rudimentary estimate of earnings and revenue of Enphase over the coming years, and calculate the expected fair share price of the company using a couple of different price to earnings ratios. I will use a couple of assumptionsIt is impossible to know beforehand if these are realistic assumptions, and other analysts might use completely different assumptions, but let us work with them.Using these earnings per share, we can calculate expected fair share prices using different P E multiples of Enphase's share over the yearsI choose the P E values of 15, 25 and 35 on purpose. At this moment, Enphase is valued slightly higher than a P E ratio of 25. I do not personally believe that a P E ratio of 15 is realistic for a company which grows its earnings and revenue by an annual rate of more than 15 , but during potential future economic downturns, we cannot completely rule it out. A future P E value of 35 seems on the high side, but for a company which grows its earnings quickly, such a ratio could be justifiable.As we can see in the table, future fair share prices of Enphase can vary wildly depending on your assumptions. There are so many unknowns here that it is impossible to know what the future fair share price is, but the purpose of these calculations is not accuracy, but it is the show the realm of what is possible using relatively conservative assumptions.I believe most of my assumptions were quite conservative, especially regarding the 2023 growth, using only GAAP numbers and the expectation of Enphase to grow in line with the solar market. Therefore I think it is justifiable to take a current fair value P E of 35 for Enphase shares. This means that I believe Enphase shares have room to recover to  155 on the short to medium term. According to this value, Enphase is about 25  undervalued. I believe that in the more distant future, Enphase's fair P E value will drop a bit as the solar market gets more mature.So, Enphase Energy is a best-in-best-in-class producer of microinverters and other home electricity products in a rapidly growing market. The company is a pioneer in the renewable energy industry, and I expects its future growth to be beneficial for consumers, investors, and the planet. My current rating for the shares of Enphase is a strong buy.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Energy Income Weekly: The Energy Sector Starts To Outperform,"It was another week of outperformance for the energy sector. Increasing oil prices raised the prospect of higher inflation, which, in turn, pushed up Treasury yields and pushed down the S P 500 . TheThe energy sector  was the top-performing sector in the S P 500, gaining 1.4 , largely in response to WTI s 2.3  gain. E Ps  underperformed the oil price, rising only 0.6  on the week, and oilfield services  performed slightly better, trading up 1.0 .Midstream underperformed for yet another week, which is to be expected due to the segment s relatively low direct exposure to oil prices. The Alerian MLP Index declined 1.8  on the week.Positive inventory data supported oil prices. U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 6.3 millionThe oil market s fundamental outlook is set to gain additional support from Saudi Arabia s export reduction. The chart below, courtesy of Vortexa, shows that Saudi exports began to fall in August instead of July, when its production cut began. The timing of its export reduction will translate to falling onshore inventories in October and beyond as shipments arrive at their destinations.Major consultancies see supply deficits even greater than our own forecasts. Rystad, for instance, is  a massive 2.7 million barrel per day supply deficit in the fourth quarter. As the supply deficit hits onshore inventories, it is likely to push crude prices higher. We expect it to push WTI into the  90s per barrel.The main obstacle to higher prices will come from the release of China's reserves accumulated over recent quarters at low prices. Reserve releases are even more likely after Saudi Aramco's  that it was increasing prices to its Chinese customers.While China's reserve releases are likely to prevent an oil price spike and could reduce crude's near-term upside, we don't expect them to be large enough to overwhelm the supply deficit, which we expect to remove roughly 200 million barrels from global inventories from September through year-end. Given where global inventories stand, further draws are likely to exert upward pressure on prices. And once China's reserve releases have run their course, that pressure will intensify.One of the most interesting developments during the week was the energy sector s 3.4  outperformance of the technology-heavy Nasdaq. If oil prices continue to increase, as we expect, the same dynamics that sent energy shares higher and tech shares lower this week are likely to continue, as higher energy prices translate to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates suppress technology and other growth stock valuations because they make it easy for investors to obtain a high return at no risk  instead of having to wait for uncertain growth to provide a competitive return in the distant future. They thereby incentivize the flow of capital away from technology and other growth stocks and toward sectors that offer immediate cash flow and inflation resistance, with the energy sector being the most obvious beneficiary. Investors should position accordingly before energy s outperformance grows more pronounced.The biggest energy income news during the week was Enbridge s   of natural gas utility assets from Dominion Energy . ENB stock ended the week down 5.6 , reflecting the market s concerns about the company s strategic direction and its lofty leverage metrics.Despite the market s negative reaction, the deal came at an attractive price and will diversify ENB s operations away from low-growth liquids. We like the deal. ENB is following TC Energy  in favoring its natural gas assets while reducing its liquids exposure. At the moment, TRP stock is more undervalued than ENB, even after ENB s selloff during the week. We continue to prefer TRP to ENB for a multi-year holding period.Midstream weakness was concentrated in natural gas-weighted names, as gas prices declined 5.8 . Williams , Kinder Morgan , Oneok , and Antero Midstream  all traded at least 2.0  lower.But even liquids-weighted names struggled, despite the rise in oil prices. Plains All American ,  was among the biggest losers, down 4.7 , on no news other than Citi s downgrade of the equity from Buy to Neutral. We recently sold our PAA units, though we believe the company s outlook remains constructive due to the Permian s bullish long-term production outlook.Western Midstream Partners , another name with a heavy liquids weighting, traded lower after  of privately-held Meritage Midstream, which operates gathering and processing infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. While shareholders panned the deal, WES management is one of the few we trust when it comes to capital allocation. The company is betting that Powder River Basin production prospects are good, and we wouldn t bet against it.WES s deal was made at an attractive 5.5-times estimated 2024 Adjusted EBITDA. It will also yield synergy opportunities. Importantly, it will diversify WES operations away from their heavy concentration in Occidental Petroleum . We also recently sold our WES units, but we believe the units are attractively priced after the week s recent selloff.Delek Logistics Partners , another midstreamer with liquids exposure, also traded lower. DKL traded down 4.9  after its sponsor and owner of its general partner, Delek US Holdings  disclosed in an SEC filing that it would sell 13.6 million DKL units. The unit sale will decrease Delek US Holdings  stake in DKL from 78.7  to 47.6 . Not surprisingly, public unitholders were concerned about the size of the sale and sold DKL units.Among the week s gainers, we were pleased to see four of our portfolio holdings listed among the top ten.Outside of our holdings, Tellurian  shares gained after the company  a deal on Tuesday with Baker Hughes  for eight gas turbines for TELL s Driftwood LNG project. TELL said that it is on schedule to complete certain parts of Driftwood by early next year.Then on Friday, TELL dropped the requirement that Driftwood s LNG be sold exclusively to Driftwood equity holders. The shares fell in response to the announcement, as it appeared to signal desperation on the part of TELL in its efforts to sign sale and purchase agreements aimed at supporting the project and obtaining financing. TELL shares remain highly speculative, and we recommend avoiding them.Holly Energy Partners  hit a 52-week high, ending the week up 6.0  for the week after the shares of its sponsor, HF Sinclair Corp  rose along with the rest of the refining sector, which is benefitting from strong refining margins. HF Sinclair is in the process of buying HEP in a deal where it is offering 0.315 HF Sinclair shares and  4.00 of cash in exchange for each HEP unit. The terms make HEP s stock price closely tied to that of HF Sinclair s.Our portfolio outperformed its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index, by 2.5  during the week.After our portfolio underperformed its benchmark in the first half of the year as we allocated funds to equities exposed to oil prices which at the time had been out of favor it is now handily outperforming its benchmark for the third year running.Calumet Specialty Products Partners  continued its hot streak, gaining 5.6  on no company-specific news. The move suggests there is a wider recognition of Montana Renewables  prospects for CLMT. Also, the company is likely to benefit from the high refining margins that have prevailed throughout the third quarter. CLMT remains an attractive long-term holding, and we maintain our  30 price target.Martin Midstream Partners  marched 2.6  higher for another week on big volume. We still don t know the reason for the bulk of the unit buying and can only point to the fact that the units had fallen to absurdly cheap levels before this spate of buying. However, we were gratified to see the company s Chairman, Ruben Martin,  to the tune of 71,120 units, which he bought at an average price of  2.97. We expect to see progress on MMLP s deleveraging over the coming quarters, which should result in a higher unit price over time.Genesis Energy  was our portfolio s third-best performer, gaining 2.1 . The recent increase in GEL shares could be attributable to the surging soda ash price, which is shown below.GEL s management reduced its full-year guidance based on the expectation that the lower soda ash prices that prevailed during its second-quarter earnings call on August 3 would continue in the second half. The price surge over recent weeks could see the company outperform management s and the market s expectations.Frankly, we re sufficiently confident in GEL s long-term return prospects that we actually liked having the units trade under  10 so we could buy more. If they fall back, we ll most likely continue our purchases. For investors who don t already own GEL, it remains one of the most attractively-priced midstream equities, even after its recent run-up.Our biggest underperformers were tied to natural gas, which slumped during the week. Targa Resources  generates a meaningful amount of EBITDA from the fractionation spread, and its exposure isn t fully hedged, so its third-quarter results will reflect lower NGL prices. However, natural gas production in the Permian is booming, which we expect to offset the impact of lower NGL prices.Cheniere Energy  shares fell 2.8  on no news despite a recent increase in European natural gas prices. There has been no change in our long-term thesis for Cheniere. We believe the shares remain attractively priced. We maintain our Buy rating and  180.00 price target.Equitrans Midstream  shares were the worst performer, falling 3.5 , presumably in response to lower natural gas prices. However, the stomach-churningly egregious  for outgoing CEO Thomas Karam could have had a role in the poor weekly performance. We were so disgusted by the deal that we momentarily considered selling our shares.Karam s transition from CEO to Executive Chairman involves shareholders paying him a  625,000 annual salary,  625,000 in short-term incentives, and  3.25 million in long-term incentives. Nice work if you can get it for simply showing up at the office. Or not we don t even know if he is required to show up to be entitled to his compensation.The deal also involves this gem  a  7.5 million bonus for Karam for having simply done his job.So how did ETRN shares perform under Karam s tenure as CEO  See the chart belowOver the period that ETRN lost shareholders 60.3  of their investment, the Alerian Midstream Energy Index  58.3 , making ETRN s underperformance under Karam a disaster for shareholders in both absolute and relative terms.We have no problem with companies awarding outsized compensation for outperformance, but this is ridiculous.The  7.5 million bonus referenced Karam s role in getting the MVP approved, when in reality, the project was the ultimate debacle. The  from management s initial tally of  3.5 billion in February 2018, when construction began, to  6.6 billion upon completion, likely late this year or early next year. ETRN shareholders footed the bill for slightly less than half of the project s cost overruns. Moreover, the MVP s ultimate returns to ETRN shareholders are likely to end up far below management s initial projections.We'd hazard a guess that the amount of influence Tom Karam had on getting the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  approved was close to nil. The project was stuck in legal limbo with almost no hope of survival until it was rescued from the scrap heap by a compromise deal between Senator Joe Manchin, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. The deal was made in order to secure Manchin s support for various government spending measures. It rammed the MVP project through to completion by an act of Congress. The compromise Manchin struck to get the project approved was more likely motivated by his desire to support West Virginia jobs and economy, as well as his party s political priorities and electoral prospects than Tom Karam s desire or lobbying efforts to see the project through. Perhaps campaign contributions to Manchin facilitated by Karam and paid for by ETRN shareholders played a role, we don t know.In any event, Karam would have walked away from ETRN as a wealthy man regardless of whether the MVP was completed or not. So in the twisted logic of public company executive compensation, Karam enjoyed a  heads I win big, tails I don t lose  arrangement where ETRN shareholders lose either way. They shouldered all ETRN's risks and costs after having collectively lost billions of dollars in market capitalization. This is a dangerous way for a board of directors to incentivize the individuals managing shareholders  capital.We ll hold our nose and continue to hold ETRN stock, though our appraisal of its board of directors and corporate governance has dimmed considerably.Enbridge  a  4.0 billion bought-deal financing in connection with its Dominion Energy asset acquisition. The deal s underwriters, including the major Canadian banks, have agreed to purchase 87,490,00 common shares at an offering price of  44.73. The price was 7.1  below the previous day s closing price of ENB s Canadian-listed shares.At HFIR Energy Income, we strive to outperform with every pick recommendation. Since inception in 2021, the HFIR Energy Income Portfolio has returned 94.5 , versus its benchmark's return of 44.6 .HFIR Research is a full-time professional energy investor, active in the sector since 2015 while specializing in deep value opportunities and special situations.

Borr Drilling: The Jack-Ups Orderbook Is At 20-Year Lows,"Borr Drilling Limited  is a highly levered offshore driller that specializes in modern jack-up rigs  used for drilling in shallow waters . I previously wrote about BORR in  when I opined on theThe strong performance has made BORR look like a momentum stockHowever, I would contend that BORR remains a value play despite the run-up. The offshore services industry is in a secular bull market that has been unfazed by recessionary fears or even oil briefly falling into the  60s earlier this year.As BORR's drilling contracts re-rate  meaning that legacy contracts at lower rates get replaced by new contracts at higherThe low valuation suggests there is much upside left and the returns to equity holders may be magnified by the high leverage, especially as the debt gets gradually de-risked. I rate BORR a  buy.I cover the bull case for oilfield  and in particular offshore  services in greater detail in some of my recent macro-oriented articles...To make a long story short, long-cycle offshore plays underwent years of underinvestment from 2014-2021 as short-cycle U.S. shale production had become the swing producer. Offshore projects require multiple years to pay out, so there is a lot of hesitancy to respond to price signals when shale may ramp up and balance the market before an offshore project has even reached production.At this point it should be clear to everyone that shale is reaching its limits and is no longer quick to ramp up production when oil prices rise. As I have argued already in the linked articles, there is evidence many producers now require  60 oil to break even.In contrast, industry bellwether Schlumberger  now believes that As oil prices remain comfortably above  50, we have seen quite a rush by the advantaged operators to develop their reserves. On the deepwater side Petrobras  has been a major driver behind rig demand while on the shallow water side where BORR plays there has been a lot of demand from Middle Eastern NOCs like Saudi Aramco and ADNOC.Even within the U.S. itself, offshore shows stronger activity. Based on last Friday's Baker Hughes  rig count, U.S. onshore rigs are -20  YoY while offshore is up  25  for the same periodUnfortunately for the offshore operators, during the lean years of 2014-2021 many rigs were retired as the drillers couldn't afford to maintain them  and many drillers had to undergo reorganization too, resulting in further industry consolidation .It is not so easy to come up with newbuild rigs either. This is especially true on the deepwater side where estimates of  1 billion are thrown around for a newbuild drillship, but is also valid for jack-ups where the orderbook is at its lowest in 20 years  as pointed out in BORR's recent Part of the reason is rising building costs and more expensive financing, but shipyards are also backlogged with other orders such as LNG carriers. So when demand rises but supply is constrained, utilizations and day rates for the existing fleet go upThis is clearly very bullish for BORR, especially as the company has a modern fleet  average age of six years  that is in even higher demand compared to older rigsThe only negative is that rigs are contracted long-term, so BORR is still realizing revenue based on legacy contracts that were concluded at lower rates. It will take some time for the re-rating process to play out until the high rates we see today fully filter down to the bottom line. For this reason focusing on 2023 or 2024 EBITDA here doesn't make as much sense and Seeking Alpha's standardized valuation scores may be misleading.BORR believes that it can get close to  1 billion in EBITDA by 2026As a high-level calculation,  750 million certainly looks possible24 rigs x 175k d rate x 365 days x 95  utilization x 50  EBITDA margin    728mNote the company's calculation is a lot more detailed as it considers the phasing out of the legacy contracts.All this means the current enterprise value of  3.2 billion is only about 4x the EBITDA we could have in 2025-2026. How high should the multiple beI don't know, but I think it could easily be 5x or 6x. BORR doesn't have a long history, so we can look at Transocean  as a potential reference  during 2016-2020  offshore bear market , RIG's EV averaged  10 billion.In the meantime, RIG was generating annual EBITDA between  1 and  2 billionSo on average, RIG was able to sustain 6x EBITDA even when things were already bad in the industry.Assuming BORR can get to 6x  50  EV increase , that would essentially double the equity value due to the financial leverage.Even the average Wall Street target suggests  50  upsideBORR's management still has to carry out a significant refinancing in 2025. However, it looks like this refinancing will happen under a more favorable 3x debt EBITDAThe company's secured debt now has a single-digit yield too.It is important to note though that BORR also has  with a conversion price of about  7.35 per share. Right now this is out of the money, but there will be some dilution if we hit my 2x price target.As of the latest financial report, the 34 million in shares associated with the convertible bonds were considered In other words, recalculating EPS assuming the conversion would result in higher EPS. However, that won't be the case for much longer as the rig contracts re-rate and the EPS improves.BORR is a nice way to play the offshore services thesis. Even though I am very bullish on deepwater plays like Transocean, I think BORR provides a good counterbalance as the number one competitive threat to deepwater is probably shallow water.BORR's backlog is also now two-thirds from NOCs which I think will be the more resilient customer group this decade  energy security is also a strong imperative for government-owned companiesI rate BORR a  buy  with a view towards  14, although don't expect the path to be linear. BORR is also a highly volatile stock, so you should make sure it agrees with your risk tolerance.

Alexandria Real Estate Q3 Earnings Preview: Expecting Continued Strength In Leasing And Occupancy,"Life science-focused REIT, Alexandria Real Estate , is  to release its third fiscal quarter earnings report on Monday after the market close.In past coverage on the stock, I ve maintained a bullish position due to whatWith shares down over 20  since my last , my views haven t yet held water. Despite this, I remain bullish. And with shares at new 52-week lows, I ve also recently initiated a new position in the company s shares. With the current dividend yielding over 5  and supported by a strong track record of growth and safety, the stock made for a compelling addition, in my view.Looking ahead to the release, here s what to watch when ARE reports Q3 results on MondayARE currently trades at just 10.6x their 2023 projected funds from operations  FFO  midpoint of  8.96 share. While this is represents a premium to other office operators, such as SL Green , Vornado , and Highwoods , which all trade between 5x and 8x, I believe ARE warrants the premium because of their portfolio composition.Unlike other pure-play office operators, ARE s portfolio is comprised of mission-critical lab space. Others, namely those short on the stock, would disagree with this statement. But their tenant composition, which is overwhelmingly centered around pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, provide weight to this position.The trend in ARE s occupancy percentage is also dissimilar with other office operators. Despite the challenging operating environment, occupancy has held within the mid-90  range. This compares to notable declines elsewhere in the sector.In addition to favorable operating metrics, ARE continues to maintain a fortress-like balance sheet. And earlier this year, ARE secured an increase to their credit facility, resulting in a total overall liquidity position of  6.3B. The financial capacity is supported further by a debt composition that is effectively entirely fixed at a low weighted average rate of 3.7 , with nothing due prior to 2025.On their Q2 release, ARE  their full-year guidance for FFO but left the midpoint unchanged at  8.96 share. This would represent YOY growth of 6.4 , a respectable build on top of last year s 8.5  increase.Elsewhere, ARE is expecting year end occupancy to land at a midpoint of 95.1 . And from a leasing perspective, ARE is forecasting overall double-digit rental rate increases of between 12  and 17  on a cash basis. Despite what is viewed as a tough operating environment, ARE has continued to report . In Q2, the team reported total leasing volume of 1.3 MSF. Not only was that above their five-year pre-2021 average, but it was also their 13 consecutive quarter of turning in overall volume in excess of 1 MSF.I expect Q3 to be the 14 consecutive quarter of over 1 MSF of leasing volume, led by continued strength in Seattle and in the Northeastern pockets of the U.S. I also am expecting strong cash rental rate growth, supported in part by elevated levels of liquidity in the life-sciences sector following strong fundraising activity over the past two years and a large pipeline of R D-based spending ARE has maintained stable occupancy levels. And I expect this to continue in Q3 and beyond. Some have speculated as to physical occupancy and have concluded that ARE s space is physically occupied at the same rate as other administrative spaces.While it s a discussion worth having, ARE did somewhat address this in their prior earnings call by releasing data regarding energy consumption. Investors should expect further commentary in Q3 from management, more-or-less consistent with what had been previously stated. ARE does operate in high barrier to entry markets. But even then, supply has been on the uptrend. In Q2, for example, ARE reported rising supply in their Greater Boston and San Francisco markets. In San Francisco, the supply outlook was compounded by a notable increase in sublease vacancy to 6.2 . This is in addition to the unleased competitive supply expected to be delivered in 2024, estimated at about 6.6  market inventory.ARE will likely provide an update regarding new supply to be delivered in 2025 after providing their 2024 update last quarter. In my view, I expect the supply to be lower due principally to the unfavorable operating market for new development. Construction costs, for instance, are still high. And financing is harder to come by for most. This, in my view, should keep a ceiling on the amount of new supply coming online in the next few years.At this point in the economic cycle, I consider ARE to be one of the best additions to any long-term focused portfolio. The stock has been pressured over the last year from high-profile short interest, as well as from a general malaise in the office sector, the sector which ARE continues to be associated with  wrongly, in my view.Attractive yields on risk-free alternatives have also reduced the appeal of those investors who otherwise would have invested in real estate for its income appeal. But on this, I believe ARE provides long-term investors an attractive opportunity to lock in a fairly high yield for ARE s caliber.At present, the payout yields over 5  and is backed by a fortress-like balance sheet and safety position. Additionally, the payout is  at a 3-year compound growth rate of about 5.5 . Sure investors can lock in attractive yields on Treasuries at present. But those yields are unlikely to grow at the same rate of ARE s dividend payout.In addition to the dividend, I believe ARE presents outsized upside potential based on its current implied cap rate. I ve noted this in past coverage on the stock. And this continues to ring true.Earlier in the year, ARE was disposing of properties at cap rates in the mid 4  range. Even if one were to consider a 5.5  rate as fair, that would still take shares to the  150 mark, right around current . Looking ahead, I can see ARE reaching this potential on continued leasing strength and the maintenance of occupancy levels in the mid-90  range.With shares under pressure and at new 52-week lows ahead of a Q3 print where expectations are likely low, I continue to view ARE as an attractive addition to any long-term focused portfolio.

"Enphase: No Time To Waste, Consider The Stock Now","Enphase  is beaten up year-to-date and down more than 50 . I have been amazed by the business in the past years, but the stock was out of reach for me based on valuation. However, the multiples have gone down, the, Inc. is a global energy technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems. The company's semiconductor-based microinverter system converts energy at the individual solar module level, which provides a number of advantages over traditional solar panel systems, includingEnphase's IQ8 microinverter is the world's first grid-forming microinverter, capable of providing backup power without a battery by forming a microgrid during a power outage relying solely on sunlight.Further, Enphase is about to launch a new microinverter product. The IQ8P is targeted at a small commercial market in North America and Europe, and emerging residential markets  Brazil, Mexico, India, etc . The new product should support panels up to 650 watt DC, more than enough to provide full energy from the latest Tiger Neo solar panel of JinkoSolar , with power estimated at 635W.The company has shipped over 68 million microinverters and over 3.5 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in more than 145 countries. Enphase's customers include residential homeowners, commercial businesses, and utilities.In addition to its microinverter systems, Enphase also offers a variety of solar-plus-storage products, including batteries, energy management software, and EV charging systems. These products allow homeowners to store excess solar energy for use at night or during power outages, to better manage their energy consumption and charge their electrical vehicles.The company's main competitors are SolarEdge Technologies , SMA Solar Technology , Tesla  and Fronius International.In the near term, Enphase is facing some challenges, including the impact of higher interest rates on loans and a new net metering program in California  NEM 3.0 . Nevertheless, the company is confident that it can overcome these challenges and continue to grow its business.Higher interest rates in the U.S. and Europe have an impact on the interest on loans. Each rate hike makes it more expensive to loan money, which creates a slowdown in long term investments, like placing solar panels and batteries. Moreover, the largest solar market state in America, California, is making changes to their net metering program. Under , the value of solar energy credits decreased by 75  for new California solar customers. Therefore, it has an impact on the payback time of the solar system, lowering the incentive to place a new solar installation.On the other hand,  are steadily declining, making them cheaper than ever, but also more efficient than ever before. Besides, the still elevated energy prices have two large benefits when you own a solar system. The first one is that you have less costs on your energy usage and the second one is that you can earn more money by sending excess green energy back into the grid.The upgraded   'ITC'  for renewable energy projects is another tailwind in America. Between 2022 and 2032, taxpayers may claim 30  of capital costs when starting an eligible solar project.Enphase is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for solar energy. The  is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18  by 2030. Further, the  is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.2  by 2030. Enphase is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth due to its leading market position and its innovative technology.Surprisingly, by the end of 2022, only  had solar panels installed in the U.S., up from 4.3  in 2020. This shows that there is still immense growth left in the solar industry for America, so even while the market is currently slowing down, it should be temporary.Furthermore, in the  the CEO, Badri Kothandaraman, mentioned that they are opportunistic about sales growth in EuropeTogether with the rise of electrical vehicles, the  has been increasing rather quickly. Despite the recent drawback, the overall trend is bullish for Enphase's solar-plus-storage systems, which are supported with one the best software platforms out there.Historically, Enphase has not traded cheaper since the COVID-19 crash. Considering Enphase's  is expected to grow 9  in 2023, 32  in 2024 and 30  in 2025, the forward price-to-earnings is relatively inexpensive at 24x. Zooming out to 2024 and 2025 the forward price-to-earnings are respectively, 18x and 14x. Since the PEG ratio is well-below 1, I believe we can assume Enphase is an undervalued growth stock.Additionally, when we compare Enphase with some of the publicly listed competitors, it is visible that Enphase is by far the cheapest based on enterprise value to free cash flow. Two reasons are the company's strong profitability and CAPEX lite business model.Enphase has not traded at a higher free cash flow yield in last 5 years. The free cash flow yield is now standing at almost 5 , which is pretty impressive for a growing business. Some might say that comparing SolarEdge based on free cash flow is unfair, yet the PEG ratio of Enphase is also lower than that of SolarEdge.So while Enphase has been the cheapest stock compared to peers, they also have the highest gross margin. This showcases how efficiently run the company is and the amount of pricing power the Enphase brand has in my view.On top of that, Enphase's profit margins are again outperforming competitors by far. The large benefit of all this is that the business does not demand a lot of resources, and everything that is leftover can be reinvested in R D, M A or now share buybacks to counter dilution from stock-based-compensation. In case we see a recession, Enphase will be the last man standing and able to take over market share while remaining the leader in innovation due to better capital returns. In the last earnings call, the CEO mentioned that the higher margin IQ8 microinverter will soon be introduced in Europe, which can further improve profit marginEnphase has built up a strong balance sheet with a current ratio around 3.4x. As a result, the management is able to start doing share buybacks to stop the dilution of the shareholders. In the second quarter, Enphase bought back 1.25 million shares at an average price of  159.43 for a total of  200 million.A new  1 billion buyback program got announced as well, the CEO had this to say about it in the Q2 earnings callOverall, Enphase is a leading player in the solar energy industry. The company has a strong track record of innovation and growth, and it is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for solar energy.The secular solar tailwind seems far from over and the temporary headwinds in North America overshadow the international growth ahead. The relentless focus on cost efficiencies has created a highly profitable business, that can easily reinvest profits in the business, and secure their dominant position for the foreseeable future. Knowing that Enphase has an average return on invested capital of 14.6  over the last 5 years, investors can rest assured money is invested well. Another positive for shareholders is the end of dilution, equity raises should not be needed anymore and share buybacks are expected to easily cover stock-based compensation going forward.The third quarter is expected to be the weakest for 2023, as inventory levels are getting a correction. Nonetheless, the business is completely fine and should be back on track by 2024 with new product launches coming globally. Enphase has an edge on competitors with their highly innovative microinverters and software ecosystem that is especially user-friendly.Shares might drop lower in the coming months with the arrival of the third quarter, but I rate Enphase a 'Strong Buy' at  120 a share. At this price level, investors have a high chance to outperform the market in my opinion. If we see further downward pressure, I'll be a massive buyer of this excellent company.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

China Curbs Exports Of Battery-Making Graphite As Global Tech War Escalates,"Citing national security concerns, Beijing said onUnder the new restrictions, China will require exporters to apply for permits to ship two types of graphite, including high purity, high-hardness and high intensity synthetic graphite material, and natural flake graphite and its products.Meanwhile, it dropped temporary controls on five less sensitive graphite items used in basic industries such as steel, metallurgy, and chemicals.China dominates global supply chains of graphite, the raw material essential for EV batteries. Graphite demand is expected to riseThe EU listed natural graphite as a critical raw material in 2020. The US also considers it to be a critical and strategic mineral.Beijing s move comes days after Washington tightened controls on exports of semiconductors to China, including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by Nvidia .The EV supply chain has become a source of escalating feud between Beijing and the West. Last month, the European Union said it was weighing levying tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies.China dominates the global supply chain of critical minerals needed to make EV batteries, from material processing to the construction of cell and battery components. This is a result of Beijing s early push towards electrification, particularly through subsidising EVs.The curbs are similar to those placed in August on , key metals used to make semiconductors and electronics.Exports of the two metals had surged before the controls went into effect but have fallen in recent months. Meanwhile, prices outside China have increased.China is the world s top producer and exporter of the mineral. It also refines over 90  of the world s graphite into the anode material used in EV batteries. Top buyers of graphite from China include the US, South Korea, Japan, Poland and India, Chinese Customs data shows.Graphite can be found naturally or produced synthetically. Natural graphite is the mined graphite, which is then processed into an end-use product that can be used in the battery industry.Natural graphite is primarily mined in China and Mozambique. Synthetic graphite is produced by utilising a carbon precursor product, typically petroleum coke, needle coke or coal tar pitch, and made into graphite through a process called graphitisation.A natural graphite anode generally benefits from smaller costs and lower energy consumption than a synthetic anode. But synthetic graphite is popular thanks to its higher purity and most lithium-ion batteries rely on it these days.Other countries that mine graphite include Brazil, Mozambique, Russia, Madagascar, Ukraine, Norway, North Korea, Canada, and India.In 2022, China took the top spot by mining 850,000 tonnes of the mineral, accounting for 65  of the global total. Brazil came a very distant second with 87,000 tonnes while other countries mined significantly less, according to the US Geological Survey  USGS .Africa has been a recent focus for graphite exploration, with projects under development in Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, and Tanzania.Ukraine and Russia were among the top 10 producers of graphite before the conflict, according to USGS. In February last year, Ukraine halted graphite production.Operations resumed in August, however future production is uncertain as the conflict continues. As well, many countries have suspended trade relations with Russia, which has removed supplies of Russian graphite from much of the global market.Graphite is the largest component by volume in an EV battery. It makes up 95-99  of the anode  negative electrode  material in lithium-ion batteries, in varying natural and synthetic combinations.In lithium-ion batteries, graphite cannot be substituted as it helps improve electrical conductivity and acts as a host for lithium ions. Cathode, the other half of the battery, constitutes lithium, nickel and cobalt.Graphite prices are likely to rise, but China s latest move will also intensify the need to find alternative sources of this key battery material and push production out of China.Although China produces more than half of the global supply, but looking at global reserves, China is not the only option. Turkey takes the top spot  27 , followed by Brazil  22 , with the two countries owning half of the world s natural graphite resources. China comes third at 16 , according to data from the USGS.Some EV manufacturers have already moved to diversifying supply chains away from China. Earlier this year, Tesla  signed a supply deal with Australia s Magnis Energy Technologies , which produces graphite concentrate in Tanzania.Meanwhile, graphite consumption is expected to continue to increase, owing largely to growth from the EV market. A total of 14  of all new cars sold were electric in 2022, up from around 9  in 2021 and less than 5  in 2020.Global  10 million last year alone   and this level of growth isn't expected to slow any time soon, with almost one in five new cars sold worldwide this year set to be electric.The battery end-use market for graphite has grown by 250  globally since 2018, according to USGS. Besides EVs, graphite is commonly used in the semiconductor, aerospace, chemical and steel industries.The energy transition has become a pillar of policy for many governments, while global trade and political tensions have prompted a reconsideration of global supply lines.The global incidence of export restrictions on critical raw materials has increased more than five-fold in the last decade. In recent years, about 10  of the global value of exports of critical raw materials faced at least one export restriction measure, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD .China s graphite export restrictions are just a part of the global trend, with several other countries having taken greater control of their resources. Chile nationalised its lithium industry earlier this year, while Indonesia banned exports of nickel ore in 2020.We believe the rise in resource nationalism could slow down the pace and increase the cost of the energy transition, impacting the scale of investments, supply and prices. Meanwhile,  will continue to play an increasingly large role in the future of EV supply chains.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Energy Income Weekly: Oil's Bull Run Gains Momentum,"It was another strong week for the energy sector. Yet again, energy gained while the S P 500 and Nasdaq declined. The XLE  rose by 3.4 , and all energy sub-sectors posted gains. The E P-weighted XOP On the commodity side, WTI rose for its seventh straight week, continuing a trend that began in June and strengthened in July. Since bottoming on June 12, WTI is up 24 . The turn aligns with our call for higher oil prices made throughout the first half of the year.Higher oil prices are ending the year-to-date price leadership of growth names in the Nasdaq. Many tech valuations reached absurdly high levels, particularly when viewed against interest rate levels. Fortunately, the scales are being tipped in favor of energy takingOil fundamentals have been improving in the second half as if on cue. On Friday, the IEA released its August Oil Market Report, which reported that global oil demand reached a record 103 million barrels per day  bpd  in June. The agency continues to expect a massive supply deficit that will reduce global oil inventories by more than 300 million barrels in the second half of the year.Since oil prices and inventory levels are inversely correlated, these draws bode well for higher oil prices over at least the next few months.During the week, Brent crude backwardation surged to its highest levels of the year. Backwardation implies that demand for barrels today exceeds demand for barrels at a later date. This pricing is characteristic of a supply shortage.Backwardation in WTI is also surging. But despite the surge from Wednesday through Friday, WTI was essentially flat. The bullish fundamentals but lackluster price action is the result of a battle between oil bulls and bears around the  84 level, which has served as resistance to higher prices since late-2022. Continued backwardation and the inventory draws likely to ensure will increase the upward pressure on WTI prices until they breach resistance and head toward  90 per barrel.Among other fundamental metrics, refining margins are healthy, pointing to robust demand. Unfortunately, they may be healthy for oil investors  comfort due to a mix of growing demand, low refined product inventories, and relatively low refinery utilization. After all, the end user of oil-derived products pays the cost of crude oil   refining margins   transportation, storage, and other fees   taxes when they buy a gallon of fuel. The higher refining margins go, the more expensive oil-derived products become even if crude prices stay flat. The concern for oil investors is that refining margins spike and increase the price of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to a point that reduces demand and sends oil prices lower. Something along these lines occurred in 2022. The high refining margins throughout that year as shown in the chart below.The chart also shows the sharp increase that has occurred over recent weeks. Only integrated producers that own refineries like the oil majors, Suncor Energy , and, to a lesser extent, Cenovus Energy  can capture the high refining margins.With oil demand healthy, production growth from current levels should remain subdued. Sources of immediate production growth are few, reducing the chance of a surprise supply surge over the coming months. Iran has been the source of additional supply since mid-2022 when the Biden administration stopped enforcing U.S. sanctions against Iran s oil exports and allowed it to run down 50 million barrels of floating storage. The following chart shows the ramp in Iranian production.Iran has up to an additional 250,000 bpd of supply potential, which we expect to arrive by year-end.Outside of Iran, the U.S. and Canada could add 350,000 bpd this year, while Brazil could add another 200,000 bpd or so in early 2024. This production won t be able to offset the supply deficit that is likely for the second half of this year and for the full-year 2024, absent a global recession.Global strategic petroleum reserves  SPRs  were tapped to the tune of more than 250 million barrels in 2022. SPRs are intended to cover 90 days of crude oil imports. After last year s drawdown, the U.S. SPR currently maintains enough supply to last slightly more than 50 days during an emergency with no oil imports. This level is low enough to ensure that the administration would have to expend significant political capital to initiate a further material drawdown without facing a political backlash.So looking at supply and demand, oil prices have room to run in the second half of the year. Our thesis remains intact. Select E Ps are still cheaply priced relative to our oil price expectations. We recommend CVE, SU, Canadian Natural Resources , MEG Energy , and Cardinal Energy  as our favorite ways to profit from higher oil prices.On the earnings front, ONEOK  reported  971 million in Adjusted EBITDA, beating consensus expectations of  930 million by 4.4 . The company also raised its full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance by 2.5 , excluding the impact of the insurance settlement related to its Medford processing plant. OKE continues to execute. Last week, Magellan Midstream Partners  reported Adjusted EBITDA of  386 million, beating expectations of  354 million by a whopping 9 . Over the coming days, we ll see the voting results for OKE s proposed acquisition of MMP. If OKE wins, it will have created a midstream juggernaut sporting the highest sustainable returns on capital in midstream. If it loses, well, things could get interesting.

We  WES from our portfolio on July 11 to buy Equitrans Midstream .The miss was attributable to higher-than-expected expenses, mostly due to cost inflation related to utilities and personnel. WES also lowered its full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance by 5  due to unexpected  producer operational challenges that appeared during the second quarter,  including delays in wells coming to market and well performance issues. Management failed to elaborate, but well-performance issues in the Delaware Basin could be a cause for concern for WES and perhaps others if they persist.On the positive side, WES increased its natural gas, NGL, and crude oil throughput volumes from its Delaware Basin assets. However, even the improved result fell below management s initial expectations.Despite the underwhelming results, we remain positive on WES s long-term prospects. Growing Delaware Basin volumes are likely to offset declining DJ Basin volumes in terms of their impact on WES s financial results. For the units to really outperform, however, Occidental Petroleum  will have to increase its drilling activity in the DJ Basin.

"WEC Energy: Fully Valued, Buy The Dip Or The Preferred For Higher Yield","WEC Energy Group  is a utility that has existed in various forms since it began in Milwaukee in the 1890s. The current version of the business emerged as a holding company in 1986. WEC providesIn the states of Wisconsin and Michigan, WEC sells electricity and natural gas. Natural gas is also provided to portions of Illinois  including the city of Chicago  and Minnesota. A map of the service areas is presented below. WEC is the only utility choice in most of its markets and the Wisconsin operations generate about two-thirds of the company's business. The  has a full list of the company'sWEC shares are currently trading at  82.45 down 23.4  from a recent peak of  107.69 in August 2022, with a dividend yield of 3.78 . The current beta is 0.44, so the stock is significantly less volatile than the market. WEC is perceived as a premier Mid-Western utility and in my opinion, you are paying for perceived quality in addition to the dividend. This company in many ways reminds me of Consolidated Edison  - it's a strong investment, but shares never seem to be as cheap as you'd like them to be. Below is a chart of the share price history over the last five years.In its  report, WEC Energy reaffirmed its 2023 annual earnings guidance of  4.58 to  4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year  i.e., no warm spells that would reduce energy consumption . That said, the  indicates that WEC exceeded its guidance for each of the last 19 years  as this appears to be consistent, I believe EPS will be closer to  4.65 or higher  a number I'll use to value the company's shares in a later section . During the last 20 years earnings per share have grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 9.0  as illustrated below. If that's true again this year, EPS would be  4.86. However, the company estimates current growth of 6.5-7.0 . If we use this number, 2023 EPS would be about  4.75. My estimate of  4.65 could be conservative, therefore.According to 2023 Q2 results that were published, second-quarter earnings were  0.92 cents,  0.08 cents higher than the consensus. According to the CEO   After a down first quarter marked by one of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter. And we're firmly on track for a strong 2023.  Net income was  289.7 million for the second quarter of 2023, up slightly from  287.5 million or  0.91 per share in 2022. For the first six months of 2023, the company had a net income of  797.2 million, or  2.52 per share, down 6.6  from  853.4 million, or  2.70 per share in the first half of 2022, again due to a record warm weather last winter. Despite this short-term setback, WEC is still on track to meet or exceed its guidance.In 2022, revenues were  9.59 billion, up 15.3  from  8.32 billion in 2021. In 2020 revenue was  7.24 billion. Net income was  1.41 billion in 2022, up 8.5  from  1.30 billion in 2021, and up 18.5  from  1.19 billion in 2020. The increase in net income in 2022 was partly achieved by a decrease in operating costs during the year. Another portion of the 2022 increase in income  a not insignificant  45.2 million  was created by higher government Production Tax Credits, from the company's Jayhawk Wind Park, which recently began operation, plus higher generation volume at other wind parks, per the 2022 Annual Report.WEC's  page says the company currently has 7,700 megawatts of power generating capacity. In 2005, 73.0  of the power generated was done using coal  in 2021 that number dropped to 39.0 , with natural gas electric generation making up the difference and going from  between those years. The company's present goal is to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris Climate Accords, so it plans to reduce carbon emissions from its electric generation to  60  below 2005 levels by 2025 and 80  below 2005 levels by 2030.  By 2050, WEC hopes to be  net carbon neutral.  The near-term amount budgeted to achieve this goal is  20.1 billion, to be spent over the next five years, through 2027. A significant part of this is earmarked for creating renewable energy infrastructure. About  5.4 billion of the amount will be spent for new regulated solar, battery storage, and wind developments in the state of Wisconsin. Another  will be spent to replace outdated infrastructure, and another  2.0 billion will be invested in  unregulated renewable energy infrastructure, with higher returns than WEC's rate-regulated businesses.Over the last five years, WEC has already retired more than 1,800 megawatts, or 23.4 , of its coal generation capacity. The goal by 2026 is to retire another 1,600 megawatts of coal, taking the percentage up to 44.2 . This lost capacity is expected to be replaced with solar and wind generation.The holding company WEC consists of a basket of regulated utilities. As of October 2023, the allowed return on equity ranged from 9.05  to 10.52  depending on the entity and the state, as outlined in the table below.For 2024, Wisconsin rates are under review and there are proposed rate increases of between 0.5  and 1.3  for electric and between 2.9  and 4.5  for natural gas, per the . A final decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. This adjustment addresses the recovery for new renewable costs. The Wisconsin Commission has already approved more than  1 billion of capital investment costs for these since the end of 2021. In Wisconsin, WEC rates are based on a  forward test and an earnings-sharing rate  over its allowed return on equity. The state is generally considered favorable for utility regulations.Rising interest rates have had some impact on the company since the Fed began raising rates. Interest expenses for the Wisconsin and Illinois segments of the business increased during calendar 2022, mostly due to long-term debt that was issued in late 2021. Below is the ratio of total debt to capitalization since 2015, which you can see has been rising slowly, but steadily, not necessarily following the Fed's increases in rates but rather tracking increased capital expenditures.In January of 2023, WEC raised its quarterly dividend by 7.2  to  0.78 per share from  0.728 per quarter. This is the 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. If it continues this trend, which I believe it will, WEC will be a member of the  in 2028, where members have increased their dividends for a minimum of 25 years. Increases in the last few years have been in excess of 7.0 , so generally exceeding inflation, which is important  7.4  in 2022, 7.1  in 2021, and 7.2  in 2020. Over the last 20 years, the dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10.8 . While it made healthy increases through the 2008-2010 financial crisis, it is also important to note that in 2000, WEC cut its dividend from  0.195 per quarter to  0.10 and left it there for three and a half years. At the time, the dividend was cut to finance , including coal-fired electricity generating plants.In recent years, the payout ratio for WEC has been in a narrow range of 65.0-68.0 . The exact payout ratio over time is presented below. This assumes 2023 income reaches the average  though, as previously stated, probably low  consensus number of  4.61 per share. The Edison Electric Institute cites the utility average  as 69.4 , but ratios do vary widely from companies like Xcel Energy  at 63.9 , to Alliant Energy  at 78.6 , Consolidated Edison at 45.9 , and American Electric Power  at 76.6 . The Institute also reports the average utility dividend yield for 2022 as 3.4 .Utility shares have been trending lower lately, as interest rates have increased, boosting yields across the board. You can compare the current 3.78  yield at WEC to other utility stocks such as Xcel at 3.5 , PPL Corporation  at 4.0 , Southern Company  at 4.17 , Consolidated Edison at 3.67 , American Electric Power at 4.42 , and Spire Incorporated  at 4.9 . It is also worth comparing to an index like ProShares Ultra Utilities  with a current dividend yield of 2.89   and down 32.8  from its peak price  or Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  at 3.6   down 19.2  from its peak . But it is also important to note that WEC Energy has two series of preferred shares.There are two series of preferred shares outstanding at WEC  the M Shares  and the P Shares , also known as the 6.0  series and the 3.6  series, respectively. These both trade on the OTC Markets and are rated Baa1 by Moody's, or lower investment grade. I searched and could not find a prospectus online for either series, as apparently, both debuted before EDGAR, though  is their transfer agent. I also called WEC's Investor Relations on this issue and have yet to hear back. Both series were issued at  100 a share. The 6.0  series, WELPM, pays  1.50 quarterly and currently , a slight discount from the original  100 issue price, with a yield of 6.1 . These are reportedly  and with no stated maturity. The 3.6  preferred shares, WELPP, are currently trading at a discounted  and pay  0.90 quarterly for a yield of 6.0 . These are reportedly  but I would think the 3.6  Series would be left outstanding by the company, given its now below-market rate. Volume on both of these is less than 1,000 shares per day. Perhaps a reader has access to these prospectuses.WEC Energy reaffirmed its 2023 annual earnings guidance of  4.58 to  4.62 per share, but as indicated in the 2023 Investor Presentation, WEC has exceeded its guidance for each of the last 19 years. This appears to be a consistency, so I have used  4.65 to value the company's shares, though this is likely low. WEC Energy also has a narrow 6.5 -7  annual earnings growth target.I estimate the current value of WEC shares to be US  83.42, so at today's price of  82.45, shares are about fully valued. I used a discounted cash flow to value the stock, with my rounded-up earnings per share of  4.65, beginning in 2023, and then projecting forward. In this case, I have used a 5-year projection period. For the discount rate, I looked at the average annual return of the S P 500. The long-term average , while over the last 10 years it has been higher . I used a discount rate of 9.25 , just below the lower end of the range, and discounting beginning in the second year. As a regulated utility, I believe WEC deserves a lower risk premium.Below are WEC's annual earnings since 2018. Between 2018 and 2023, the compound annual growth rate in earnings per share was 6.8 , within the company's stated range. Morningstar forecasts a median 6.0  annual EPS and dividend growth across the overall utility sector. This is also supported by , which has projected 6.0  per year growth for utilities over the next three years.I have valued the shares using my projected EPS of  4.65 in 2023, then a 6.0  growth rate in net income each year over the next five years and a 9.25  discount rate. I have estimated a reversion rate of 6.5 , to account for future growth.Although much of the utilities sector is selling at a discount  Morningstar says the current median P E of 16 is the lowest since exiting the 2008-09 recession , WEC shares appear to be fully valued. As a cross-check, I have valued the shares using a traditional P E ratio calculation for gas utility companies. Gabelli Funds has a useful chart indicating that the average US Large Electric utility ratio for 2024 would be 16.3. Applying this to the estimated 2023 earnings per share, the value would be  4.65 x 16.3    75.80. At the 2023 P E ratio of 17.0, shares would be  4.65 x 17.0    79.05. Given the current price of  82.45 and these two similar value estimates, shares appear to be fully valued.In its service areas, WEC Energy has no direct competition. Rate regulations seem favorable in the primary Wisconsin market it serves. It does seem that one of the major risks to income is unseasonably warm weather, as happened in the winter of 2023. Of course, a warm winter means less usage. However, this could be offset by the possibility of a warmer than usual summer, which would also boost demand for energy, just with different timing. The other risk is further increases in interest rates, which could create higher debt-carrying costs and make a 3.5-5.0  dividend-paying stock less attractive than a 5.25  paying money market fund. I believe WEC is unlikely to cut its dividend again, as it did in 2000.WEC is a stable and growing utility with a cohesive plan to move away from coal. It is a quality business and that quality comes at a premium. The current P E ratio ranges from 18 to 19.0 times earnings, depending on the day, while the average large electric utility currently has a P E ratio of 16.0. I do think WEC is a strong long-term dividend play, with some potential share price upside. Again, like Consolidated Edison, the shares may never be as cheap as you'd like them to be. The key is buying under  80 per share, but even at a price of  75.00 per share, the dividend yield is only 4.2   WEC shares only went as low as  74.00 in the March 2020 selloff . I would personally buy the stock under  80.00  it is appropriate for dividend investors who can accept the  decent  dividend, but with an annual growth rate of 7.0 , well above inflation. But the two series of 6.0  preferred shares are likely a stronger option for dividend investors, you just need to get a hold of the prospectuses.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The energy needed to train GPT-3 could power an average American's home for more than 120 years, according to a .Meantime, Bay Area chipmaker Nvidia  notes that energy requirements for training models that include transformers - a form of deep-learning architecture - have increased by 275 times every two years.AI's energy consumption will come from many corners. In addition to training and running large models, the proliferation of AI-assisted products, including AI search and chatbots, will gobble up terawatts.Increasingly complex models will, in turn, require the use of more specialized hardware, such as graphic processing units  GPUs . The good news is that GPUs deliver much more performance-per-watt than traditional central processing units  CPUs , which could offset the overall power requirements to train and run AI models.Ultimately, these drivers of energy consumption will accelerate the construction of power-hungry data centers, which already account for nearly 1  of global energy use, according to the International Energy Agency. Even before AI began to take off,  a sharp increase in data center construction, driven by the energy needs of new technologies.There's also the issue of emissions to consider. In particular, investors are pushing companies to measure - upstream and downstream emissions that can be difficult to quantify. As AI use increases, the Scope 3 emissions of all data users - including firms that traditionally have low carbon footprints - are likely to grow correspondingly.Fortunately, companies are beginning to address the enormous AI energy challenge. These include firms that are central to AI and those only nibbling at the periphery. We think investors should pay attention to three key areasHardware and Software  Reducing AI-related energy use will require new processor architectures. US semiconductor makers like AMD  and Nvidia are focused on delivering more energy-efficient performance.In fact, AMD has set a goal of increasing the energy efficiency of its processors and accelerators used in AI training and high-performance computing by 30 times over a five-year period.According to Nvidia, its GPU-based servers in some applications, such as large-language model training, use 25 times less energy than CPU-based alternatives. As GPUs from AMD, Nvidia and others take share from CPUs in data centers, energy efficiency should increase even further.Conserving energy will also require advanced transistor-packaging techniques. Technologies such as dynamic voltage frequency scaling and thermal management will be required to produce more efficient machine learning.We believe companies involved in semiconductor chip production and inspection, including Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC  and Netherlands-based ASML , will have a significant role to play in bringing these new innovations to market.Investors will also be hearing more about power semiconductors, which help improve the power management of AI servers and data centers. Power semiconductors regulate current and can lower overall energy use by integrating more functionality in smaller footprints.Firms like Kirkland, Washington-based Monolithic Power Systems  and German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon Technologies  are at the forefront of their development, in our view.Improvements in Data Center Design  As AI adoption fuels the expansion of data center capacity, firms that supply data center components could reap benefits.Key components include power supplies, optical networking, memory systems and cabling. Tech companies that use the data centers themselves - think Amazon.com , Google   and Microsoft  - also have a strong incentive to continue improving data center design and energy consumption.Coming full circle, AI itself is being used to optimize data center operations. In 2022, Google DeepMind released the results of a three-month experiment that involved training a learning agent called BCOOLER to optimize Google's data center cooling procedures.The result  BCOOLER achieved roughly 13  energy savings - underscoring that energy efficiency is improving in data centers, even as their numbers grow.Renewable Energy  Renewables made up 21.5  of US electricity generation in 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration. With 80  of the US power grid nonrenewable, near-term power could come from traditional fossil fuels.But over time, AI demand could open the door for more renewable energy use. That's especially true given that AI data centers will be operated by the likes of Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, Inc., whose net-zero policies are among the industry's best. As a result, we expect that accelerated adoption of AI could improve the investment prospects of the entire renewable-power ecosystem.In all these areas, we believe that investors should search for quality companies with a technological advantage, persistent pricing power, healthy free-cash-flow generation and resilient business models.Companies with strong fundamentals that are poised to participate in and benefit from increased demand for energy-efficient AI capabilities could provide attractive opportunities for equity investors with a sustainable focus and those with an absolute-return mandate.As AI adoption accelerates and search engines are replaced by chatbots, the energy impact of this revolutionary form of machine learning should not be overlooked.Initiatives aimed at creating a more energy-efficient AI ecosystem might not be in the spotlight now, but they could eventually unlock attractive return potential for investors who can spot the potential solutions early.Claire Walter, Research Analyst - Sustainable Thematic Equities, contributed to this analysis.

Crypto's Crossroads: Where Does Riot Platforms Stand?,"Riot Platforms  finds itself in a consolidation phase after an impressive rally, largely due to the recent shifts in the crypto landscape.When I wrote  Riot was, for me, one of the biggest bargains inThis optimism, however, is juxtaposed against mining giants grappling with escalating energy expenses and less-than-enticing prices for their primaryCompounding the challenges for miners is the heightened scrutiny on crypto exchanges, accentuated by events like the FTX  downfall. While there's a clear demarcation between crypto exchanges and the short-term price action of Bitcoin  and associated mining outfits by extension , adverse news stories inevitably cast shadows on the broader industry. Previously, Bitcoin's wild price surges overshadowed many of the structural issues within the mining sector. Its recent price stabilization, although a positive sign for its long-term prospects, has taken the shine off many mining equities. This leads to an intriguing investor conundrum  invest in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency or its minersFor those immersed in the Bitcoin world,  Bitcoin halving  is a seminal event. Having taken place thrice since 2009, this procedure critically impacts the quantity of new Bitcoins in the market. Unlike the whims of central banks that can fluidly change money supply, Bitcoin's inherent deflationary blueprint is unique. The halvings of 2012, 2016, and 2020 decreased miners' rewards consistently.As we inch closer to 2024, there are more and more murmurs about the impending halving on April 25th, where the mining reward will decline to 3.125 BTC per block. Though it sounds detrimental for miners on the surface, it's fundamental to Bitcoin's longevity and value. Draw a parallel to gold  mining it becomes tougher over time. Similarly, each Bitcoin halving event ensures the cryptocurrency's increased scarcity. Given its finite supply of 21 million coins, each halving inches us nearer to this ceiling. Historically, such events have often ushered in substantial bullish trends, but these runs can take some time to happen - which some miners may not have.This dynamic poses a dilemma for potential mining stock investors. Cryptocurrency mining corporations frequently hold substantial amounts of tokens, anticipating higher future prices. While halvings typically signal a bullish trend for Bitcoin, the reduced rewards necessitate miners to ramp up hash rates and, subsequently, energy consumption. Given the historic profitability challenges in the Bitcoin mining domain, the evolving landscape suggests that investors exercise prudence.Riot Platforms has commendably maintained consistent production figures despite disruptions. The real story here, however, is Riot's strategy of liquidating most of its monthly production.Author's estimatesThis move significantly bolsters their liquidity stance, a much-needed respite, especially recalling the liquidity issues that plagued the industry not too long ago, culminating in unfortunate episodes like Core Scientific's  bankruptcy.Historically, mining entities opted for heavy dilutions to safeguard their Bitcoin reserves. With the recent industry-wide valuation crunch, there's been a discernible shift towards selling tokens as they're mined. Yet, Riot has impressively grown its treasury, with production consistently outpacing sales over the past quarter. Furthermore, their average net selling price for Bitcoin has remained robust at around  26,000, even though it pales in comparison to Bitcoin's peak of  67,000 in recent memory.A pressing concern for Riot and the industry at large is the unmistakable vacuum left by Bitcoin's stagnation. This standstill in Bitcoin prices has allowed the inherent challenges of crypto mining to surface, casting a cloud over the once-bright investment prospects of several mining companies. A cursory look at recent financial data reveals a series of concerning EPS misses for Riot, indicating that this trend may persist unless Bitcoin undergoes another significant rally.Predicting the next big surge in the crypto domain is akin to reading tea leaves. The trade has taken on a speculative hue, especially as murmurs of an impending recession grow louder, even amid seemingly buoyant unemployment figures.It's essential to note that a recession could be particularly devastating for the crypto realm. In such scenarios, investors often liquidate non-essential assets, with cryptocurrencies likely being high on the chopping block. This is to reinforce liquidity in preparation for uncertain economic times. Furthermore, one must exercise caution before heralding a recession's end. Drawing parallels from the past, peak unemployment rates post the 2008-2009 recession didn't manifest until 2010, well after the Federal Reserve ceased its tightening measures.Absent a substantial upward movement, Riot might find itself leaning on external sources such as dilution or financing to bolster its coffers. The issue  In a recessive environment, tapping into these resources becomes increasingly challenging. That said, Riot's impressive cash balance, a testament to its steadfast leadership, shines as a silver lining. This financial buffer positions Riot favorably to weather economic storms. The crux, however, lies in discerning the valuation at which it emerges on the other side.While the broader crypto landscape has been tested by Bitcoin's price stagnation and intensifying challenges in the mining sector, Riot's operational strategy offers a promising blueprint. Their decision to regularly liquidate a substantial portion of their monthly production safeguards their liquidity, a crucial move given the industry's historical liquidity pitfalls. It shows that management is focused on survivability, which I agree with. The problem is that the solution for Riot's profitability challenges is completely out of the company's control. This gives a speculative feel that is often acceptable with crypto miners. There are potential tailwinds on the horizon, like the possible proliferation of Bitcoin ETFs, but there are also some notable challenges. I believe we will see some prolonged cooling down in the space for this reason, and will look forward to lower prices to rebuild my position. Until then, Riot Platforms is a .

Baker Hughes: The LNG Boom Can Be A Catalyst For This Stock,"Baker Hughes Company  is one of the largest providers of oilfield services and equipment  OFS  globally. It competes with the other two OFS majors, Schlumberger  and Halliburton , asStructurally, I am very bullish on OFS stocks , particularly those with offshore or international exposure, or even select North America onshore service providers that differentiate themselves through state-of-the-art technology or a more robust customer base.In addition to checking the offshore and international boxes, Baker Hughes also has a large industrial and energy technology  IET  business that supplies equipment  e.g., gas turbines  and services to the liquefied natural gas  LNG  value chain.As bullish as you may be on oil, you have to acknowledge that a recession will temporarily bring down oil prices and investment. However, that isn'tIn a sudden change of heart, governments started to worry about energy security, which has led to a record number of LNG final investment decisions  FIDs , both on the export  liquefaction plants  and import  regasification  sides  shipyard orders for LNG tankers are also at record highs . In a paradoxical move, perhaps underscoring how politically driven the whole energy transition debate has become, the EU parliament even voted last year to .Oil isn't robust to consumer  gasoline, jet fuel  or industry  petrochemical  demand but natural gas is less cyclical due to its use for power generation and heating. As Europe and Asia are short on gas, that gas has to be brought from elsewhere and this requires investment in LNG infrastructure. No matter which way things go for oil, the LNG boom will continue to be a tailwind for Baker Hughes.I have laid out the macro foundations of my OFS thesis in prior articlesThe cornerstone of the OFS bull thesis is that we find ourselves in the early stages of a multiyear capex cycle, not unlike 2002-2014, and will see increased spend across the energy value chain while the services capacity remains tight due to 2014-2020 attrition.The initial recovery in energy equities post-pandemic left the OFS sector behindBack in 2021, the mainstream narrative was that upstream producers  would shy away from new investment while gradually depleting their developed production base to maximize oil price realizations and cash flows. Under this  capital discipline  model, OFS would see limited gains.However, this narrative wasn't fully correct. Since 2022, OFS stocks have performed relatively better than upstreamApart from the energy security wake up call, there are a couple other reasons why the narrative has shifted from  capital discipline  to  capex supercycleRight now, U.S. drilling rigs, considered a profit driver for much of the OFS industry, are downThis weighs on the OFS sector although the U.S. is more of an outlier here. International rigs Even U.S. offshore rigs aren't downThe negative press for OFS is largely reflective of U.S. shale where mostly smaller, private operators were forced to reduce rigsOutside of North America, there are few signs that OFS demand is stalling.Natural gas makes a lot of sense as a transitional fuel. It emits almost 50  less carbon than coal, provides reliable baseload and is fairly abundant. Pipeline infrastructure achieves a lower transportation cost than LNG, but as the European woes last winter showed, pipelines also create mutual dependency on both sides of the trade. In contrast, LNG allows an importer to source from multiple potential suppliers and the spot trade as a proportion of total volumes has been increasing over time.Unfortunately, it took European gas prices skyrocketing to  100 per MMBtu  equivalent to  600-barrel oil  for policymakers to understand the benefitsIn the typical reactive fashion of our age, we are now looking at record investments in the LNG sector. According to the International Gas Union's 2023 LNG report  my highlightsFor context, the 2022 LNG trade was about 400 MTPA  metric tons per annum  or about 50 bcf d. Adding close to 1000 MTPA would basically triple the potential market size. For further reference, U.S. total gas supply runs at about 100 bcf d and the global market  LNG and non-LNG  is probably about 400 bcf d now. In other words, LNG could expand from 10-15  of the global gas market to more than 30 .Investment is going strong on the regasification  import  side tooMuch of the new liquefaction  export  capacity is expected to come from North America, mostly the U.S. but also from some important steps in CanadaThe LNG trend isn't easy to convert into an investable idea. Many LNG projects are joint ventures among oil majors, utilities and even private investment. Some  pure play  ideas include Cheniere  on the liquefaction side or New Fortress Energy  and Excelerate Energy  on the regasification side.However, as much as spot volumes are growing, the majority of the LNG trade is still a long-term business with offtake contracts going up to 20 years. So for Cheniere, New Fortress or others the return on their capex will get realized over a longer time period. Instead, through Baker Hughes we can approach LNG from a different angle and focus on the LNG equipment orders that will be frontloaded.In these times of  greenflation  and rising raw materials costs it is perhaps also prudent to side not with the developer but with the contractor - or even the supplier to the contractor as BKR doesn't itself construct the LNG terminals. Baker's competitors in the space are mostly general industrial firms such as Siemens on Mitsubishi, for which LNG would be a very low contribution to the profit line.LNG featured prominently during Baker Hughes' The company is converting the macro pull into orders and backlog, including the Rio Grande FID which  by NextDecade In fact, BKR went on to increase its guidance for the IET segmentThe IET segment which serves the LNG industry is still smaller than the OFS offering by EBITDAHowever, IET is quite material and a differentiator from SLB or HAL. Further, Baker's management says that 73  of the OFS revenue is international, which means it should also benefit from the long-cycle upstream capex boom.Wall Street gives only 10  upside to BKRI think there may be more upside. Consensus revenue estimates are  28 billion for 2024 and almost  30 billion for 2025. During past OFS cycles, the OFS majors have been able to expand their EBITDA margins to 20This implies BKR can achieve  5.5 to  6.0 billion EBITDA. Historically, when things were good  that is, EBITDA was already high , valuations were in the 8 to 10x rangeAt 9x EBITDA of  5.5 billion, Baker's EV would be close to  50 billion. This implies 30  upside for the equity.The risks  I think at a macro level the LNG exposure de-risks Baker Hughes compared to SLB or HAL. However, investors should watch if management is able to control the corporate overhead. So far, BKR hasn't been able to replicate the cost reductions seen by its peersBaker Hughes has been through a number of reorganization efforts, namely the failed merger with Halliburton in 2016 and the merger with GE's oil and gas unit in 2017  which brought in the LNG business , followed by the spin off from GE.These efforts can add cost, advisory fees for external consultants and be a distraction for the employeesThis is what management said on the earnings callWe'll have to see when they are done  re-wiring the organization.  In my view, achieving a steady organization state is a necessary condition to control the overhead.Baker Hughes can be an interesting idea in the OFS space for up to 30  upside if things go well. While rivals SLB and HAL are more of bets on upstream oilfield spend, for BKR the exposure to rising investment in LNG infrastructure is a differentiator. The ongoing record FIDs in this space can be a catalyst for the stock.

Canadian Natural Resources Is One Of The Best Oil Stocks Money Can Buy," I finally pulled the trigger on a stock I've had on my watchlist since the day I first researched it. Last month, I deployed a big portion ofWhen I say that the company behind the CNQ ticker is one of the best oil companies on Earth, I'm serious. CNQ has everything I'm looking for in an energy stock. This includes deep reserves, low breakeven prices, a healthy balance sheet, a great dividend track record, and the aim to distribute almost every penny of excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks. Especially at a time when US shale production, which was the global supply engine between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021, is running out of momentum, I think investors need to be prepared for a prolonged period of elevated energy prices and invest in companies with deep reserves in a time when most are running out of tier 1 drilling inventory. Currently, the Permian is the only basin in the US capable of strong growth. All other major basins have gone sideways since the pandemic.Now, even the Permian is expected to reach peak production at the end of next year, as I discussed in a recent . On top of these  bullish  secular long-term developments,  Arabia is determined to defend  80 Brent by all means necessary, which is currently adding to the oil price rally. That's where CNQ comes in. Not only do I need investments to protect my portfolio against inflation, but it's also a terrific income vehicle with the potential to outperform its peers and the market by a wide margin.So, let's get to the detailsAs its  65 billion market cap may suggest, Canadian Natural Resources is a giant. In the second quarter, the company achieved a quarterly production of around 1.19 million BOEs  barrels of oil equivalent  per day, including natural gas production of about 2.1 bcf per day and production of liquids of roughly 847,000 barrels per day.These numbers were influenced by operational impacts from wildfires in Western Canada, third-party pipeline outages, and planned turnaround activities.The wildfires led to temporary shutdowns of some assets between May and July, with no significant damage reported. Most of the production affected by the wildfires has been restored, which is the biggest takeaway when it comes to these fires. Furthermore, oil production from international assets remained steady. Heavy oil production in 2Q23 increased by 15  compared to the prior-year quarter, supported by strong drilling results counteracting natural field declines.Operating costs for heavy oil decreased primarily due to lower natural gas fuel costs.With that in mind, the company has more than 30 years of proven reserves, which beats its average peer by more than ten years. Last year, the company's new reserves exceeded production, which shows that the company has way more than 30 years' worth of high-quality production, which protects it against forced M A deals down the road - the same cannot be said about a wide range of peers. Adding to that, the company is breakeven at roughly  40 WTI, which makes it one of the most efficient oil producers in the world. It also helps that the company has a very healthy balance sheet. The company ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x EBITDA and remains well-prepared in terms of liquidity, boasting substantial resources such as revolving bank facilities, cash reserves, and short-term investments. As of the end of 2Q, the company's liquidity stood at an impressive  5.6 billion.According to my calculations, the company ended the second quarter with  12.1 billion in net debt. Going into 2024, it could reach its target of  10 billion. Once the net debt level has reached  10 billion, the company sees no need to lower it further, as it has pledged to distribute all of its free cash flow to shareholders. In this case, the company beats most of its peers that have pledged to distribute between 70  and 80  of free cash flow. A big part of its distribution consists of dividends. The company has a history of 23 consecutive dividend increases, which include the Great Financial Crisis, the 2015 2016 oil price slump, and the pandemic. After a 5.9  hike in March, the current dividend is  0.90 per share per quarter, which translates to a yield of 4.5 . This excludes special dividends. Last year, the company paid a special dividend of  1.50, which brought last year's total dividend to  4.60. This would indicate a yield of 5.7  using the current stock price. When adding buybacks, the total distribution yield was roughly 12 . I expect this rate to remain high based on my bullish oil price thesis and the fact that the company's implied free cash flow yield is high. At  85 WTI, the company has a free cash flow yield of more than 12 .Meaning next year, the company can distribute 12  of its current market cap if its net debt load falls to  10 billion. At  100 WTI, that number rises to almost 20 . I almost feel like a snake oil salesman, but it's all based on reasonable assumptions and the company's ability to distribute cash. The year-to-date returns to shareholders, including dividends totaling  2.9 billion and share repurchases of  1.4 billion, reached a significant milestone of  4.3 billion this year. That's 6.6  of its market cap in the first half of 2023. This also contributes to the company's consistent outperformance. Over the past ten years, NY-listed CNQ shares have outperformed the energy ETF  by a wide margin. The performance even comes close to the S P 500's total return. Since 2020, CNQ and XLE have outperformed the market by a wide margin. I expect outperformance to continue, as I'm bullish on oil and believe that we will soon get a rotation from growth to value stocks, benefitting undervalued stocks like CNQ. It also needs to be said that the pending   TMX  is expected to be opened in the next few months, which will increasingly allow Canadian producers to capture better prices for their oil and reach more customers. The TMX is one of the reasons why I like Canadian oil players, in addition to their deep reserves and low breakevens. According to Oilprice.com  This brings me to the valuation. Valuing commodity-driven stocks is tricky, as the outlook depends on the price of commodities. Looking at the relationship between CNQ and WTI crude oil, we see that CNQ has gone sideways while oil has declined. There are two reasons for this divergenceBased on the company's free cash flow potential, I believe that it is about 50  undervalued if oil prices work their way up to  100 in the next 12 to 24 months. On a longer-term basis, I expect much higher gains, accompanied by aggressive buybacks and juicy special dividends. I think we've only scratched the surface when it comes to the company's ability to reward investors. If my oil price thesis bears fruit, we could be looking at a tremendous total return for many years to come.However, for now, we also need to incorporate recession fears. I do not rule out regular corrections, which I will be using to boost my position. ProsConsI couldn't be more thrilled about my recent investment in Canadian Natural Resources. With deep reserves, low breakeven prices, and a healthy balance sheet, CNQ has all the qualities I look for in an energy stock. As US shale production loses momentum and energy prices remain elevated, CNQ stands out as one of the best oil companies on Earth.Their impressive dividend track record and commitment to distributing excess free cash flow to shareholders through special dividends and buybacks make CNQ a great income vehicle that has the potential to outperform its peers and the market.Considering the projected growth in oil prices and CNQ's undervaluation, I see tremendous potential for future gains. While there might be some bumps along the way, I'm confident that CNQ's ability to reward investors makes it a solid addition to my portfolio for years to come.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

SolarEdge Technologies: Far From A Sunny Story," has been a very strong performer since its public offering at  18 per share in 2015, but it has run into some serious issues recently. Since May, shares have lost nearly three-quarters of their value  in fact, they lost more than thatWhile the pullback in the underlying results is severe, due to a myriad of factors which will be discussed further in this article, there is a long-term growth trend, sound quality products, and strong net cash balance, making the case that we are approaching interesting levels here.SolarEdge claims to be the  1 solar inverter company. The company has global operations in solar inverters, optimizers, and monitoring systems. Growth in the world's population, but moreover an electrification of economies  inSolarEdge plays a key role in this, offering integrated solutions which include EV chargers, monitoring solutions, inverters, batteries, optimizers and smart modules. Outside the residential solutions offered, the company serves commercial clients as well.The business has been on fire as it generated revenues of  300 million in 2015 when it went public, although accompanied by GAAP profitability and operating margins of around 10 . What followed was the business expanding with revenues tenfolding to  3.1 billion in 2022, as margins have typically come in around 10 . The rapid pace of growth came at the expense of some dilution, but with the share count increasing by a third since the public offering, real revenue and earnings growth on a per-share basis were rather impressive.The advancements were seen in the share price as well. Since the public offering, shares rose to the  50 mark in 2018 and broke the  100 mark pre-pandemic as shares actually rose to a high of around  350 in 2021 and 2022  in fact, they traded at these levels at various occasions .Still a  300 stock in May, shares of SolarEdge have collapsed and now trade at just  83, as demand for inverters and related products is under severe pressure. Ballooning energy prices in 2022 have retreated as the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine is less disturbing than previously thought and feared. With this factor and congestion in grids, changed subsidy regimes, and higher interest rates, demand for new PV developments has come down a great deal.In February, SolarEdge  a 58  increase in full-year sales to  3.11 billion. Operating earnings fell to  166 million, but this came after a  116 million goodwill impairment charge. Adjusted for that operating earnings of  282 million worked down to margins of 9 , down a bit from the year before.The company posted adjusted earnings of  6.38 per share while posting GAAP earnings of just  1.70 per share. The gap was caused by some ten adjustments, with the asset impairment charge being a dominant factor in this, although I am not happy to adjust for a  2.64 per share stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted for this item, earnings came in at  3.74 per share, or about  210 million in dollar terms.With 56 million shares trading around the  300 mark, at the time the company was granted a near  17 billion equity valuation, a valuation which included a billion net cash position. Note that the fourth quarter sales number of  890 million indicated that revenues trended at over  3.5 billion. This valued the operations at around 4-5 times sales, but a sky-high earnings multiple in the 70s.Following the fourth quarter earnings release, the company guided for first quarter sales at a midpoint of  930 million. In May, SolarEdge  revenues of  944 million, while reporting a very strong operating income number of  144 million. Moreover, the company guided for further growth with second quarter sales seen between  970 million and  1.01 billion.The company  second quarter results on the first day of August as revenues of  991 million came in exactly at the midpoint of the guidance, with operating earnings posted at  150 million.The headwinds which materialized during the summer were clearly seen in the outlook, as that was the reason why shares plunged to  200 overnight in August. Revenues for the third quarter were seen down to  880- 920 million.Since August, shares of SolarEdge have fallen another 40  to  120 per share, that is at least until the update of last week. SolarEdge  preliminary third quarter results with revenues seen at a midpoint of  725 million. The company attributes the very soft topline sales result to cancellations in Europe, push outs of backlogs in Europe, both the result of the tougher operating conditions.The  175 million reduction in the quarterly sales guidance had a huge impact on the bottom line with adjusted operating profits seen down by around a hundred million to  12- 31 million, with GAAP operating losses now seen between  9 and  28 million.With 56 million shares of SolarEdge trading at  83 per share, the company commands a mere  4.6 billion equity valuation here. This includes a  860 million net cash position  at least as of the end of the second quarter  indicating that the operating asset valuation comes at around  3.8 billion. This is a huge decline from earlier this year, as the sales multiple has fallen to just over 1 times.The issue is what realistic earnings look like here. Trading at  83, we see a share with a net cash position of around  15 per share, as operating assets are valued at around  68 per share. The question is about the earnings, which are non-existing at this point in time based on the preliminary results, after earnings came in at  3.50 per share last year. Based on such earnings power, the unleveraged business would trade at a market multiple near 20 times, but these were boom earnings, and of course not be replicated anytime soon based on the near-term outlook.Hence, we have some modeling to do. Assuming that the business stabilizes at a lower level, we might see a business with  2.5 billion in sales and 8  margins. Such a business might post after-tax earnings of around  150 million, close to  2.50- 3.00 per share, as some long-term growth should be seen as well.Based on such an outlook, I would believe that appeal is nearly to be seen here, certainly as the company is high quality, long-term demand for its products remains, and a strong net cash position means that financial problems should not be expected.Hence, appeal is rapidly on the increase here, and while the near term does not look too enticing, an 80  pullback since May  albeit from too high valuations from the get-go  seems like a gross overreaction, even as the near-term industry outlook remains dismal.If you like to see more ideas, please subscribe to the premium service  Value in Corporate Events   and try the free trial.

European Utilities Outlook: More Investment But More Selective In 2024,"The European utilities sector is in an important transition phase towards green energy generation and transmission. The provisional agreement in March 2023 updating the European Union s RenewableWhile every industrial sector is being asked to reduce CO2 emissions by adopting green energy consumption and other climate mitigation measures, the utilities sector is at the forefront of green electrification.Like many industries, soaring commodities and material costs are impacting the utilities sector. Purchasing, staff and financing costs, especially for offshore wind farms, have forced some utilities to terminate some of their projects.Danish utility Orsted recently announced a  2.1bn impairment charge on its US offshore wind farm projects. Soaring costs, higher interest rates and uncertainty about related subsidies are having a dramatic impact on the expected return on investment.While Vattenfall recently opened its offshore wind farm on the Dutch coast, it announced it was suspending the development of its 1.4GW Norfolk Boreas offshore wind farm intended to power 1.5 million UK homes. According to the Swedish utility, costs on the project have increased by 40 , negatively impacting the company s future earnings on the project.In September 2023, the United Kingdom failed to attract bids for its offshore wind power auctions. Offshore wind developers argued that the government s offer did not match the surging costs and higher funding expenses. The same reasons explain the poor auction results that Spain registered in December 2022. Only 50MW of wind projects were subscribed when authorities planned to allocate 3.3GW of new onshore wind power and solar panels.Capital expenditure plans are financed partly by debt, especially for network utilitieswhose regulated cash flow generation does not provide them with sufficient funds to finance investment plans in full. In 2023 and 2024, we estimate that network utilities  investment plans will surpass earnings before interest and depreciation  EBITDA  by 30 . For integrated utilities, earnings are sufficient to finance capital expenditure needs. However, EBITDA represents the revenues generated by activities when operating costs and taxes have been deducted. The financial indicator does not take into consideration interest expenses on financial debt, and the remuneration of shareholders.The utilities sector is a capital-intensive sector and European utilities are heavy users of bonds and bank loans. While investments partly need to be financed by new financial instruments, utilities also face loan and bond redemptions. On top of higher operating costs, the sector has to refinance its debt at much higher interest rates than in the last five years. Today, the sector pays an average rate of 3.7  on new five-year senior bonds. In 2022, this rate was 3  on average. In the period 2018-2021, Utilities could issue five-year senior bonds with an average coupon rate of 0.8 .In 2024, the top 40 European utilities will likely invest a total of  132bn in the maintenance and development of their grids, renewable base and conventional energy generation assets. According to their strategic plans and our estimates, this global amount compares to  126bn for the full year 2023, representing 5  growth year-on-year.Looking back to the period 2018-2022, the sector s investment plans have grown by a staggering average of 10  per year, going from c. 70bn in 2018 to  110bn in 2022.The 5  increase that we forecast for 2024 is smaller than what we have seen in the last five years. We see two reasons for thisThe shift in European integrated utilities' business models from conventional energy generation producers and suppliers  coal, natural gas and nuclear  towards renewables is reflected in past and future investments. In 2018, 33  of the total investment was dedicated to renewables. We forecast renewables to represent 52  of total investment in 2024. With conventional power generation plants being shut down or disposed of, capital expenditure for this segment is in significant decline, from 39  in 2018 to 22  in 2024.In 2024, we estimate that 70  of the investments made by European integrated utilities will be earmarked for Europe with 30  outside the region, a ratio similar to 2023. Internationally, European integrated utilities' favourite destinations are North, South and Central America. The United States has been an attractive place for renewable investments through fiscal incentives. At the beginning of 2023, the Biden Administration s Inflation Reduction Act restarted a US 10bn tax credit for clean energy producers. Due to their historical ties with Latin and Central America, Southern European utilities have and continue to invest heavily in these regions. With strong growth potential for renewable energy demand and grid services in these regions, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian integrated utilities are committing up to 60  of their total investments outside their European market presence.1 2 This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

NexTier Oilfield Solutions: Consider Taking Some Profits After The Rally,"The regional banking worries back in March, on the back of already crashing natural gas  prices, opened up a decent value opportunity among some premium onshore oilfield services names, including NexTier Oilfield Solutions The fundamental part of my argument seems to be largely holding out so far. Onshore oilfield activity indeed moderated but it didn't fall through the floor. NexTier, as well as other onshore services companies, are now calling the bottom sometime this Q3.On the other hand, the 40  run-up has closed up the valuation gap to some extent. Forward P E was at 2.6x when I wrote the . It has since risen to 4.2xItNonetheless, since the announcement, one NEX share is basically worth 0.752 PTEN shares based on the merger terms so the NEX price now rather reflects the prospects of the future company. I do think the PTEN-NEX combination will be a powerhouse for the reasons I covered before, but the market will probably want to see some evidence the merger is working out.The two managements have promised, for example,  200 million in annual synergies, which by my earlier estimate is about 10  add-on to the combined pro forma EBITDA. It will take some time for the integration to achieve its targets, so in the meantime the major catalysts may be just the broader moves in oil  and natural gas prices.I am long NexTier's competitors Liberty Energy  and ProPetro , which also provide fracking services and too saw impressive run-upsHowever, consistent with my current sentiment toward NexTier, I have scaled down my LBRT and PUMP positions in the anticipation of a possible correction.NEX had its  recently. Impressively, the company posted a modest 1  sequential increase in revenue, despite the falling activity driversFrac fleets  from last year and at multi-week lows although they bounced back a bitSimilarly to its competitors, NexTier thinks the activity bottom is nearNexTier expects a strong start to 2024Fracking companies are also more conscious of managing supply this time around and prefer to idle fleets than to erode pricingThe quality of equipment continues to matter as well as who your customers are, and NEX believes it has an advantage in both areas. Its now partner PTEN is also a premium services provider in the drilling space though it has a bit too much of exposure to private operators compared to some other drillersHowever, in the shorter term, I probably see more downside risk associated with integrating the two legacy companies.Investment legend Michael Burry's  also disclosed a Q2 position in NexTier in the recent 13-F filingInterestingly, Burry's fund also had a position in Precision Drilling , another onshore oilfield services player, which runs premium land rigs. PDS had similar performance as NEX, PUMP and LBRT over the last monthsUnfortunately, we won't know if Michael Burry already sold until the Q3 filing, which won't be available for quite a while.However, what we do know is that NexTier's CEO sold  5 million worth of shares recentlyThe CEO still has a lot of shares left, but perhaps this proves the point that after a strong run-up it's prudent to take some profits.Wall Street gives about 20  upside to NEX from the current levelsHowever, when I wrote my prior article, the Wall Street target upside was 70I remain long both LBRT and PUMP but have scaled down after the recent run-ups. I would approach NEX the same way, but I am already overweight oilfield services. Everyone's individual circumstances will be different of course.

"ENFR: Pipelines And Profits, A Dive Into The Energy Infrastructure-Based ETF","The energy sector is presenting an interesting picture right now. On one side of the coin, there are oil companies that are raking in the cash, thanks to the high oil prices. On the other side, there's a bit of a pickle forDemand for energy is staying strong, both here at home and on the international stage. That's music to the ears of midstream companies and MLPs-they're cashing in on this demand and riding high. Enter the  In my , I laid down a case in favor of investing in the energy infrastructure sector and Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF specifically, a stance that has only grown stronger since then. In my view, it's a great option for investors looking to get a piece of the action in high-quality energy assets and definitely worth a spot on your radar.The Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF comprises 27  energy infrastructure companies and Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  in the U.S. and Canada. It's a moderately sized fund, managing assets worth  124.5 million, and offers a dividend yield of 5.10   based on the 30-day SEC yield . It is significantly smaller than some of its counterparts, like the Alerian MLP ETF , the largest in the energy infrastructure domain, boasting over  7.1 billion in assets under management.Unlike numerous competing ETFs with a primary focus on MLPs, such as Alerian MLP ETF, ENFR incorporates both c-corporations and MLPs. In my view, this approach provides investors with a more comprehensive exposure to the energy infrastructure sector compared to the larger, MLP-centric ETFs.This distinction is vital because some of the biggest energy infrastructure players, like Kinder Morgan  and Enbridge Inc , operate as c-corporations. These major companies are often overlooked by MLP-centric ETFs. I believe this is a significant oversight, as it denies investors access to companies that are pivotal to North America's energy infrastructure. For instance, Enbridge plays a crucial role, transporting  a third of all North American crude oil production, while Kinder Morgan's pipelines handle nearly 40  of the region's natural gas production. For those seeking comprehensive sector exposure, I consider ENFR to be the superior option over MLP-focused ETFs.Those familiar with my work know I've extensively discussed the U.S. rig count's decline and its impact on certain oilfield service providers, as highlighted in my  Ranger Energy . Drilling activities have indeed decelerated in the U.S. throughout 2023, with a reduction of 150 rigs since the year's commencement,  to Baker Hughes . By last week's close, 622 rigs were operational in the U.S., comprising 501 oil and 117 gas rigs-down from 618 oil rigs and 152 gas rigs at the year's onset.While this situation poses challenges for oilfield services companies facing diminished demand, it actually hasn't translated into a drop in oil and gas production. In fact, U.S. production levels have risen. Despite a slowdown from the shale boom era, this year has seen an increase in production volumes, showcasing enhanced efficiency from oil and gas producers, enabling them to extract more with fewer resources. U.S. oil production climbed to 12.99 million bpd by July, an increase from 12.57 million bpd at the start of the year, as per U.S. Energy Information Administration . Concurrently, gas production also  to 3.22 trillion cf in July, up from January's 3.16 trillion cf.Should oil prices maintain their strength, we could witness a revival in rig counts as U.S. producers potentially increase drilling activities to meet rising energy demands and compensate for OPEC  supply gaps. This scenario might boost U.S. oil and gas production growth.Oil prices have seen nearly a 10  surge over the past three months, with WTI hitting  86 a barrel at the time of this writing. This uptrend is partly attributable to OPEC 's  restrictions. Just last month, Saudi Arabia-the group's powerhouse-committed to extending its one-million-barrel-per-day output reduction until the end of 2023, a stance echoed by Russia in its decision to keep its crude oil exports down by 300,000 bpd during the same period. The International Energy Agency has  the potential for these actions to push the oil market into a deficit in Q4-2023.Compounding this are the escalated geopolitical tensions following the Israel-Hamas conflict. While Israel is not a significant player in the global oil market, the conflict's potential to spread, particularly to the Persian Gulf region, cannot be overlooked, as it may disrupt oil supplies. A potential tightening of U.S. sanctions on Iran  withdraw 500,000 bpd of Iranian oil from the market, further constricting supply and potentially elevating prices.Nonetheless, the current production lull from OPEC and its allies presents a unique opportunity for U.S. oil and gas producers to step in, bridge the gap, and expand their market share. This scenario would ensure a steady flow of oil and gas through pipelines, guaranteeing sustained demand for energy infrastructure assets, which is a positive development for the midstream sector.The energy infrastructure companies and MLPs within the ENFR portfolio are poised to reap benefits from the current business climate, displaying promising potential for earnings growth. Note that ENFR is top-heavy ETF, predominantly influenced by the largest players in the energy infrastructure arena. The ETF's top-10  encapsulate the industry's giants, including Enterprise Products Partners  and Enbridge. Collectively, its leading 10 holdings represent a substantial 65  of the ETF's total assets.Amongst these, the top two holdings-Enterprise Products and Enbridge-exemplify ENFR's strength in diversification, blending both MLPs and C-corporations in its asset pool. Enterprise Products, an MLP, and Enbridge, a C-corporation, highlight the ETF's capacity to fairly represent the energy infrastructure industry.Exploring ENFR's top holding, Enterprise Products stands out as one of the world's biggest midstream companies. It boasts an impressive assortment of midstream assets, notably within the Natural Gas Liquids  NGL  value chain. Enterprise Products' reach  over 50,000 miles of pipelines, augmented by an array of natural gas processing plants, fractionators, and PDH and iBDH facilities. This extensive asset base is matched by strong demand, as evident in its  results in which its pipelines achieved record oil equivalent volumes of 11.9 million barrels.Furthermore, Enterprise Products exhibits stellar performance in generating Distributable Cash Flows  DCF , consistently surpassing cash distributions and resulting in a robust coverage ratio. A case in point  the second quarter saw the firm generating  1.7 billion in DCF,  to a solid 1.6x coverage ratio. With a proven track record of converting high-quality assets into steady cash flows year after year, Enterprise Products has maintained an upward trajectory in dividend growth for over 25 consecutive years, affirming its commitment to unitholder value.Currently, Enterprise Products is channeling its efforts into numerous  initiatives aimed at capturing the expanding U.S. oil and gas production volumes. The completion of four major projects, including a cryogenic natural gas processing plant, an NGL fractionator, and a propane dehydrogenation  PDH  plant marks significant progress. Alongside these completed projects, an additional capital commitment of  4.1 billion has been earmarked for upcoming projects that will come online in the coming quarters and are poised to boost earnings and cash flow, which ensures sustained distribution growth. This ongoing development bodes well for ENFR's performance.Switching focus to Enbridge, ENFR's second-largest holding, we observe a formidable asset base comprising liquid pipelines, and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities. Additionally, Enbridge's portfolio extends into renewable energy, featuring wind farms in Europe and solar energy projects across North America. Much like Enterprise Products, Enbridge stands out for its consistent cash flow generation and a stellar record of dividend growth spanning over 28 years.Enbridge is working on a  suite of 17 growth projects, representing a cumulative investment of CAD  19 billion  approximately  13.8 billion USD . Notable projects include the 137-mile Rio Bravo , poised to supply natural gas to the Rio Grande LNG export facility in Texas, and the Woodfibre LNG export  in British Columbia, boasting a production capacity of 2.1 million tons per annum. Additionally, a significant expansion  British Columbia natural gas pipeline system is also underway. These initiatives, set to materialize over the next five years, are expected to fuel Enbridge's growth trajectory, subsequently enriching ENFR's potential for returns.ENFR's biggest holdings have consistently demonstrated their capacity to reward shareholders through dividends while generating strong cash flows. They appear to be strategically positioned to reap the rewards of the strong business environment, investing significantly to maximize the advantages of the favorable market conditions. As they bring their new projects to fruition, we can expect their earnings and cash flows to continue growing. This, in turn, should enable them to sustain and potentially increase their dividends and distributions, positively influencing ENFR's overall performance.When we delve into the valuation aspect of ENFR's holdings, the findings are intriguing. Approximately 37  of the holdings, constituting a combined weight of 36 , have garnered attractive valuation grades ranging from A  to B- on Seeking Alpha's Factor Grades. Meanwhile, an equivalent number of holdings, representing a slightly higher weight of 38 , have been assigned valuation grades varying from C  to C-. Focusing on the ETF's top two holdings, Enterprise Products and Enbridge  been  valuation grades of C  and B- respectively. However, it is noteworthy that within the top-10 holdings, four companies-Cheniere Energy , Kinder Morgan, Williams Companies , and Targa Resources -collectively accounting for 21  of the total weight, present less attractive investment opportunities with valuation grades ranging from D to F.Given this assortment of valuation grades, creating a diverse landscape with no clear inclination towards higher attractiveness in terms of valuation, my assessment leads me to categorize ENFR as a 'hold'.It is also important to address the potential risks when evaluating investment opportunities. Although ENFR presents a promising outlook, navigating the current high interest rate environment remains a formidable challenge for energy infrastructure companies and MLPs. Rising interest rates directly impact borrowing costs, potentially hindering the development of new projects and limiting future growth prospects. For energy infrastructure companies burdened by substantial debt, the current financial landscape is particularly challenging. Refinancing in such conditions escalates costs, potentially straining their financial resources. This, in turn, could lead to reduced profits, leaving less capital available for shareholder payouts.Additionally, the high borrowing costs do not operate in isolation. The high interest rate environment also contributes to a broader economic slowdown, with potential repercussions for energy demand. A contraction in energy consumption could place further pressure on the energy infrastructure sector. This scenario is not without precedent  the industry faced significant headwinds during the pandemic as energy demand plummeted. While it's critical to acknowledge that the severity of the pandemic's impact represents an extreme case, it serves as a stark reminder of the industry's vulnerability to demand fluctuations.

Weight loss drugs may lead to reduced food consumption - watch these stocks,"The retail sector received a bit of a jolt on Wednesday when Walmart  pointed to weight loss drugs as a factor in a  slight pullback  in terms of items purchased and total calories represented in purchases. Walmart The comments from the nation's largest retailer added some weight to the issue that has been speculated upon loosely for months. Analysts estimate that nearly 7  of the U.S. population could be on weight loss drugs by 2035, which could lead to a 30  cut in daily calorie intake due to the consumption changes for the targeted group. There is also some conjecture that the increased attention to dieting and weight loss in general could have a downstream impact on the consumption of snacks and sweets. Conagra Brands  CEO Sean Connolly has stated that if there is a decrease in calorie consumption due to weight loss drugs, the company is prepared to develop new pro-health food options and change package sizes. Kellanova  CEO Steve Cahillance said the company is also looking at the impact of pharmaceuticals on eating habits.The list of stocks that could be impacted from a change in food consumption habits in the U.S. is long. The issue is relevant for grocery store names like Kroger , Albertsons Companies , Grocery Outlet Holding Corp , Ingles Markets , and Sprouts Farmers Market . There is also a case to be made that Walmart's  warning is probably something being looked at by executives at Target  and Costco . Meanwhile, packaged food sellers like PepsiCo , Kraft Heinz , General Mills , J.M. Smucker , Hershey , Mondelez International , and Hostess Brands  will also be watching the development. The restaurant sector could also be looked at slightly differently by investors, including McDonald's , Restaurant Brands , Yum Brands , Domino's Pizza , Wingstop  and Krispy Kreme .From the healthcare side of the equation, diabetes drugs such as Novo Nordisk's  Ozempic and Eli Lilly's  Mounjaro  tirzepatide  have risen in popularity as they are being used for their weight loss benefits. Along with Novo's  Wegovy  semaglutide , which is actually approved for weight loss, all are considered GLP-1 agonists.",104,2023-10-05T07:53:23.000-04:00
SMOG: Macro Headwinds Make This Low Carbon Energy ETF Hard To Inhale,"The VanEck Low Carbon Energy ETF  invests across renewable energy companies as well as leaders in related environmentally friendly technology. This is a segment that has grown significantly in recent years, but underperforming following what was aSolar stocks within the SMOG portfolio are facing a major selloff with several category bellwethers warning of despite global to government-backed efforts to incentivize clean energy technology. Wind energy stocks have not been any better. Broader macro headwinds including rising interest rates have pushed SMOG down by more than 25  since its September high.That being said, we can highlight that SMOG has at least fared better than many alternative  clean energy  ETFs with a narrower decline this year, largely related to the fund's position in Tesla Inc We think SMOG can work for investors in the context of a diversified portfolio over the long run, but expect the current volatility to extend through 2024.SMOG is intended to track the  MVIS Global Low Carbon Energy Index  including companies that generate at least 50  of their revenue from renewable sources of energy and related activities or benefits directly from those technologies.Naturally, wind and solar power firms are the clearest examples of  low carbon energy , but that also includes hydrogen, bio-fuel or geothermal technology, lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicles, smart grid technologies, and even environmentally friendly industrial materials that reduce carbon emissions or energy consumption. By this measure, SMOG takes a  of this theme.It's worth noting that SMOG's strategy features some global diversification. U.S. companies are currently 35  of net assets, but there are also clean-tech leaders from China at 20  and European names covered.With a modified market-cap weighting methodology, Tesla Inc. stands out as the largest position in the fund with an 8.5 . Technically, there is an 8  cap on all holdings which is rebalanced quarterly.Utilities are the most well-represented sector in the fund at 37  of the overall weighting. This includes names like NextEra Energy Inc , the largest utility-scale solar generator in the United States, along with Spain-based Iberdrola SA  both with a 7.5  weighting.Down the list, we find more specialized names like China EV makers including BYD Co Ltd  and Li Auto Inc . U.S. solar stocks like First Solar Inc  and Enphase Energy Inc  round out the top 10 holdings.We mentioned that there are several different options for investors when looking at clean energy thematic ETFs. SMOG with current assets under management of around  150 million is still small compared to some of the alternatives including the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF  with  2.8 billion in AUM.That being said, SMOF is relatively unique in this category for including electric vehicles  EVs  as part of the same  theme  which comes down to semantics. We believe it makes sense that EVs are one of the most direct implementation and most widely visible clean energy solutions in a transition from fossil fuel so it makes sense they are included, in our opinion.Other funds like the PBW Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF  favor more technology names and industry suppliers while underweighting the role of utility stocks from clean energy generators.The most direct comparison to SMOG is likely the Invesco MSCI Sustainable Future ETF  which also holds TSLA and other EV stocks. That said, our criticism there is that the portfolio with 183 names may be a bit too extensive, and attempt to do too much by getting into segments we find more controversial including real estate and even data center providers within its theme of  sustainability .We can't say one direction is better or worse than another but find that SMOG does a good job of finding this balance with a broad interpretation of clean energy through a targeted portfolio of 76 stocks covering the important category leaders.Over the past three years covering the period since late 2020, SMOG's -21  decline is less than half the drawdown the PBW ETF has faced and also narrower compared to the -26  decline in ERTH and the -34  loss in ICLN. Again, the inclusion of TSLA as its top holding is a big part of that spread.The sentiment for SMOG and this segment of the market has been terrible. For many companies including utilities that are highly leveraged and depend on debt financing, global interest rates at a near two-decade high have added to the volatility alongside concerns of a global economic slowdown.Outside of company-specific factors, the weakness in the solar market is a major development. The sense is that the demand for photovoltaic applications particularly on the residential side has disappointed, and is below prior forecasts. This comes at a time when the pricing for solar panels has , which might be great for buyers, but isn't helping in terms of profitability for producers.SolarEdge Technologies Inc  which represents about 2  of the SMOG portfolio, for example, recently citing  substantial unexpected cancellations and pushouts of existing backlog . The company is seeing higher-than-expected inventory and soft installation rates at the distributor level. Those comments  from Enphase Energy, whose shares are down more than 60  in 2023 amid a sharp slowdown.With the wind power industry, the story has been rising costs for the traditionally capital-intensive developments, pressuring margins. Even with EVs, several manufacturers including Tesla are hitting the breaks on aggressive expansion efforts with signs of.The setup here doesn't instill much confidence over the near term for SMOG and the clean energy sector overall. That being said, investors can take some solace in the longer-term big picture.By all indications, the transition to cleantech away from fossil fuel is a movement that can't be stopped. EVs continue to gain share from internal combustion engine automobiles and the expectation is for solar power  over the next decade. The silver lining of the current selloff is that it sets up a stronger base of support in the underlying equities at more attractive valuations ahead of the next leg higher.SMOG is a high-quality ETF that has performed exactly as intended by capturing exposure to companies best positioned to benefit from trends in renewable energy. Unfortunately, that momentum has been negative in 2023 against various bearish pressures.We rate SMOG as a hold representing a neutral view over the near term, recognizing the current headwinds against what remains a more positive long-term outlook for the theme of low-carbon energy.Amid the ongoing selloff, we're eyeing a move in SMOF back to its pre-pandemic price of around  90.00 per share as the next level of technical support. In our view, it would take a deeper deterioration of the macro outlook along the lines of a sharp global recession for the fund and underlying holdings to break down significantly further.On the upside, it will be important to see signs that demand for key technologies like solar is rebounding which can be monitored by reports from the leading companies in the sector. Stability in interest rates will also be key to watch into 2024. Take a look at our exclusive stock picks.

Amplify Energy: A Long-Term Winner On Valuation And Quality Assets,"Investing into oil and gas might not be exactly what has been hyped over the last few years as many renewable and solar companies saw their valuations skyrocket. But when the prices for those increased and ultimatelyThe company is included in the oil and gas exploration and production industry where it primarily focuses on engaging in both acquisitions and developments of oil and natural gas in the United States. The need for these resources is unlikely to diminish anytime soon and I think there isOne of the major benefits of AMPY right now is the solid asset base they have consisting of solid and low-decline projects across the US.The are diversified and span across Texas and some parts of California too. The assets are long-lasting reserves and are likely to continue yielding AMPY solid returns over the coming several decades.One of the major benefits of having such assets is the consistent cash flows they can generate from them. The 5-year  of FCF margins for AMPY is a very strong 25  which is far above the sector average of 6.23 . I think this should equate to a higher premium for the company and a p FCF of around 6 - 7 should be applied for sure. With sector beating margins a premium is valid and the proven stability of it as well further adds to that argument. That would put a price target of around  14 -  16 for the company, indicating a significant upside from current prices.While it's a common perspective to view the future of oil and gas through a negative lens due to the ascendance of renewables, the narrative is more nuanced than a simple relegation of traditional energy sources. The landscape of energy generation is indeed transforming, with renewables gaining prominence and advocating for a cleaner and more sustainable future.Even as ambitious emission targets are set for , the practicality of completely eradicating oil and gas from the energy mix is complex. These resources continue to offer a reliable and accessible energy source, particularly in regions where alternative options are still developing. Furthermore, the extensive investment in oil and gas infrastructure, including refineries, pipelines, and distribution networks, underscores their role as integral components of our energy ecosystem. Despite the above having data until 2021, I think it quite clearly showcases the dependence the US has on both oil and gas to generate energy to support the massive grid they have. This is unlikely to shift in the short term and makes investments into AMPY still very appealing.Looking at the from the last quarter we can see that AMPY had some decent results actually as production levels were up around 9  on a YoY basis. Net cash generated during the quarter was  4.9 million and EPS came in at  0.24, a massive beat from the expected  0.13 for the quarter. This hasn't translated into a higher share price as AMPY posted strong results. Instead, the share price has remained in the same range and that leaves us with a solid opportunity still to capitalize and invest accordingly.On a QoQ basis, the FCF was down a fair bit to  6.1 million, but AMPY still has performed quite well maintaining solid margins. The company also reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 and the CEO briefly mentioned that some of the challenges placed on the company in the last 2 years are residing and more positive times seem to lie ahead. I think for upcoming quarters the most important factor to look out for will be an increase in the production levels of the company, this would indicate a more positive and demand market condition for AMPY which with solid operation performances will raise margins and the share price as well.While the company has subtly alluded to the possibility of divestitures, it's intriguing to consider the alternative scenario where they veer in the opposite direction. Given the company's existing low leverage, a strategic shift towards initiating acquisitions could potentially trigger a downward trajectory in the stock's trading performance.Should management opt for a divergent course by pursuing acquisitions, the implications on the stock's valuation could be noteworthy. Acquisitions entail not only financial implications but also strategic alignment and integration challenges. A misstep in this arena could reverberate through the stock's performance, leading to a lack of investor confidence and consequent price depreciation.Besides the mentioned risks with AMPY, I think another one worth considering is the fact that volatile commodity prices are likely to place slight pressure on AMPY to continue posting quarterly growth. I think it might be unlikely for them to do that all the time, but that is the nature of the oil and gas industry. As long as the asset base is solid then there is little to worry about in my opinion, which is the case with AMPY.Investing in oil and natural gas is still very much a good opportunity for investors in my opinion. AMPY has showcased resilience and with a great margin of safety for investors, the company looks very appealing to start a position in. As we mentioned earlier, the company has a solid historical FCF margin thanks to the asset base they have developed.If we applied a 6 - 7x FCF multiple we are left with an upside of over 100 . Even if we don t necessarily reach that, the potential still far outweighs the risks here in my opinion. For investors that seek to start a long-term position in an oil and gas company then making AMPY one seems highly advisable right now. Rating AMPY a buy right now.

"Constellium: Sensitivity To Exogenous Factors Capping Upside Potential, Rate Hold","A changing macro regime, along with more compelling risk-reward profiles in adjacent sectors to tech and healthcare, means there is scope for specialty metals companies to catch a bid in FY'22. Constellium  has beenCSTM posted its today, and results were a downside versus  expectations. Challenges were observed throughout its operations last quarter not in the least related to reduced shipments and softer aluminium pricing. This hasn't come as a surprise, seeing as aluminum price weakness is often correlated with sharp and violent pullbacks in the company's stock price.Critically, the distribution in  i  the projection of its future cash flows, and  ii  market pricing going forward, are likely to be biased to the downside in myThe key macro numbers continue to dominate market tensions and capital flows in the back end of 2023. The yield on the 10-year has pushed above a 5 handle, having increased by  125bps since its flattening in July. According to a  from UBS, . It says the data has persistently surprised to the upside oni . Growth and consumer resiliency, evidenced in key economic data,ii . The market's inability to conceive the magnitude of Fed hikes at each point along the way.,  it says. .Meanwhile, prices of industrial metals remain at elevated levels, despite their broad selloff over the last 12 months. Aluminum sits in an interesting position. Demand for the metal is high, but there is a high cost of energy in its production. In a  from August, UBS also said that .It notes that smelting production in China's Yunnan province could add 1.2mm tonnes of capacity, expecting rates to lift in H2 this year. Critically, it also notes the bulk of aluminum stored in LME warehouses is produced in Russia, which, if removed from the LME system, would reduce 80  of the visible inventories would fall to  extremely low levels . It looks to a 2,500 mt price target on aluminum over the long term.This is important data for CSTM, given 1  it is in many ways a price taker on the market's pricing of aluminium and 2  the high correlations between spot aluminium and its stock price over the last 5 years  Figure 2a . No surprises on the 2nd point, but it's important to consider moving forward. We've not got CSTM selling back at its 2019 levels, whilst aluminum prices remain elevated.There is scope for spot aluminum to trade at the  2,500 mt level. Those at Trading Economics  the breadth of price ranges based on historical data. The key fact is that trends are declining, and the most likely path could be within the  2,000 2,200 mt region.Analysis of CSTM's economics and financial  reveals it was a mixed period for the company. The four most critical insights in my opinion are as follows.One, total shipments for the quarter amounted to 369,000 metric tonnes, marking a 4.6  decrease in comparison to Q3 2022. This brings shipments to 1.2mm metric tonnes for the YTD, also down 500bps YoY. This decline is attributed to several factors impacting the company's operations.Two, revenue for the same period reached  1.7Bn, representing a 15  decrease from Q3 last year. Consensus estimates were  1.9Bn and 6  decrease, so the miss was more than double in percentage terms. This was due to a combo of  i  lower shipments and  ii  reduced metal prices. Looking ahead, management forecasts adj. EBITDA between  700mm  720mm, on FCF of  150mm.Three, it pulled this to adj. EBITDA of  168mm, up 5  YoY, on earnings of  64mm, a decrease from the  131mm last year. It converted 44  of adj. EBITDA as FCF  74mm , amounting to  112mm in FCF spun off this YTD. Both are down YoY, as CapEx charges were higher likely a result of asset cost inflation.Four, and conversely, it put up value-added revenue  VAR  of  704mm, reflecting a 5  increase YoY. This was up 11  YoY for the YTD to  2.2Bn. This growth can be attributed to improved pricing and product mix. However, these gains were hindered by lower shipments, metal costs, and FX headwind, thus weren't realized below the top line.As to the divisional highlightsCSTM has traded within a wide distribution in the last 3 quarters before gapping down following a sharp vacuum pulling prices lower at the  15 region. Markets tend to move from pockets of high usage to low usage, so there is risk that CSTM could continue selling lower to complete the distribution shown in Figure 5. This would continue the downtrend set earlier this quarter.The distribution is also in a positive skew adding weight to the prospect of a series of ongoing small losses, continuing the downside. The catalyst to change this setup would be related to aluminum market pricing in my view.With the selloff in pre-market as I write, we have activated the  13 downside target, and I believe that the stock will push to this level in the coming days given the miss and what's been seen since it topped in July.The gap down following the update has only extended its position away from the cloud, adding to the negative positioning. In my view, this tells me to remain neutral over the coming weeks at least. A break above  18 is needed to suggest we are bullish again. This looks to be a key level for CSTM as well  the  18 level .The stock now sells at  estimates, quite the discount when the sector is priced at 7.55x forward. However there is far too much risk to contend with in my view.One of the issues I have with those in the metals space is there is typically no differentiation on price or product. Specialty metals such as aluminum do a good job at overcoming this, by providing select products to industry in CSTM's case, its offerings in packaging   automotive and aerospace   transportation. But it all boils back to the original input, being the underlying metal  spot price of aluminum . Companies hedge along the futures curve in these markets, but their offtakes all stem back to what the market is doing, which is influenced by many variables, not in the least supply   demand.This makes cash flows cyclical and less predictable, ultimately broadening the range of possible distributions when it comes to valuation. There is money to be made in this substrata of the market, but it does not align with our core investment tenets, that call for robust economics, low capital intensity to support a competitive position, and predictability   defensibility in future cash flows.At 6.15x forward EBITDA of  720mm  which converts to USD  761mm at the time of writing , implies a value of  4.68Bn in EV for the company as I write, marginal upside given the risk involved, and value gap of 5.6 . This supports a hold in my view. I would note,  agrees with this notion, also rating the company a hold based on a composite of objective factors.In short, CSTM's selloff looks set to continue, and there is little evidence to corroborate a reversal any time soon. Its fundamentals are sound, but sensitive to exogenous factors that suit a certain type of investor willing to position along the aluminum value chain. Net-net, rate hold.

NextEra Energy: Promising Dividend Yield Coupled With Strong Financials Bring Bright Future,"NextEra Energy  is a leading company in the production of electric power and energy infrastructure in the United States and Canada. NEE s business structure is a combination of regulated utilities and renewables that provide capacity forAs the fastest-growing state in the United States, Florida is experiencing both population and economic growth. Thus, it is of great importanceAdditionally, recent investments in Energy Resources led to 14  of growth in adjusted earnings versus the prior-year quarter. The demand for renewables and battery storage is increasing, and NEE s infrastructural investments will assist the company in meeting the demand and thus keep affordable bills for customers. Looking outside the box, NEE is on track to meet its predictions through 2026. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, Energy Resources added 1800 megawatts into operations while adding 1665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to their backlog. As a result, they have settled approximately 20 gigatons of renewables and battery storage.During the last two years, macroeconomic issues like inflation caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and thus, high interest rates to combat the inflation brought economic challenges for most people and businesses. However, NextEra Energy could leverage its competitive advantages and cater to strong financial statements. I believe that NEE s established capital plan will lead to higher strength and growth by 2025.Renewable energy capacity is growing at a fast pace, and the growth is permanent in the following year as the electric power sector has planned to add 27 GW of new solar generating capacity by the end of 2023 while adding another 31 GW by the end of 2024. As a result, it is  that renewables will account for a 25  share of U.S. electricity generation by 2024, up from 22  in 2023. As indicated in Figure 1, solar energy has boosted its share in U.S. electricity generation in 2023 and 2024. It is a good indicator that NEE s capital projects are progressing well. Solar is the lowest-cost alternative for customers, and NEE executed approximately 225 megawatts of solar in the recent quarter. Since the start of 2023, the company has placed circa 1200 megawatts of solar services.Figure 1Furthermore, it is worth noting that overall energy consumption is going to decrease by slightly 1  by the end of 2023. However, the share of renewable energy in U.S. energy consumption will improve from 13  in 2022 to circa 14  at the end of 2023. Thankfully, the U.S. carbon intensity, which refers to total CO 2 emissions relative to total energy consumption, is going to decrease more as economic activities will boost more than emissions in 2024. The total renewable energy share of total energy consumption will reach 15  by 2024. As a result, NEE s capital expenditures in renewables in Florida, the fastest-growing state, will reach long-term growth and profitability for investors.In my last article about NextEra Energy, I mentioned that the company has a large level of debt, with the past six years of free cash outflow. However, we should consider that high leverage is normal in the utility industry, and based on different , NEE is on track. As you can see in Figure 2, S P and Fitch rates for NextEra Energy's credits are A- and A, respectively, while Moody s rate is Baa.Figure 2 -Due to the higher interest rates during the last few years, most utility companies have experienced challenges as they largely rely on debt financing. However, as the inflation rates decreasing back, there is no need for the Fed to insist on high-interest rates. Thus, there will be a better outlook for utility financials. Analyzing NextEra Energy s financial condition indicates that the company has been able to provide benefits for its shareholders during the last year. In doing so, I have analyzed their profitability condition across the board of return on equity and margin ratios. As you can see in Figure 3, the company has improved its ROE considerably from 3  and 3.9  in 2Q 2022 and the end of 2022, respectively, to 5.14  at the end of 2Q 2023. This development was mainly due to the strength of net income that surged from  1380 million in 2Q 2022 to  2795 million at the end of 2Q 2023. The growth of NEE s ROE indicates that the company is capable of returning its equity investments into profits. Furthermore, NextEra has been provided an encouraging level of margin ratios in the recent quarter. After surging to over 44  in the first quarter of 2023 from 26  at the end of 2022, NEE s operating margin declined by 588 bps to 38.8  in 2Q 2023. However, it is worth mentioning that their operating margin was far higher year over year compared with 18.6  in the prior-year quarter. As a result, NEE s operating margin or return on sale ratio shows positive signs for growth investors. Additionally, an astonishing boost in EBITDA generation of  4406 million in the recent quarter versus  2193 million in 2Q 2022 led their EBITDA margin to surge to approximately 60  as compared to 42  year over year in the second quarter of 2022.Figure 3   NEE s profitability ratiosApart from the company s encouraging profitability condition, its long-term performance is heartening in terms of its dividend yield. NextEra Energy has grown its dividend yield during the last year and reached 2.59  of the yield. The company has shown consistency in growing its dividend payment, and the management expects to have annual 10  dividend growth by at least 2024, which represents NEE s well-growth in the future. Moreover, the payout ratio sat at approximately 44 , which indicates that the management is willing to share their income among shareholders. It is notable that in the utility industry, with its high volatility, NEE s payout ratio is ideal and shows its financial health  see Figure 4Figure 4   NEE s dividend yield and payout ratioNotwithstanding growth capacity and positive profitability outlook, NextEra Energy is facing some risks that can adversely affect its financial conditions. Although NEE s business construction is a mix of regulated utility and clean energy operations, and this combination provides growth opportunities for it, NEE and FPL s large portion of operations are subject to several federal, state, and other regulations. For instance, their rates and cost structures, operations, licensing of nuclear power facilities, and construction of electric generation are highly-regulated, and these regulations may have a material adverse effect on the business. NEE uses derivative instruments continuously to manage its risks. If the authorities find these instruments imprudent, they can deny cost recovery for such use by NEE, thereby adversely affecting their results of operations and financial condition. Ultimately, NEE s and FPL s operations are highly subject to operational risks including lost revenues due to prolonged outages, higher expenses due to monetary penalties, liability to third parties, and so on.Throughout the analysis, I have investigated NextEra Energy s results for the second quarter of 2023. The company s investments in renewables provide a bright future for growth investors. Moreover, analyzing NEE s profitability condition in terms of return on equity and margin ratios indicates that the company could increase its profitability, which was to the strength of its wise investments. Ultimately, NEE s high dividend yield and payout ratio are good indicators to show the company s capacity to remain on expected annual dividend growth of 10  by at least 2024. As a result, notwithstanding the existence of operational and market risks that NEE is facing, the company has performed well, and I recommend a buy rating for NEE stock.As always, I welcome your thought and comments.

The Art Of Hedging For A Market Meltdown: 5 Strategies (Ranked),"Financial markets are never immune to turbulence, and history has shown that market meltdowns, though unpredictable, are a recurring part of the investment landscape. Whether triggered by economic downturns, geopolitical events, or unforeseen crises, market meltdowns can wreak havoc on portfoliosIn this article, we explore the art of positioning for a market meltdown. We'll delve into a range of strategies and assets that historically have shown resilience during downturns, helpingThe first hedging idea that I want to discuss is also the most obvious  Buying put options on the S P 500 . For those who are not familiar with puts, and options, put options are financial contracts that give investors for a relatively small fee  premium  the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific asset, such as a stock, at a predetermined price before or at a specified future date. This means that as the S P 500 falls, the value of the long puts rises, effectively providing insurance against losses in the portfolio. Accordingly, these options contracts provide investors with the ability to profit from a decline in the S P 500 index, giving investors exposure to a direct, inverse correlation to the performance of the broad market.What is so great about options as a hedge, in my opinion, is that buying puts gives investors the opportunity to cap downside, as limited by the maximum loss equal to the options premia outlay. Moreover, puts also allow investors to achieve significant, and tailored, exposure to the market's downside with a relatively small upfront investment. This  implied leverage  can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the hedge, basically allowing investors to insure their portfolio for 180-240 days at a 2-5  implied interest on the portfolio  with costs dependent on implied volatility, interest rate, dividend payments, strike and time to expiration . By selecting different strike prices and expiration dates, long puts offer flexibility in designing a hedge that aligns with individual objectives and expectations regarding the market's performance. Scenarios can be simulated here -- on the .Finally, options on major indices such as the S P 500 are highly liquid and accessible through all major brokerage platforms.The price of an option depends on market volatility. Higher volatility raises the price. This is bad for the put options strategy discussed in the previous argument, as times of market uncertainty usually come with elevated implied volatility levels on options, thus making the Strategy somewhat expensive for investors. An opportunity to avoid paying high premia to hedge the portfolio, and actually take advantage of the high implied volatility during times of market stress relates to call overwrite strategies, such as pursued by the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF .To give readers a better understanding of , I point out that JEPI generates income by leveraging a combination of options selling and investments in U.S. large-cap stocks. Its primary objective is to provide investors with a consistent monthly income flow derived from the premiums earned through option sales and dividends from the stock holdings. To achieve this, JEPI creates a well-diversified equity portfolio with a focus on minimizing volatility, mostly dividend stocks, and complements the equity holdings with short call options on the S P 500.By selling call options, JEPI agrees to sell its underlying assets at a predetermined strike price, if the options are exercised. In ideal cases, the call options sold may not be exercised by the buyers, allowing investors to retain ownership of the underlying assets, and continue to retain the benefit from any future appreciation in the asset's value. Now, while the call writing may also cap an investor's upside potential, it also establishes a level of protection though the options premium, which can be especially valuable during market meltdowns  and this article is all about downside , as the premium income from selling call options can provide a buffer against potential losses in the underlying assets.Buying treasuries is another no-brainer when markets behave nervously. Historically, in times of market turmoil and uncertainty, U.S. Treasuries, particularly longer-term bonds, have emerged as a safe-haven asset and a classic and effective hedge against systematic risk. Again, the fundamental reason for the Treasuries' value as hedge is actually quite simple  When market conditions turn turbulent, investors often seek refuge in government-backed securities. And talking about government securities, debt of the U.S. government continues to be one of the most highly regarded investment options on strong creditworthiness, despite the most recent controversies relating to the . Also, investors should not forget that the Dollar remains the world's most-widely used, and accepted, currency.The attractiveness of buying Treasuries is of course also dependent on the broader fundamental backdrop of fixed income securities. In that context, the value of U.S. government backed securities shines very bright. For reference, the 10-year treasury yield is currently quoted at a 4.6  yield, outshining even some of the most highly regarded dividend benchmarks. Moreover, it is important to recognize that there may be another argument supporting an investment in treasuries -- namely the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates. With an implied effective duration of approximately 8, for every 100 basis points that the Fed cuts, the 10-year Treasury is expected to appreciate by 8-10  in value. The interest rate duration sensitivity is even higher for longer dated securities, such as the Depending on the nature of the downside risk, buying energy-focused equity securities may be a great way to hedge systemic beta. Specifically, I see energy securities very strong in context of geopolitical tensions  especially relating to the Middle East  and inflation. More specifically, the reason why I like energy in times of market uncertainty is relatively simple, and fourfold  First, many energy companies are known for their consistent income and dividend payments. This income not only shields investors during market turmoil but can also serve as a source for reinvestment in undervalued assets  Second, energy assets have generally a unique quality of acting as a hedge against inflation. While inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, energy companies often experience rising revenues and profits during inflationary periods due to increasing energy prices  Third, energy stocks display defensive characteristics, akin to those found in sectors like consumer staples or utilities. No matter the economic or political backdrop, energy remains an essential product with inelastic demand  Fourth, investors should consider that market meltdowns are often succeeded by recoveries. Energy ETFs can enable investors to position for the eventual rebound, as energy consumption typically resurges as the economy regains stability.To be fair, the energy argument per se encompasses securities in both traditional fossil fuel industries, as well as renewable energy markets. Expanding on the dividend argument, however, for downside protection I would prefer the fossil fuel exposure. That said, I recommend the Lastly, as a final asset to hedge against a market meltdown, let us not forget the yellow metal, gold. In times of economic turmoil and market uncertainty, gold has a consistent, long-dating and strong track record of performing well. Historically, the value of gold has tended to rise when other assets, such as stocks or currencies, have faced value depreciation or instability. In fact, gold often exhibits an inverse relationship with stock markets, meaning when equities face steep declines, the demand for gold tends to surge as investors seek a safe-haven asset  like Treasuries .Moreover, Gold is often considered an effective hedge against inflation  like energy discussed above , something that is well acknowledged globally. Historically, the value of gold has transcended geographic boundaries and currency fluctuations, offering a level of stability in the face of international economic challenges.Now, while gold boasts numerous advantages as a hedge, it is essential to also understand that gold does not generate income, and its value can be influenced by various factors, including currency movements and market sentiment. As such, if you buy an ounce of gold, and store it in a safe for 10 years, after 10 years you still will have an ounce of gold. And the extent of which the gold investment appreciated in value depends entirely on market participant's willingness to buy the yellow metal. Thus, buying gold is my least favorite hedging instrument, although I may consider buying some gold-focused productive assets such as miners.Preparing for a market meltdown may be a prudent strategy in an ever-changing financial landscape. Now, while it's impossible to predict the exact timing or triggers for such events, having a well-considered plan in place can help investors weather  unforeseen  storms. The strategies discussed, from  1  utilizing options,  2  buying alternative investments like JEPI,  3  investing in Treasuries, and diversifying with assets like  4  energy and  5  gold, can all play a valid role in safeguarding your portfolio. Sophisticated readers, and long-term Cavenagh Research followers, may argue that my article is missing Credit Default Swaps  CDS . This is true. But while CDS can be a valid strategy for hedging against credit-related risks during a market meltdown, investors should also consider that they come with complexity, counterparty risk, and accessibility challenges. Accordingly, retail investors may find it more practical to explore the strategies mentioned in this article. That said, it's crucial to remember that risk management is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and the right strategy should align with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

Jackson Hole: The Fed Faces The Ghosts Of The 1970s As Stock Market Rollercoaster Continues,"Next week, the Federal Reserve hosts its annual . Each year, roughly 120 central bankers, media members, academics, and business leaders attend to share research and escape the summer heat. Unlike its Since then, stocks have been on a rollercoaster, with the S P 500  fluctuating in a range above itsStocks have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last year, though volatility slowed significantly as summer arrived. The 15  selloff in the S P 500 was soon followed by a rally in hopes of a Fed pivot. The rally soon fizzled when Powell didn't give the market what they were looking for and investors began to sell popular stocks in December for tax loss harvesting. Markets rallied again on pivot hopes, only to be pushed back down after the next Fed meeting in February. Stocks fell sharply during the short-lived spring bank crisis, while the subsequent post-bank-crisis rally seems mostly driven by sentiment and fear of missing out. Some profit-taking followed, and here we are, roughly at the same price as a year ago after 12 months of tug-of-war. However, Jackson Hole may break the stalemate.In Powell's speech last year, he alluded several times to the policy mistakes of the 1970s. Then, the Fed's lack of commitment to fighting inflation contributed in large part to allowing core inflation to rise from roughly . Inflation came in three waves then, and the Fed would raise rates to halfheartedly fight inflation, only to cut them too soon and allow inflation to roar back.Most people reading this know the story of how Arab nations imposed a  on the United States, Canada, and the UK in 1973. More than a few of you reading this likely lived through the gas shortages, 55 mph speed limits, and sky-high inflation. In 1973, oil prices skyrocketed and stock markets crashed. The S P 500 fell 48  from peak to trough. fared much worse, falling over 73  from peak to trough.Less widely known is how a series of policy mistakes that traded short-term gain for long-term gain set the stage for this. This is one reason that political pundits tend to think , while  it may be harder.Compare this with todaySo far, the Fed has steadily raised interest rates until they've reached a positive real yield. Sound  this is what is needed to bring down inflation. Now, they'll have to raise them a bit more and keep them above the rate of inflation in order to avoid a disastrous repeat of the 1970s.  from the last meeting showed that members feared upside risks to inflation, which is why most members support hiking interest rates a bit more, even with some progress on inflation. The market is skeptical,  that the Fed is done hiking and will soon begin to cut. However, the Fed said they're going to hike , so there are plenty of people  including me  who will take them at their word.The key to understanding the Summary of Economic Projections is to read between the lines. By comparing the rate of core inflation the Fed projects and the interest rate it projects, we gain an understanding of how the Fed is likely to respond to rising or falling inflation. Essentially, they're looking for a about 2  real yield on cash. That means if core inflation is 3.5 , then they're going to hike one more time and hold rates at a level of 2  above inflation. This is in sharp contrast to many traders who think that if inflation goes to 3  that the Fed will aggressively start to cut when job growth slows or reverses. That's not what the Fed is saying at all, and the difference might be enough to get traders to seriously reevaluate their bets. Under this framework, rates stay above 5  until inflation is under 3 .Why wouldn't the Fed cut rates much when inflation slows down to 3  or so  Quite simply, that's how they got burned in the 1970s, so they're going to take their time. Modeling  supports this view.I calibrated the model to run using core inflation  ignoring rising oil prices  and added an interest rate smoothing feature to account for rents starting to fall. Still, almost all of the models here are calling for more rate hikes, with most favoring an interest rate above 6 . The Fed's dot-plot represents a compromise between the more hawkish members and dovish members worried about the banking system, but a cash rate of 5.75  followed by a long hold seems like the most likely outcome here. The market isn't quite pricing this, so traders may be caught by surprise that the Fed isn't looking to bail them out. Their surprise may be compounded if stocks fall sharply in the coming months and the Fed hikes again rather than pivoting to cuts.It's crucially important that the Fed doesn't allow another 1970s-style inflation surge. It's equally important for the Fed to not cave to political pressure to print money to let Congress off the hook for out-of-control spending. There is no alternative. By the end of the 1970s, Americans' trust in the government was shattered, living standards had stagnated, and the top political priority for voters was ending inflation. People were fed up. That's why they let Fed chair Paul Volcker drop the hammer on the economy and raise rates to 20 . By taking a hard line now, the Fed can ensure we don't have to end up in that position again after multiple consecutive waves of inflation, as was the case in the 1970s.This entire article really boils down to one question.

TORM: Stock Price Is Likely To Follow Revenue Decline,"Last year, TORM plc  was one of the primary beneficiaries of the sanctions against the Russian oil exports caused by the war in Ukraine. These disruptions significantly affected all transportationTORM has a vibrant history tracing back to 1889. The company is one of the largest carriers of refined oil products. Transported by TORM products include clean petroleum products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, naphtha, and gas oil, and occasionally dirty petroleum products, such as fuel oil. According to the , TORM operated a fleet of 80 owned or chartered-in vessels as f the fiscal year-end.The company's fiscal year ends on December 31. During 2022, the twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 74  of total revenue, of which one customer accounted for 12  of the total. TORM operates within two segments, the Product Tanker segment and the Marine Exhaust segment. Though, the Marine Exhaust segment is insignificant from the financial performance perspective.The company operates in a highly cyclical industry, and, unsurprisingly, its financial performance has been very volatile over the past decade. However, the revenue was compounding at a substantial 45  CAGR over the decade, with relatively slight pullbacks in crisis years for the industry as a whole. Last fiscal year was record-breaking due to favorable tailwinds caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and economic sanctions for this country. Due to sanctions on one of the largest global oil exporters, the whole oil and gas industry, including transportation routes, was significantly disrupted and positively affected TORM's earnings.After such a successful year in FY 2022, it is unsurprising that  forecast revenue to decline in the upcoming three years and return back to normal. That said, the strong momentum for the product tanker industry has gone, and the turnaround is not expected in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, consensus estimates might be too pessimistic since they project the revenue to fall to  665 million in 2025, which is below FY 2019 and FY 2020 levels. It looks not in line with the  that global oil demand will reach a record high this year, and I expect that the demand will continue to grow in the near future. I think so because we have a favorable global demographic trend in the global population, which is  by nearly 2 billion persons in the next 30 years. No disruptions are expected to happen to global travel, and we also all see the trend of many companies  their employees to return back to offices. That said, there is little evidence that the demand for oil transportation will suffer. It is also crucial to mention that the world's largest crude oil and oil products consumer, the U.S., faces the need to replenish its strategic reserves, which is also a solid near-term tailwind for TORM.The latest quarterly earnings were released on May 11, and the company slashed revenue consensus estimates by more than 20 . The top line increased by a massive 86  YoY, though the positive effect on pricing captured the Q1 FY 2022 revenue only partially. The upcoming quarterly earnings are scheduled to be released on August 17. Revenue is expected to decline YoY by a significant 17 . But, it is crucial that the upcoming quarter's revenue is expected to be higher than Q2 FY 2021 by almost two times.The strength in recent multiples company allowed the company to improve its balance sheet significantly. The leverage ratio is substantially lower than one, and the major part of the debt is long-term. Liquidity metrics are in excellent shape, and so is the covered ratio.Overall, I think that TRMD's financial performance suggests that it is a high-quality business, though vulnerable to cyclicality. I think that near-term trends are moderately favorable for the company, though last year's  Golden Rush  is definitely over and unlikely to happen again in the following years.The stock price declined 5  year-to-date, significantly underperforming the broad market. TRMD also underperformed the Energy sector , which rallied about 4  year-to-date.  assigns the stock the highest possible  A  grade mainly because of a very low forward P E of below 4. Current multiples are also substantially lower than the company's five-year averages.Since TRMD is a highly cyclical business, the discounted cash flow approach would not be a good fit to continue my valuation analysis. On the other hand, the company pays dividends. The dividend discount model  DDM  approach is a good option. Consensus  project an FY 2023 payout of  8.18, representing a 31  dividend yield. But this extraordinary payout became possible due to a record-breaking FY 2022. This was a year when the war in Ukraine positively disrupted the energy transportation market and provided tanker companies to generate abnormal profits. There is little certainty regarding the timing of the war termination, but a tailwind like this will likely not happen again for TRMD in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I use a much lower  2.5 dividend for my DDM formula. I use an 8  WACC and simulate three different scenarios of dividend growth.In theory, the stock looks attractively valued even in case of zero dividend growth and has a lovely upside potential if the stock delivers at least a 1  dividend CAGR over the long term. On the other hand, there might be dividend cuts as well. If we look at the dividend payout history, we can see that it was very volatile, and dividend payouts were as low as 2 cents per share, and there also were years with no payouts. High uncertainty and unpredictability are inherent to the company's dividend payouts. The business is highly cyclical, and the company's ability to sustain dividend payouts might be significantly harmed in case of significant disruptions to earnings.Therefore, I would better look at where the stock price is now compared to its all-time highs. The stock currently trades about 30  below all-time highs and multiple times higher than the pre-war level, despite the apparent fact that the strong growth momentum has gone, and consensus estimates forecast that earnings will return closer to normal. FY 2025 revenue is expected to be almost two times lower than the current fiscal year's expected revenue. That said, the stock price is highly likely to follow and return closer to its normal range.An attractive valuation with solid upside potential cannot exist without substantial risks of investing in the stock.The nature of the product tanker industry is highly cyclical, meaning that the company's earnings are subject to high volatility. Many factors outside the management's control might adversely affect the company's earnings. These include global economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in energy consumption patterns, and fluctuations in oil prices, which significantly affect the demand for product tankers.Such hard-to-predict events like marine disasters or adverse weather conditions could lead to vessel interruptions, impacting idle time and the company's ability to generate sales. We all saw that the COVID-19 pandemic was a big disruption for TRMD and highlighted the company's vulnerability to such events.As a global marine transportation company, TRMD is subject to a complex web of maritime laws, regulations, and environmental standards across multiple jurisdictions. Failure to comply with all regulations might be costly for the company and result in substantial fines and penalties.Overall, the stock is a  Hold  for me. I think TORM is a high-quality business that demonstrated impressive scaling up and profitability improvement. But it is very vulnerable to cyclicality. The last year's once-in-a-century strong momentum definitely cooled down, and I think that the stock price should also return closer to the normal historical range while it looks much closer to the last year's all-time highs at the moment.

Week On Wall Street: The Soft Landing Consensus Grows,"Listening to market analysts and economists, it's clear sentiment has made an abrupt shift. The  soft landing  commentary has gripped theHowever, there are still plenty of risks on the horizon. Here are four reasons why we still need to be concerned about the MACRO fundamentalsConsumption has been supported by a historically tight labor market, the strongest wage gains in nearly forty years, and excess savings from the pandemic. However, these tailwinds are fading. The excess savings buffer is slowly disappearing, student loan payments resume on October 1, and gas prices are now trending higher. Consumers' balance sheetsThere are signs that the labor market is cooling. The pace of job growth eased to its lowest level since December 2020. What has gone unnoticed is the last six prior payroll reports were downwardly revised-the longest negative streak since 2009. Other indicators, such as the declining number of job openings, easing quits rates, falling temp jobs  a historically strong signal that the labor market is weakening  and a pullback in the average workweek suggest cracks are forming in the labor market. I doubt if we will see a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, but this softening trend to continue may continue.As we entered 2023, consumers shifted back to spending on services, particularly on travel and experiences. However, after two consecutive summers of 'revenge' travel, spending on services is showing signs of fatigue. Airline fares have moderated on a month-over-month basis for three consecutive months, restaurant activity is lower relative to last year, and attendance at theme parks has softened.Since we've already been through the  Goods spending  as the first part of the post-pandemic cycle, it is unlikely to pick up the slack in service spending this time. Both goods and service spending will be on a flat to downward trajectoryCorporate non-residential capital expenditures have been a significant tailwind for economic growth, rising at an annualized rate of 7.7  in 2Q23 and contributing nearly 1.0  to GDP growth. However, with recession risks elevated and small business loan rates at their highest level in 2007, the outlook for future capital expenditures is clouded.The percentage of small businesses that view now as a bad time to expand due to higher interest rates is  The composite of capex plans in the regional Fed Manufacturing surveys remains near the  Historically, these low levels have led to sharp declines in non-residential fixed investment.Finally, only 22  of CEOs surveyed plan to increase their capex budgets over the next 12 months-. This sour sentiment suggests that CAPEX is likely to be challenged going forward. And this has already started to translate into weaker demand for loans, as the  stronger demand for loans has fallen to its All of these  issues  add up to the conclusions I have drawn and discussed many times. Economic growth is going to be hard to come by for the remainder of this year and into 2024.That brings us to another problem that is being discounted by the investment community. They are counting on the death of inflation and that the Fed will not need to increase the fund's rate further. I'm not ready to join that parade. I will acknowledge that if I'm correct that growth will slow, it will go a long way in adding to the Fed leaving the scene. However, there are other factors to consider.Can we be so sure that CORE inflation will subside quickly  Do we believe the FED will remain ultra-patient and wait for the inflation rate to decline gradually on its ownThere has been an impressive reduction in the core inflation rate in the past year, but the pace is likely to slow in the months ahead. One reason for that is the dramatic increase in crude oil and natural gas prices which has not yet filtered into the CPI.  The price of crude oil has risen from  70 per barrel in early July to  83 currently. That is an 18  increase which is eventually going to filter into the CPI. They raise the cost of  from jet fuel which will push up airfares, to diesel fuel which will increase the cost of shipping anything by truck and rail - which includes almost every commodity. The increase in transportation costs will be passed along to retail customers so the price of everything that moves by truck and rail will be higher - from furniture to cars to food and apparel.I do not doubt the glide path for inflation is lower, but the argument will be when will we reach the hanger  2  target . At the end of the day, the Fed may feel a need to encourage a faster drop in the inflation rate by raising the funds rate a couple more notches. Even if the BEST case for inflation unfolds, the Fed remains patient and monitors the CORE inflation rate, It is UNLIKELY they will change course and move into an easing mode anytime in the next few months. Yet there is plenty of  in 2024. That notion is more about what investors  than what may be  Let's say my outlook for economic growth is wrong- it stays more resilient for longer before it eventually caves due to the headwinds that are present. That simply means the FED will continue to fight an economy stronger than their forecasts suggest. Then lowering inflation to their 2  target becomes a more difficult task and they deem it necessary to continue to raise the Fed Funds rate. Either way, it then becomes difficult for me to put lipstick on this MACRO situation and call it pretty.We've discussed how the market's mindset will control the near-term price movement. Consider this. Last October when the 10-year treasury peaked at 4.20  the S P 500 was around 3600. Fast forward to almost a year later and we have a 10-year that traded as high as 4.3  recently and the S P 500 is trading around 4400. That implies sentiment is the key factor as investors' views have shifted from a  hard landing  to a  soft landing  thesis as the most likely outcome. Toss in a dash of AI  Artificial Intelligence  mania and we have our answer as to the  WHY  of the price action that sent stocks on a big rally this year. We're now starting to experience a reversal of sorts. How much of a reversal might depend on where the 10-year Treasury is headed.Similar to other MACRO analyses - we'll place these near-term factors in the background and keep the long-term trends that have emerged in the foreground. Don't let the conflicting messages work on your emotions. We'll follow the price action, but it sure is a confusing scene out there.That leaves investors tiptoeing around the landmines.Trading opened after four straight days and three straight weeks of losses. BULLS were wondering if Friday's stable session may have set a floor for the S P. It seemed that way but a quick positive opening was sold, and that's been the case during rallies in this slide. Typical action during a pullback. What is also typical is choppy price action, and the S P reversed course again which led to a 0.69  rally. However, the day belonged to Technology. Led by Nvidia  the NASDAQ led the charge in what turned out to be a risk-on day gaining 1.5 .Technology and Nvidia continued to garner the headlines and at the close on Wednesday, the NASDAQ Composite posted a 3.2  gain for the week. The S P added 1.1  on Wednesday as buyers showed up when the 10-year Treasury dipped. It was fun while it lasted. The choppy summertime trading continued. After the S P 500 had its first 1  gain of Q3 on Wednesday, the bulls gave it all back and more on Thursday. After a sharp upside move at the open, the mood quickly shifted and all of the indices reversed earlier gains and closed lower on the day. All eleven sectors finish in the RED.While US indices  dating from the bear market lows  more clearly visible on the S P 500 and NASDAQ than with small caps , European stocks have managed to An indication that the entire global growth scene may come into question unless there is a quick recapture of these trend lines. This and other signals are the reasons I have dragged my feet on embracing the NEW BULL market scenario. They highlight my questions and concerns that this is the next leg of the secular BULL market that began in 2009.Existing home sales dropped 2.2  to 4.07 million in July after sliding 3.3  to 4.16 million in June.  Also, it is . The notion that the manufacturing sector is  bottoming  and ready to rebound is getting a bit long in the tooth. at 50.4  July  52.0 . Services Business Activity Index at 51.0  July  52.3 . Manufacturing Output Index at 47.5  July  50.2 . Flash US Manufacturing PMI  3  at 47.0  July  49.0 . The  rose 2 ticks to -7 in August after dipping -1 point to -9 in July. The employment component weakened to -3 from 5 and is the lowest since -5 in February and March.The backdrop of labor strikes, successful wage hikes, and general labor bargaining power in a sub-4  unemployment rate economy makes the recent surge in Treasury yields feel if not justified then at least narratively correct. A ratcheting-up of estimates for the size of fiscal deficit Treasury needs to fund over coming quarters hasn't helped, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow index tracking 5.8  annualized growth for Q3 doesn't either. If that estimate holds  and there's a lot of data to digest before it's a reality, of course  Q3 will see faster real growth than any quarter between 2009 and 2019. That's hardly an endorsement of Treasuries as a screaming buy and the reason they are being dumped kicking yields higher.On the other hand, GDP can be incredibly volatile. Recall that 2022 saw a  real  GDP decline in both quarters of the first half. From Q4 of 2021 through Q2 of 2023, cumulative GDP growth was less than 1.4  per year. Even if we get a very robust quarter from Q3 2022 at the 5.8  the Atlanta Fed currently tracks via its NowCast,  PMI Composite Output Index at 47.9  Jul  50.8 .

Maybe they were fixated on a  hope  trade . A majority kept talking about the end of the hiking cycle and then participated in what I viewed as an absurd conversation about rate cuts this year.Fed Chair Powell said the message is still the sameSo the investment community initially saw the tone of Powell's speech as hawkish, as they ONCE AGIN reiterated the  higher-for-longer  stance. Then the light went on. Perhaps today's turnaround action after Chair Powell said the same thing he has been saying for months finally resonated.My message has not waivered since Q4 '22, and it has been reinforced every month this year. There is a decent probability that the Fed will have to raise rates further. When they finally do reach the terminal rate, there will be NO PIVOT. Interest rates will remain higher for longer. I've maintained a stance that rate cuts would never be on the table this year unless the economy fell off a cliff. I now reiterate that view going into '24. Investors should get the notion of rate cuts anytime soon out of their heads. I'm getting close to the point of forecasting there will be no rate cuts in '24.The big news is the rise in Treasury yields as the 10-year yield increased from 3.97 , up to 4.20 on August 3rd, and then took another step higher trading at 4.34  this week. We may have gotten a reprieve and avoided a breakout that  in the 10-year march to 5 . Whether it was a resistance level or just  the 10-year traded down to 4.22  this week before settling at 4.27  on Friday.The whipsaw action in the treasury market has unnerved equities, as investors have no idea what might come next for rates. For the moment resistance has held and what happens next in rates could determine where the stock market trades in the next few weeks.The 2-year Treasury Note traded at 4.90  on Friday  down from 74 bps last week. The 2-year 10-year curve has been inverted since April '22.Another notable  recently reported shows total primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions. As shown in the chart below, CO2 produced from the generation of energy has I'm not about to start doubting the U.S. Energy Information Association, and the statistics do not lie. . For those who would like to make the argument that green initiatives are responsible for the drop, please look at the dates on the chart. Then please consider that power generation from the recently introduced alternatives - Solar and Wind is 5 .The upward blip on the map that disrupted the trend was due to the emissions-intensive economic recovery from the Covid crisis.  Yet present policy continues to demand spending trillions while carbon emissions are already in retreat. The payback from these green investments is going to be negligible AT BEST.BUTThe economic impact will be costly.The all-out march to renewables is running into potholes.  where projects are under scrutiny and are now being halted, mirrors efforts in the U.S. in states such as Kansas and Iowa have encountered resistance from local municipalities and state governments, which have cited the effect of solar and wind farm projects on small communities.It's time to go back to the drawing board and rethink this entire transition before the negatives start piling up.In the UK, new home and workplace chargers being installed must be   connected to the internet and able to employ pre-sets limiting their ability to function from 8 am to 11 am and 4 pm to 10 pm.One after the other, the dirty secrets are all being exposed, and the move now has a chance of dying on the vine. If so, that slows and perhaps temporarily stops a transition that has the potential to bring economic calamity.In the U.S. California, the leader in EV deployment seems destined for huge problems. To support the State's EV growth,  , more than twice the amount of Virginia, the second largest importer of electricity. California typically receives between one-fifth and one-third of its electricity supply from outside of the state. The cart is before the horse, and that suggests there will be no progress that is meaningful on any front. While everything stands in place - money will continue to be tossed at a failed experiment. The term  clean energy  is a misnomer. In my opinion, NONE of what is being proposed in this transition is actually  clean . The process of producing an EV is hardly  carbonless , and that is why the return on investment is poor. That makes the transition a burden for global economies and unsustainable.This week's  brings  and others to light. In the coming weeks, I'll be introducing a new way for followers to get access to a streamlined service that shares some of my most important reports at a reduced rate.Stay TunedA rally off the recent lows was thwarted right at obvious resistance levels. Once again demonstrates the need for employing technical analysis as part of an investment strategy.Investors can flip a coin as to what comes next. But in fact, there are three options now. A rally back to test the '23 high, a move to test the original breakout level that sparked the rally, and a trading range that suggests a sideways market.Wherever the market decides to find a floor and bounce, the  of that bounce will then go a long way in determining whether that was  it  on the downside or if we should expect more weakness to come. The indices are in the process of that  bounce  and investors will have a better idea of how the end of Q3 shape up.Just about every technician has the S P 4200 level as their line in the sand on the downside. That tells me the index will never get there OR when it does, it slices through that level like a hot knife thru butter. A break below  4150-4200 would start to do some damage to the charts.  I think the odds favor finding a bottom above these lower levels. Below there, it will raise the probability that despite the strength of the rally off of last October's low, we may need to consider the possibility of another deeper wave lower. However, don't jump to conclusions, this has to be taken one step at a time.On an individual stock sector basis, I see many situations that still have some room to fall before they  revert to the mean . Many could test their respective 200-day moving averages or as I noted to members of my service the MEGA cap charts open the possibility for them to retrace their entire move from the breakout level. In many cases, that infers  10  or so below current levels. So, there is space for this to develop into a more complex pullback even should it remain part of a  normal correction.Given the fact that rally attempts are quickly thwarted and the fact that several red flags  overbought conditions  had popped up before this decline, I remain in no hurry to try to jump in front of this retracement until I see more evidence of buyers stepping in.The calendar may not make it any easier for the market either. We have now entered a period of poorer seasonality that  last until around the beginning of October.Seasonality is always more of a guide than a rule, but over the past 10 years, the S P 500 has, on average, topped out around this time and then drifted lower into early October. Going back 20 years, at best the S P has gone sideways from August to October when we average them all. This year, such a pullback or stall period would make a lot of sense after such a one-sided rally since the beginning of the year.I've highlighted the numerous failures to break the downtrend the Russell 2000 The index took the elevator down and found itself right back at support levels. The BULLS are hoping support holds to avoid a move to the March lows which is another 7  lower from current levels.I admit that I have been surprised that this  laggard  didn't step up and start to stabilize and move higher in Q3. That was my  call , and while there is still time for the small caps to gather momentum, these constant failures at resistance levels are unnerving.The fact that it's lagging again is sending what may be an ominous signal for the economy and the outlook for stocks in general. This price action also starts to question this NEW BULL market and adds more evidence to the argument that we are not embarking on another leg higher in the Secular BULL market.So far in 2023, the S P 500 has risen  15  with a big thanks to the Consumer Discretionary, Technology, and Communication Services sectors, all of which have risen more than double that of the S P.As for the other end of the spectrum, Utilities have been left in the dust with the sector down almost 11  YTD. The underperformance of the Utility sector is more or less a casualty of the shift from TINA  there is no alternative  to TARA  there are reasonable alternatives . Utilities are often used for dividend income, the rapid rise in yields over the past year is a big reason for the sector's underperformance. The 10-year yield moves up and the Utes move down.Entering Q3 we knew the strength in the outperformers wouldn't disappear overnight, but we are starting to see some of the gains melt away. I believe once the overall market finds its footing and stabilizes, the Laggards are going to continue their outperformance.The S P is down 1  in the quarter while three of the laggards are up so far in Q3. Energy  7 , Financials, and Healthcare have modest gains of less than 1 . Commodities have also surprised with a 6  gain in Q3, after being down 4  in the first half. I continue to like this sub-sector as the year progresses.For the month, only Energy  and the Oil Explorers, two groups that I highlighted in July have posted small gains EVERY other sector and sub-sector is in the red.A new high, a test of the bottom of the trading range, and now a pause in the latest run back to the old highs. While all of that was taking place the Energy sector  remained in a long-term BULL trend.Other than tweaking holdings along the way, the best strategy during a BULL trend is to stay with it. Unless you are an active trader there is little reason to leave a long-term uptrend.No one said it was going to be easy owning the Nat Gas ETF  and the ETF is demonstrating why it's a tough trade.It's ready to break out, then it's ready to break down. For the most part, the trading range has held. UNG closed the week at the bottom of that trading range, leaving investors questioning what comes next.The Financial ETF  isn't showing a positive picture. That last rally attempt has to now be considered a lower high in a series of lower highs since the December '22 high. The sector is also teetering on the brink of falling back  If it closes below that level at the end of the month, then we can conclude the brief move above was a false breakout. That is a bad omen for the group and the market in general.We've known since the California Banking crisis in March, the regional banks  have stayed in a BEAR trend. After forming a rebound rally that looked encouraging, resistance held and now the beleaguered regional banks have come down to a big support test. The ETF failed that test and now looks for a level where it can stabilize. Another critical point in time for the banks. It is getting very close to the time the banks need to step up, or it's another signal questioning the  BULL  market backdrop.Since the last failure to take out resistance in May, the Gold ETF  has been in decline and is attempting to hold support. The entire precious metals complex that I follow got a lift this week. The longer-term BULL trend remains in place for GLD and so I continue to HOLD my position.I've had some success trading the Silver ETF  and the trading shares that were added over a week ago are up 6.5 . I continue to HOLD a CORE position as well.Last week I noted that Uranium was making up its mind about whether to break up or down out of a tight trading range that has been in place since July 12th. The metal moved higher and I cashed in another trading profit  12.5  on shares that were added in July. Similar to the other two metals I HOLD a CORE position as well.Not much has changed in the trading range that has been established. An optimist would note the series of HIGHER Lows that have been established since the October '22 lows. However, it's been a tough year of underperformance as the group is down 2.5  in '23.Rising interest rates are poison to companies that are always needing to raise capital. The Biotech group  finds itself weakening and may eventually test the March lows.The NASDAQ Composite and the NASDAQ 100 have led the rally in '23, and they led to the downside on this pullback. The  reversal  on Thursday was some of the worst price action seen in a while. I continue to believe the sector will be an underperformer for the remainder of this quarter. I'll reiterate what I've said for the last couple of weeks - I'm not inclined to buy dips in the mega caps just yet. All of their short-term trends have been broken.The semiconductors  show a couple of breakout areas on the DAILY chart. I've wondered if the last move would take the ETF higher or if it was a false move. Recent price action indicates the latter as the group was rejected at resistance. Like other pullbacks in other indices or sectors, no one can be certain when support comes in. Given the big move off the October lows, probabilities suggest there is more weakness ahead. If that is the case it's another factor that keeps Technology very weak in the near term.After the S P 500 posted the best YTD performance through July since 1997, the Index is now down -4.4  MTD in August. Heading into the summer, stocks looked vulnerable to a temporary setback, owing to excessive economic optimism and lopsided positioning. Technically, 96  of sub-sectors were overbought. Consensus interprets the recent drawdowns as a pause that refreshes, as opposed to a change in trend.As I have noted in recent reports, there has been a change in the market profile lately from feeling like  to feeling  Out of the 19 sessions so far in August, more stocks have declined than advanced, and the S P has posted losses in 15 of them. The breadth indicators, therefore, continue to weaken, and we are now back to having considerably more stocks making new 52-week lows than highs across the market. Support levels have provided little help, as well, with the S P 500 breaking down through initial, and then secondary support quickly.Three weeks ago we discussed the market situation and noted how positive the situation looked and notedFor those that have been around a while, they know that usually means something is about to  change . That is exactly the scenario that has played out as the market has run out of steam aided by a few material negative catalysts.Perversely, the largest concern from markets in terms of activity has been China. Everything from equity market performance to news flow to economic data suggests that the Chinese economy is extremely weak and getting weaker. Historically, weakness in the Chinese economy has been met with declining global growth and inflation pricing in bond markets, But over the past month, increasing pessimism over Chinese economic growth has been met with  That leads many experts to scratch their heads, wondering exactly what the bond market is telling us. 10-year yields have hit their highest levels since 2007 while 30-year yields are the highest since the summer of 2011.As we have discussed, the stock market runs into trouble when the inversion spread is  normalizing , and that is starting to occur now. Whether this is a short-term phenomenon or it morphs into a bigger issue for the markets is yet to be determined. So it's no surprise a market that had run out of things to worry about a few weeks ago, all of a sudden has plenty of things to be concerned about.TTHANKS to all of the readers that contribute to this forum to make these articles a better experience for everyone.Best of Luck to EveryoneFear   Greed Trader is an independent financial adviser and professional investor with 35 years of experience in all market conditions.

Ensemble Fund - Analog Devices: The Future Is Bright For This Analog Leader,"The following segment was excerpted from Analog Devices, known in the industry as ADI, makes semiconductor chips that predominantly operate at the boundary of the physical world and the digitalAnything with an on-off switch requires lots of these analog chips if it is going to relay input andWhat s unique about this class of chips is that companies making them do not need to make the huge investment bets that digital chips require in both R D and manufacturing to stay ahead on the Moore s Law performance treadmill. Analog chips usually use manufacturing equipment that s several years or even decades old, which are much cheaper to buy than the latest and greatest that digital chips require.In addition, consolidation has reduced the number of players in the semiconductor industry to a few big players globally and just a handful in the US, with analog chipmakers demonstrating a focus on strong returns on invested capital, high levels of free cashflow, and good competitive advantages built on scale, reputation, and a cornered talent resource of specialized analog engineers that we ll explore further.To understand why we believe ADI is both different and valuable, we have to delve a little bit into the technicalities of semiconductors. While we think of chips as  thinking  in ones and zeros, the real world does not operate on ones and zeros. The forces in the physical world have more of a continuous analog waveform that is not binary   examples of these are light color and brightness, sound frequency and volume, pressure, temperature, etc.Mixed-signal chips will take those continuous signals and transform them into digital data that digital processors and memory chips can understand. Then the digital chips can operate on that data to compute new information or activate an output signal, which are translated back for consumption in the physical world by a mixed signal chip. Analog chips perform a similar role, but usually in the realm of power regulation and communication. Analog and mixed signal chips are often made by the same companies and sometimes referred to interchangeably.As technology has broadly penetrated our world and everyday lives, semiconductors have also done the same as the underlying hardware substrate. Moore s Law has allowed their capabilities to grow, and their cost and energy consumption to fall at an exponential rate, which has driven their adoption and use in a broad range of applications in all industries, bringing us to where we stand today, on the verge of ubiquitous connected intelligence.As devices are able to do more and become more intelligent, their semiconductor content has increased, relying on more sensors, power management, and communications capabilities. These devices and systems are dispersed throughout our lives  from smartphones to computers, cars, planes, microwaves, ultrasound machines, HVAC systems, cellular radio towers, data centers, factories, etc. Given their role, it s important to recognize that the more powerful and capable the main digital processor is, the more data it needs to bring new applications and value to market.A lot of these applications also leverage connected devices   think your smart bulbs or fridge or cars   and all of these applications that can do more, generally require more analog chips to do the  sensing  that creates the data that feeds the application or main processor. In the case of the latest cars, those with adaptive cruise control, fancy smart LED lights, and electric vehicles   which are basically getting close to becoming computers on wheels   the number of chips required is multiples that of vehicles just a few years ago and is 10-100x as many as traditional products we think of as technology products like iPhones, PCs, and game consoles.Therefore, we believe that the analog segment of the semiconductor market can see faster growth ahead, but without the risk and high levels of ongoing cash reinvestment necessary for the sexy digital brain part of the industry. In analog, the pace of technological change is slower and product cycles are much longer, spanning decades in many cases. This results in sustainably higher returns on R D and manufacturing investments, along with more consistent secular forecastability. In addition, the markets they sell into are global and across all industries making them relatively less dependent on one or two end markets, like smartphones or the data center.Companies like ADI and Texas Instruments , which the industry refers to as TI , two of the largest analog companies, have built broad portfolios of tens of thousands of products, each with over a hundred thousand customers who make millions of products that sell billions of units. The product needs and lifecycles across all industries can vary from a year to decades, which is why ADI derives half of its revenue from products that are over ten years old  Historically, the prices of these chips have ranged from less than a dollar to a few dollars while volumes in the billions of chips result in  10-20 billion dollars of revenue for each of these companies at operating profit margins of 30-50 .Once these chips are designed into customer products, it is generally uneconomical to switch them out for a competing chip because the average selling price is so low relative to reengineering costs, especially when you consider software that is built on top of the designed in hardware. This makes ADI s products sticky once they are designed in, resulting in a competitive moat that spans across the scale of products and distribution, switching costs, and service capability.Another source of competitive advantage and value to customers is that unlike digital chip design, there is a lot of  art  or experience-based know-how that goes into analog and mixed signal chip engineering that deals with its own unique set of design challenges. This results in an engineering talent pool that is hard to replicate at new companies or even at customers  product design teams. Consolidation in the industry has meant that these resources are even more concentrated at the largest companies, which enable them to drive further efficiencies in product development.Taken together, in most end markets outside of consumer electronics, all of these factors make it hard for a new entrant to build enough scale in any timeframe under a decade to become a profitable competitor.While consolidation has mostly played out in the industry, increasing complexity, automation, and integration create other avenues to grow revenue and margins, one that ADI has been particularly focused on with the diversity of functional chips it has in its catalog of nearly 80,000 chips. Customers are coming to rely more and more on buying complete solutions from ADI, which is becoming more of a solutions partner rather than just a chip components vendor. This allows ADI to get closer to its customers  engineering teams and help design and build subsystems comprised of multiple chips that its own engineers have integrated to perform complete functions. Historically, engineers at the customers  design centers would be buying chips from multiple companies and integrating them onto system boards themselves.Delivering more complete solutions has enabled ADI to increase its average selling prices and build a higher margin business over time, while also providing further protection from competition and deleterious price pressure effects in the future during more economically challenging times.Examples of this are battery management and infotainment systems in autos, 5G cellular radio infrastructure, digital systems in healthcare instruments, and smart factories. ADI has targeted and successfully built systems level businesses in these high growth industries.Based on what industry leaders like ADI and TI are saying and our own broader understanding of trends in various industries, including auto, energy, communications, industrial, and healthcare, it appears that trends in this part of the semiconductor industry is at an inflection point of acceleration. Whereas historically organic growth has trended in the mid-single digits, the next few years are forecasted to grow closer to 10  per year. In fact, these companies are so confident in that forecast based on customer conversations that they are allocating billions more in capital to build out new manufacturing capacity to meet the demand.In the meantime, valuation multiples in this area are reasonably cheap since the semiconductor industry, outside of booming AI related names, has been undergoing an inventory correction as a result of rebalancing from the COVID disruption years. We believe we are at the latter part of the cyclical adjustment that fluctuates around an accelerating secular trend.The future is bright for analog leaders like ADI and TI, although they are pursuing that opportunity with different business strategies that lead us to currently prefer ADI over TI. However, we believe both could be winners at different stages as the industry evolves to capture the growth opportunity ahead.

Super Micro Computer: Big Secular AI Tailwinds,"If you like to invest in powerful secular growth opportunities, Super Micro Computer  has likely caught your eye. This developer and manufacturer of high-performance servers and storage systems isSuper Micro Computer was founded in 1993 as a five-person operation run by Charles Liang, alongside his wife and company treasurer, Sara Liu. It has since grown into a significant player in the IT industry, with a focus on innovative designs and efficient solutions. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California and has manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Taiwan, andSMCI was started with a vision to develop servers and storage solutions with modular and open architecture designs, which would allow for greater customization and scalability. It has been able to adapt quickly to changing technology trends and it is now a preferred choice for customers seeking powerful, flexible, and energy-efficient computing solutions. The company has expanded its solutions to cater to a diverse set of market verticals, including high-growth markets, such as enterprise data centers, cloud computing, AI, 5G and edge computing. In each of the last three fiscal years, SMCI has sold to more than 1,000 direct customers in over 100 countries. In addition, it serves thousands of end users through its indirect sales channel.The company's sources of revenue are  1  server and storage systems and  2  subsystems and accessories  see chart below . Revenue from server and storage systems is derived from assembly and integration of servers and storage systems and related services to help set up, maintain, and support these systems. Subsystems and accessories revenue includes sales of server boards, chassis, and accessories., server and storage systems made up 93  of total revenue, while subsystems and accessories revenue made up the remaining 7 . In terms of geographical distribution, the company earned a substantial portion of its Q4 2023 revenue in the USA, as shown in the chart below.In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in server systems and storage racks towards adopting advanced technologies such as energy management and seamless cloud integration, with a primary focus on software. Super Micro Computer, with its innovations in open architecture rack designs and modular solutions for data centers, has emerged as a leader in this domain.The company's comprehensive Total IT Solutions approach offers a complete package, encompassing AI, servers, storage, networking, software, racking, cabling, power, cooling, integration, validation, management features, and services. This approach allows customers to entrust their IT hardware solutions to SMCI and concentrate more on their applications and new software functions.The newly introduced solutions  liquid-cooled rack-scale solutions and production lines, product auto configurator and online business automation  enhance value provided to customers  in a fast and high-quality manner . Additionally, the company is working on improving its cost efficiency by expanding operations in Taiwan and the upcoming Malaysia campus.SMCI has now reached a stage where, given there are no hindrances in supply, it can design, construct and validate complete systems, and deliver ready-to-use rack-level solutions to customers in only a matter of weeks after an order is placed. This is a much faster timeline compared to its competitors  which often take months . The company is currently on track to support 4,000 racks per month of global manufacturing capacity by year end.One standout feature of SMCI's approach is its focus on environmentally friendly solutions. The company's architecture allows for independent refreshing of different system components, which reduces energy consumption and e-waste. By sharing computing resources, SMCI products also help save space and power, aligning with the growing importance of energy-efficient computing in modern data centers. According to the company's estimates, if the IT industry adopts its Green Computing solutions, it's possible to save close to  10B in electricity costs per year, which is equivalent of eliminating about 30 fossil fueled power plants and equating to the preservation of up to 8B trees for our planet.In 2022, the global AI market was worth  454B. It's  to significantly expand and reach  2.6T by the year 2032, at a CAGR of 19   see chart below . The increasing need for AI technology in different industries like automotive, healthcare, banking and finance, manufacturing, food and beverages, logistics, and retail is predicted to strongly contribute to the expansion of the global AI market in the coming years. A significant milestone was the introduction of ChatGPT 3.0 in 2022, which brought attention to the potential of generative AI, which has led to a noticeable rise in interest in generative AI.Due to the surge in demand for large-scale GPU-driven systems essential for handling data-intensive generative AI and machine learning tasks, SMCI finds itself in the right place at the right time. In the last quarter, the company showcased remarkable speed at which it was securing important design contracts for cutting-edge GPUs, and the backlog of orders also rose steadily. One major edge that SMCI holds over its rivals is its strong collaborations with key chip industry leaders like NVIDIA , Intel, and AMD .And according to Super Micro Computer CEO, Charles LiangThe market for servers, storage, and associated IT solutions is benefiting from a prolonged trend of digital transformation, as companies across the globe seek to enhance their IT systems to accommodate high computing workloads. Although there are short-term headwinds due to elevated inflation, economic activity slowdown, disturbances in the supply chain, and geopolitical tensions, the server market has displayed continued resilience in recent years, as IT infrastructure has become progressively vital for many enterprises.According to , worldwide server market spending was at  123B in 2022 and is expected to touch  186B by 2027, with a CAGR of 8.6  in the five-year period. Owing to swift transformations, susceptibility to emerging technological advancements, and shifting customer preferences, the industry is marked by intense competition. Supermicro has several distinctive attributes that set it apart from its competitors. These encompass reduced expenses, quicker market entry, and a significant emphasis on environmentally friendly computing. Supermicro has also benefitted greatly from the generative AI boom and its key partnership with NVIDIA, outperforming the industry average growth rate over the past three years.In Q4 2023, total revenue increased 34  YoY to  2.2B. Revenue from Server and Storage Systems grew 37  YoY to  2B and accounted for 93  of total revenue. Subsystems and Accessories revenue made up the remaining 7  and was flat at  153M. The strong growth was driven by the demand for Supermicro's leading AI platforms, particularly the NVIDIA HGX-based Delta Next solution, which is tailored for optimal performance of Large Language Models  LLM  like ChatGPT.Through its in-house Building Block Server  BBS  system, Supermicro possesses one of the most comprehensive ranges of GPU solutions required for AI infrastructure. The company has plans to further solidify its market position with the forthcoming MGX platforms, which represents a shared vision for AI computing developed collaboratively with NVIDIA. Numerous customers have already expressed interest in these new MGX platforms, and they are expected to enter mass production shortly. With nearly half of revenues this quarter derived from AI-related designs, the positive momentum in AI growth is expected to persist and expand the company's TAM across diverse customer categories.Supermicro has outperformed management guidance in each of the last five quarters, except Q3 FY23, which was marked by economic headwinds and component shortages. The company is in a much better position going forward and for the full year 2024, management expects total revenue to be in the range of  9.5B -  10.5B, representing growth of 33  to 47 , as the demand environment for LLMs and other AI applications continues to be robust.On the profitability front, Supermicro reported a Non-GAAP gross profit margin of 17.1  in Q4 2023, down 50 basis points as compared to last year. This was due to the company's focus on securing new designs and expanding market share. However, for FY 2023, Non-GAAP gross profit margin improved to 18.1  from 15.4  in the preceding fiscal year. This was driven by an increased mix of rack-scale products and customers, coupled with enhanced manufacturing efficiencies. Non-GAAP operating margin also improved to 11  in Q4 2023  vs 10.7  and 11.4  in FY 2023  vs 7.2 . This is attributed to increased operating leverage from higher revenues and expense controls.The largely stable and double-digit gross and operating margins reflect the strength of Supermicro's business model. Benefitting from enhanced economies of scale and increased Average Selling Prices  ASPs , the company is expected to continue to exhibit similar profitability levels going forward.Supermicro ended FY 2023 with  440M in cash and cash equivalents and  120M in long-term debt. The company generated  627M in Free Cash Flow  FCF  in FY 2023, improving significantly from negative  486M in FY 2022, as supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic headwinds eased. Ample liquidity and low debt level put Supermicro in a strong position to weather near-term uncertainties and it has the potential to consistently generate favorable FCF going forward.Supermicro emerged as one of the standout performers in 2022, in the midst of an overwhelmingly negative sentiment prevailing in the markets. This trend has extended into 2023, with SMCI capitalizing on the AI-driven surge in stock prices and the stock is up  243  YTD.Historically, SMCI has traded on notably low valuation multiples. The company faced reputation  and  that led to years of subpar performance. However, over time, the controversies have subsided, and thorough investigations have failed to unearth any significant incriminating evidence against SMCI's products.Now, with AI taking center stage, SMCI's prospects have improved significantly. The company stands out for providing some of the most energy-efficient server solutions in the market, and despite the recent steep run-up in stock price, we believe the risk-reward ratio is favorable for long-term investors.As you can see in the table below, SMCI trades at only 14.7x forward earnings, very reasonable for a company benefiting from such high growth. It is the second best  Computer Hardware  performer this year  behind only IonQ , read our  and a clear top performer over the last 2-year and 10-year periods. It currently trades at only 2.2x sales, again quite reasonable for a business with such high growth and healthy profitability  incidentally, EV Sales is 2.1x .Worth mentioning, SMCI shares are down  16.4  over the last month, a more attractive entry point versus previous highs, especially considering the attractive valuation and continuing high growth. The server market is marked by intense competition. There are swift transformations, and Supermicro remains susceptible to emerging technological advancements, shifting customer preferences, and novel product launches. Market players are continually investing in R D to introduce more powerful and efficient servers. The company's primary competitors are major suppliers of general-purpose servers and components based on the x86 architecture. Smaller suppliers that specialize in marketing server components and systems also compete. In recent times, the company has experienced increased competition between original design manufacturers  ODMs  who capitalize on their size and highly economical manufacturing capabilities. The server industry is susceptible to various risks stemming from supply chain disruptions. Shortages of critical components result in delayed production and increased costs, affecting the ability to meet customer demands. Fluctuations in supply chain availability also result in increased working capital requirements leading to reduced cashflows. To mitigate these risks, diversifying supplier base, building contingency plans and maintaining buffer inventory is of prime importance. Although Supermicro's close collaboration with key suppliers is a compelling competitive moat, the company is not completely immune to supply chain disruptions. As with any big disruptive secular trend, in this case,  Artificial Intelligence  and  The Cloud,  shares of Super Micro Computer have been very volatile and short-interest  basically people betting against the shares  is high  recently over 10 . High volatility  and differing market opinions  is often the price you pay for the best long-term returns. The recent share price pullback may provide opportunity for disciplined long-term investors to begin building a position in the shares.Super Micro Computer is in the right place and at the right time. As the demand for AI capabilities has exploded higher this year, SMCI benefits from its key relationships  with Nvidia, AMD and Intel  as well as its economies of scale, speed to market and now higher selling prices as a result. The company is profitable and growing rapidly, and despite recent strong price gains, the shares continue to trade at a very reasonable valuation. Considering the current risk and reward dynamics, we view Super Micro Computer as an extremely attractive opportunity for patient, long-term investors.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Dow: This Dog Of The Dow Will Make A Comeback,"Dow Inc.  is a company that produces various chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The company emerged from a  in 2019 and is a major player in the chemicals industry. Dow is dedicated to spearheading the pathDespite the lowered industry demand, DOW's current price is appealing because of its cost advantage, a high dividend yield that is covered by cash flow, diverse product and service portfolio, classified as a  Dog Of The Dow  which has historically been a great investing strategy, and it is currently undervalued with big upside potential.DOW was classified as a dog of the Dow Jones in early 2023. The Dogs Of The Dow investment strategy entails purchasing the top 10 highest-yielding stocks from the 30 stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average. While it might appear simplistic, the Dogs of the Dow strategy has delivered an average annual return of 8.7  since 2000 in comparison to the Dow Jones' 7  annual average return. Although the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF  doesn't have history dating back to 2000, we can see an example of the Dog's outperformance here below.I wouldn't solely base an investment decision on a  strategy  but I do think it's something neat and unique to mention here. I was always quite fond of tracking these kinds of metrics.By 2025, DOW make significant progress on CO2 reduction which is planned to be accomplished through an E-cracking pilot.  Cracking  is an advanced technology that can be utilized to reduce CO2 emissions overall.Nevertheless, this energy-intensive procedure generates a substantial volume of CO2 emissions. To stay committed to their sustainability goals, Dow is  with Shell  to introduce a new concept  replacing conventional heating methods in steam cracker furnaces with renewable electricity. DOW is making great strides towards achieving these sustainability metrics as according to their timeline, they are in progress and on track with these goals that will significantly reduce CO2 emissions. I feel that this is noteworthy because through these initiatives, DOW anticipates an earnings growth exceeding  3 billion annually, alongside a projected reduction of approximately 30  in CO2 emissions by 2030.DOW's success is linked to its ability to produce chemicals more affordably in North America by using low-cost natural gas-based materials. This advantage could lessen if natural gas prices rise, driven by global demand and shifts to renewable energy. DOW's CEO had the following statement at the most recent earnings callTaking a look at DOW's cash from operations does confirm that they are treading in the right direction here. We can see that cash from operations has grown at an average of 9.5  per year. this is pretty healthy considering the macro challenges such as local price decreases and lowered global energy costs that DOW is currently experiencing. This is reassuring because it generally means that when market conditions align for DOW, we can expect a much higher level of profitability in the future. Confirmation of these conditions were stated in the latest earnings We can see that DOW's current strategy to weather these market conditions is by prioritizing cost-saving measures throughout their business. They are targeting a savings total of  1B. This includes confronting maintenance turnaround spending and to reassess higher-cost but lower-return polyurethanes, coatings, and industry solutions.Lastly, we can see that since the spinoff, DOW has seen healthy growth in operating EBITDA, FCF, available liquidity, and a substantial decrease in net debt from  16.7B down to  11.3B. The reduction of debt allows buybacks as well as the potential to increase the dividend distribution. The decrease in debt will also result in DOW paying less in interest payments which is likely to result in an increase of free cash flow.DOW offers a solid dividend yield of 5.2 , one of the highest among its peers. Unfortunately, we haven't had a chance to experience a track record of dividend raises yet because of the company currently take a cash preservation approach during unfavorable market conditions. Despite this, the company's cash flow comfortably covers the dividend. DOW's cash per share is  4.16 while the dividend payout is currently  2.8 per share. This represents a payout ratio of roughly 67 . I anticipate this payout ratio to shrink within the next 5-year period as margins get larger and profitability starts to rise.We can determine from their latest  that DOW is in strong financial standing. DOW generated  1.3B of cash flow from operations while paying out about  500M to shareholders as a dividend.I fully expect dividend raises in the future as signals indicate profitability likely to rise over the next decade as natural gas prices settle out and DOW is able to capitalize on better profit margins from better macro environment conditions. This includes better profit margins because of local prices on items such as polyethylene, primarily used for flexible packaging. I plan on collecting more shares below the  55 price and enjoy a steady income stream of dividends while we ride out this cycle of reduced demand.According to Seeking Alpha, analysts hold optimistic outlooks for DOW. While they anticipate challenges in the current year due to a global economic slowdown, they project a swift rebound and anticipate the company's earnings to experience double-digit growth over the coming years. Analysts have forecasted earnings per share of  3.94 for 2024 and  4.80 for 2025. This is understandable in my opinion because of the likely increased profit margins from a more suitable set of macroeconomic conditions.In addition, using a DCF  Discounted Cash Flow  analysis and conservative growth estimate of 5  annually, we can determine a fair value of  67 share by 2025. From the current price level, this represents an upside of 22 .Total revenue amounted to  11.4 billion, marking a 27  decrease compared to the previous year. The drop in sales across all operational segments was due to reduced demand and prices resulting from a sluggish macroeconomic environment. In addition, sales declined by 4 , as the increase in volume was outweighed by the decline in local prices. Success here really depends on what the macro environment will shape to be.This could be a barrier DOW faces looking forward and if they are not able to mitigate this margin somehow, I'd expect the price to stay flat or fall a bit under the  50 share mark. So far though, nothing here is concerning as DOW was able to strategically manage this current setback through targeted cost-saving measures and has the potential to continue doing so for the short term.Dow Inc.  DOW  is a prominent player in the chemicals sector, emerging from a 2019 merger to offer diverse chemical, plastic, and fiber solutions. Committed to sustainable energy solutions, DOW's global presence spans 31 countries and 104 manufacturing sites.While revenue declined due to market challenges, DOW strategically manages costs, indicating better profitability when market conditions improve. Financially, DOW demonstrates positive cash flow growth and debt reduction, enhancing potential for buybacks and dividend growth.Though risks persist, DOW's adaptive strategies and growth potential position it for value creation. DOW's capacity to innovate and seize macroeconomic opportunities will likely define its future success.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"VinFast: Long-Term Growth Potential, Meme Stock Frenzy Untenable","Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup Joint Stock Company  JSC  - led by Mr. Phạm Nhật Vượng - is having a veritable fortnight in the sun. Originally starting out in Kharkiv, Ukraine as dried foods company Technocom in 1993  which produced Ukraine's popular  Mivina  brand of instant noodles , the companyA lot of the recent hype coming its way lately hasn't been from  Mivina   which was  in 2010  but rather from  specificVinFast originally started operations by producing electrified 2-wheelers  or  e-scooters  in Vietnam, with Germany's Bosch  and South Korea's LG Chem supplying the batteries. Over the years since, the company diversified into Internal Combustion Engine  ICE -driven vehicles, electric buses and electric cars.The company's first two ICE-driven models, Pininfarina-designed LUX A2.0 and the LUX SA2.0, were based on previous generation BMW  products and powered by BMW's N20 turbocharged petrol engine. The third model was a V8 version of the SA2.0 designed for  while the fourth model - the compact Fadil - was  with General Motors  as a rebadged variant of the Opel Karl.In the present year, VinFast is in the midst of a massive pivot  and the  factor behind such massive interest  it will  ICE-driven cars after fulfilling long-outstanding orders and switch to becoming a  pure play EV carmaker.Nearly all of the models  both available and upcoming  are in the SUV silhouette, with two current models  available to customers based outside Vietnam and two more expected later this year or thereaboutsThis is possibly the  factor behind such massive interest  the company is offering EVs across a gamut of vehicle size classifications in a popular silhouette format. The  factor could be that the rates of the currently-available models  and thus, possibly, of the upcoming ones  are highly competitive with those by the likes of Tesla and Ford's  Mustang EVs.The Vietnam-specific  VF 5  has a rather interesting backstory  with a starting price of around  23,000, its entry came with the backdrop of Chinese EVs such as the  4,500 Hongguang Mini EV and others from the likes of BYD Company Limited  entering the Vietnamese market. 3,000 orders were received for the VF 5 in the diminutive Vietnamese market  earlier this year. Reports since then do not seem to suggest any outsized issues.In order to make its products more accessible among buyers, the company effectively leases out the vehicle's battery for a monthly fee based on miles traveled. The company  to provide a lifetime battery warranty covering all maintenance and repair costs, and will replace the battery for free when charging capacity dips below 70 . This is an attractive guarantee for buyers concerned about battery capabilities of a new carmaker. It's also a mark of confidence that such a new carmaker is willing to shoulder the substantial downside costs. This is likely the  factor behind the interest.The  factor are a combination of events that signify the company's deep commitment to striking out with unique propositionsParent Vingroup has invested  into the company through the end of 2022, despite the fact that only 7,400 electric vehicles were sold that year. Despite only   mostly VF 8s  being registered in the U.S. from March through June of this year, VinFast broke ground on its first manufacturing facility outside Vietnam in  in July.Costing at least  4 billion, the facility aims to open in 2025 with an  production capacity of 150,000 vehicles annually. The state has offered the company up to  1.25 billion in incentives that can be reached if it meets hiring and investment thresholds. The localization of manufacturing into the targeted market  thereby signifying the meeting of localized standards and expectations  is likely the  factor behind the massive interest.Rationalizing the stock's recent performance is a  different beast.The company has attempted for years to list in U.S. bourses which included a Byzantine move of its legal and financial HQ  along with  to a Singapore subsidiary which is, in turn, owned by a Vietnam-based entity.Earnings releases over the past couple of quarters aren't presently available. However, in preparation of an eventual listing either via an IPO or SPAC merger, full-year  FY  results have been made available via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC . The line trends therein aren't  interestingKey facets that can be extracted areAt least one reason for the company going through the SPAC route is that this has fewer regulatory hurdles. After all, the parent still continues to own  of the company. The SPAC deal ostensibly brought only  to outside investors, while the rest of the  shares outstanding are held by insiders, i.e., the parent and the parent's founder.Institutional portfolio managers advisors with the steeliest of nerves would likely take pause due to the price ratios of a company with such low sales entering an increasingly competitive market. However, there is a subcategory of institutional investor that  be interested  those looking at a 10-15 year horizon for a deal on the cheap. They would be the closest facsimile to the  diamond hands  depicted in the patois of many an investment forum. This group  take many of the aforementioned factors of interest into consideration and lock in for the long haul at a reasonable price point.On the 14th, SPAC partner Black Spade Acquisition's  BSAQ  shares . On the 15th, VinFast's new shares opened at  22, more than  the  agreed with the SPAC partner that had valued the company at  23 billion. It closed the day at  37.06  a 68  intraday gain . The journey since has been no less dramatic.Overall, the data suggests that the shares available for trading have changed hands about four times. Over the course of this week alone, i.e., the 21st through the 28th, traded volume is in excess of . On the 22nd alone, the traded volume was in  of shares made available for trading. The average holding period was at roughly 1.5 days in the past week and steadily decreasing in the present week. Given these facts, it's a fair assumption that institutional participation is vanishingly small at present.It bears noting that the company and the parent have stood little to gain once the shares were listed, although  paper  valuations have currently elevated the company into 3rd place, just behind Tesla and Toyota. The parent  to supplement the company's capital needs and is also leveraging capital from its healthier businesses to give it a longer cash runway. The sole beneficiaries are those benefiting from the stock being  meme-ified  skywards.The parent isn't particularly known to throw good money after bad for very long. For instance, its subsidiary VinSmart  of smartphones and televisions three years after it began since  at 0  despite capturing 10  of the local market. From a long-term investor's perspective, there could be two possibilities if VinFast fails to capture substantial U.S. market share and Year-on-Year  YoY  growth on its ownIn either scenario, it is possible that the senior carmaker might make an offer for shares of the company. Thus, for the long-term investor, there is  buffer of inherent value. This is, of course, speculation. Both carmakers have more than sufficient wherewithal to go their own way but it is, of course, easier to simply pick up existing assets if the price is right. A third carmaker can conclude the matter for the same reasons.It bears noting that a number of reviews of the  VF 8 , with a prominent reviewer's headline being . On balance, though, car-making is a long game  the  that it will continue to strive to bring quality products to the market.In the present, the stock's valuation merits a  Hold  rating under  circumstancesFor those looking to cash in on the  meme,  VinFast Auto Ltd. stock's price trajectory is extremely volatile and wholly unsupported by fundamentals. Quick profit taking is the name of the game. The stock's trajectory isn't  unique in EV SPACs  Lordstown Motors Corp , Nikola Corp  and Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc   of their market value since their mergers with their respective SPACs. Since its listing at the  22 price level, there has been a  till the closing price as of the 28th. That seems to imply that there is a lot more ground to pull back through.On a macro level, as a  published in May mentioned, there is plenty of room to give in the U.S. market, where German, Korean and even Japanese carmakers have been gaining at Tesla's expense. For EV adoption to grow and the addressable market to expand, a range of options for EVs at affordable price points is needed. It remains to be seen if VinFast will be a trigger that propels development work in that regard.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Oil Prices To Stay Well In The Triple Digits As European Winter Is Almost Here,"The Saudis' oil supply cut made many investors rush to buy the relevant asset classes. But the story with the rising commodity prices is not over, it seems. The  I read was the fact Russia decidedIn order to stabilize the domestic market, Russia  to export gasoline and diesel to all but four ex-Soviet countries. The limit does not apply to fuel delivered to members of the Eurasian Economic Union. Its members include Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan. Russia's seaborne diesel and gasoil Even without that ban, the EU would have probably still ended up with low supplies of gas and oil products. You might argue, however, that this did not happen during the 2022-2023 winter. Indeed, but the reason for this was the fact the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere, and Europe in particular turned out to be very mild. That is why less fuel was needed to supply the population. Oil exports from the US helped as well.But unfortunately for the EU, the situation might get worse compared to the same period a year ago. The inventories in the US Strategic Reserve are near , whilst any unpredictable supply shock, e.g. a war in the Middle East, may force the commodity prices further upwards. So, it seems likely the US would be unwilling and unable to export enough fuel to Europe.Unfortunately, Europe is now far too reliant on LNG  liquified natural gas . True, the proportion of piped gas imports from Russia  to just 17  between the beginning of 2022 and the start of 2023. That has obviously led to unprecedented demand for LNG.LNG s total share of EU gas imports increased from 19  in 2021 to about The LNG infrastructure also had to be upgraded.  increase LNG capacity by about 30  between 2021 and 2024. Interestingly,  into Europe still come from Russia.This LNG shift has made EU countries  that market's volatility because these imports are purchased at short notice. In Asia, however, long-term oil-related contracts prevail.We have recently seen Europe s benchmark gas price rising in recent weeks thanks to at LNG plants in Australia. That is a sign of tight supplies. Obviously, Australian strikes are not the only possible source of disruptions.To synchronize LNG demand, the European Commission has come up with the  This is an IT platform that facilitates supplier companies in EU countries to buy the fuel together. But further questions remain because this platform remains untested. The industry does not want this form of state intervention to undermine the market's demand and supply mechanisms.Norway has taken the place of Russia to become Europe s leading pipeline oil supplier. Its market share  of the requirement at the beginning of 2023 versus 38  a year ago. Obviously, this made Norway s gas infrastructure struggle. Earlier this year in May and June, the fact that maintenance work was  led to sluggish oil flows that made the prices go upwards. This is yet another evidence that Europe's market is tight. So, another disruption in Norway can make the prices of fossil fuels surge.Meanwhile, Europe is  to import about 22 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas from Russia in 2023, which is equivalent to about 11  of all the pipeline gas consumed by the EU . A lion's share of it is coming through Ukraine. Given the current situation, this supply route is facing a serious threat.In order to spread the risks, the EU managed to reduce gas consumption just  in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. The bloc aimed to decrease gas consumption by 15  but did not manage to do so.Further progress in this field is unlikely. Just  European bloc members introduced policies to decrease energy consumption, while Eastern European countries like Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, did not take such measures.Another threat to energy supplies is the fact the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands will be closed as  this year. But the fossil fuel problems do not end here but include the fact Niger's uranium imports to France are under threat thanks to the military coup in Niger. Just a reminder that France relies heavily on nuclear energy, whilst  of uranium imports to France.All these factors are obviously bullish for oil and gas assets. The question is how investors can take advantage of these. It is definitely possible to invest in major oil and gas companies. But it is easy to make a mistake, whilst choosing the most profitable and the cheapest one. So, as an alternative, investors may wish to choose ETFs to benefit from the tight oil market.Below I have made a list of the largest oil ETFs listed in the US. In my humble opinion, conservative investors would be much better off if they chose the largest ones. First of all, the largest ETFs' holdings include big and stable companies with the highest credit ratings. Then, top ETFs are highly liquid and have relatively low expense ratios.Of all the ETFs listed above the largest one is Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund . I wrote about this ETF several times in my previous articles.In short, XLE's holdings  of the S P 500. This does not look like much. But most of the S P 500's companies are high-tech corporations. So, this is not little, I would say. Exxon Mobil Corp , and Chevron Corp  are some of the largest US oil companies. These are profitable and pay high dividends. Moreover, all of XLE's businesses have high credit ratings, which makes this ETF a relatively low-risk buy. Then, the annual expense ratio of XLE is only 0.10 .The downside risks are also substantial. The first obvious non-economic risk is the weather. There is still a risk that it might be as mild as last year. Then, there is a much-feared recession risk. The Fed's Jerome Powell is still expected to hike the interest rates once more this year. The  rule out any further rate hikes either because of the high inflation readings. So, there is a risk that so much monetary tightening might lead to a recession, thus making the oil prices crash. Moreover, OPEC might have to increase the oil output if the commodity prices stay high enough for several months. Some analysts argue that Europe's green energy might help it replace fossil fuels. But I do not believe it will be the case. First, it is a very long-term process. Then, green energy, including wind turbines and solar batteries, . This was clearly shown two years ago when the wind turbines did not generate enough energy because of the .In my view, it seems likely the Northern Hemisphere would have a tough time this winter due to tight fossil fuel markets. That is why it is likely the oil prices will remain high this winter. Obviously, any black swan event would lead to greater energy shortages and higher fossil fuel prices. However, there are risks to my thesis, including the mild weather and a likely global recession ahead. But I still remain bullish about energy assets, oil and gas ETFs in particular.

Nvidia: Why I Believe The Recent Dip Is An Opportunity,"NVIDIA Corporation  is going through the largest transformation of its business model which is not a short-term story and, in my opinion, its real bull case is just starting. NVDA continues to transform its business model withNVIDIA is known for its graphics processing units  GPUs  that were initially used for gaming and graphics-related tasks but have found applications in a wide range of fields, including artificial intelligence and deep learning. The long-term revenue prospectsIn this article, I'll explore NVIDIA's recent capabilities, arguing that past year growth is just the beginning. The recent stock pullback offers a long-term buying opportunity before the upcoming earnings on 8 23.Over the past few quarters, NVDA has strategically established essential cloud capacity pathways, culminating in the announcement of approximately  2.3 billion in  Providers  CSPs . A significant development was the introduction of the DGX Cloud offering, a move that seems to be rapidly gaining traction among customers. During a recent customer panel discussion focused on DGX Cloud, NVDA revealed that the product's unveiling had triggered a surge in interest, with a substantial number of customers eagerly anticipating early access to the platform.DGX Cloud essentially offers customers a gateway to an AI factory in the cloud, seamlessly delivering the computational might of NVDA's DGX systems without necessitating the establishment of hardware infrastructure, such as the DGX H100 or DGX BasePOD, within their own data centers. A pivotal component of DGX Cloud's value proposition, if not the cornerstone, is NVDA's AI Enterprise software suite. This suite encompasses a wide array of accelerated AI and data science tools, finely tuned frameworks, and pre-trained models that cater to diverse industry sectors. Importantly, many of these resources surpass the capabilities that CSPs themselves can offer.While, on the surface, the DGX Cloud business model might appear to set up a competitive dynamic between NVDA and its own customer base, the prevailing sentiment suggests that CSPs are approaching DGX Cloud in a pragmatic manner. In fact, there is a realization that DGX Cloud has the potential to funnel a greater volume of customers into the cloud environment. The collaborative ecosystem formed by DGX Cloud's offerings, including the AI Enterprise software suite, is anticipated to drive a more substantial migration of workloads and projects to the cloud, resulting in a win-win situation for both NVDA and CSPs. This approach aligns with a forward-looking strategy that embraces the transformative power of AI while creating mutually beneficial outcomes for stakeholders in the AI and cloud sectors.NVDA arranged multiple  that revolved around the development and utilization of large language models  LLMs . These sessions emphasized a concerted effort within the community to make substantial advancements in three key areasAn essential focus of multiple sessions was the adoption of FP8  8-bit floating point  for both training and inference, a novel approach made feasible through NVDA's integration of native FP8 support into its Ada and Hopper products. Notably, substantial strides have been achieved in terms of maintaining model accuracy even with FP8 quantization.This development confers a significant edge to NVDA over competitors like AMD , particularly in light of the industry's growing inclination towards FP8 for training and inference. The H100, operating at FP8 precision, delivers a compute performance of approximately 2,000 TFLOPS  with a potential surge to around 4,000 TFLOPS when incorporating sparsity . This starkly contrasts with the A100's FP16 performance, offering a sixfold increase. Critically, the A100 lacks native support for FP8.The implications are twofold The H100's superiority in FP8 precision signifies a substantial enhancement in performance per watt and price performance. This establishes it as an enticing option for tasks such as Large Language Model  LLM  training and inference, capitalizing on the inherent benefits of higher computational output with less energy consumption. In the competitive landscape, NVDA gains a strategic advantage by offering a solution that aligns with the industry trend towards FP8 for AI-related tasks. This native support empowers users to harness the advantages of FP8 without compromising on model accuracy.Collectively, NVDA's embrace of FP8 and the H100's impressive performance metrics bring forth a compelling choice for LLM training and inference. This strategic approach sets NVDA apart by addressing the evolving demands of AI processing, substantiating its position as a leader in the AI hardware domain.Generative AI plays a crucial role in facilitating the creation of sophisticated, varied, and controllable simulations necessary for advancing Level 3 to Level 4  autonomous vehicles. NVDA's DRIVE Sim derives its potency from the fusion of generative AI and Omniverse, enabling the conversion of real-world sensor data into synthetic 3D models  known as digital twins  for rigorous testing and validation. Complementing this innovation is NVDA's novel DRIVE Thor chip, which consolidates autonomous vehicle functionalities into a single System-on-Chip  SoC  for digital clusters, infotainment systems, and driver assistance. This approach streamlines development and accelerates software refinement, offering up to 2,000 teraflops in FP8 precision across AI, infotainment, and driver assist functions.NVDA's DRIVE Thor empowers automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers  OEMs  to tailor configurations to precise requirements. Furthermore, the company  NOW cloud gaming services to vehicles, enhancing in-cabin entertainment offerings. NVDA's distinct advantage lies in its ability to deliver a comprehensive AI toolkit alongside robust hardware, creating a differentiating solution that leverages data center-based AI training to enable high-performance centralized in-car computing.Highlighting NVDA's growth trajectory, its auto design win pipeline has expanded to approximately  14 billion, . The company's recent notable contracts include a partnership with Mercedes to develop a car computing system powered by   the predecessor of Thor . This collaboration, based on public statements from Mercedes, has the potential to drive substantial incremental revenue in the 2026-2028 timeframe, potentially amounting to several billion dollars annually.Per , Graphics Processing Unit  'GPU'  Market size is expected to grow from  41.82 billion in 2023 to  172.08 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 32.70  during the forecast period  2023-2028 .Based on a range of factors, with a strong focus on TSMC's capacity expansion, we can project GPU units for NVDA and AMD. Regarding AMD, there's substantial demand for several hundred thousand GPU units across major hyperscale s. This demand still holds, but it's important to recognize that capacity constraints and lead times for the MI300X may prevent the shipment of all these units in FY 2024.Moreover, this situation could extend into FY 2025, as we expect new orders to come in and contribute to revenue backfilling. This underscores the significance of considering capacity limitations and lead times when assessing the timeline for fulfilling GPU unit orders in the context of AMD's operations.NVIDIA is playing a pivotal role that can be likened to a  kingmaker  in the current landscape. This analogy highlights the company's influential position, as it is not merely a participant but a significant driving force behind the ongoing transformations in the AI sector. The market is witnessing a significant surge in capital investments and the emergence of innovative financing vehicles. These resources are being directed towards novel AI software solutions and specialized cloud infrastructure models, with notable examples being CoreWeave and Lamda Labs.In parallel, enterprises are encountering a substantial challenge in their early stages of adopting AI at scale   the struggle to secure adequate computing capacity. This capacity is essential for building and deploying AI systems effectively. This demand-supply mismatch is likely to persist well into the upcoming year, reflecting the magnitude of the transition toward AI-driven technologies across industries.Currently NVDA is trading at  53X EV FCF.NVDA is trading at  29X premium to the S P500 and  26X premium to other Semi-conductor stocks.NVDA is currently trading  29X premium to the S P 500 and it s in line with its historical trading range of the stock over the past 5 years, where the median P E ratio has been around 39X.If we assume that in FY 2024, it shows 5  growth in Gaming and an impressive 96  growth for Data Center YoY  and in FY 2025, 8  growth for Gaming and 15  for Data Center YoY, then my projections assume net income margins of 49  for FY 2024 and 44  for FY2025.I am using a conservative multiple of 33X for valuation purposes. This is relatively lower compared to the historical trading range of the stock over the past 5 years, where the median P E  Price-to-Earnings  ratio has been around 39X. Despite being on the lower end of historical valuations, I believe this lower multiple is justified due to anticipation that the market will begin compressing the multiple. This expectation is based on the substantial increase in earnings I foresee in the upcoming quarters.By applying a  33x multiple, stock should trade around  625.  Providing investors  40  upside from current trading priceAdditionally, it's important to recognize the historical pattern of NVDA's stock performance. It has typically followed a trajectory where its peak value tends to occur after the YoY comparisons have reached their peak. This suggests that there might still be significant upside potential for the stock in the foreseeable future, and that the current momentum could potentially carry forward for some time before any substantial corrections or adjustments occur.NVDA's innovative use of generative AI, the integration of DRIVE Thor, and its strategic software-hardware synergy position the company as a pioneer in the autonomous vehicle landscape. The projected revenue growth and strategic partnerships underscore the potential of NVDA's offerings to significantly shape the automotive industry's future.In essence, NVDA's role as a  kingmaker  is shaping the AI landscape by attracting capital, stimulating innovation, and addressing the computational demands of AI adoption. Both strategic and tactical investors are finding reasons to remain engaged in the company's growth story, as the prevailing market dynamics and historical patterns indicate promising prospects for the foreseeable future.I established this target price by employing a P E ratio. Risks specific to NVIDIA includeThese company-specific and industry-wide risks should be closely monitored, as they can impact NVIDIA's performance, market positioning, and overall growth prospects.

First Solar: A Little Pricy For Me,"I wanted to take a look at First Solar  and how it has improved its financials since FY22. It seems like the company has improved a lot and is projected to make decent margins and revenueSolar power has been experiencing a boom in the last decade, going from total energy generation of around 95TWh in 2012, to  by 2022. We can see that it is gaining in popularity as more and more countries become more environmentally conscious. Renewable energy has become a big topic these days with ESG factors playing a much bigger role. Millennials and Gen Z are goingMany countries are also providing government subsidies in the form of tax breaks credits for companies like First Solar, and it depends a lot on these subsidies to generate revenues. In my opinion, these subsidies all around the world will not go away anytime soon and will most likely accelerate because of the current generations that are more environmentally conscious. The demand for renewable energy is there and governments are not going to squander that. Just recently, the Biden-Harris administration announced a   Solar for All Grant competition  that aims to fund costs for families and  advance environmental justice through investing in America .India, which still gets most of its energy, around 80 , from coal, oil, and other non-renewable energy will be a great future opportunity for First Solar, as the Indian government is starting to warm to the idea of renewable energy and it wants to have solar energy to be the leader in the country with  of energy to come from solar, which will be around 280GWh by 2030. India does not represent a very big market for FSLR yet, however, with most of the country getting  of clear and sunny days, coupled with , I could see this becoming a much bigger revenue generator in the future, especially now that the construction of the factory is completed there and will begin production shortly.It also seems like the growth of solar energy is going to continue on a strong positive trajectory, as it is predicted to grow at a very  until '28. This already coincides with what FSLR can attain in terms of revenue generation, with the  showing revenues increased by around 30  from the same quarter last year.All the graphs below will be as of FY22  however, I will include some of the latest figures for extra color if it is necessary.As of Q2 '23, the company had around  1.9B in cash and marketable securities, against  437m in long-term debt. This is a very strong position to be in, which provides flexibility in how the company is going to expand its global footprint and other initiatives. The company's current ratio has been a little too high in my opinion, which is a good and a bad thing. A good thing because it has no problems paying off its short-term obligations and a bad thing because this tells me that the company isn't being very efficient in using its assets for further expansion. I would like to see the company being more aggressive in future expansion. As of Q2 '23, the ratio stood at over 3.3. My ideal range is anywhere between 1.5-2.0. This is the range I believe tells us that the company is being efficient with its available liquidity and still able to pay off its short-term obligation with ease.The company's historic ROA and ROE have not been very impressive to say the least, however, since the company has become quite a bit more profitable if we look at the analyst's estimates, the graphs below will include years '23 and '24 which show how these metrics might evolve and they look much healthier than before.If the numbers in '23 and '24 are close to where the company might end up, then it is a very good return on both metrics.The same can be said about the company's return on invested capital. The historic numbers were quite disappointing, however, since the company seems to be having a turnaround, ROIC might develop like this in the futureThis would tell me that the company has a decent moat and a competitive advantage.Overall, if we just look at the historical figures, it will show quite a mixed bag of results, and certainly not the best, but if we make some assumptions, the profitability and efficiency will improve quite considerably in the upcoming years. Take the estimates with a grain of salt because these are just my estimates, and a lot can happen over the next couple of years. Prices may fluctuate, and production costs increase once again, which will bring down these metrics as they did in the past.It seems like the past revenue growth doesn't apply to FSRL because, in the past decade, the company managed to lose 21  of revenues. FY15 to FY16 and FY17 to FY18 drops can be explained by divestitures. Now, with the recent performance in the latest quarter, analysts are estimating around 33  growth in FY23 and around 30  in FY24. Let's say the time has come for FSLR to shine, so for my base case, I went with an 18.8  CAGR over the next decade, 22.5  for my optimistic case, and 16.8  CAGR for an optimistic case.I admit these figures are more than just optimistic, but analysts see a lot of improvement over the next decade in terms of revenues and margins, so I will stick with these estimates.Speaking of margins, FY22 was a very bad year for FSLR. Cost of sales accounted for 97.3  of net sales. The  came in from freight, demurrage, and detention charges, which accounted for  167m. In the latest quarter, gross margins came in at around 38 , which tells us that the costs have stabilized, and the company is going to perform much better in the future.I decided to improve gross margins from around 35  in FY23 to around 45  by FY32, which I believe is slightly optimistic also.Because I decided to go with such optimistic assumptions and because the financial estimates also look great on assumptions, I will add a 35  margin of safety to the intrinsic value calculation. With that said, First Solar's intrinsic value is  155.14 a share, implying that currently the company is slightly overvalued.The company has a lot of potential to perform very well, with many countries subsidizing the future of energy consumption, FSLR is going to be one of the leaders to capture a lot of growth in this segment, however, does this mean that the company is going to be so much more profitable going forward than it was in the past  Is the revenue growth that I assumed for the model attainable  It is hard to tell given the past revenue growth, or lack thereof.Nevertheless, if the share price retreats slightly to my implied share price, the risk reward would be much more enticing than now, and I would seriously look into opening a position and see how it goes in the next couple of years.Currently, the company is trading at 15.6x '24 earnings according to my model, and at my PT it would be trading at around 12x, which I would prefer to be honest, so I will be waiting patiently for a pullback if one happens. If not, then I'll keep looking for a company that is closer to my risk reward profile.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

This volatility aligns with its financial performance, with periodsPresented above are Willdan's financial results.Willdan s revenue has grown at an impressive CAGR of 19  during the last decade, with inconsistent gains year-on-year. Its growth trajectory has been materially impacted by various acquisitions and the inherent nature of contractual work. Large wins and roll-offs have and will materially impact the company. EBITDA has broadly exceeded this level, with a CAGR of 25 .Willdan offers a wide range of consulting services, including energy efficiency and sustainability solutions, engineering and planning, public finance and economic consulting, and disaster recovery services. This diversity allows it to target a broad client base, including utilities, and private enterprises.Willdan has a significant presence in government contracts and consulting, particularly in the US. It assists government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels in addressing critical issues such as energy efficiency upgrades, disaster recovery planning, and infrastructure development. The company has developed a long track record  of over a number of decades in some cases  of high-quality support, utilizing this to develop its brands and pitch for additional work.The company's consultants are highly specialized in their respective fields, with selective recruitment and a strong emphasis on training. These expertise are critical given the complex nature of the energy industry and the scrutiny associated with being allocated multi-year contracts.Willdan is currently capitalizing on the growing demand for energy efficiency and sustainability solutions. It is helping clients reduce energy consumption, lower carbon emissions, and achieve sustainability goals. This is a global trend that is supported by societal pressure and government regulation, contributing to a strong tailwind. We believe this transition will materially impact Willdan in two key verticals. Firstly, there is a growing market for renewable energy projects and infrastructure, including solar and wind, offering opportunities for Willdan to design and consult on sustainable energy solutions. Secondly, the public and private sector will be investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades given this is the only material way to reduce climate impact rapidly. This again presents avenues for Willdan to offer engineering and consulting services.Willdan is currently leveraging technology to enhance its consulting services. It uses data analytics, modeling tools, and software solutions to optimize energy usage, assess infrastructure needs, and make data-driven recommendations. This has significantly enhanced the company s cross-selling capabilities. The following is an excerpt from Management s communications illustrating this.Finally, Management is active in strategically acquiring companies with complementary expertise, broadening its service portfolio and customer base. These acquisitions have accelerated growth and increased market share, covering any weaknesses or deficiencies in its existing model.The company has a strong business model. It operates similarly to leading consulting firms, with a range of related services that are complementary  developed organically and through M A , a focus on reputation building through successful projects, and an emphasis on high-quality recruitment. The key differentiation with Willdan is its focus on the energy segment. Historically, this would represent a partially cyclical but low-risk segment due to its emphasis on multi-year government contracts. Now, however, the company will benefit from an extended tailwind as various institutions seek to decarbonize their infrastructure while others are focused on new clean investments. Willdan will essentially benefit from its historical strengths, while its growth trajectory improves.Willdan s margins have been incredibly volatile, aligning with the rest of the business. This is a reflection of the company s cyclicality and contact-based nature, in conjunction with a relatively fixed cost base. With tailwinds ahead, we expect a normalization in its year-on-year performance, which could mean a smoothing of this profile.Willdan s recent performance remains strong, with revenue growth of  23.5 ,  22.8 ,  11.7 , and  16.0  in its last four quarters. In conjunction with this, margins sequentially improved relative to prior years.This may be a surprise to some given the wider macroeconomic environment, with the expectation that spending by clients would soften. This has not been the case. Management is seeing no  signs of a recession . Labor shortages and Willdan s capabilities have allowed it to expand its services across the US, with a number of new client wins and upselling opportunities.Key takeaways from Management s recent communications includeOverarchingly, it appears clear that industry tailwinds and the broader trajectory of its clients have outweighed any economic concerns. Management is very confident of growth and is investing heavily to ensure its various businesses are positioned to maximize their reach.Willdan s balance sheet is relatively clean. The company has a ND EBITDA ratio of 2.9x, which implies a comfortable debt position although it lacks scope for further debt without profitability growth. With Management expecting M A to begin again in the near future, we could see capital raised through equity or more expensive debt, neither of which is ideal in our view.There is good scope to raise funds through FCF but the volatile nature of its operations means this is highly uncertain. As an example, the company has generated  0m between FY21 and FY22. With greater backlog and new business wins, this should improve.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 2 years.Analysts are forecasting strong growth in the coming years, with a CAGR of 10  into FY24F. In conjunction with this, margins are expected to slightly improve from the FY22 levels.These assumptions appear reasonable in our view, as Management communications imply an improvement in the company s trajectory with tailwinds improving. Its recent contracts alone should ensure HSD LDD growth, although analysts are likely being conservative with new customer wins. As a reminder, Management is of the belief that when M A is factored in, growth will reach  15 .Presented above is a comparison of Willdan's growth and profitability to the average of its industry, as defined by Seeking Alpha  30 companies .Willdan s revenue growth has been strong relative to its peers, exceeding the industry on a 3Y basis, with the expectation of this to continue in the forward period. The company s strong growth is a reflection of the broader energy transition, contributing to increased demand for services beyond the normalized level. Willdan s margins are its key weakness, with a material deficit to the industry. This is a gap the company is unlikely to close based on historical results.Given the maturity of the industry, our preference is for margins over growth, which means Willdan should be trading at a discount to its peers.Willdan is currently trading at 14x LTM EBITDA and 9x NTM EBITDA. This is a discount to its historical average, although not on a NTM EBITDA basis.Our view is that Willdan should be trading at a small premium to its historical average. Our rationale is that its margins are currently slightly above average, while its growth trajectory is enhanced by the current energy transition that will likely unwind over  10 years. Based on this, Willdan is attractively priced, with a 10-20  upside in our view. Confirming this for us is its NTM FCF yield, which is above average at 6.2 .Further, Willdan is trading at a 22  LTM EBITDA and 55  NTM P E discount. This substantially covers the margin weakness in our view, only because the growth runway is sufficiently long to allow for accretive returns.Both analysts and Seeking Alpha concur with this view, with a Strong Buy rating.The risks to our current thesis areOverall, we believe Willdan represents an attractive investment for those seeking exposure to the energy transition. The business is a leader in this segment, with deep expertise that is underpinned by technological capabilities. This is a relatively wide moat given its historical track record and focus on this segment  which is significantly more niche compared to mainstream, public industries . When considered in conjunction with M A, we see good runway to achieve Management s objective of  15  growth.Although there is economic uncertainty, the company continues to perform exceptionally well and outperform its peers. We do think its debt could restrict its scope for M A but the cash flow from its existing contracts will mean, at worst, M A is delayed.With an outperformance relative to its peers alongside a discounted valuation, we see upside at its current share price.

Cemig: A DCF Evaluation With Limited Upside Pre-Privatization,"In my most recent  about Cemig  Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais   , I maintained a neutral position towards the company despite recognizing its discounted valuation compared to its peers.At the time, I alsoSince then, the company's shares have depreciated by approximately 10 . This decline occurred in the context of a broader downturn in the Brazilian stock market  Ibovespa , which has been downward since late July.The thesis surrounding Cemig, however, remains the same, centered around the potential positive impact of the privatization of the company owned by the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. If privatization occurs, CemigOver the past few months, other state-owned utility counterparts such as Sabesp  Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo   and Copel  Companhia Paranaense de Energia   have made substantial progress towards privatization, with expected completion by next year. While the privatization of Cemig is slightly behind its peers due to greater legislative complexity in the state of Minas Gerais, it continues to be a central focus of the current government, reinforcing shareholders' hopes.Taking into account Cemig's consistent track record of strong financial results in recent quarters and its positive outlook for Q3, I currently find that the company's current valuation presents a relatively low level of risk in terms of its potential long-term return compared to its key domestic peers. However, based on my analysis using the Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  model, which considers the expected investments Cemig should undertake in the future, the company might be overvalued while awaiting privatization. As a result, I am inclined to maintain a neutral stance on Cemig.In its most recently reported quarter, 2Q23, Cemig  progress in net revenue, totaling R 8.8 billion. This marked a 7.4  increase compared to 2Q22, primarily driven by rising revenue from TUSD  Charges for Use of the Network , heightened gas supply, and increased energy sales volume.Consolidated EBITDA reached R 1.8 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 430 . The financial result amounted to R 39 million, reversing a loss of R 870 million in 2Q22. This variance can be attributed to the tax refund executed last year. Ultimately, the company reported a net profit of R 1.25 billion, representing an 11  decline from 1Q23.Operating costs and expenses decreased by 13.5  compared to 2Q22, totaling R 7.3 billion. This cost reduction can be primarily attributed to the inflationary impact in 2Q22 when ICMS  a type of value-added tax  was temporarily excluded from energy tariffs, a situation that has since been rectified. Additionally, there was a decrease in the  personnel  expense category due to the company's cost-saving measures implemented during the quarter.For Q3, the Brazilian market has been  an increase in energy consumption, which tends to benefit distributors like Cemig. Consequently, this scenario is expected to yield robust volume data in Cemig's third-quarter results, reflecting the impact of the seasonally driven heatwave.Cemig continues to maintain consistent cash generation, contributing to the execution of its investment program, which includes an expected CapEx of R 780 million for this year with Gasmig, its natural gas subsidiary. This, in turn, enhances the company's liquidity.The company also maintains a healthy leverage ratio, concluding the first half of 2023 with a net debt EBITDA ratio of 1.1x.The state governments of São Paulo, Paraná, and Minas Gerais have reintroduced privatization discussions to the financial market's agenda. They have plans to transfer control of state-owned Brazilian utilities such as Sabesp, Copasa, Copel, and Cemig. This shift is primarily driven by state governors adopting less statist policies.The stock market has already demonstrated investor approval of these initiatives  shares in the concerned companies are expected to increase by at least 10  by 2023.Copel is the furthest along in the privatization process in the current landscape. Shareholders have already approved modifying the company's bylaws to convert it into a corporation without a controlling shareholder.In the Southeastern states, the processes are expected to take longer. In São Paulo, Sabesp is  to advance its privatization by March of the following year. However, Copasa  sanitation  and Cemig  energy  depend on an amendment to the Minas Gerais state constitution, recently  by the administration of Romeu Zema, the current Governor of the State of Minas Gerais.One factor that instills optimism in the private credit market is the potential for increased investment. Operating outside of state management provides companies with greater flexibility, allowing them to issue shares and debentures to raise funds for investment.There is a significant need for investment, but there are limits to the indebtedness of Cemig and its state-owned counterparts. With the government relinquishing control, these companies can raise substantial funds through share issuance or debt.However, optimism is tempered because these companies may remain under state governments' ownership, which, according to experts, could impose restrictions on their debt. The increase in private sector participation helps alleviate some constraints on public companies, but with mixed ownership, they will still be subject to government regulatory oversight.With more prominent companies issuing debt, the market for tax-exempt debentures is expected to expand, potentially increasing liquidity for these securities, which is currently limited in the secondary market. Privatizations would be another positive factor for the capital market, in addition to the sanitation framework and the , the federal government's infrastructure investment program.According to the Governor of the State of Minas Gerais, Romeu Zema, who is a liberal, privatization is only a matter of time as the outlook remains optimistic with the approval of the bill, which has been sent to the State Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais  ALMG . This amendment aims to facilitate the privatization of Cemig and Copasa.The bill is currently under review by the Legislative Branch and aims to simplify the process of selling state-owned companies. It also revises the requirement for a simple quorum to approve a law authorizing changes in the corporate structure or spin-off of a mixed-capital or public company.Presently, three-fifths of deputies must vote in favor of such changes. Additionally, the bill exempts the state from holding a referendum on privatization.Historically, Cemig is a company that has consistently provided attractive dividends. It has maintained a historical yield of 10.7  over the past decade. This achievement can be attributed to Cemig's average payout ratio of 47.5  during the same period, which closely aligns with its primary industry peers.However, with the outlook pointing to lower profits due to a higher CapEx in 2023 and more modest growth in 2024, the  is that Cemig may experience an impacted yield over the next two years. It is worth noting that if privatization occurs, improved operational efficiency is likely to lead to higher profitability in the long term, potentially resulting in increased dividends for its shareholders.Nevertheless, Cemig surpasses its domestic peers, both private and state-owned, currently boasting the highest yield at 9.6 . This is particularly attractive considering the backdrop of lower interest rates in Brazil, significantly affecting the Brazilian fixed-income market.Cemig, a state-owned utilities company controlled by Minas Gerais, could currently be undervalued by the market. Despite experiencing growth in CapEx, Cemig has been consistently delivering solid results.While there are still uncertainties surrounding the privatization of Cemig, contingent on political factors, the company has been projecting robust profit growth. It  an EPS increase of 24  for 2023, primarily driven by the conclusion of the tariff review in May, expected gains in the generation and transmission business, positive performance from Gasmig, the continuation of an efficiency program, asset disposals, and improved capital allocation as catalysts.One potential disadvantage Cemig holds over its industry peers is that its distribution segment is exposed to the risk of concession renewal, unlike other integrated companies in the sector.Cemig is trading at an implied Internal Rate of Return  IRR  of 12.2 , surpassing the segment average of 11.6 , and trading at 5.1x EV EBITDA in 2024-2025. The company trades at a discount when comparing Cemig's valuation multiples, particularly to other Brazilian electricity companies, such as its state-owned peer Copel. Copel has forward EV EBITDA multiples of 6.98 times. However, when comparing Cemig to its private domestic peers, the company also trades at a discount relative to Eletrobras, which has a forward EV EBITDA of 5.9x, Engie Brasil  with a forward EV EBITDA of 6.73x, and Equatorial , which has a forward EV EBITDA of 7.7x.Given that this is a state-controlled company, a notable political risk exists associated with valuing Cemig. This risk is complex to quantify and may help justify the substantial discount the company is currently trading, as indicated by my DCF analysis.When constructing my model, I relied on revenue growth  provided by Seeking Alpha for Cemig, which project a growth rate of 4.2  in 2023E, 2.9  in 2024E, and 8.6  in 2025E. Additionally, I established a stable gross margin of 14.5 , based on the company's five-year historical average, and an effective tax rate of 23 , also considering the company's five-year historical average.In my model, I incorporated a cost of equity of 11 , derived from Brazil's long-term interest rate curve  TJLP , currently at 6.55  per year. Additionally, I included a cost of debt of 10 , as provided by the company's data. I utilized a leveraged beta of 0.65 for the utilities sector and considered Brazil's equity risk premium of 9.6 . As a result, this calculation led me to a WACC of 11.8 .Over the next three years, considering that the company is expected to report a CapEx of approximately  156 million in 2023, in line with the company's , and assuming more conservative investments for 2024 and 2025 by maintaining the exact figures as 2023, along with changes in working capital corresponding to the five-year historical average, I have calculated an unleveraged free cash flow growth rate as follows   6.1  in 2023E,  15.1  in 2024E, 5.2  in 2025E, and 2  in perpetuity.As a result, considering a terminal value of  3.586,3 billion and discounting it to present value using the WACC of 11.8 , we arrive at a present value of the terminal value of  2.359 billion and a Total Equity Value  TEV  of  4.413,2 billion. When divided by Cemig's 2.2 billion outstanding shares, this yields an implied value of  2.01 per share. This would mean a downside of 13.2  compared to the share price of  2.31 on October 6th.While the primary thesis for Cemig revolves around a specific catalyst, namely the company's privatization, Cemig continues to show strong performance in its financial results and remains poised to deliver solid dividends. It's worth noting that regarding the privatization process, Cemig lags behind some of its domestic peers in the utilities sector, such as Sabesp and Copel.When assessing the valuation of Cemig, the company is undervalued compared to other state-owned peers and even more so when compared to its private peers. However, in my Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  model, assuming the company maintains its recent five-year performance and allocates more capital towards CapEx spending in the coming years, the estimated intrinsic value is approximately  2.01 per share, indicating potential overvaluation. This suggests a downside of 13.2  from the current share price.If privatization proceeds over the next two years, it will likely increase operational efficiency, cost reductions, and potentially even more significant value appreciation. Additionally, the dividend yield could experience growth projections shortly.Considering these factors, I will maintain my neutral recommendation for Cemig's shares.

Enphase: Undervalued Solar Juggernaut With Superior ROIC,"Enphase  is one of the most popular growth stocks today and is also one of the best-performing stocks in the last five years, returning more than 2,500  to shareholders.But recently, Enphase releasedThat said, here's a deep dive on Enphase stock. EnjoyA little bit of background about solar energy production, solar panels generate electricity in the form of Direct Current, or DC, which is sent to an inverter, which consequently, converts the DC into Alternating Current, or AC.That AC power is then used to power your home appliances, chargeAnd today, there are three ways in which solar panels convert sun energy to DC, and ultimately, to AC.First, we have , which is probably the oldest and most common way. With string inverters, all of the solar panels are connected to a single inverter, and because only one inverter is required, this method is usually the cheapest out of the three.However, the downside is that string inverters have a single point of failure, meaning the entire system is only as efficient as the lowest-performing solar panel.For example, as shown in this diagram, if one of the panels is partially covered by a shade and can only produce 50  of DC output, then the entire system   including the other panels   will also produce only 50  of output.Put simply, string inverters are cheap but inefficient, and this is why it's more commonly used in utility projects where shade is not an issue, such as in a desert or a large field.Two relatively-new methods solve the issues that come with string inverters.First, we have , and a popular company that offers this solution is SolarEdge .Basically, these devices are installed on each solar panel, which essentially isolates each solar panel.If one of the modules could only produce 50  output, the rest of the modules will not be affected, and therefore, the system could run more efficiently.However, with power optimizers, a string inverter is still required, which again, if the inverter fails, the entire system fails as well.That s where  come in, which is pioneered by Enphase.Just like power optimizers, microinverters are installed in each PV module, but unlike power optimizers, microinverters do not need a separate inverter but instead convert DC power to AC power immediately at each solar panel.In other words, microinverters are exactly what they sound like, mini inverters.Although microinverters are the most expensive option, they are the most efficient form of inverters today, namely due to their ability to produce maximum power per module, with no single point of failure.And because of that superior efficiency, reliability, and safety, consumers and businesses are not hesitant to pay extra bucks for microinverter systems, and that is why Enphase s business is growing so rapidly.In a nutshell, Enphase is the leading supplier of semiconductor-based microinverter systems, and the Enphase Energy System enables users to capture solar energy, store those energy, and manage them in one software-enabled platform.At the same time, the Enphase System enables users to lower utility bills, reduce their carbon footprint, as well as power an entire building off the grid or if the grid goes down.Diving deeper, the Enphase System consists of three major componentsIt is important to note that Enphase does not sell solar panels, but instead the inverter which is one of, if not, the most important component of a solar panel .Of course, there are other products such as Enphase s IQ Batteries, which stores solar power to use anytime, even during outages, as well as Enphase's Bidirectional EV Charger which can charge a car with the sun and power homes during an outage.So to sum it all up, Enphase offers solar, storage, and energy management solutions, powered by its industry-first microinverters.Based on my research and analysis, I identified 3 competitive moats for Enphase  technology, switching costs, and cost advantages.Enphase was founded in 2006 by Raghu Belur and Martin Fornage and the two basically invented the first microinverter-based solar energy system, giving Enphase a first-mover advantage.Compared to competitors, Its innovative technology offers higher quality, efficiency, safety, flexibility, reliability, and most of all, value.It is important to note that Enphase s microinverters are also module-agnostic, meaning they can work with virtually every solar panel made.Through its unique value promotion, it is no surprise that Enphase is loved by consumers and installers alike, earning the company a net promoter score of 75.An Energy Sage report released in March 2023 also mentioned that Enphase was the , which is a testament to the company s incredible technology and brand power.Unlike string inverters and power optimizers, microinverters are more expensive and difficult to install given that they are small devices that need to be installed on every individual solar module.Once consumers and businesses have invested their money on Enphase microinverters, it will be very difficult for them to switch given that they have to uninstall every microinverter as well as replace it with an alternative device, which is often a downgrade to Enphase s best-in-class technology.In addition, adding Enphase batteries and EV chargers into the system further solidifies the switching cost moat.Not only that, but Enphase also offers the Installer Platform, which is an end-to-end digital platform that provides the tools, guidelines, and documentation for installers to seamlessly execute their Enphase installation plans.This includes its recent business acquisitions such asWith that being said, Enphase s vertically integrated platform streamlines the entire installation and maintenance processes, which makes it very convenient for installers to remain on the platform.Finally, I believe Enphase has cost advantages moat.First, the company has a capital-light business model. Enphase does not have any big factories but instead, works with various suppliers and third-party contract manufacturers to commercialize its products.This way, Enphase can save on production costs and use that savings to scale further or invest in R D.Secondly, Enphase has superior margins compared to competitors. As you can see, Enphase has a high gross margin of about 45 .And last but not least, the Enphase ecosystem is large and growing. As of Q2, Enphase has over 1,500 installers in its installer network. It has also deployed 68 million microinverters, 1 GWh of energy storage systems, and 3.5 million systems across 145 countries worldwide.As the company scales further, the company should gain economies of scale, which further strengthens its cost advantages moat.Let's now look at Enphase's financials.Here s a chart of Enphase s Revenue and its YoY Growth rate, and as you can see, Revenue pulled back during the early days of the pandemic as supply chain issues and government lockdowns put pressure on demand.However, the business quickly recovered in the following quarters, with Revenue growth peaking at 152  in Q2 of 2021.Since then, growth has slowed down significantly.In Q2 this year, Revenue was  711 million, which is up 34  YoY, due to higher consumer demand, increased microinverter shipments, as well as higher average selling price.However, the 34  reported growth fell short of  by 2 , or  15 million, due to high interest rates that affected consumer affordability.Additionally, this is a 2  decline QoQ as well as a steep deceleration from Q1 s 65  growth, which seems to be threatening the growth story of the company.As mentioned earlier, growth was driven by increased microinverter shipments. As you can see, microinverter shipments in terms of units and megawatts have been very strong over the last few quarters, with 5.2 million units and nearly 2,121 megawatts shipped in Q2 alone, which is up 55  and 75  yoy, respectively.On the other hand, battery shipments grew exponentially last year and then decelerated to negative growth in the first half of 2023. In Q2, battery shipments were just 82 megawatt hours, which is down 38  YoYAs you can see, battery shipments have been falling for three straight quarters, sequentially, which is rather concerning. And this is likely due to high interest rates, which negatively affected affordability. Since batteries are often the most expensive, but not essential, components of a solar energy system, it is not surprising to see a drop in battery demand.If you re unaware, California has introduced a new net metering policy called Net Energy Metering 3.0, which went into effect starting April 15.The main difference between NEM 2.0 and NEM 3.0 is that version 3.0 significantly reduces the average export rate in California, which is the price of excess electricity delivered to the grid. In other words, consumers under NEM 3.0 will receive less compensation for net metering credits, which increases the payback period for their solar installations.As such, consumers rushed to get their solar systems before the new NEM 3.0 goes into effect, which is why microinverter shipments remain strong while battery shipments falter since batteries are the more expensive component. Coupled with high interest rates, we can see why battery shipments are taking a hit.But during the , the CEO mentioned that battery shipments should improve in Q3 and there should be a  bigger inflection for Q4 and beyond  as battery attach rates increase with NEM 3.0.That said, I think this is just a temporary headwind for the battery segment as consumers will eventually adjust to the high-interest rate environment and NEM 2.0 rush, and over time, demand should pick up again as consumers all over the world transition to off-the-grid power systems.Moving on, you can see Revenue broken down by geography.As you can see, US Revenue is decelerating meaningfully, declining by 12  QoQ and 1  YoY in Q2, mainly due to tough macroeconomic conditions and lower utility rates in some states.During the earnings call, management mentioned that in Q2, Enphase did not enjoy the seasonally strong recovery quarter that they expected, and that sell-through of their microinverters in the US decreased 20  compared to Q4.Clearly, high interest rates are putting pressure on demand for solar powered-equipment in the US.That aside, the International business drove all the growth in Q2, which is up by 173  YoY, driven mainly by Europe, which grew 25  sequentially, and more than tripled YoY.Management also mentioned that the sell-through of microinverters in Europe was 13  higher in Q2 compared to Q1.That said, it s really great to see the rapid growth in the International segment, which is maintaining the growth of the entire business while the US deal with near-term challenges.It s also nice to see that the company is capitalizing on opportunities outside of the US and to see that kind of growth in the international business means there are tons of optionality and Revenue potential for Enphase.The US has historically been Enphase s main market, and as of Q2, the US makes up 59  of total revenue.However, US Revenue as a   of total Revenue is declining due to a combination of slowing US Revenue growth and aggressive international expansion   it won t be long before the International segment overtakes the US business.There s no doubt that the world is transitioning to renewable sources of energy   including solar energy   and this transition will benefit solar companies like Enphase, which is why we're seeing such strong growth for the company over the last few years.Issues such as power outages, rising utility costs, and global warming are all pushing solar adoption faster than ever before, and this is going to be a long-term trend for decades to come.And given Enphase's strong competitive position in the microinverter market today, there's little to no doubt that Enphase will be a dominant force in the solar space in the long run.However, growth is showing signs of weakness due to macroeconomic conditions and high interest rates, and this is particularly serious in the US market where US Revenue declined YoY.However, these are temporary problems and consumers will eventually adjust to the higher interest rate environment. Besides, the Fed will eventually cut rates, which will drive demand once again.And while we wait for the US market to stabilize, the International segment is still growing rapidly, which is a reflection of its industry-leading technology and competitive positioning.Turning to profitability, Gross Profit has been growing steadily as you can see right here.In 2022, Gross Profit was  975 million, which represents a 42  GAAP Gross Margin and a 43  Non-GAAP Gross Margin.Moving on, Q2 Gross Profit was  323 million, which is a 45  GAAP Gross Margin and a 46  Non-GAAP Gross Margin.Notice how Gross Margins have been improving over the last few quarters. This is due to 1  higher average selling prices, 2  favorable product mix as the company sells more of its newer, more advanced IQ8 microinverters, and 3  improved logistics. In Q2, IQ8 makes up 78  of all microinverters shipped, which increased average selling prices by 3 .The expanding Gross Margin is a great indicator of strong pricing power, economies of scale, and higher earnings potential.At the same time, Enphase has the highest Gross Margin profile in the solar industry, which gives the company extra freedom to allocate that excess capital.Moving down the income statement, Operating Profit in 2022 was  448 million which represents a 19  GAAP Operating Margin and a 30  Non-GAAP Operating Margin.In Q2, Operating Profit was  170 million, which is a 24  GAAP Operating Margin or a 32  Non-GAAP Operating Margin.As you can see, both metrics have been improving over the last few quarters which reflects management s disciplined cost control as well as operating leverage within the entire business.Enphase also has one of the best Operating Margins in the solar industry, although the company has recently been overtaken by First Solar , which is currently seeing unprecedented demand for its solar PV modules.And finally, the bottom line looks great as well.In 2022, Net Income was  397 million, which is a 17  GAAP Net Margin or a 28  Non-GAAP Net Margin, while Q2 Net Income was  157 million, which is a 22  GAAP Net Margin or a 29  Non-GAAP Net Margin.But here's the chart that separates Enphase from the rest. As you can see, Enphase has a much higher ROIC than any of its peers. Higher ROIC means higher cash returned to shareholders and an ROIC of above 20  is usually considered excellent. In other words, Enphase has superior profitability.So fundamentally speaking, Enphase is a highly profitable business despite growing rapidly in the emerging solar industry. It's also great to see that margins are improving, which shows economies of scale and operating leverage within the business.It's quite rare to find companies that are growing at such a fast pace without actually sacrificing profitability, but we won't know for sure how margins will look in the long term as competition in the microinverter category increases and solar components become commoditized.That said, I'm impressed with the margin profile of Enphase and to see that margins are improving also means that the company has strong pricing power as well as a strengthening of its cost advantages moat.Enphase has a strong balance sheet. As of Q2, Enphase had  1.8 billion of Cash and Short-term Investments and a Total Debt of about  1.3 billion, which puts its Net Cash position at half a billion dollars.At the same time, the company has a Current Ratio of about 3.4x which is healthy and liquid.As you can see, its Net cash position is starting to pick up over the last few quarters, and the reason why Net Cash hasn t grown much in 2021 and 2022 is due to the fact that the company made 7 business acquisitions in those two years alone, so if there aren t any more acquisitions in the pipeline, we may see net cash position increasing from here.On a side note, Enphase is also dealing with inventory challenges. As mentioned earlier, their microinverter sell-through rates in the US decreased by 20  compared to Q4, thus building excess inventory in the channel.As you can see, Days in Inventory, have been picking up over the last few quarters as demand slowed down, with that figure approaching levels seen during the early days of the pandemic. As a result, management plans to decrease shipments in Q3 to reduce inventory in the channel.Nevertheless, Enphase is well-positioned to deal with near-term challenges, particularly because of its strong Free Cash Flow profile.As shown below, Enphase has been consistently generating FCF Margins of over 30 .In 2022, Free Cash Flow was  698 million, which represents a 30  Free Cash Flow Margin, and in Q2, the company generated  225 million of FCF, which represents an impressive FCF Margin of 32 .And of course, because of this solid cash generation, Enphase is able to acquire other businesses, which it has done so aggressively over the past two years as the company enhances its consumer and installer platform.As a result of high FCF generation and plummeting share prices, management also took the opportunity to scoop up its own shares, buying back  200 million worth of its stock in Q2.Consequently, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program which extended the company s buyback capacity to  1 billion.Prior to Q2, the last time Enphase bought back shares was in Q4 of 2021, specifically in the month of December when the stock was trading between  180 to  250 a share.Given that 1  shares have fallen by 50  from all-time highs, 2  management bought  200 million of stock at an average price of  159 in Q2, and 3  share prices remain below the levels in December 2021, I expect Enphase to continue to buy back shares aggressively in the next few quarters, especially if the stock goes below  150 a share.That said, Enphase is a highly capital-efficient business with a strong balance sheet which should allow the company to scale quickly through a consistent cycle of reinvesting capital for growth, thus generating shareholder value.While the fundamentals of the business look solid, the near-term outlook of the business looks discouraging.Here, I've compiled management's guidance in an easy-to-read table. I've included both GAAP and Non-GAAP measures, but I ll just be analyzing the GAAP numbers as I don t really look at Non-GAAP measures, but it's there just for reference.Management expects Q3 Revenue to be in the range of  550 million to  600 million, which is a 9  YoY decline if we take the midpoint guidance. This is well below  and this is a steep deceleration from Q2's 34  YoY growth.Weak guidance is due to the lower sell-through rates as I explained earlier, which were down 20  in both Q1 and Q2, compared to Q4, due to high interest rates.Management was expecting a seasonally up Q2, 23 but that didn t materialize, which caused excess inventory in the channel, which consequently forced the company to reduce shipments in Q3 to prevent excess inventory in their balance sheet, and therefore, Revenue is expected to be down in Q3.In my opinion, this is the right move by management as it prevents the company from over-manufacturing and overbuilding its inventory, which could lead to inventory writedowns in the future if demand in the near term continues to be soft.But it s important to note that the weak guidance is almost exclusively due to the issues faced in the US market.During the earnings call, management mentioned that 85  of the QoQ Revenue decline is due to a one-time rebalancing of its US operations while the remaining 15  is due to Europe being seasonally down in Q3. That said, it's great to hear that the outlook in Europe remains robust.Moving on, the Revenue guidance, management also expects shipments of 80 to 100 megawatt hours of Enphase IQ Batteries, which if you take the midpoint guidance, is actually a 33  YoY decline. So again, we re going to see the batteries business continue to struggle in this high-interest rate environment.GAAP Gross Margin is expected to be between 41 to 44  before Net IRA Benefit, which is expected to be about  15.5 million in Q3 based on shipments of 600,000 units of US-manufactured microinverters.Moving forward, Enphase plans to reap more benefits from the IRA's Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, which incentivizes clean energy component sourcing and production in the US, and for Enphase, the IRA provides a tax credit on microinverters of 11 cents per alternating current watt basis.At scale, the net benefit can be significantThat said, the midpoint guidance of about 42.5  is slightly higher than last year s figure of about 42 , so the increase in Gross Margin is a good indicator that the company is gaining economies of scale.GAAP Operating Expense is expected to be  159 million to  163 million, which is roughly a 9  YoY increase. This figure is higher than Revenue growth, which means Q3 Operating Margins will drop YoY.So overall, Revenue guidance is pretty underwhelming probably due to high interest rates, weak sell-through, as well as tough yoy comps, which is why the stock sold off after earnings.In addition, the CEO mentioned that demand will unleash only when interest rates return to normal, but recently, the , so that could mean additional short-term headwinds for Enphase.But that aside, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and the issues it is facing currently are externally driven, rather than a company-specific problem.With that being said, the long-term outlook of the business remains positive as the world continues its transition toward renewable energy.Here's what the CEO has to say about the company's outlookFor one, according to the International Energy Agency, Solar PV installed power capacity is expected to  while other sources of energy such as coal and natural gas are expected to flatten and decline over time.In addition, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, energy storage installations are expected to , reaching annual additions of 88 gigawatts by 2030.Furthermore, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, storage is increasingly being paired with all forms of solar modules. As you can see, solar plus storage systems only accounted for 10  of all distributed solar systems in 2022, and that figure is expected to .In other words, more consumers will likely opt for solar plus storage solutions in the future.And Enphase is already capitalizing on this opportunity by expanding its ecosystem of products and cross-selling them. As you can see, Enphase is increasing its  share of wallet  per home.Back in 2019, its potential per home was only  2000, which consists of only microinverters. But as the years go by, Enphase introduced more products to enhance the Enphase Energy System.For instance, with IQ Batteries, the potential per home increased to  9000, and today, with other products such as IQ Load Controller and EV chargers, Enphase s potential per home is now close to  12,000.Put simply, the trends are clear. Solar PV and energy storage adoption will only continue to grow from here and this will be a massive tailwind for Enphase in the long run, and Enphase s ability to innovate new products, expand the ecosystem, and increase monetization for each home is proof that the company has a massive market opportunity ahead.Not forgetting to mention, there are numerous government policies that support solar system adoptions, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which was enacted in August 2022.Through the IRA, the federal solar investment tax credit of 30  has been extended until 2032, allowing homeowners to save 30  of the cost of installing a residential solar system in the US. At the same time, the IRA also includes the new advanced manufacturing production tax creditThat said, the investment tax credit for consumers and production tax credit for suppliers will push demand for solar-plus-storage systems to new heights as you can see right here by the dark blue bars.As such, favorable policies like this will boost Enphase s outlook.On the other side, there s the California Net Energy Metering 3.0 which reduces the average export rate by nearly 80 , so that means less incentive for homeowners, which is likely to decrease demand for solar PV systems in California.And given that California is Enphase s largest market, it is no surprise that investors are concerned with this new policy.As you can see, NEM 3.0 is expected to decrease installations in California by nearly 40  in 2024 and beyond. But on the bright side, installations in other states are expected to continue to grow over the next few years, which is still going to support Enphase s growth.Following Q2 results, Enphase stock crashed 7  the following day, and the stock is now down more than 47  year to date, while the S P 500 is up 18 . This kind of divergence got me interested in the stock.If we look at valuation multiples, we can see that Enphase is trading at an EV Revenue multiple of just 7.1x, which is back to prepandemic levels and it is also a significant discount to when the stock traded at more than 30x its sales.Of course, it's not as low as it was back in 2019, but the company is much bigger and much more profitable than ever before so the higher valuation multiple is justified.At the same time, its PE and Price to FCF ratios are trading near their all-time lows, at just 35x and 24x, respectively. As you can see, valuation multiples are trading at a massive discount, which looks attractive from an investment standpoint.If we compare Enphase to its peers, it gets even more interesting.As you can see, I ve included the PE ratios of its competitors SolarEdge and First Solar, which have PE ratios of 58x and 133x, respectively, compared to just 35x for Enphase.But the interesting part is that Enphase has a much higher ROIC than its peers.Furthermore, Enphase has higher growth rates than its peers as you can see here.So clearly, there s a huge disconnect in fundamentals and valuations among these three companies, and just a quick peer comparison tells me that Enphase is significantly undervalued given its superior growth and ROIC.I also did a DCF analysis on Enphase. Here are my key assumptionsSo based on all these assumptions, I expect Enphase to reach a Revenue run rate of about  12.8 billion by 2032, with an FCF margin of about 28 .Keep in mind that Enphase has an FCF margin of over 30  currently, but I expect competition to put pressure on margins over time, thus, the lower projected FCF Margin profile.So based on my projections, and based on a discount rate of 10  and a perpetual growth rate of 2.5 , I arrive at an intrinsic value per share of about  226, which is higher than the  of  200 a share.That said, my price target represents an upside of about 60  based on the current price of  141 a share.Personally, for mid-cap growth stocks, I would like a wide margin of safety of at least 40 , which brings my wide margin of safety price to about  136.On the other side, management seems to be quite bullish after the recent drop as they  worth of Enphase stock in Q2 alone, which is probably the first time insiders are net buyers of the stock.That said, I do think there are some catalysts for Enphase stock, namely expanding margins, the reacceleration of its battery business, better-than-expected growth, strong international growth, as well as interest rate cuts.It's also worth mentioning again that the company initiated a new stock repurchase program of  1 billion   management may find the stock undervalued which is why they accelerated the buyback program.Even though shares look undervalued today, I won't be buying the stock as it has not fallen below my margin of safety price. However, it's getting close, so I'll be watching the stock closely.According to the company s annual report, one customer accounted for 37  of total revenue in 2022, which was up from 34  and 29  in 2021 and 2020, respectively.The rising concentration could be a problem if we see this customer facing its own company-specific challenges.As you may know, the solar industry is very competitive with players like Solar Edge, Huawei, Tesla, and so on.For comparison, I ve included Tesla s solar and storage operating metrics. As you can see, Tesla s solar business is way smaller than Enphase s solar microinverter business.However, Tesla s energy storage business is much larger than Enphase s battery business, and I think this is due to the fact that Tesla serves more of the large-scale projects while Enphase leans more on the residential side.That said, growth for the Enphase battery business on the commercial side may be limited given Tesla s dominant position. But the point is, Competition is fierce, and that may slow down Enphase s growth.At the same time, as the solar and energy storage industry matures, components such as microinverters may become commoditized, which means price competition for Enphase as cheaper alternatives flood the market.That means Enphase would need to cut prices, which of course, is going to hurt the company's Gross Margins, and ultimately overall profitability.But for now, it seems that Enphase has strong pricing power and customers are willing to pay for the premium, which can be seen from its improving Gross MarginsNevertheless, we need to carefully track Gross Margins, because if gross margins are going down, it's a strong indication that demand has shifted to competitors.We saw how rising interest rates put a strain on consumer demand for IQ Batteries, which are already very expensive.We saw how NEM 3.0 is likely going to reduce future solar installations in California.And what happens if the government suddenly withdraws the 30  solar investment tax credit  I think that would be a huge blow to the solar industry.I think Enphase could be a really attractive investment if investors want exposure to cleantech, given its technology, high switching cost, and cost advantages moats.The company is growing rapidly, has superior margins, and has a long growth runway ahead as consumers and businesses all over the world transition to renewable energy.The fundamentals of the business remain strong and although it is facing some near-term challenges such as high interest rates and NEM 3.0, it is clear that solar adoption will continue to increase day by day, which is going to be a long-term tailwind for Enphase.And by the way, this is a US-specific issue. Last time I check, the International business is still growing by triple digits.In addition, the 50  selloff provides a wide margin of safety for investors to accumulate shares today.

On the callNow I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.Thank you, Yijing. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the continued strong momentum in the third quarter and year-to-date. Demand for our thermal comfort, massage, and lumbar solutions continues to accelerate. The  520 million in new business awards achieved in Q3 set a third quarter record, bringing us to  1.7 billion in new business awards year-to-date. I am thrilled to announce that as of today we have now exceeded all prior year records for new business wins, which now stands at  2 billion with more than two months left in the fiscal year. Also, during the third quarter, we achieved record revenue in the key product lines of Climate Control Seat and Steering Wheel Heaters, as well as improved profitability.During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our operational execution and further improve productivity. We delivered the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in the past 10 quarters, up 15  compared to the third quarter of 2022 and an increase of 12.5  from the second quarter of 2023. We also continue to make progress on our Fit for Growth 2.0 initiatives and on the preparations for our footprint expansion in Morocco and Monterrey, Mexico. These actions will help us to continue to expand margin and return to a high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate in the midterm.Now turning to the automotive highlights on Slide 4. In the third quarter, we launched our automotive solutions on 16 different vehicles across eight OEMs, including BMW, BYD, Ford, General Motors, Great Wall, and Volkswagen. We continue to see expanded application of our CCS solutions. In the third quarter, our CCS solutions were launched on the BMW 5 Series, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Great Wall Mecha Dragon, Hongqi eH5, and Xpeng G9. Now let me give you a quick update on ClimateSense. First of all, I'm pleased to announce that Gentherm's ClimateSense won the 2023 Automotive D.R.I.V.E Honours for reducing emissions. D.R.I.V.E is the Reuters event's annual recognition for automotive excellence. ClimateSense is the industry's first scalable, intelligent, automotive microclimate comfort solution that offers an interior cabin experience that uniquely delivers energy efficient, personalized comfort for each occupant that extends electric vehicle range.Our proprietary ClimateSense leverages thermal physiology principles to determine which areas of the body to target at specific intensity and duration to provide optimal comfort with minimized energy consumption. I would like to congratulate the Gentherm team for winning this coveted recognition. In addition to ClimateSense, our advanced engineering team continues to integrate our thermal products with lumbar and massage products to create innovative full system solutions. The combination of heating and cooling the body with massage, including our industry's first proprietary pulsating massage, Pulse A, is opening vast opportunities for solutions that promote health and wellness experiences, alertness enhancements, and physical recovery in the car.Now on to Slide 5, where, as I mentioned, we secured  520 million of awards in automotive in the third quarter. We won several CCS awards in the quarter. Of note, we won the Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500, Mazda CX-5, and Volkswagen Tyrone. And in China, we won Audi A4, a future electric Buick SUV, Ford Explorer, and Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell EV. We continue to gain momentum with some of the fastest growing Chinese EV makers. Of note, in the third quarter, we won three full CCS awards with Li Auto on their L8, L9, and the future electric SUV. Additionally, I am pleased to share that we just won our first combined CCS and pneumatic massage award from Li Auto in October. I'd like to congratulate our global team for this breakthrough win, our first high-end massage system with a domestic Chinese OEM.And in addition, we received pneumatic lumbar and massage awards with Stellantis and Mercedes in the third quarter. We continue to win pneumatic lumbar and massage awards at a much faster pace than expected. Allow me to remind you that in just 14 months since the Alfmeier acquisition, we have won conquest pneumatic lumbar and massage awards with BMW, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Stellantis, Volkswagen, and one of the largest global EV manufacturers. These wins confirm our Alfmeier acquisition thesis of leveraging Gentherm's strong customer relationships to introduce Alfmeier's industry-leading technologies. Also of note, in the third quarter, we received 10 Steering Wheel Heater awards across eight OEMs. These included Audi, BAIC, BMW, MINI, Fiat, GMC, Honda, Hongqi, and Volvo. And importantly, six of these awards are hands-on detection enabled.Turning to ClimateSense, our demonstrations of range extension and superior thermal comfort enabled by ClimateSense have driven higher thermal content, higher take rates, and adoption of our solutions on electric vehicles, which contributed to our record awards in 2023. Of special note, we have won a follow-on Heated Interior solutions award, including our electronic control units from Honda for additional EV platforms. Our ongoing ClimateSense development project with Honda has demonstrated significant savings in HVAC energy consumption by combining seat heat, steering wheel heat, and interior heat. We are excited about our ongoing partnership with Honda in Japan.Moving on to electronics and software, I'm pleased to share that we won our first Multi-Function Electronic Control Unit Award from General Motors as part of their software-defined vehicle platform. This is truly a breakthrough win for Gentherm. Our electronics hardware will be on every General Motors software-defined vehicle requiring control of thermal devices along with other features, resulting in a higher take rate of electronics and higher content per vehicle for Gentherm. This award opens the door for us to be a major player in the software-defined vehicles of the future.Our multi-function electronic control units, which operate the thermal functions as well as control motors and other actuators, are increasingly in demand as OEMs look to combine ECUs and remove sensors to decrease weight and complexity. And this is just the beginning. As the industry's SDV ecosystem continues to grow, we expect to add incremental electronics and software features that will enable greater energy efficiency, more personalization, and novel comfort and wellness experiences. Software and electronics are fundamental to our strategy. We have significantly increased our resources and competency from embedded devices to algorithm-driven connected solutions.Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our medical business. Medical revenue in the third quarter increased 10  year-over-year, primarily driven by revenue growth of our Dacheng air warming blankets. In the third quarter, we added 20 new hospital customers in China. In the U.S., we were awarded contract extensions with two of the largest group purchasing organizations, Premier and Vizient, for our flagship Blanketrol product. These contract extensions will give us continued access to more than 70  of the domestic acute care hospitals associated with these GPOs. Given the change in purchasing behaviors in the medical device market, post-COVID, we have adapted our go-to-market model in the medical business to leverage large partnerships, distribution channels, and white label opportunities. As we announced on the last earnings call, we're partnering with SourceMark Medical, a certified minority supplier, to provide world-class patient warming solutions to the U.S. healthcare market. Consequently, we have reduced the size of our in-house sales team to improve our cost structure in medical. We remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunity in medical and are laser-focused on improving returns in this business in the near term.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matteo for a little more color on the financial results.Thank you, Phil. Let me turn to Slide 7 and focus on the most significant items in our third quarter results. For the quarter, product revenues increased by 10  compared to the same period of last year, including the contribution from the acquisitions. If we adjust for the impact of acquisitions and FX, our overall product revenue increased by 3 . Starting with the automotive segment, automotive revenues were  355 million, reflecting a 10  increase compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for the contribution from Alfmeier in both periods and foreign currency translation, automotive revenue increased by 3.1 , which is 150 basis points lower than the 4.6  increase in the actual light vehicle production in our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea.Excluding the non-automotive electronics business, which we are in the process of phasing out, and last year's one-time benefit from spot buy recoveries, we were in line with the production volume for the third quarter and year-to-date we outperformed the market by 370 basis points. It is worth noting that our core thermal product lines, which include CCS, seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters outperformed the production in our relevant market by over 500 basis points in the third quarter and 650 basis points year-to-date. We saw growth in the majority of our product lines with quarterly records in both steering wheel heaters and CCS. More specifically, steering wheel-heater revenue increased by 27  compared to the prior year period due to higher demand of our hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel-heaters on multiple VW models.CCS revenues increased by 12  due to higher production volume of GM trucks and SUVs, as well as higher take rate with Hyundai-Kia and the start of production at one of our the largest global EV manufacturers. This was partially offset by reduced volume of several model year changeovers and slower ramp-up than expected of some customer electric vehicles. Cable revenues increased 7  due to higher sales with Bosch. Seat heater revenues increased by 2  due to higher production volume at Ford, Honda, as well as ramp-up on an electric vehicle for a global EV manufacturer.Lumber and massage and valve systems revenue was relatively flat year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to lower production volume of certain vehicle models at one of the largest global electric vehicle manufacturers. CCS revenue declined 15  due to lower volumes with Jeep and Mercedes driven by earlier than expected decrease of the mild hybrid vehicle production. This was the primary driver of our at-market versus above-market performance during the quarter. Electronics revenue decreased 16  due to lower production volume with Ford and the phase-out of non-automotive electronics. Other automotive revenue decreased 60  primarily due to last year's one-time benefit from spot buy recoveries. Turning to medical, medical revenues increased 10  primarily as a result of growth of our Dacheng air warming blankets as well as strong sales of our liquid cooling disposable blankets in the United States.Moving to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA rate in   adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was  47.7 million, up from  41.6 million in the prior year period and  42.2 million in the prior year performance. The adjusted EBITDA rate for the third quarter was 13 , the highest profitability rate in seven quarters. This compares to 12  in the year-ago period on a comparable pro forma basis. That 100 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by lower freight costs, productivity at the factories, and fixed cost leverage on higher sales volume. These were partially offset by material and wage inflation and lower price recoveries relative to the prior year period, which had included catch-up recoveries of previous quarter. It is worth noting that sequentially adjusted EBITDA margin rate rose 160 basis points despite lower sales volume driven by improved profitability from Alfmeier, higher factory productivity and supplier cost reduction.Operating expenses were  62.5 million in the quarter compared to  57.5 million in the prior year period. If we adjust for acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, as well as non-cash stock compensation expenses in both periods, operating expenses were  56.4 million, up from  51.6 million in the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase of approximately  5 million was primarily driven by additional expenses from the acquired businesses, as well as higher compensation and R D expenses partially offset by higher reimbursement of R D costs. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 30 . And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter were  0.64 per share compared to  0.70 per share in the third quarter of last year.If we move to the balance sheet on Slide 8, our cash position at the end of the quarter was approximately  154 million, and our net debt stood at  54 million. Net debt increased by  5 million in the quarter, due to capital expenditures and share repurchases, partially offset by  21 million of cash generated from operating activity.Our net leverage ratio was 0.3 at the end of the third quarter in line with the prior quarter, and well below our target of 1.5 times. Based on the trading 12-month consolidated adjusted EBITDA end of September 30, we had approximately  293 million of remaining availability on our line of credit, and the total available liquidity as of September 30 was  447 million.Now let me turn to Slide 9 for our 2023 guidance. For comparison purposes, we included the actual results as reported for 2022, as well as the pro forma 2022 values if we had incorporated the results of Alfmeier since the beginning of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date and the best information that we currently have from our customers and suppliers, we are updating the full year 2023 guidance that was provided at the beginning of the year.The UAW situation remains volatile. However, for the purpose of the guidance, we assume that the OEM plans impacted by the UAW strike as of October 25 will remain idled through the end of November. For 2023, we now expect the revenue to be in the range of  1.45 billion to  1.47 billion, assuming FX remains at the current level. The midpoint of our guidance implies a growth rate of 9  on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.We now expect adjusted EBITDA margin rate to be in the range of 11.5 to 12.5  for 2023. We still expect our adjusted full year effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the previously recorded goodwill impairment, to be in the range of 28  to 32 . And we now expect capital expenditures to decrease to the range of  40 million to  50 million.With that, I will turn the call back to Phil.Thanks, Matteo. Now let me summarize. As the new business wins, record revenues in key product lines and improve profitability in Q3 demonstrate, the Gentherm team is executing strongly. As we've discussed, we're driving content per vehicle and simultaneously increasing our penetration into key EV product lines and into OEMs globally. We are effectively leveraging the Alfmeier acquisition, winning global conquest, pneumatic, lumbar, and massage awards with a growing number of OEMs globally. And we are laser-focused on building an even stronger foundation for the future, as we expand our global manufacturing capabilities with investments in Morocco and Mexico.While the automotive production environment remains challenging, including the UAW strike, our relentless focus on strong operational execution, innovation, and cash flow generation, along with our record performance on new business awards, positions us well to continue to drive shareholder value over the long term.With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q A Session.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda with Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead.Hey guys, it's Mike Zabran, on for Matt.Good morning.Good morning.Good morning. I guess starting on the topline may be just speak to why organic and ex-FX automotive revenue growth lacked industry production in the third quarter. I know we called out some spot buy recoveries in the prior year period, but are we also seeing lack of launch activity, are take rates lite  I guess just some more color on 3Q would be helpful. And then how do we expect revenue to trend relative to industry production in 4QSure thanks. I'll take that, Matt. First of all, you're right, we were basically flat to market, excluding the spot buys and the phase out revenue from our non-automotive electronics business. Outside of that, I'll just kind of break it down by product category to explain how we performed.First off, we grew basically in line with expectations that we had previously on our core climate business, so CCS, seat heat, steering wheel heat. There were some puts and takes in there, though. I mean, we had some higher take rates and vehicle launches than we expected, but those were somewhat offset by lower volume on some vehicle changeovers and some delayed EV ramp ups, which I think, has been well publicized with some OEMs.So all in all, kind of right on track with the climate business, where we saw the most significant impact below our expectations was with our Battery Performance Solutions. So we talked about in the past, the majority of our revenue currently in that category is with 48-volt mild hybrid vehicles, and that's where we have our thermal electric-based battery thermal management product. We've known over time that that's going to gradually phase down. Unfortunately, it was a little faster of a phase down or ramp down in the quarter than we expected. Now, those customers are Jeep and Mercedes.So revenue will still be there on those products. It's just gradually phasing down. Over the longer period for BPS, I think, if you look at the next several quarters, probably going to be relatively flat on our BPS business due to that ramp down.On the good side, we're launching some new products, mostly through our MSP-based flex circuits. So the BMW self-connecting board, the Renault battery heater, Mercedes battery heater, products like that. We're also ramping up our growing air-cooled battery products. So some good guys that are coming, but that will be basically offset by the declining 48-volt mild-hybrid business. So, that's BPS.On the other products, as you look into the full year, as you know, we kind of softened the top line a little bit. The BPS plays a significant impact there. The rest of the year, we still see the climate product about online with our expectations.If you look at the pneumatics products, we are going to see a little bit of a delay in the outperformance on our pneumatic lumbar massage. We expected quite a ramp up of EVs in the back half of the year, and some of those customer ramp ups are happening a little slower or delayed than expected. So that's kind of the high-level assessment of the revenue.Got it. Super helpful. Moving down to gross margins, feels like we're not totally getting the margin pull-through maybe that we were expecting. Could you help bridge the 60 bps of year-over-year decline in a little bit more detailYes, sure. So I think for the gross margin, we   in the quarter, we recorded about  3 million,  3.5 million charge on inventory related to the non-automotive electronics that we are phasing out, as we announced last year. So that's what is impacting the gross margin in the quarter. I think if we want to look at the profitability of the quarter, probably the better metric is the EBITDA. And that's where we see, on a pro forma basis, the 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, and 160 basis points sequential improvement.On the year-over-year side, on the positive, we continue to see a normalization of the environment, particularly around freight. So the biggest extension margin was the reduction of expedited and regular freight in the quarter. Productivity at the factory also was a nice lift. We achieved better productivity in the factory in this quarter compared to the last several ones.And then on the negative side, we have seen a negative price, primarily due to the fact that we had a tough comp when you compare that to a quarter of 2023 versus last year, since we had a high elevated number of price recoveries in the third quarter of last year, just due to timing.So that's the walk year-over-year. Sequentially, really, the improvement came from Alfmeier. As we said throughout the year, Alfmeier started the year in the single-digit EBITDA rates, and in the third quarter we were in the high single digits. So really a good improvement thanks to productivity, price recoveries, lower scrap. And then we started to see also benefits coming from supplier on a sequential basis. So that's at a high level, the walk both sequentially and the year-over-year.Got it. Super helpful. Last one from me. Good to hear, Alfmeier, margins improving. That was kind of my next question. I guess just what needs to happen to get the segment to maybe low double-digit margins in 2024 if we still think this is a reasonable assumption for next yearI would say a little early to talk about 2024, but overall, I think the real lift on the EBITDA margin of Alfmeier will come from a couple of things. If you go back to what we said back in February, footprint optimization is one of the projects that we kicked off actually with the announcement that we had earlier in September. And then obviously incremental volume, thanks to the huge number of awards that we have been winning since we owned the company. And then continue to work on productivity and scrap production across the factories. I think these are the three catalysts that will take the EBITDA margin of Alfmeier up.I think it's important to add, first of all, that as Matteo said, we're winning at a much faster rate than we expected on our pneumatic, lumbar, and massage products. And besides the growth, that product is going to be coming in overtime at company margins. So that'll help to replace business and backfill lower margin business over time.Very clear. That's all from you guys, thank you.Thank you.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.Good morning Phil, Matteo.Good morning, Ryan.Good morning, Ryan.Curious, so within the guidance, you're assuming that the UAW strike goes through the end of November, kind of as is last night forward and UAW came to a tentative agreement. Any comments, I guess, how that was factored, if at all, into the guidance for Q4 and the rest of the yearSo obviously, Ryan, we are monitoring the situation between the UAW and the OEM very closely. There was no impact in the third quarter, but the impact will be in the fourth. And as I said in my remarks, we are assuming that the plans that were impacted up to yesterday will continue to be idled through the end of November.So in terms of numbers, this equates to about  15 million to  20 million revenue impact for the fourth quarter. And Ford is about 25 , 30  of it. So that gives you kind of a gauge in case things change in the coming weeks.Maybe last comment, I would make, this incremental margin on this  15 million to  20 million revenue is about 40 , which is a little higher than what we normally have, just because there are, embedded in the estimate, additional inefficiencies that we are expecting to incur due to the strike.Then obviously, Ryan, if things were to continue, obviously, and if the strike gets prolonged, then we have a contingency plan in place, which we will enact, which includes obviously cost control at the OPEC side, tighter control and capital expenditures. But for sure, we are planning to   foremost, to protect our people and our customers. We have delivered good, strong free cash flow in the year, so we can afford to build a little bit of inventory to make sure that we are ready for the ramp up once this issue is resolved.And then as just my second question, it seems like you guys have had an accelerated traction with local Chinese OEMs. Is this primarily customers demanding more thermal comfort solutions and more of your products, or is this primarily you guys winning conquest business away from competitorsIt's both. The first one, for sure, we're seeing a rising demand for thermal and pneumatic features in China, period  ph . So the consumer is growing more accustomed to those solutions and expecting it from the OEM. So that's great. Great tailwinds just on the features in general.On the other side, we have very tactically focused on specific OEMs. In the past, most of our business, well, still is, and certainly traditionally has been with global OEMs who have formed joint ventures in China, and we've kind of transitioned our business with them into the market. In the last couple years, we've prioritized several domestic Chinese OEMs and are starting to make very good progress there. We have a full support team in China, very large with three manufacturing plants, ready and able to aggressively go after those customers.And we're excited to announce that, especially with rising EV players, companies like Li Auto, BYD, Xpeng, and certainly Great Wall, that we've picked up a lot of business of late. So it's a priority for us, and we're excited about what the team is doing there.Great, thanks guys, good luck.Thanks, Ryan.Thanks, Ryan.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  As there are no further questions, the conference of Gentherm has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-26T10:49:08.000-04:00

Taseko Mines: Major Upside Left After EPA Approves Arizona Copper Project,"Taseko Mines Limited  saw its stock price  over 20 percent after the EPA  for its Florence Copper project in Arizona, before closing the day upTaseko, a Vancouver-based mining company with just over 700 employeesFlorence will have capacity to produce up to 85Mlbs of copper annually at operating cash cost of only  1.11 lb. This will come in addition to the 115Mlbs of copper output from Taseko's Gibraltar mine in Canada. The EPA's move should allow Taseko to begin construction soon, which is estimated to take about 18 months.According to the , the plan proposes an In-Situ Copper Recovery  ISCR  well field supplying a solvent extraction and electrowinning  SX EW  plant with economic copper grade of pregnant leach solution  PLS  for at least 22 years.The approach taken was welcomed by the local community as it will create jobs while avoiding exacerbating the state's water crisis. According to the Florence Copper   There will be no impact on local water quality or quantity. ISCR uses significantly less water than what would be used by most types of farming or residential housing on the same area of land. The water used in the process comes from a layer of water deep underground and reused in the ISCR process over and over again for water efficiency.In a  on Thursday, Taseko President and CEO Stuart McDonald said the next steps include mobilization of contractors for the wellfield and SX EW plant construction and continuing to advance talks with potential lenders and royalty providers for the rest of project financing, which they expect to have in place prior to construction spending ramp up.I estimated Taseko Mines stock's fair price at  2.60 share in June, but that was before the company's Q223 filing which revealed operating margins for the trailing twelve months dropped from 15  to 11.66 , which will be the new starting point for year 1. I make the assumption that Gibraltar operations will gradually reach 20 , roughly in the direction targeted in its technical .The model assumes per the technical  that Florence adds nearly 35Mlbs annually beginning in year 3 before rising to an average of 83Mlbs year in years 5-10 net Mitsui's cut. This comes on top of Gibraltar's roughly 112-115Mlbs yr, before the combined total output reaches close to 200Mlb year. I slightly reduced Florence projections because Mitsui's 2.67  streaming agreement  was not fully reflected in the previous model. The Florence technical report does not incorporate this in its economic analysis. The company is also projected to produce on average of about 2.3Mlbs of molybdenum per year, which I incorporated into the DCF model.Based on a copper price of  3.75 lb and Mo. price of  20 lb, Taseko's annual revenue should climb to nearly  800 million by year ten in the model. Operating costs at Florence are expected to be  1.11 lb,  1.32 lb including royalties, significantly lower than the  2.66 lb Gibraltar registered in Q2. As a result, the company should see margins gradually rise. Gibraltar gradually rises to 20  while I have Florence plugged in at 35  EBIT throughout.The aforementioned changes, especially the lower EBIT baseline, end up reducing the fair price to  2.19 share, implying that the stock is undervalued by 33 . I also provide sensitivity tables that show the value based on discount ranges of 9 -13  and copper prices of  3.50 lb to  4.50 lb.Taseko's rising debt levels remain a key risk for the company, eating into its operating margins and threatens its valuation. A good argument could be made for using a higher discount rate in fact if we factored in the company's debt to market equity ratio, which is about 108   debt   market cap . The debt to common equity ratio is at 165 , coverage ratio 1.03, and Net Debt EBITDA ratio is 5.88. In the previous report, before the Q2 filing, we reported D E of 169 , coverage ratio of 1.43, and Net Debt EBITDA of 4.8. Interest expense was almost 9  of sales in Q223 and averaged about 10  of sales in the past five years - which feeds right into major risk  2.The other concern is Gibraltar's operating margins. The reality is Gibraltar will represent nearly 60  of production even when Florence is fully up and running. This presents opportunity as well, considering it is more likely to increase operating margins toward the industry average than to go backwards  at least one would hope . Plus, think of the possibilities if the company was able to reduce interest expenses to even 5  of sales.TGB stock popped after the EPA greenlighted its Florence copper mine in Arizona, as I anticipated in a buy recommendation a couple months ago. However, I expect the stock to rise even more in the long-term, especially if investors gain confidence the company can reduce its debt load and the current operations can enhance operating margins. Hence, I maintain a buy recommendation.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

National Fuel Gas: This Dividend King Is Cheaply Valued,"I first  purchasing National Fuel Gas  in the spring of 2020. Since my article, the stock rallied up to 80  within two years. The stock has incurred a 25  correction in the last 12 months due to the plunge inNational Fuel Gas is an integrated energy company that is focusedSource  The company is diversified, but its upstream segment generates 54  of its EBITDA. As a result, National Fuel Gas is fairly sensitive to the cycles of the price of natural gas. This sensitivity has been obvious in each of the last three years.National Fuel Gas posted record earnings per share of  in 2021 thanks to the recovery of the global energy market from the coronavirus crisis. Even better, the company greatly benefited from the Ukrainian crisis last year. Due to the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union on Russia, which was producing about one-third of natural gas consumed in Europe, the global natural gas market became extremely tight last year. Europe imported a record number of LNG cargos from the U.S. in order to replace the lost quantities from Russia and thus the U.S. gas market became extremely tight as well. Consequently, the price of U.S. natural gas skyrocketed to a 13-year high last year. As a result, National Fuel Gas grew its earnings per share  last year, from  4.29 to a new all-time high of  5.88.Unfortunately for the company, the price of natural gas is infamous for its high cyclicality. Due to an exceptionally warm winter in the U.S. and Europe, which has greatly increased gas inventories, the price of natural gas has plunged this year. While it has bounced off its bottom in April, it is still 70  lower than its peak last year. This has taken its toll on the results of National Fuel Gas.In the most recent quarter, the company  its output 7  year-over-year thanks to the continued development of its assets in Appalachia. However, it was hurt by the correction of gas prices, and thus it incurred a 34  decrease in its earnings per share. It is also remarkable that management marginally lowered the mid-point of its guidance for the annual earnings per share for a third consecutive quarter, from  5.10- 5.40 to  5.15- 5.25.Moreover, there are no signs of a sustained recovery of the price of natural gas, according to the latest  of the Energy Information Administration  EIA . The U.S. natural gas inventories have climbed 12  above their 5-year average and 22  above their level a year ago. During the ongoing refill season, the net increase in stored natural gas has exceeded the 5-year average by 3  so far, primarily due to increased gas output from producers. Furthermore, U.S. natural gas inventories are expected to end the refill season at approximately 3.9 billion cubic feet, which is 7  higher than the 5-year average. Given all these facts from the latest report, it is easy to understand why the price of natural gas has slumped from last year's levels.As mentioned above, National Fuel Gas generates slightly more than half of its earnings from its upstream segment and hence it is sensitive to the gyrations of gas prices. On the other hand, thanks to its midstream and downstream segments, the company is much more diversified than pure upstream producers, such as San Juan Basin Royalty Trust .In addition, National Fuel Gas is growing its production at a fast pace thanks to the development of its high-quality properties in Appalachia.Source  The development of these properties are likely to drive growth, not only in the upstream segment, but also in the midstream segment, as this segment is likely to gather, transport and store greater amounts of natural gas in the upcoming years. Moreover, investors should note that natural gas is much more protected from the environmental policies of most countries than oil products, as the former is considered a much cleaner fuel.Analysts seem to agree on the promising growth prospects, which results from the high-quality asset portfolio of National Fuel Gas. They expect the company to incur an 11  decrease in its earnings per share this year, but they expect the earnings per share to recover to  5.84 in fiscal 2024, just 1  lower than the all-time high achieved last year. It is also important to note that National Fuel Gas  the analysts' earnings-per-share estimates in 15 of the last 17 quarters. Therefore, the company has good chances of exceeding the above forecast of the analyst community.Due to the significant correction of gas prices from blowout levels last year, the market sentiment has become negative on National Fuel Gas this year. As a result, the stock has declined 25  in the last 12 months and hence it is currently trading at a nearly 10-year low price-to-earnings ratio of . It is also remarkable that the stock is trading at only 9.1 times its expected earnings in fiscal 2024, which will begin on October 1st, 2023.This price-to-earnings ratio is much lower than the 5-year average of 13.1 of the stock. During the last decade, the stock has traded at price-to-earnings ratios between 10 and 21. Therefore, it seems reasonable and prudent to assume a fair price-to-earnings ratio of 13.1, in line with the 5-year average of the stock.Whenever the price of natural gas improves, the stock is likely to revert towards its historical valuation level. In such a case, National Fuel Gas may enjoy a 44  rally  13.1 9.1 - 1  merely thanks to the normalization of its valuation. When the stock approaches the technical resistance of  70, which will correspond to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.0, the stock will switch from a  buy  rating to a  hold  rating. Overall, National Fuel Gas has significant upside potential from its current price thanks to its exceptionally cheap valuation.National Fuel Gas has paid a dividend every single quarter since its foundation, 121 years ago. It has also grown its dividend for 53 consecutive years, and thus it has become the first energy company to become a member of Dividend Kings.Source  Investor PresentationThis is an extraordinary achievement for a company that belongs to the highly cyclical energy sector and confirms the solid business execution and long-term perspective of management.Moreover, National Fuel Gas is currently offering a nearly 10-year high dividend yield of 3.7 .Furthermore, the stock has a solid payout ratio of  and hence its dividend has a wide margin of safety. The only caveat is the low dividend growth rate  over the last decade. However, the nearly 10-year high dividend yield of National Fuel Gas and its healthy payout ratio render the stock an attractive candidate for income-oriented investors.The primary risk factor for National Fuel Gas is the secular shift of the entire world from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This shift has accelerated since early last year, as most countries are doing their best to avoid a future energy crisis, like the one experienced after the onset of the Ukrainian crisis. To this end, most countries are investing in clean energy projects at a record pace.However, the record investment in clean energy projects is likely to weigh on the future consumption of oil products much more than the consumption of natural gas, which is considered a much cleaner fuel than oil products. Moreover, as global energy consumption grows year after year, it may take several years for the global consumption of oil to peak, let alone the consumption of natural gas. Overall, the boom in renewable energy projects may pose a threat to the business model of National Fuel Gas but only in the very distant future.The stock of National Fuel Gas has incurred a material correction this year, as the price of natural gas has corrected off its blowout levels reached last year due to the war in Ukraine. Due to a negative market sentiment, the stock has become exceptionally cheap. It is trading at a nearly 10-year low valuation level and is offering a nearly 10-year high dividend yield. Given also its promising growth prospects, National Fuel Gas is likely to highly reward investors in the upcoming years.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

This slide essentially captures Heliogen on a single page.I'd like to begin by reaffirming our core mission, which is that first slice highlighted in orange on the page. Heliogen is on a mission to help decarbonize industry and enable a sustainable low carbon future. We're positioned to do this through our unique combination of concentrated solar technology, thermal energy storage and artificial intelligence, which allow us to produce dispatchable green energy in the form of heat, power or hydrogen.Now over the next five minutes or so, I'm going to walk through slides, which essentially double-click on other slices from this opening page  our product and value differentiators, our market focus and our offering.Turning to Slide 5. Here, I'll describe the needs we see in the market and how Heliogen's products can meet those needs. First, let's talk about heat, which includes steam. 30  of industrial heating applications require heat below 100 degrees Celsius, while another 27  can be met with heat between 100 and 400 degrees Celsius. In most cases, the on-site production of this heat is vital in order to minimize wasted heat that gets lost in transport to the point of use at the customer.We specialize in producing and delivering green heat because our energy starts as heat from the sun. Our first products will serve saturated and super-heated steam applications of up to 550 degrees Celsius. This capacity enables customers to avoid high fuel costs, enhancing both sustainability and financial viability. Longer term, we see huge potential for the high temperature heat products that are on our future product roadmap as we've already proven at our demonstration-scale facility that Heliogen's technology can generate temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees Celsius. High temperature applications are especially compelling because they can address industries like cement and steel, which are among the most significant contributors to carbon emissions specifically because their high temperature processes are currently served almost exclusively by burning fossil fuels.On the power side, the need for on-demand electricity is ever present and tends to be much more universally understood as compared with heat. It's not a surprise to most that industrial and utility load serving assets often require continuous power. So, a resilient economical grid-independent solution with 4-and-plus-hour duration is essential. And the market has finally started to incentivize this commercially for renewable sources of power. Our power products will produce dispatchable electric power that is competitively priced inclusive of storage.Turning to green fuel, with around 95  of all hydrogen currently produced with fossil fuels, the call for green hydrogen has intensified. Heliogen's ability to produce both green heat and green power makes us uniquely suited for harnessing the efficiencies of a solid oxide electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen, which can leverage both steam and power as essential energy inputs for splitting the water molecule.Now on the right side of the page, let's delve into the differentiators that set our products apart. Strategically, our solutions offer high capacity factors of up to 100  low energy storage costs, no reliance on rare earth minerals and greater than 85  recyclability. We are also well positioned to leverage regulatory incentives in the U.S. via the Inflation Reduction Act and many others abroad.Operationally, our AI-enabled closed-loop tracking for the Heliostat field leads to over 30  more efficiency per square foot than traditional solar PV without the thermal runaway fire risk associated with battery storage solutions. Our products are designed to use widely available materials with a diverse supply chain for stability and scalability.Finally, the modularity of our systems solves for scale by enabling tailored solutions to serve behind the meter needs for both small and large customer applications. Modularity also enables easier permitting and maximizes the ability for us to reapply engineering work and lessons learned from project to project.By aligning our solutions to the critical needs of our customers and differentiating our offerings through strategic and operational innovation, we are building a robust platform for growth within a massive addressable market opportunity.Moving on to Page 6, we'll explore Heliogen's value proposition through the lens of the different industries our technology can serve. Our technology is applicable and customizable across diverse sectors. The metals and mining industry is responsible for nearly 4  of total final energy consumption globally. And given the prominent role that critical minerals play in the energy transition, it faces a pressing need to use more sustainable energy sources. Heliogen is primed to replace aging fossil fuel energy production assets serving this market.Legacy renewable technologies have been an imperfect substitute to dispatchable fossil fuel energy sources. Our solutions for demand year-round can maximize the integration of renewables with low carbon electricity. We're prepared to fully integrate our concentrated solar power with solar PV and storage for optimal levelized cost of energy inclusive of storage. This integration offers a new standard that can be utilized by both utilities and industrial operators with on-site power generation. We're working to forge solutions-oriented partnerships with other service providers and vendors, along with clients that have a need for decarbonization that Heliogen technology can solve.I strongly believe in all of the above strategy is necessary for the world to achieve its ambitious and growing net-zero goals. And the attributes I've outlined here show why Heliogen's technology can be an essential contributor to achieving these goals.Let me now take the time to describe our commercial offering. Page 7 lays out how we operate today and provides a glimpse into our vision for the future. Today, we develop and sell turnkey projects which deploy Heliogen's core technology. This includes planning, designing and overseeing the installation of the projects to ensure that they are functional and ready to use. Taking on these roles helps us control our own destiny on our early commercial projects, and we will work closely with our customers to align our solutions to address their unique needs and pain points. Then upon start of operations, we can provide operations and maintenance support through a long-term service contract.In the future, we expect our business model to shift more towards a licensing approach, where we sell technology packages, which may include our Heliostats, our proprietary software and integration services. We expect to partner with third parties on project development and physical deployment under this business model, and this will help us amplify our reach and accelerate our market penetration.Now I'd like to share an update on our strategic priorities as summarized on Page 8 of the presentation. We've made significant progress since our last business update.Our first priority is to close sales contracts. In June, we signed an  11.2 million sustainable green hydrogen offtake contract with the City of Lancaster, California. This represents not only a commercial milestone for Heliogen, but a shared vision for a cleaner future with the city as our partner. Looking ahead, our current prospects pipeline has grown to 825 megawatts with 700 megawatts added since our last conference call in May. This remarkable expansion reflects the progress our sales and commercial team have made and positions us for securing additional customer commitments.Our second priority is to install our first commercial scale project, which will open up access to new prospective customers as well as continuing to help us evolve future generations of our products. This priority underscores our commitment to translating vision into tangible results. We're targeting groundbreaking by year-end, setting the stage for the construction of our pioneering green hydrogen project. We're executing on a well-calibrated plan to achieve mechanical completion by the end of 2024 and commence the first hydrogen production during the first quarter of 2025. Over the upcoming 90 days, we'll be focused on our permitting and long lead equipment activities.Our third priority is to extend our liquidity runway in order to position for robust growth. The cost reductions that we actioned at the end of the first quarter are now being realized. And in parallel, the shelf registration that we filed earlier this year is now effective and preserves optionality for how we add growth capital to the balance sheet.If you'll turn to Page 9, you'll see we have outlined our commercial pipeline on the page for the first time. What you see on the page is a summary of our sales and marketing activity. This is how our Chief Commercial Officer, Tom Doyle, and the commercial team now manage the pipeline internally. And going forward, we'll continue to status and share this with you as part of our business update on subsequent calls. There are four stages named at the top of the graphic, and we've defined those stages based on the status of engagement with each prospective customer. We only categorize an order as booked if we have a fully signed contract with the performance obligation under the sale.In terms of the big picture, we have a total of 825 megawatts across 22 potential customers. We've more than doubled the total number of potential customers in the pipeline. In terms of megawatts, we've grown that number by over 6 times with our focus not only on adding customers, but on prioritizing those who may have energy demand across multiple operating locations where Heliogen may be a fit. So, the average capacity per customer has increased.Let me take a moment to explain the stages of the pipeline. Each stage is defined based on the progress of engagement with the customer. In the lead generation stage of our sales pipeline, we are discussing site-specific details of the customer. We're in discussion about their goals, their pain points, their technical wants, and we're conceptualizing the approach to integration. As those interactions progress, we'll receive more detailed information from the customer that we use to generate an indicative proposal that we then submit. We currently have six customers in this submitted proposal stage encompassing 34 megawatts.The next phase in the pipeline is the pre-final investment decision activity stage or the pre-FID stage. By this point, it will often be the case that we'll have a letter of intent or a memorandum of understanding in place that outlines mutual intent between Heliogen and the customer. We progress through the necessary steps to help the customer make a final decision. This may include activities such as engineering design work, providing the client with a detailed equipment layout and providing details on the scope, schedule and cost estimates. Where possible, we'll structure these as customer-funded activities. The duration of pre-FID work will depend upon the type of customer and the nature and size of customer commitment. For example, for some projects, the customer may need to take the decision to their Board of Directors for approval.After executing a final contract, we move into the execution phase of the project. We currently have two customers in this stage. That includes the Proxima green hydrogen contract as well as the Capella project with Woodside Energy, who continues to be an exceptionally strong partner for us. Projects in the booked order stage enter our revenue backlog.I mentioned last quarter that we augmented and reoriented our sales team to grow our pipeline, and the numbers on this page are a testament to those improvements. As we work to close additional contracts, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.Before we move on to the discussion of our backlog and financial results, I'd like to introduce Sagar Kurada, our new CFO and Head of Strategy, and to express my deep appreciation to Kelly Rosser, who graciously served as our Interim CFO and has now returned to serving as our Chief Accounting Officer. Sagar brings more than two decades of experience in industrial decarbonization and renewable energy, and he has a proven track record of developing and implementing financial growth strategies for disruptive companies in this space.Sagar, over to you.Thanks, Christie. Good morning, everyone.Continuing our review of the second quarter business performance, allow me to direct your attention to Page 10. As Christie mentioned on Page 9, we have today 7 megawatt and three projects in our contracted backlog, representing  75 million in anticipated sales. Our backlog has grown approximately  10 million since the first quarter earnings call.On June 6, 2023, we announced our green hydrogen contract, adding  11.2 million in backlog in the second quarter. This will be our first installed project. It will be in the City of Lancaster, California, and will fuel their municipal fleet. We refer to this project as Project Proxima. Proxima is expected to achieve mechanical completion at the end of 2024 with first production in the first quarter of 2025.Additionally, at the end of second quarter, we have  63.5 million of backlog remaining on our original contract to develop a turnkey green energy production facility sponsored by Woodside and partially funded by the Department of Energy. We refer to this as Project Capella.Lastly, we have a partnership with Dimensional Energy for a remaining backlog of  0.5 million to develop sustainable aviation fuel.In the second quarter, we recognized  1.4 million of revenue, largely attributable to Project Capella for  1.1 million. In addition to the  75 million, we have been selected to receive a  4.1 million award from the DOE that aims to reduce the carbon emissions associated with cement manufacturing by decarbonizing the heating of limestone. We also have a contract with NantG Power to provide up to  5 million in engineering services, paving the way for them to purchase a commercial-scale calcination facility. These services include field testing, development of a technoeconomic model and design services.In the next two pages, I will talk you through the second quarter financials. Let me direct your attention to the right-hand side of Page 11. We earned  1.4 million in revenue in the second quarter on Capella. Over the lifetime of this contract, we will earn  80.6 million. We have thus far recognized  17.1 million, leaving a backlog of  63.5 million, which we expect to recognize through 2026 as we work to complete the project.Moving to SG A. We recorded  17.7 million on a GAAP basis. SG A includes  3.3 million of non-cash expenses,  1.4 million of unusual non-recurring items and  0.9 million of project costs related to Proxima and other long-term projects. Adjusted for these items, we recorded  12.1 million in SG A. This is a 14  reduction relative to the comparable costs in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to manage our R D efforts to focus on methodical product development to deliver on commitments to our existing and future customers in our pipeline.Moving on to Page 12. We ended the second quarter with  108 million in liquidity, including  44 million in cash and  64 million in investments. Year-to-date, we received  8.8 million in cash for projects underway and we expanded project development expenses of  8.5 million. We spent  21.8 million in SG A year-to-date. Adjusting for project costs and non-cash items, SG A expense was  25.8 million. This spend does include  3.2 million in unusual items and  1.5 million related to sales and marketing efforts to support our commercial engagement. As a reminder, the remaining of the contracted backlog for Project Capella from Woodside and the DOE for  63.5 million is not included in our liquidity on hand of  108 million. We expect our liquidity on hand to address both our project and working capital needs through the first half of 2024.With that, let me hand it back to Christie for Page 13.Thank you, Sagar.Before we open it up for Q A, I want to take a moment to reflect on the significant strides we've made. We have a contracted revenue backlog of over  75 million that serves as a springboard for our future growth. Our addition of 700 megawatts to our pipeline since May is a sign of the market demand and our aggressive progress toward capturing it. Our first project installation is on track toward our goals of groundbreaking by year-end 2023 and mechanical completion by year-end 2024. Our fully operational world-class manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California represents our commitment to excellence in engineering, automation and robotics. None of this will be possible without our strong team who is bringing fresh energy to the challenge. All of our team's actions are aligned to the strategic priorities that I laid out at the beginning of the call.Heliogen's differentiated approach to clean energy is not just a response to market demand, but it's a reimagined way of advancing the energy transition. And the progress that we've made over the past three months highlights the effectiveness of our strategy and also shines the light on our path ahead. So, I want to thank you for your continued support of Heliogen and your belief in our mission.I'm pleased to now open the line to address any questions that you may have.Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.I had one question on the product and then a couple on the pipeline funnel. You mentioned on Slide 6, fully integrated hybrid design. I'm not sure if I'm fully familiar, I wonder if you could expand on what that means just a little bit.Yes, Rob, absolutely. When we talk about hybrid design, there are actually exist projects in other parts of the world outside the U.S. that combine concentrated solar energy technology with solar PV. And what we can do uniquely is to bring Heliogen's elevation of concentrated solar technology through the artificial intelligence and our hardware innovations to uplevel that further. And for the benefit of combining these two, the concentrated solar plus PV and storage is the fact that you can then leverage the low-cost solar PV in certain parts of the world during the daytime and use that time to then charge off the solar thermal energy storage during the day and then have that be dispatchable at night. So, we found a lot of interest in that solution, and find that could actually be a great fit for many customers looking for that consistent round-the-clock availability along with that low-cost energy.That's interesting. Is that inbound interest  I'm not sure if that was one of your strategic focuses, it seems a little bit new. And then just really, does that include concentrated solar energy gathering  Or is it more the heat storage you have that you would add into itIt's something that we've been exploring. And as we've been testing the market with it, we have found a lot of interest in that as a solution. And then, in terms of the way that we combine the storage, we would have most of the storage is our concentrated solar thermal energy storage, and so it would be thermal, and with some potential for integration of either grid access or battery to the extent necessary. So, if we are looking to firm it up to 100  firm power to meet a customer's need, that would be an option too. So we're really focused on serving the customer depending on their operational requirements. But again, most of the storage would be our CST thermal storage.Perfect. Okay. Great. I wanted to move to the commercial activity where it seems like the strategy you kind of put in place, Christie, and the rest of you, as you evolved, seems to be paying off, by which I mean you've got the 34 megawatts and the 20 megawatts, which seem to be more in this  indiscernible  kind of size frame so that downscaled smaller footprint. So a couple of questions there. Can you talk about on those projects in the 34 megawatts and the 20 megawatts buckets, which do seem to be a little bit smaller and more bite-sized, can you talk about the speed of permitting and complexity and proposals and so forth  I know this is all new, so I'm not sure you have metrics on how fast stuff can move to the pipeline, but is it fair to assume that the project complexity is lower than on the big mining or whatever the other ones are  And could you maybe talk about just how fast it could move if it does from one step in the bucket to the next to actually being completed  indiscernibleYes, Rob, absolutely. So it's quite a range that we see. You pointed out the 34 megawatts across six customers. And I would say that's true, your point that, in general, the smaller projects tend to be less complex than the potentially larger projects and we're pleased that we have been able to increase the average capacity per prospective customer in the pipeline. So that's a positive direction. We find that there is a sweet spot, especially for power projects where to leverage the turbine efficiency, you really have to be in the tens of megawatts range for that to make sense. And so in fact, the smaller projects that you see tend to more likely be actually heat or steam projects. So that's one context that I'll provide on your question.And then in terms of timing, it really depends. I would say that for the really large projects, yes, you could be looking at something like 12 to 18 months in terms of what it takes to move a prospect through our sales pipeline. But for smaller projects and nimble customers, we're able to move as quickly as the customer looks like. And so, we look forward to advancing some of these projects to completion.And then I know you don't have metrics on how many fall out at different stages of the funnel yet because you're building the funnel so fast here, but do you have any comments on the work that goes into it or the customer commitment that goes into it or how you vet the customers to think about how much of the 34 megawatts and or the 20 megawatts kind of are likely to come to fruition  I know that's maybe a hard question to answer numerically, but I wonder if you can give a background on it.Yes, certainly. So background on that is, look, I think any capital project in the world of energy and capital projects, there are always going to be for every project that moves forward, some of that fall by the wayside. And I think that's just the nature of the business because there's -- for every project that gets built, there are some that don't go forward. And those can be for reasons that are both outside our control and sometimes often outside the customer's control. And so for that reason, you will see that over the course of time, there will be net change to the pipeline where things are both added to the pipeline and they fall away from the pipeline, but I would consider that to be natural progressions of any sales process for the type of business that we're in rather than something that's specific to Heliogen.And so, in terms of the way that our pipeline is shaped going forward, I would look for, in general, the health of the pipeline to be moving more from the regeneration to submitted proposals to pre-FID activities, that's the progression that we look forward to. And so it's not necessarily that we're only ever going to be adding to the pipeline.And then, going to the second piece of your question, in terms of how we prioritize customers, for us, an ideal customer is someone who is worried about increasing cost and volatility of fossil fuels and looking for a different solution that provides that same consistency of availability with the greater certainty of not having carbon emissions and cost reduction. And so I think a global customer with a footprint requiring some combination of heat and power is definitely a priority for us in terms of how we probably look at our customer base.Okay. Perfect. And I'll ask one more and then I'll get back in line. But, on the left end of the chart, the lead generation, obviously, a tremendous amount of progress there. You've been talking to folks for a long time. So, could you give us the criteria or what changed or why we have such a  indiscernible  from what I assume are sort of intangible conversations to tangible  Maybe you could just give us a little bit of background on what the screen was to make it into the 825 megawatts bucketYes. There's a number of screening criteria that we use. There are screening criteria that include both the nature of what the customer is looking to do in terms of, are they needing some -- one or more of heat or power or fuel, and then also aspects of the customer's physical sites. And so for example, if a customer is in the middle of an urban location, in middle of downtown, and that's where they're making their -- whether it's a consumer good or what have you, that's not going to be a strong fit for many types of projects in the energy space, because there's just a land requirement that's there.But for example, we talk to customers who are in  indiscernible  remote places serving mining companies and if you're in that kind of location and you need grid independence and certainty of cost where you're otherwise paying a high cost for diesel or otherwise importing fossil fuels to help fuel your energy requirements, that's something where Heliogen can provide truly a differentiated way to help them meet their energy consumption requirements.But then you've been talking to folks, I assume, for the past long while, what  indiscernible  entry into the qualified lead backlog  I mean is your commercial outreach been more successful in some way that makes it into the slide, if you see thatYes. Okay. So that's a great question. Many of the customers that are in the 825 megawatts are actually brand new since May. There are some that we've been talking to for a period of time, and the ones that are new, I think what we've been able to do is to really focus our offering more  indiscernible , we came out to the market with our first available steam unit. And then with the power offering, which, as we talked about earlier, has the opportunity to combine both CST or CSP and solar PV, that's another way of being able to meet customers' needs in a different way for power. And so, I think over the course of time, you're going to see that our pipeline will shift more towards power in the medium term because the market is -- the market demand is just so significant. And I think we have a unique way of meeting that demand.Got it. Thank you.Thanks, Rob.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Alliance Global Partners.And first, I just want to commend you all for putting forth a lot more transparency and visibility on the pipeline. That's super helpful and exciting to see. Continuing on kind of that last comment, Christie, just wanted to peel the onion back a bit more on the robust growth in the pipeline over the last several months. Is that purely attributable to a shift in the sales strategy  Is that for the derisking of the technology  A shift in kind of the offering  Is there a way to kind of -- I know it's probably hard to attribute discretely to each of those, but just looking for more detail on what's driving so much of that growth over the last few months.Yes, Jeff, thanks for the question. If I could boil it down to one word, I would say focus. It's about the sales team and our overall commercial effort being more focused on the type of customers that the fit and on customers that are interested in moving quickly to capitalize on what's out there on both carbon reduction opportunity and from a financial perspective. And then it's really our team's effort in hitting the market with a more focused product offering as well and having that be consistent.Got it. That's very helpful. And within the current pipeline, the 825 megawatts, I'm curious if any of those currently include a PV component  And when you guys use that term kind of a hybrid project, should we think about that as integrating things including your AI and software on the PV side as well  Is that a little bit earlier stage of something to think about  Or -- yes, just hoping to get a little bit more detail on the PV component there.Sure. In the 825 megawatts, there are prospects that we're having dialogue with on this hybrid approach. And so yes, that does include the hybrid offering. And in terms of the way that we integrate our AI and our novel hardware, both of those are focused on Heliogen's proprietary CST technology, and so we haven't looked at, at this point, applying that to PV. This is just traditional commercially available PV off-the-shelf, easy to integrate and that sort of thing. There's not anything novel from a purely PV perspective. Really, the novelty is in Heliogen's core IP applied to our concentrated solar technology offering.Okay. Great. And if I can just sneak one more in. What would you say are the main risks as it relates to the timing milestones on the Capella project  Is it purely just kind of sourcing long lead items, permitting kind of normal things of that nature  Kind of how would you characterize any risks or main milestones that you guys are looking to achieve over the next 12 to 16, 18 monthsYes, Jeff, I think the ones that you called out, you hit the nail on the head. I think if some of those kind of traditional project milestones that are often referred during the development phase. And then also, it's just an approach of how we're developing the development of the testing process. And so that particular project is -- just to remind folks and give context for folks who are tuning in for the first time, that project is a first demonstration of our next-generation storage technology.And so, we're really excited to be partnering with our customer Woodside Energy on that project. And we have a whole program kind of parallel testing and risk reduction efforts on that technology. And over the course of time, we're going to be deploying those as we continue to develop the actual project site. And so, I think that as we proceed with these milestones, we're going to be completing our front-end engineering design study, which will produce an updated schedule and estimate, and then move towards breaking ground sometime next year.Our next question comes from the line of Jaden Williams with Siebert Williams Shank.Just a question about sort of that qualified lead backlog. Is there an ideal sort of cumulative power product capacity or number of customers you'd be targeting  Or ask a little differently, if all of those qualified leads wanted to sign deals tomorrow, what portion do you think you'd be able to supportLook, I think right now, our objective is to increase our focus on getting contracts in the door. We will -- we do have a fully entitled Heliostat production facility that can produce a lot more than where we are in terms of our contract and backlog today. So, we are excited to reach that capacity. And the quick deployment of increased capacity is something that we would consider at that point. What I can say is that we would be -- we are today equipped to do more than what we have contracted and we want to first get to 100  of that. But to Christie's point, there is a lag time between generating the pipeline to getting it to contract and that -- within that lag time, we'll have a better answer for you on how that translates into reaching the complete entitlement.Our next question is a follow-up from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.Just a couple of small ones. The hydrogen at Proxima, what's the revenue recognition like on that projectYes. On that project, Rob, revenue recognition would be once we have the asset in operation that we get paid  10 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. And so, revenue would be recognized over the course of time once that contract is underway and the asset is generating hydrogen. Now if, for example, the project were to be acquired by an equity investor, then we would recognize that revenue -- that revenue recognition would be pulled forward and we could be recognizing at an earlier stage. And so we do have inbound interest from parties interested in participating as an equity investor in that project. And so that's a possibility. But as currently structured, revenue recognition happens based on the offtake contract, which is once the hydrogen is being produced.Perfect. And I know it's early to talk about gross margins on projects that you haven't fully brought in the backlog yet, but how are you thinking about pricing on this  I know you have a lot of manufacturing talent. I know you have a factory that can ramp up pretty far and your costs will come down over time. Anyway, how do you think about gross margin on early projects  Whether you get people -- how do you think about gross margin on early projectsYes, of course. I love that you came back to that question three times over in the same dialogue. But look, I think -- but we are intently focused on delivering gross margin. We believe that in the next couple of years as we ramp up our production and to the conversation we had earlier, get more contracts through the door within the forecasted period when over the next three years, we expect to get there. My view on gross margin is we have today a compelling product that can demand market pricing. And we are coming down the cost curve as we ramp up our manufacturing facility to entitlement. We'll be presenting more of that detail over the course of this year as we come back to you periodically.But there are no projects that we would be considering in the long term that would not be yielding gross margin both on a project basis and on an aggregate basis. Today, we are expanding our market share. So there is a level of flexibility we demonstrate on that in order to ensure that our technology is more present and prominent versus other incumbents. And for that reason, there is a fine balance between margin versus revenue, but we'll keep you posted as new contracts come through the door.Thank you. We have no more phone questions, but we do have one question submitted from the audience. How are you reaching out to potential customers to use this technology  Is your sales approach based on the potential of the technology or the vital importance that an alternative technology must be implemented sooner rather than laterThank you, operator. We are -- to address that question, we are absolutely meeting and selling on the basis of necessity. We have found that industrial consumers of energy without exception are driven by economics, and that includes both their operational requirements and their own cost benefit assessment looking at the value of what our solutions can provide financially in terms of carbon reduction, and they do look at both now and in the future.Now there may also be emotion involved. In fact, one of our customer executives told us that he's excited to work with our technology because he said,  I know that I owe it to my kids that helps us to plan on a better path than it's been on.  But ultimately, the way that we approach sales is to show how Heliogen can deliver dispatchable, high-capacity factor clean energy to help customers both meet their operational and their carbon reduction and financial objectives. And so that's -- hopefully, that addresses that question from the investor.With that, I understand that was the last question that we had coming in.

Significant Changes Might Greatly Alter America's Rail Transportation System,"The American railroad network has played important roles in the expansion of economic growth for over two centuries  it's clearly long-term. During its existence, change, forced marketplace change, dominated the landscape. Today's network condensed itself from its multitudes of flags into sixChange, the ever-present constant, is once again afoot. Among the coming is the ever-increasing population redistribution driven by political, technological or other forces  demand growth opening new doors into more options  and a coming world dominated with significantly higher energy costs, particularly for airlines and trucks. Before we head into the forest to extinguish some fires  discussed later , we note that picking investments especially for the long run requires a comparison between a company's vision and its relative reactions to paradigm shifts. Now, would you grab the gear and come alongFrom the dawn of time, transportation of all kinds challenged the minds and skills of the human race. Whether the task involved mankind or necessary goods, the endeavor to increase efficiencies, reduce societal costs while increasing speed, was ever present.By the early 1800s, a technology largely developed in England, the iron horse, found its way into American business, i.e.,   B O . By 1840, lands east of the Mississippi hosted near 3,000 miles of track. The importance of railroads proved itself during the American Civil War thus opening doors into its Golden Age between 1860 and 1930. In that period, four major railroads constructed lines from the Mississippi to the West Coast, knitting together the continent.The roads leading west demanded enormous resources. In the case of the Union Pacific Central Pacific, Congress passed legislation assisting the project . Lobbied for by interested business representatives, the Act offered generous subsidies including  200 feet of land on each side of the right of way, 30-year construction bonds of  16,000 to  48,000 depending on the landscape and odd sections of public land. At maturity, the law required railroads to repay bonds. Later, testimony offered from the two companies stated that  was  50 million for the Central and  60 million for the Pacific, an enormous amount in the 1800s. This ACT also assisted in building the rest of the western roads except James J. Hill's, Great Northern. Without a sizable level of government involvement, these projects would have been drastically delayed or never built.The Golden Age, a period without significant competition, continued through the 1920s being stunted with the effects of an enduring, deep depression and early competition from autos and air. A short resurgence appeared during the 2nd World War continuing shortly thereafter.In the sixties, the multiple of flags faced the reality that freight traffic was the only route to profitability forcing an exit from passenger services, the last straw being thrown by Lyndon Johnson with his canceling of the lucrative 1st class mail contracts. The Nixon Administration created a highly disjointed passenger service through a corporation primarily owned and funded by the Federal Government . n 1971. In its creation, law dictated a relatively strong mandate requiring now freight-only railroads to give priority dispatching to the Amtrak service with timely operation being a requirement for viable service. Over time, a very  relationship developed between the two for many reasons, but primarily a result of this dispatching mandate.The private railroads shrink in physical size shown in a time-telling graph with a radical the  during the late 70s lasting through the early 90s.This period included a critical change by the Carter Presidency, deregulation of the freight rails through  This action both saved the group financially, lowered costs for shippers and consumers, yet induced this cascade of damaging abandonments with transporters seeking only profitable ROWs. The unfortunate list of abandonments includes several typesThe draconian purposeful loss of ROW came during periods of continued ., we included a map predicting regions of over-capacity by 2035. This map, generated twelve years ago, is certainly dated, yet still offers an important view. For example, the mostly single trackage, shown in green, between Birmingham, AL and New Orleans, LA suffers precipitously with major capacity issues.Put in bold and distinctive words in a 2023 article from ,In our view, the needed capital is massive. A drastic physical transformation coupled with expected increased business foretells a future of compressed capacity and great operational risk without funding similar in size to the transcontinentals.Railroads operated in an almost perfect monopoly for nearly 100 years. In time, competition from air and truck auto cramped the market. In times of low energy costs, the competition, truck auto air, shine. But energy isn't always cheap. Thus, reviewing a few comparative facts opens the door into a different vision. On energy, load bearing, land consumption and costs a multitude of give and takes exist. Each plays a role in determining viable options. In real applications, the comparisons are more complicated, but purposely we tried to highlight a or the driving characteristic. A table summary follows. Unclear whether eminent domain costs were included. Expansion cost per mile for freight rail.  a high-speed rail line including land, maintenance structures, and train stations at a cost of  25 million per mile.  completed its Rosenburg to Victoria on an abandoned ROW  without track, tie and ballast  for  1 million per mile. Concept of load bearing equates to the lateral spreading of weight across a surface. For rail, it's the area of the tie across the length of a car  Approx. 60 and 10  by 100 . For trucks, it's the tire surface area contacting the road.  at a limited area of 100 sq. in.. Truck data was not found, but is relatively limited. The interstate highway by specification is approximately  With approximately 50,000 miles, the system consumes a minimum of approximately 1.5 million acres. Class I trackage shown above equals 100,000 miles. Double track consumes approximately 50 ft., triple equals approximately 70 ft. equaling about 7 acres per mile. The total consumed equals approximately 700,000 acres. Note  most of the US is single track. This purposefully We fully recognize that the above considers new construction and that expansion and repairs have differing factors. What is important is that when considering new opportunities or major repairs with the existing paradigm shifts, the rough concepts offer clear rule-of-thumb guidance. Continuing, a table shown next outlines expenditures for highways, railroads and airports. 40 year yearly average.Clearly, investment in rail even with its strong competitive advantages, lags significantly.In addition, freight rail, on average, is three to four times more fuel-efficient than trucks with a single freight train can replace several hundred trucks.With comparisons in tow, now enters change, that ever-present constant. Among a multitude of the possible, two or more systemic shifts approach. First, . This will also spread into diesel. A slide estimating future demand follows.This critical air travel factor, fuel,  perhaps four to eight times higher, will drive air travel cost significantly higher. In today's environment, fuel costs equal  ticket price. This will be a paradigm shift. Again, this type of change isn't reserved just to passengers but will hit freight through increases coming through the capacity-driven need for renewable diesel. We could write about demand and the availability of fossil resources, but this comment suffices. The likelihood for  doesn't exist, if the EIA is correct.A second systemic change, increased  through increased demand continues. This natural law appears often and across all businesses. A prime example was the long-time contentious battle between Apple's  culture of developing highly specialized products vs. Intel's  drive to cheaply create a one solution fits all. In the early period with lower volumes, Intel reigned. With changes in technology coupled with budding volumes, Apple jettisoned into the lead. The same principle applies with transportation.A sampling of America's geographical and social landscape illustrates the next shift. A glaring example followsThe advent of compressed air conditioning in the 60s played an enabling role. Drastic divisions in political ideology now influences a second. This structural change forces reallocation of assets.Continuing, with the higher projected fuel costs coupled with geopolitical tensions, a return in American manufacturing naturally accompanies. Local manufacturing drives a different freight networking strategy from the now vision of picking up massive volumes at ports and transport for as long as possible. This willFinally, on growth,  The Federal Highway Administration  that total U.S. freight movements will rise 30  over the next fifteen years. With the above systemic changes, we wonder if this is .Thus far, our discussion centered completely with freight. Excluding passenger mispresents the truer picture. An interest in passenger rail surged in recent years. Some believe it is essential in managing climate change. We aren't so certain. But even outside of the climate belief,  With this in mind, at least two common themes merge  ensuring the legal ability to reclaim abandoned ROWs and gaining significant government aid for adding capacity. A good example for reclaiming abandoned ROW is the Spokane, Portland   Seattle's Pasco, at least through Hooper, WA main.With respect to synergy between freight and passenger, the  allocated  100B for passenger rail. Would wise freight management seek common grounds to enhance its infrastructure  Thus far, unfortunately, the answer seems an exclamation, NO, with the bitter tiff existing between majors and Amtrak outlined in our, For the long-term investor, watching for a laundry list of acceptance and patterning by management will be helpful. Our list includesOf note  we  It encompasses advantageous actions embracing future trends includingWhat  is a vision for the natural progression toward smaller unit rail-only shipping. In time, an increased viable market size will likely occur.  The majors might approach this through granting trackage rights to new or existing short lines with their natural operational flexibility .In our view, the major risk with railroads is the railroads themselves.We couldn't agree more. During the steady flowing shifts, the signs, enabling change, might be missed without careful attention coupled with the unfortunate short-term thinking.Others might dream of a differing vision, one driven by cheaper fuel alternatives. On this issue, investors must recognize the massive investment required and with it time and non-existent viable technology. Personally, we can't envision any significant penetration in the timeframe considered.Again, in our view, freight rails must  with passenger entities followed by smartly and willingly joining together, i.e. Union Pacific's, the State of Illinois', Amtrak's and the Federal Government's Illinois trackage upgrade project, being a prime example.Wise investing requires careful observations. Although this article isn't intended to focus on any one company, Norfolk Southern's vision seems leading in spite of its recent struggles. The future could be bright very bright for freight rail heading forward. The forest is now rich with younger trees ready for growth. The railroad harvest can grow especially  and embrace synergic relationships. Majors, which chose to do so, are likely to be the more lucrative long-term investments.

Energy Storage Makes Tesla Stock A Strong Buy,"Since I last detailed the energy storage division of  in my  in April, the pace of development has continued ever more rapidly.Demand for the company's commercial and residential energy products continues to surge. Tesla's manufacturingThose who continue to value Tesla as a simple auto company are failing to see the wood for the trees. As my  in January detailed, Tesla's auto business is flourishing worldwide. It is energy storage, however, which makes TSLA stock a Buy over and above its current stock trading range.The company has a number of other potential big revenue hitters in the non-auto sector. These include  Optimus,   Dojo   which alone is receiving  1 billion investment in the coming year  and Insurance. These are still only potentialThat is very speculative. In comparison, energy storage is here and now. The revenue and the growth path are apparent. The company has always stated that its energy revenues could match their auto revenues. This is becoming increasingly clear and measurable. The stock is undervalued because most observers have not recognized this fact.Tesla's growth in energy storage comes at a time of secular market growth everywhere in the world.  Wood Mackenzie, installations in Q3 in for instance the USA rose to 1.680MW 5.597 MWh. That was a 116  increase on the previous quarter. The figure would have been higher if it had not been for supply chain constraints and delays in interconnecting the grid.The Inflation Reduction Act in the USA provides for substantial funding and encouragement for the nation's transformation to renewable energy. This is small fry compared to subsidies enjoyed by the fossil fuel industry, but it is a start. By comparison an  in August estimated that fossil fuels are subsidized to the tune of  7 trillion per annum, or  13 million per minute.According to some , Tesla currently has about 30  of the global BESS  Battery Energy Storage System  market. Bearing in mind the size of the market a few years hence, it is not surprising that Tesla is ramping up huge production. It is also not surprising that those who understand the market emphasize the influence this could have on company revenues and the company stock price.CEO Elon Musk has stated that he thinks they can in the long run capture 15  of the total energy market with Megapacks. These are pictured belowThat might be typical Musk over-exuberance. However as this  detailed, if they were to capture 5  of the total energy market, that would produce an astonishing  4.2 trillion in revenue in the long term.In the whole of 2022, Tesla's auto revenues rose 40  and energy storage revenues rose 64 . The differential between the two has increased markedly in 2023 and this gap is expected to continue to increase.At the the rise in energy generation and storage revenues reached 74  year-on-year. These revenues comprised only 6  of total company revenues. That percentage is changing rapidly. Megapack business over the  has grown by 62 , by 152  and by 360 . Deployments actually increased 222 .At the earnings call Musk got it about right concerning the company's achievements, and what makes it still a good BuyEnergy storage growth will only add to the already very impressive free cash flow figures from the company.Energy storage profitability is improving while auto revenues profit margins are in fact declining somewhat. Its revenue is growing much more rapidly than the admittedly healthy auto business, but that does have a measurable glass ceiling.My  in February detailed how the planned 40GWh capacity of the new Megapack plant to  in Lathrop California could contribute about  20 billion of revenue annually  by comparison, the company's auto revenues in 2022 were  81.462 billion . That  20 billion would equate to the sale of approximately 570,000 Model 3 autos. For comparison, in Q2 this year the company sold 466,140 cars.The company is  a similarly sized Megapack factory in Shanghai. This will be fully up and running sometime in 2024. The resultant 80 GWh of capacity would provide Tesla with revenue value of  40 billion and profits of  10 billion.This forward-thinking capital expenditure is based on solid grounds. A  expects capacity of 1.143GWh by 2020 by which time the market size will have increased 15-fold. Tesla intends to remain one of the market leaders in this transition and is perfectly placed to do so.When Lathrop and the new China factory are both fully up and running, this should produce an immediate  40 billion in sales and  10 billion in profits. Already current lead-times for Megapack are about 18 months to 2 years ahead.The 50 50 split between autos and energy is no longer a pipe-dream. At the  call Management had stated that stationary storage growth would  significantly  exceed auto growth. This aim continues to be the case and one can see a clear road map towards it. The company expect energy storage margins to reach mid 20  range, about the same as autos. The aspiration is to reach this margin in 2023, but perhaps the more likely expectation should be to reach this in 2024.The projects keep rolling in. Sceptics say these are one-off low-profit projects, but they are mistaken and they leave out software from their calculations. The company expects 20 years of ongoing revenue from the  Powerhub  monitoring and control software for each project. This package comprises  Autobidder,   Opticaster,  and  Microgridder  programs. Although such matters are confidential between supplier and customer, this detailed  reckons the software revenue for Tesla will amount to approximately 5  of the project value.Credits that will come from the U.S Government's program under the Inflation Reduction Act will add to the profitability.One might summarize the following advantages that Megapack has over the competition High efficiency. Fast and easy installation. Optimization of land use. State of the art software integration and management. Easy integration with solar.Some recent projects include Eveco 53 MW  using 53 Megapacks  value about  84 million . CS Energy 100 MW  Australia using 80 Megapacks  value about  128 million . Sierra Estrella , which will be the largest in that State. It is thought that the Megapack value could be as much as  300 million though exact numbers have not been confirmed in public. NGEN Smart Grid System at  the largest such project in Austria so far, at 10MW. It is worth about  16 million to Tesla. Cranberry Point Energy Storage   Medway Grid projects in These are thought to involve approximately 300 Megapacks  value about US 480 million . in Australia. The latest to be awarded is the 197 MW Collie Battery in Western Australia for AEMO. The country's largest project manager in this field, Neoen, has worked on 6 projects together with Tesla. Currently they are installing on the 200 MW and Blyth Battery and the 200 MW Western Downs Battery. Tesla and Neoen originally worked together on the famous  world's largest battery  project at Hornsdale. Tesla's software integration abilities are a central driver of the co-operation of the two companies.In an indication of faith in their own products, the company is installing 68 Megapacks at their own  plant. This is thought to have a power of about 131 MW.This list is by no means intended to be comprehensive but to give an idea of the types and global reach. An interesting site, ,  gives a more comprehensive picture of this. They identify projects amounting to 5,204 MW 12725 MWh.Earlier this year it was confirmed that the company had installed over half a million residential Powerwalls. VPP's around the world are gaining pace. Even in fossil fuel-based Texas, customers are reducing bills by about one-third by participating in VPP's. These provide much needed grid support to ERCOT  Electric Reliability Council of Texas  with the ability for bidirectional charging. As extreme weather becomes more frequent due to climate change, VPP back-up to often-creaking utilities becomes crucial.The regulatory framework from State to State is about the only impediment to more rapid business which in actuality financially benefits both the utility and consumer. This seems to suddenly be changing.In Colorado recently, utility   set up a VPP scheme, open to households using products from Tesla or SolarEdge  NASDAQ. Xcel is active in 8 different States, and this move shows how U.S. utilities are finally actioning large-scale VPP's after some years of trials.One forward-thinking utility that has already accrued clear benefits is Green Mountain Development Corp.  of Vermont. They have had a  since 2015 of gradually bringing Powerwall users into a VPP. It has been so successful that it is now being opened up fully statewide. Just with 4,800 residences, it has built up 27 MWh capacity and enabled the utility not to have to invest large capex in new generating capacity. The utility and the residence owners have both saved substantial amounts. It is a win-win game. Vermont now expects to have 100  renewable power by 2030 at the latest.Australia is where Tesla got the VPP project business off the ground, and they continue to grow the South Australia VPP. This is shown . The long-term aim is to have 50,000 homes in the VPP there. That alone would provide 250 MW of solar energy and 650 MWh of battery storage capacity and have a value of perhaps  5 billion on the basis of  10,000 per Powerwall.In California, VPP's are established and have  strongly in the past year, as the graphic below showsThis shows even faster growth than California's , as illustrated belowTesla-based VPP's are expanding worldwide. They are only constrained by the company's ability to supply product. As with Megapacks, waiting times are up to 2 years for product. As Tesla's capacity has built up, and as they no longer need to prioritize autos over storage, revenue figures will rise very rapidly.It was recently that Tesla are setting up a VPP in Puerto Rico. There are already about 50,000 units there, much of it from Elon Musk's charitable assistance to the country following the weather catastrophe of recent years.There have been  of a major drive for the use  and potential manufacture  of Tesla Powerwalls in India. This has not been either confirmed or denied by the parties involved. It would be highly beneficial in a country where blackouts are frequent and where there is huge production of polluting coal-based plants.In the UK, Tesla received a license in 2020 to be an electricity generator to complete with established players like Octopus. They have recently been on a recruitment drive to go full out as a This comes at a time when what would be the complementary auto division has been seeing soaring sales in the country. It may well be that Tesla will do this in country after country as and when their autos have sold well  which is virtually every country in Europe in 2023 .In fact, world leader after world leader seems to want to meet Musk to discuss investments. For example Musk has  with President Erdogan to discuss facilities for both autos and energy storage.As with the Megapack, there is a substantial order backlog for the Powerwall. Tesla's plans to ramp up production have not been itemized as clearly as for the Megapack, but the ramp-up has begun. There will be a more powerful  coming online in the coming months. Tesla's ability to supply, and the whole pace of the inevitable transition to renewables, could be slowed down by insufficient supply of minerals such as lithium and nickel. The dominance of Asia, especially China, in the market as explained  could be a problem. However Tesla's increased investments in Asia could stand them in good stead against the competition and are no doubt a reason for Musk's recent push in the continent and meetings with political leaders in India and Indonesia.Lithium battery power might get superseded by other battery technologies. Unknown possible world economic or political crises that can hamper an international giant like Tesla.The future of energy is a picture of renewables replacing fossil fuels. Storage is the natural concomitant of renewable sources such as wind and solar. EVs are the critical way in which greenhouse gases can be reduced and air quality improved. The two complementary technologies are growing together hand-in-hand and Tesla are leading players in both.Storage, though, will in my opinion come close to matching autos in revenue in the medium term. By next year, the Megapack production should provide revenue potential of  40 billion. This compares to total revenue for the company in 2022 of  81.5 billion. The 50 50 divide between autos and energy is now foreseeable long term, as the growth picture for renewables is far greater than that for autos.Tesla's capital investment in storage and their strong share of the market should enable the company to remain at the forefront. It makes their stock very attractively priced, as the current price is based mainly on auto revenues. The long-term future for substantial growth may lie with storage. Other new areas outlined above may of course also contribute substantially long term, but they are by no means certainties in my opinion.Energy storage is without doubt a rapidly growing worldwide market. It seems to be unstoppable due to worldwide secular trends. The benefits to Tesla, Inc.'s revenue and are cash flow may come sooner than expected. As outlined in this article, for Megapack alone this should amount to  40 billion in sales and  10 billion in profits within a couple years. That is very likely to have a strongly bullish effect on Tesla's stock price.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Energy Transfer: Still A Solid 8.84% Opportunity Despite Recent Price Run-Up,"  is one of the largest midstream partnerships in the United States, boasting a network of pipelines and related infrastructure that stretches over most of the nation.This has proven to beThat has not prevented Energy Transfer from proving to be a very good investment for its unitholders recently, however. As regular readers may recall, we last  EnergyThis may not be entirely caused by rising energy prices, although that is almost certainly a factor. As I have pointed out in various articles over the past few weeks, the mood of the market has recently changed to one of impatience. Investors are no longer willing to wait years  or decades  to earn cash flow from the assets in their portfolios. In today s high-rate environment, their interest has shifted to those companies that boast strong cash flows and can deliver money right now. Energy Transfer currently boasts an 8.84  yield, so it certainly meets this requirement. In fact, this yield is sufficiently high to beat the yield of the S P 500 Index as well as the yield of the Alerian MLP Index .This strong recent performance does not necessarily mean that the units have gotten ahead of themselves, however. Let us investigate this and see if buying Energy Transfer still makes sense today.As stated in the introduction, Energy Transfer is one of the largest midstream master limited partnerships in the United States, boasting a network of pipelines, storage facilities, natural gas liquids fractionators, natural gas processing plants, and terminals. The company even has a liquefied natural gas regasification plant. Overall, its infrastructure can be found in many states in the eastern and central states, although it is somewhat less common along the Pacific Coast.This is not especially surprising, as there are very few midstream companies with operations in California. This is mostly due to California regulations requiring a special formulation of refined products for sale in the state. As a result, there are no crude oil or refined products pipelines going into the state, and most midstream companies have just shunned the entire Pacific Coast as a result.As mentioned earlier, it is quite possible that the strong performance of Energy Transfer s units in the market over the past few months has been at least partially driven by strengthening energy prices. This chart shows the cash price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil against Energy Transfer s unit price since August 3, 2023We can obviously see a correlation here, as the two charts move almost in lockstep. However, Energy Transfer s cash flows have very little to do with oil prices. As I explained in my last article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer expects that approximately 90  of its 2023 adjusted EBITDA  a proxy for pre-tax cash flow  will come from these volume-based contractsThus, the company s financial performance is largely dictated by the volume of resources that it transfers, not their value. As such, its cash flow is not really impacted by energy prices. We can see this cash flow stability by looking at the company s adjusted EBITDA over the past few yearsIt cannot be denied that oil prices were all over the place during those years. In particular, the average price of West Texas Intermediate was  39.68 per barrel in 2020,  68.17 per barrel in 2021, and  94.53 per barrel in 2022. The year-to-date average for 2023 is  77.90 per barrel and Energy Transfer s annualized adjusted EBITDA is  13.110 billion. Thus, we can immediately see that energy prices have virtually no impact on the company s adjusted EBITDA despite what the market seems to believe.With that said, there could be some optimism that the volume of resources that the company transports will increase as energy prices do. After all, there is a certain logic behind the belief that American shale producers will increase their production in order to take advantage of rising energy prices. However, as I have discussed in a few recent posts to Energy Profits in Dividends, it is unlikely that this will be the case. As the Wall Street Journal I pointed this out in a few articles published over the past two years in various shale companies as well. Basically, due to investor complaints about the industry s underperformance over most of the past decade, shale companies are largely opting to simply keep their production stable and pay out the majority of their cash flows to investors. Thus, it is unlikely that Energy Transfer s volumes will increase substantially due to shale producers increasing their output along with energy prices.This does not mean that Energy Transfer has no near-term to mid-term growth opportunities, just that the company will probably not see the volume growth that the market expects. For example, there are still significant growth opportunities in the natural gas space, as energy producers are constructing an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas production capacity over the next few years. Indeed, the nation s consumption of natural gas is expected to increase by 20 billion cubic feet per day by 2027, approximately 14 billion cubic feet of which comes from new liquefied natural gas production facilities that are scheduled to come online over the periodEnergy Transfer is engaged in some growth projects to take advantage of this situation. For example, the company stated recently that it is investigating the possibility of constructing a new natural gas processing plant in the Permian Basin due to strong customer demand.This is in addition to the 200 million cubic feet-per-day Bear processing plant that the company brought online in June. The company also has a number of natural gas pipelines under construction that are meant to increase its ability to meet the growing demand for natural gas domestically, as numerous utilities are replacing coal power plants with renewables supplemented by natural gas plants.After all, wind and solar are not capable of meeting electric demand on their own with current technology  and batteries are nowhere near sufficient to provide sufficient backup capacity . It is fortunate that Energy Transfer is reasonably well diversified and has long had a substantial presence in the natural gas space to allow it to take advantage of this growth potential. Indeed, as we can see here, the company s cash flows are quite well diversified between crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquidsMost of its forward growth will almost certainly come from the natural gas and natural gas liquids segments, but that is okay as the company should still have much greater growth potential than some other midstream companies that exclusively focus on crude oil or refined products.Energy Transfer could soon increase its presence in the natural gas space significantly by acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners . The company  on August 16, 2023, that it is planning to acquire Crestwood Equity Partners in an all-stock deal. From the press releaseAs of right now, Crestwood Equity Partners  common units are trading at  28.60 each and Energy Transfer s units are at  14.06 per share. Thus, the proposed ratio assigns a value of  29.10 to Crestwood s common units. That is a 1.75  premium today, which is not really much, but the premium was higher when this deal was announced.This deal will certainly enhance Energy Transfer s capabilities in the Bakken Shale, as Crestwood Equity Partners is one of the largest midstream operators in that region. Crestwood Equity Partners also has a gathering and processing business in the Powder River Basin, which is an area in which Energy Transfer currently has no presence at allEnergy Transfer, meanwhile, has the takeaway capacity and long-haul pipelines that Crestwood Equity Partners lacks. Overall, I can certainly understand why Energy Transfer wants to do this deal. Ultimately, it could work out quite well for the company as it allows the combined firm to offer a  one-stop service  for customers in the Bakken Shale. Crestwood s substantial gathering and processing operation in that region can handle that need for the customers and then Energy Transfer s long-haul pipelines can move it to where it is needed.As separate entities, neither company can offer both services to customers. Crestwood Equity Partners is also more natural gas-focused than Energy Transfer, so this acquisition should weight Energy Transfer s business a bit more towards gas. As that is where the strongest growth is, that is certainly a positive thing.Unlike my rather scathing  on ONEOK s  acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners, this one has some clear synergy and will probably benefit Energy Transfer. The only real downside for Crestwood Equity Partners unitholders is that Energy Transfer has a lower yield so they could lose some income. Hopefully, Energy Transfer s growth will be stimulated enough by this acquisition that it can raise its distribution to compensate for the loss, but that is not certain. For the most part, though, this deal should work out to the benefit of both parties.As I pointed out in my previous article on Energy TransferEnergy Transfer has been slowly seeing its interest expenses tick up recently, although it has not been nearly as bad as companies in some other areas of the economy. We can see this hereAs we can clearly see, the company s training twelve-month interest expenses have been gradually ticking up over the past few years, although it has only been a relatively slow increase. Certainly, this is a less worrying trend than we have seen among utilities or a few other sectors. One of the biggest reasons for this is that the market has not been friendly towards midstream companies for quite some time, and Energy Transfer started focusing on strengthening its balance sheet following the COVID-19 pandemic. We still see that the company s interest expenses have been trending up, however. Thus, we should not ignore the company s balance sheet.One metric that we can use to evaluate a company s financial structure is its net debt-to-equity ratio. As of June 30, 2023, Energy Transfer had a net debt of  48.632 billion compared to  41.457 billion of partners  equity. This gives the company a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.17. Here is how that compares to some of the company s peersAs we can see here, Energy Transfer compares quite well to its peers in this respect. In particular, MPLX, which has long been one of the best-financed companies in the midstream sector, actually employs more leverage than Energy Transfer. This is a clear sign that Energy Transfer is not employing too much leverage right now.As I have pointed out in various articles, a midstream company s ability to carry its debt is much more important than its overall financial structure. The usual way that we judge that is by looking at the company s leverage ratio, which is also known as the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. During the twelve-month period that ended on June 30, 2023, Energy Transfer had an adjusted EBITDA of  13.080 billion.This compares to a total debt of  48.962 billion as of June 30, 2023. That gives the company a leverage ratio of 3.74x, which is very reasonable. As I have pointed out before, Wall Street analysts usually consider anything below 5.0x to be reasonable. However, most companies have been working to reduce their leverage since the crash in energy prices in 2020. As such, most midstream companies now have a leverage ratio that is below 4.0x, which is the maximum level that I typically like to see. As we can clearly see, Energy Transfer easily meets this criterion.When we consider that the company s net debt-to-equity ratio compares reasonably well to its peers and that its leverage ratio is very attractive, we can quickly see that the company enjoys a very strong balance sheet. There is really not very much for us to worry about here. The company s finances are quite strong.In conclusion, Energy Transfer continues to be a good holding for those investors who desire to earn a high level of income from their portfolios while still enjoying some growth potential. Admittedly, it is somewhat unlikely that the nation s upstream energy producers will deliver growth that is anywhere close to what some market participants expect, but there are still sufficient opportunities in the natural gas space for Energy Transfer to deliver volume growth.The pending acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners is interesting, and it should significantly enhance Energy Transfer LP s potential to deliver natural gas midstream growth to the unitholders. The company continues to maintain relatively strong finances and pays a very attractive 8.84  distribution yield. Overall, this company looks like a very solid purchase today.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone.

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question.And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.Good morning, Bryan.So my question is just around volume. There's been a lot of focus on that topic, not just for Pepsi, but just, I think, more broadly. So I know in the prepared remarks, there's a little bit -- there's some commentary about a shift to small packs. But maybe, Ramon, if you could touch on what was happening specifically volumetrically for PBNA in the quarter  And then kind of relative to what your outlook was for volumes coming out of 2Q, just how that might have evolved as the quarter progressedYeah, good morning, Bryan. Let me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement, if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically, how we're thinking about how we're managing the company, there's two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands. And the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing act. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing.In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume. And we're seeing that -- you mentioned consumers moving to smaller packs. We're also, in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mix strategy. And then we're obviously optimizing margin that, as you saw it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin.When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization. And we've made some decisions, especially around take home water that we're able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business, and that has almost 2.5 points of volume impact.So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plants and some others that unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metrics that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume, net revenue and margin expansion.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.Great. Thanks. Good morning. Carrying on Bryan's question, but taking it a little bit further out into 2024, and it was great to get kind of some preliminary perspective on next year, so early. But I was also curious how you're thinking about that balancing volume and price mix as we go into next year because price mix has continued to outperform  And so just kind of thinking about that more forward look as well. Thanks.Yes, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics. But what I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans and our productivity plans and our cost trends that there will be still a higher inflation in our business. And therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think, '24 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years.Yes. So right, to add a finer point to Ramon's comments, Lauren, if you think of pre-pandemic inflation being kind of in that 2 , 3  range, inflation is going to be a little elevated relative to that. And our pricing will be roughly in line with inflation. So that should at least give you a rough sense as to how things might shake out.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Thank you. Good morning. So going back to your comments about volumes in PBNA. Was that specific to the quarter or should we still see about this 2.5  headwind to volumes you quoted and potentially into the first half of 2024  And if you can also comment on the volumes in Latin America, so how we should be thinking towards the end of the year and potentially into 2024  Thank you.Yes, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a few -- a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions. And we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and the balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA.Now when it comes to LatAm, there is mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that this possible income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size -- portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable. And that has a repercussion on -- has an impact on the actual volume.But again, the transactions are much healthier. And that's a metric that we used to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer along with brand equity and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their disposable income.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Hey, guys. Good morning. Could you just discuss the motivation behind the decision to provide guidance for 2024 a bit earlier than is typical  What do you think your level of visibility is at this point versus a typical year  And as you look out maybe what are some of the areas that give you confidence and what might be some of the areas where there's more uncertainty particularly given the volatile consumer environment here  Thanks.Hi, Dara. I can answer that one. I think in general, as we build the plans, we're focused on a couple of things. Number one is obviously the level of commodity inflation, and you know we buy forward about nine months. So that's roughly in line with the past.Number two is the balance of the PepsiCo cost structure. And as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we've put even higher focus than we've had in the past on driving productivity and driving out unnecessary costs using the tools that we've discussed, the investments in digitalization, the investments in global business services, the investments in driving out overlaps within the organization. Because that work has been going on for a longer period of time, I think, that gave us earlier line of sight into what we would expect our cost outcome to be for next year.And then number three, we're in a good spot in many of the developed markets in terms of our commercial plans. We do joint business planning with our customers. And we're probably in line to maybe even a little ahead of where we've been historically with all of that. So given the information was available to us a little bit earlier and given there was undoubtedly questions in the investment community on what '24 look like given the evolving pricing and inflationary environment, we thought it was prudent to at least give some indication of what guidance would look like in '24. So that's what drove the decision.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I actually wanted to follow-up on Dara's question there. But just more in the context of your actual performance versus your initial expectations historically because it's really been a while since organic revenue growth has actually fallen short of your initial outlook. So can you maybe just characterize your confidence in the '24 outlook at this stage and really whether or not you've embedded enough conservatism just given what remains a pretty choppy backdrop for the consumer  Thanks.Sure. Happy to address that. We obviously have a long history here of meeting or exceeding expectations, both our internal expectations as well as the guidance, including this quarter, where we beat revenue and we beat EPS. In fact, we've now met or beat consensus for 55 straight quarters. So we tend to be, I think, appropriately conservative in the way that we communicate to you all. So from that perspective I think you can go into 2024 with a similar expectation that we should at least achieve the numbers that we've laid out for you.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hugh, I was hoping maybe you can just provide some of the macro underpinnings that kind of go into your 2024 viewpoints at this point  Just would love to kind of get your state of the union on the consumer or the economy and kind of how you guys are thinking that will shape up as you go through 2024  Thanks.Sure. Why don't I start and then Ramon, obviously, you're super deep on the consumer as well, but I'm happy to start on this one. Number one, I do think that we see the consumer right now being more selective, and you see it in a variety of ways, right  You see some trade down in terms of channels of trade that they're purchasing products in. You see some orientation toward value. At the same time, the things that I usually look at with the consumer to detect whether there's high stress, we see good results, Nik.Number one is the convenience store channel. Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5  in beverages and 8  in foods in the convenience channel.Number two is food service, that's also typically a leading indicator, that's still growing double digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year.Yes. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, et cetera, that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, they move from package-to-package. All those things will continue, and they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories, then obviously, we have almost completed. By now, our innovation plans, our commercial plans are -- I think we've got better at affordability and premiumization of our portfolio. So we think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Again, Bonnie Herzog, your line is open, and if you have a question, go ahead and ask it. It looks like they didn't have a question, do you want me to go and move on to the next personYes, please.Okay. Sure thing. One moment. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning.Good morning, Chris.The inflation got a bit worse quarter-over-quarter in the PBNA segment, specifically, whereas in the rest of the segments, the trend is for continued easing. Can you just comment on some of the puts and takes that you're seeing from a commodity inflation standpoint in this segment, particularly and how the beverage side is driving the inflation expectations going into next year relative to food  I'm really speaking to Hugh's comments on above average inflation next year. And just given what we see from commodities in general, I'm trying to parse out where exactly that outlook is coming from  So thanks so much.Yes. Good morning, Chris. Chris, we don't get into by commodity levels of dissecting the numbers and guidance. That's something that historically we haven't done. As you know, the beverage segment is a little more packaging exposed in foods is just by virtue of the nature of the products. But I'd rather not go any further than that to get into the specifics of individual commodities for competitive reasons.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.Great. Thank you very much. I just want to shift a little bit more kind of to the long-term. And I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a sense of the vision, your vision for the business, the beverage business and the food business in the US in light of your large investment in Instacart what you're trying to accomplish there  And other kind of strategic moves you're doing on the digital side and the -- all the underlying work that you're doing in terms of automation and productivity. Just kind of what do you see the business looking like in the future  And how does Instacart play into it  Thank you.Yes. Good question. Obviously, as Hugh was saying, we continue to drive the transformation of the business with automation at the center of it and digitalization as well. With digitalization, we're trying to obviously give much more precision to our decision-making across everything we do from how we talk to consumers, how we invest in our pricing with our customers  How we run our end-to-end operations from agro to the consumers  How we run our routing and everything all these activities that we do to generate value for our consumers. That is an investment we've been making over time. And we continue -- that still is the priority of the company to make the company more precise on intelligence and empower our front line to make better decisions all the time with the best information possible real-time and ideally forward information. So that is a continuous investment. Now when it comes to Instacart, there is a commercial relationship trying to enhance the capabilities of our DSD system with the shoppers that they have in store, and that is a continuous focus. I think DSD continues to be a competitive advantage. And I think we can enhance that capability with supporting activities from the Instacart shoppers. And that commercial relation led to a very minor investment in Instacart. And just to reinforce the commitment to the commercial relationship, there's nothing more than that in terms of a strategic long-term intentionality with that investment.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Hey, thanks. Two questions, if I could. One, just following up on the 24 outlook given the visibility you have on cost and the commercial planning at this point. Should we be expecting a relatively even performance and cadence of growth, both top and bottom line throughout the year  Or is there a reason to see that growth weighted first half versus second half  And then I did want to ask on Gatorade because the improvement we saw this quarter sequentially volumetrically did occur. It just didn't occur at quite the level of improvement that we were expecting from a shipment perspective. I think we went from down high single digits in the second quarter to down mid in the third. So I just would love some perspective on how you view that business performing  Thank you.Listen, we will not go into more details on '24. We'll cover that in February in due June time. When it comes to Gatorade, we're very pleased with the G2DSD or the movement of Gatorade to the DSD platform over the summer. We're seeing sequential improvement in the performance of the brand. Better performance in August that we saw early in the summer, et cetera, inventory on display and a number of secondary location, et cetera. So that move is working. On the velocity of the brand, we also saw that the brand is improving its velocity. It is true that the emergence of Prime in the category took some share from Gatorade less than other brands in the category or less proportionally to the size of the brand. But I would say Prime impacted Gatorade in a way some transactions during the peak of the season. We're seeing that the size of Prime in the category getting smaller as we go into the fall, which gives us very good optimism that with the new infrastructure we have with our DSD business, some of the innovation with GFit, Gatorlyte, G Zero, our powders and tablets that are being very well received by consumers that we have a very good you know we're going to have a very good '24 for Gatorade. So we have a stronger foundation to go into next year with potentially weaker competition. But obviously, I don't know what their plans are.Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.Hey, good morning, everyone. So, clearly, there's been a lot of concern in the market around adoption of GLP-1 drugs in the US and the potential impact on your business. So maybe can you comment a bit of what you've seen so far based on your consumer studies, both on the beverage and food side  And how you're thinking that can evolve over the next couple of years, change in consumer behaviors  And then from a Pepsi-specific standpoint, what changes can you make to adopt your portfolio to these new consumer preferences that could emerge if the adoption is greater than that  Thank you.Thank you, Filippo. Good question. Listen, obviously, we're looking at this you know along with many other positive and negative potential risk for our business and our category. So far, the impact is negligible in our business. Overall, if you take global consumption, there are obviously a lot of question marks with regards to the obesity drugs when it comes to medical testing or scalability of the usage of this or what is the impact really on consumer choices. So a lot of question marks. We continue to believe that all the structural positive trends that we had to our categories remain, and I mentioned, I referred to that earlier in the conversation. So we're seeing urbanization as a big driver of adoption of our categories. We're seeing middle class development. We're seeing lifestyle and the people snacking to eat, some meals becoming more mini-meals and much more unstructured during the day, being a big driver of our categories, both beverages and snacks. So we're seeing a lot of tailwinds that will continue to drive our categories. Of course, we're observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. The other thing we're looking at is our strategy sound when it comes to portfolio transformation. And everything we've been doing for the last five, six years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it. Obviously, it's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today, a lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid and even we see them accelerating. And our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to a potential protection against some of these future developments 5, 10 years from now.Thank you. Our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. One moment.Good morning. A question for you on the North American Beverage business. You've said in the past your goal is to hold share in that business. When you begin to add things like CELSIUS as an organic business, I'd love to hear how you assess the beverage performance and you're looking to hold share with the own portfolio or you distributed brand as a component to hold share  Thanks.Yes. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. CELSIUS obviously is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars and our ability to distribute in our system, some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, CELSIUS continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of CELSIUS in our track makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store and those are all positive that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio. So I don't know if I'm answering the question because really I couldn't -- we couldn't hear it very well. But I guess you get a sense of the importance of CELSIUS in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio.Okay.

Fujitsu Limited (FJTSF) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Fujitsu Limited  Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 26, 2023 2 00 AM ETTakahito Tokita - CEOThank you for this opportunity. I would like to give you an FY 2023 Second Quarter Consolidated Financial Results Overview.Please turn to Page 3. This is the financial highlights for the first half of fiscal 2023. The most important segment is Service Solutions where revenue was  984.1 billion. Excluding the impact of divestiture of PFU, this was a strong increase of 13.6  from the prior year. Primarily, for business in Japan, results were driven by strong demand for DX and modernization, and there was also a strong rise in orders. Adjusted operating profit was  63.4 billion, a solid rise of  44.4 billion year-on-year. Because of the positive impact of higher revenue and progress as planned in improving profitability such as from the transformation in the delivery of services.On the other hand, with continued lower demand in device solutions since the second half of last fiscal year, revenue on a consolidated basis was   1,711,800 million an increase of only 2.7  excluding restructuring. Adjusted operating profit was  50.7 billion, a decrease of  24 billion year-on-year.Page 4 shows an overview of the financial results for each business segment. I will discuss the results of each segment starting with the next slide. And on this slide, you can see an overview of the segments. At the very top is Service Solutions, our growth driver gaining further momentum from Q1 revenue and Q2 also expanded significantly  PFU was included in the consolidated results until the first half of the previous fiscal year, but excluding the impact of restructuring, total revenue the first half increased by  117.6 billion.On the other hand, hardware solutions, which includes network products and device solutions, which ifSlide 5 and on results for each segment. Page 6, Service Solutions. Revenue for the first halfAs a result, there was a greater demand for consulting services, modernization projects and cloud migration support. Fujitsu Uvance was able to take advantage of this robust demand with a 63  increase in revenue. Adjusted operating profit was  63.4 billion, up  44.4 billion year-on-year. Although we increased growth investments related to Fujitsu Uvance, because of the impact of strongly higher revenue and measures to improve profitability. Operating profit rose significantly. I will explain the components of this increase in profits with the waterfall chart later on.Since the breakdown of results by quarter. The red line graph shows revenue growth. The blue bar is adjusted operating profit. Revenue rose by 10  in Q1 and in Q2, even higher by 17 . For adjusted operating profit as well. The scale of the increase in profit rose from Q1 to Q2 with an adjusted OP margin up 8.2  in Q2. There was also a large increase in adjusted operating profit year-on-year in the first half. Page 8. This chart shows the factors that caused increases or decreases in the first half adjusted OP in Service Solutions compared to the prior year. On the far left, adjusted OP for the first half of fiscal 2022,  19 billion. I will use this as the starting point to explain.The first is positive impact of  37.4 billion in part because of a solid increase in revenue in Fujitsu Uvance, total services solutions revenue also rose 13.6 . Second, an increase of  19.3 billion from improved profitability. We continue to make progress and expanded use of Global Delivery Centuries and standardization in development work and other initiatives to improve productivity. The impact of higher employee costs was covered by profitability improvements entirely or in whole.Third is a decline of  12.3 billion from higher expenses, primarily investments in growth areas. We actively made investments in areas that directly promote business growth such as development of future events offerings and investments in employee training and development and enhanced security. Adding these up, adjusted operating profit for Service Solutions for the first half of fiscal 2023 was  63.4 billion. As you can see in the far-right corner. Page 9. I will now provide supplemental information on each of factors in the previous waterfall chart. This is the status of orders in the first half of fiscal 2023 which led to the increase in revenue. This page shows orders in Japan. Domestic orders increased continuously during the first and second quarters, resulting in an 18  increase over the first half over the prior year. In every industry segment, we achieved double-digit growth in the first half. I will now comment on each industry segment.In the Private Enterprise business segment, orders were up 11  year-on-year. Momentum for growth in Q2 exceeded that of Q1. Primarily for modernization projects, growth was driven by customers in the Manufacturing and Mobility sectors. In the finance business segment, orders were up 23 . In addition to deals to upgrade mission critical systems for MegaBank and Insurance Institutions, we also won modernization project deals, resulting in a significant increase year-on-year.In Public and Healthcare segment, orders were up 27 . We won multiple modernization deals for upgraded systems for government agencies among customers in the healthcare industry as well. We are seeing a revival investments in electronic medical record systems and healthcare information systems. Below that is mission critical, orders were up 12 .Orders benefited from a project including a systems integration project in the National Security field. In our business in Japan, because of strong demand that has continued from Q1, order backlog is increasing and that will lead to higher revenue in the second half. Page 10 shows orders in regions, international. Trends in orders differed by region. Orders for Europe declined by 27 , reflecting a pullback from the large-scale public sector deals we won in the prior year. Orders in the Americas increased by 81  as we won multiple private sector business application deals in North America. This is a big rise over the prior year. Orders for Asia Pacific were down by 1 . Despite a slight pullback from the large-scale public-sector deals in the prior year, overall demand was solid. Page 11 shows the progress of Fujitsu Uvance, which we are positioning as the most vital area for the growth of our business and the transformation of our business portfolio. Fujitsu Uvance consist of a total of -- vertical areas which are cost industry areas that solve societal issues and horizontal areas which are technical performance that support the vertical areas. There are a total of 7.Overall, revenue in the first half increased by 63  year-on-year to  153.7 billion. This is a pace that may enable us to exceed our Fujitsu Uvance full year revenue target of  300 billion. in the first half of the last fiscal year, Fujitsu Uvance accounted for 10  of total Services Solutions revenue, but that increased to 16  in the first half of this fiscal year. In supplementary materials, we include information on the status of orders, which are extremely positive, up 70  in the first half compared to the prior year.In the second half, primarily in the vertical areas, we will launch multiple offerings that enable customers to achieve FX sustainability transformation. In addition, in the horizontal areas in continuation from Q1, for what we call the three business applications consisting primarily of SAP, ServiceNow and Salesforce, there is still high demand. We are clearly growing our of Fujitsu Uvance business, which is the key to our growth in our medium-term management plan.Page 12, I will now comment on profitability improvements and the status of growth investments. Profitability increased by  19.3 billion and gross margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year-on-year. Through the Japan Global Gateway, JGG and Global Delivery centers, we are making steady progress in the standardization of development work, automation, expansion of in-house work and use of offshoring.The usage ratio of JGG has increased from 30  in fiscal 2022 to 34  in the first half fiscal 2023. On the right-hand side, growth investments and expenses increased by  12.3 billion increase in expense. Including development of Fujitsu Uvance offerings, investment needed to develop with specialist talent and investment to strengthen our security, we continue to proactively invest in areas directly related to business growth. This concludes my supplemental explanation of the increases and decreases in profit outlined in the chart on Page 8.From Page 13, I will briefly touch on the status of each sub segment in service solutions. First go with Global Solutions. Revenue was  217.7 billion, up 18.2  from the prior year. On an adjusted basis, the sub segment posted an operating loss of  2.6 billion, but it is an improvement of  10.8, compared to the loss in the prior year. Fujitsu Uvance experienced faster than anticipated growth and large-scale sales of software supporting modernization also drove revenue growth.We are currently in a phase of making aggressive growth investments. But in addition to the impact of higher revenue, profitability is also steadily improving which resulted in a large decline in losses. In regions Japan, revenue from continuing operation was  571.1 billion, up 11.9  from the previous year. The adjusted operating profit was  72.2 billion, an increase of  36.5 billion and, roughly two times the level of previous fiscal year.The number of DX business deals and upgrades of mission critical systems is increasing in wide range of sectors, primarily in the public and healthcare sectors. In addition to the impact of higher revenue, we made steady progress in improving profitability. In regions international, operating profit was  288.4 billion, up 9.4  against the backdrop of foreign exchange movements. On an adjusted basis, the sub segment posted an operating loss of  6.2 billion, a deterioration of  2.8 billion from the previous year.In terms of profitability, the conditions that continue to be difficult primarily in Europe. Page 14. I will first comment on hardware solutions on the upper portion. Revenue for the first half of fiscal 2023 was  477.5 billion, a decrease of 3.7  from the prior fiscal year. The adjusted operating profit was  17.4 billion down  3.5 billion from the prior year.In system products, the impact of higher component procurement costs came from the previous fiscal year was resolved, and along with the upgrade projects for our customers' mission critical systems, there was also higher demand for server and storage systems. On the other hand, in network products, there was a large pullback from the strong demand of the previous fiscal year in both Japan and North America, resulting in drop in revenue. For this fiscal year's network products, in the midst of a decrease in sales due to large scale demand cycle, we are expanding our development investments for the next growth cycle, including our investments to achieve high speed, high capacity, low latency and low energy consumption networks. On the bottom of the slide, you see ubiquitous solutions. Revenue was  130.7 billion down 1.8  from the prior year. The adjusted operating profit was  9 billion up  4.6 billion from the previous fiscal year. With regard to the higher component costs, including the impact of the 4x movements, we are advancing efforts to cut costs and pass on higher cost to sales prices, and we are steadily increasing our resilience to changes in the external environment. Page 15. I will now comment on device solutions. Revenue was  142.6 billion which was 31.3 . It was a significant decrease from previous fiscal year. The adjusted operating profit was  9.3 billion down  41.8 billion from the previous fiscal year. The demand for semiconductor packaging, which had been strong through the first half of the prior fiscal year, significantly decreased in the second half of the prior fiscal year. There was a no recovery in the first half of this fiscal year and trend has continued in the first half of this year. In addition, factory operation also declined due to the reduction in volume.As a result, OP decreased significantly. We anticipate modest recovery at the end of this fiscal year, but the segment had a rough first half. On the bottom of the slide, you can see intersegment elimination and corporate. This segment posted an operating loss of  48.5 billion with a  27.6 billion increase in expenses year-on-year. We continue to expand our investments in medium to long-term business growth, including enhancing advanced research in cutting edge areas such as AI, quantum computing and energy saving processors and promoting the one Fujitsu program for enhancing our management of foundation.On Page 16, you see the status of cash flows. Core account free cash flow which excludes one off item was  91.1 billion up  27.4 billion from the previous year, primarily due to greater working capital efficiencies. At the bottom of the page, you can see the free cash flow which was  34.6 billion. During the first half of fiscal 2023, Fujitsu purchased GK Software, a German software company for the retailing industry to enhance Fujitsu Uvance offerings. As a result of cash out relating to the company's acquisition, other factors, free cash flow was down  12.6 billion from the prior fiscal year.Page 17 shows the status of our assets, liabilities and equity. I will omit an explanation of these figures. This concludes our financial results for the first half. There is not a slide for this, but I would like to share additional information about the status of our forecast for fiscal 2023. Service solutions is progressing in line with our forecast. Orders and pipeline of projected orders for this segment continued from the first quarter be strong in the second quarter, primarily in Japan and Americas which matched our forecast. Against this backdrop, our analysis shows that we can expect orders to firmly expand from the second half of the fiscal year onward. By steadily releasing Fujitsu Uvance's offerings and making progress on transforming our delivery of services through simple hard work. We believe we can expand as we planned both the volume and profitability of our business in Service Solutions, which is our growth driver.On the other hand, in Device Solutions, although we expected demand would be sluggish, it is taking longer than we originally anticipated for customers to adjust their inventory, so our sales volume did not meet our forecast. This resulted in the segment's base operating profit to fall short of our cast by several billions of yen.Starting from the next page, I will discuss our full year financial forecast. Page 19. This is our financial forecast for fiscal 2023. As I previously mentioned when planning our financial results for the first half. We anticipate that a full-scale recovery in demand of device solutions will be delayed until next fiscal year, and this change had been reflected in our financial forecast. As a result, on a consolidated basis, we are projecting revenue of  3.810 trillion with an adjusted operating profit of  320 billion and adjusted profit for the year of  208 billion. Compared to our previous forecast, the new forecast for revenue had been revised downward to  50 billion with the adjusted operating profit to  20 billion and adjusted profit for the year, revised downward by  10 billion.Page 20 is our financial forecast for fiscal year 2023 by segment. Service Solutions has experienced very strong growth during the first half, and we believe that we can achieve high range target that we have set. Our projections for hardware solutions and ubiquitous solutions at the same time as our previous forecast. The only revision was in the Device Solutions.On Page 21, we've read now our forecast for the first and second half of fiscal year '23 by segment. As I will touch upon Service Solutions. The segment posted an adjusted operating profit for first half of the fiscal '23 of  63.4 billion, up  44 billion year-on-year. For the second half of this year, we anticipate an adjusted operating profit of  109.15 billion, up  47.5 billion year-on-year. Although the trend of operating profit being concentrated in the second half of the year remains unchanged, the progress made in the first half was slightly better than the previous year. Also, we anticipate that the increase of the OP for the second half will be on par with the increased in the first half. Page 22 or free cash flow. It reflects the downward revision to operating profit for device solutions.This concludes our financial forecast for fiscal 2023. In the first half of fiscal 2023, although we saw delay in the recovery of demand for Device Solutions, Service Solutions, our main driver of growth made very strong progress in revenue and adjusted operating profit. There is some uncertainty in macroeconomic environment. So, it is impossible to make predictions, but we will work to achieve solid results for growth as we build up our current backlog of orders and maintain our current momentum against the backdrop of making progress and profitability improvements. This concludes my presentation.",0,2023-10-27T17:07:06.000-04:00
Energy Transfer: Buy This High-Yielding Stock Hand Over Fist,"While I am primarily focused on lower-yielding dividend stocks with robust growth stories ahead, I also have a slant toward deep-value stocks. This is evidenced by my coverage of super-high-yielding stocks such as Energy Transfer I have covered the stock on numerous occasions over the years here on Seeking Alpha. It also accounts for 2.5  of my total dividend distribution income, making it the fourth-biggest holding in my portfolio behind ONEOK , Verizon , and Philip Morris International .But it has been three full years since I . After rallying 131  during that time versus the 29  gains of the S P 500, readers may be wondering  Is Energy Transfer a buy, sell, or hold  If you caught the title of this article, you would know that I believe the stock is still an emphatic buy. Here's why.Few stocks evoke as much emotion from income investors as much as Energy Transfer, and deservedly so. Some people stand by the stock and some people loathe it. To suggest that the stealth distribution cuts and effective distribution cuts over the years have made for a bumpy ride is an understatement.While painful at the time, the  that was announced nearly three years ago has measurably improved Energy Transfer's fundamentals. Since that time, the company has reduced its total consolidated debt load from  51.4 billion at the end of 2020 to  48.1 billion as of June 30, 2023. On its face, this seems like no progress at all.But we need to remember that for better or worse, Energy Transfer is an empire-building company. It hasn't just sat around the last three years  these acquisitions include Enable Midstream in a  all-equity transaction in 2021, Woodford Express for  in 2022, and Lotus Midstream earlier this year for .Along with organic growth through capital projects, these deals are why Energy Transfer is expecting between  13.1 billion and  13.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023. At the  midpoint, the company's leverage ratio is under 4. For context, Energy Transfer is guiding for leverage between . This is a significant improvement versus the leverage ratio of nearly 5 back in 2020  based on  10.5 billion in 2020 adjusted EBITDA . That is why the company enjoyed a BBB credit rating from S P on a stable outlook as of August.Energy Transfer's strengthened balance sheet is one thing. But even better, the company has restored its quarterly distribution per unit beyond its pre-COVID figure of  0.305. The company's current distribution per unit is , which is expected to continue growing every quarter. Energy Transfer believes that it can deliver annual distribution per unit growth of 3  to 5 .This promise is supported by a very sustainable coverage ratio. In the last four quarters, the company has generated  2.26 in distributable cash flow per unit. Against the  1.1875 in distributions per unit paid over that time, Energy Transfer's distribution is covered 1.9 times over by DCF. This is partially why I believe after all the ups and downs unitholders have suffered, slow and steady distribution growth can finally be sustained.Given the circumstances, Energy Transfer had a decent second quarter for a business I consider to be utility-like. What do I mean  Well, the company was strong across the board. NGL fractionation volumes were up 5 , NGL transportation volumes grew by 13 , and crude transportation and terminal volumes respectively surged by 23  and 15 . According to Co-CEO Tom Long's opening remarks during the , these each represented record volumes for the business.Energy Transfer's adjusted EBITDA was down 3.3  over the year-ago period to  3.2 billion. But for lower quarterly average natural gas and NGL prices to the tune of 70  and 45  compared to the prior year's second quarter, adjusted EBITDA would have grown slightly.Energy Transfer also generated  579 million in free cash flow after distributions. This was nearly enough to cover the  603 million in combined growth and maintenance capex during the quarter, which is sustainable over the long run.Energy Transfer's executive team also still has tremendous confidence in the direction of the company. This is evidenced by  383 million of insider purchases since January 2021 by insiders and independent board members. Co-CEOs are also required to own at least 6 times their annual base salary in units, so these folks are eating their cooking. Thus, it would be in the best interest of their personal cash flow to keep the company healthy and the distribution growing.Energy Transfer looks to be doing well operationally. However, all businesses have risks that must be navigated, and there are no exceptions to this rule. This is especially true for Energy Transfer, which has over 40 pages of discussion of Risk Factors in its .Deriving about 90  of its estimated 2023 adjusted EBITDA from fee-based sources, Energy Transfer is mostly shielded from industry volatility. But the caveat is that this is only as long as its customers can continue to pay the company. If a major downturn ravages the energy industry again, Energy Transfer could encounter some counterparty risk that could hurt its results.A longer-term risk for the company is the ongoing shift of many economies from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Energy Transfer will need to adapt to this transition to be around well into this century. The good news is that because total global energy demand is only going to grow over the next few decades, Energy Transfer has plenty of time to figure this out. The company is seriously considering carbon capture and storage via its project with CapturePoint concerning its processing plants in north Louisiana. This could ultimately be a way to make the adjustments necessary to stay in business well beyond our lifetimes.Following its magnificent rally in the last three years, Energy Transfer looks like it could have even more upside ahead as it reverts to its historical fair value. The stock's 8.6  trailing distribution yield is well above its 13-year median of 6.7 . Considering Energy Transfer's fundamentals relative to the last decade, I fully believe a return to a trailing distribution yield around the median is justified.My inputs into the dividend discount model or DDM further support this argument.The first input for the DDM is the annualized distribution per unit. Energy Transfer's annualized distribution per unit is  1.24 at this time.The next input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is the annual total return rate required by an investor. My preference is for 10  annual total returns.The final input for the DDM is the annual distribution growth rate. I believe that in a conservative scenario, Energy Transfer will deliver 3  annual distribution growth over the long haul.Plugging these inputs into the DDM, I get a fair value per unit of  17.71. That means, units of Energy Transfer are trading at a 21.9  discount to fair value and offer a 28.1  upside from the current price of  13.83 a unit  as of October 10, 2023 .Some in this community aren't going to trust Energy Transfer ever again after what they have endured, and that's fine. Investing always involves risk and for those who are willing to tolerate Energy Transfer's risks, my opinion is that the rewards could be worth the risk.The company's free cash flow after distributions is enough to cover its growth and maintenance capex spending. Energy Transfer's balance sheet has finally stabilized. The company is arguably further strengthening its business via a  with Crestwood.Finally, units of Energy Transfer seem to be priced 20 -plus below my estimated fair value. The stock's 9  distribution yield, low- single-digit annual growth, and 2.5  annual valuation multiple expansion potential promise annual total returns well beyond my 10  preference for the next decade.

Williams wins $495M court verdict related to failed Energy Transfer deal,"Williams Cos.   Tuesday in its seven-year legal battle over the failed merger with Energy Transfer , fending off the latter's challenge to its  495M court victory.The Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of Williams , upholdingThe Justice's  fully upheld previous rulings of the Delaware Chancery Court, which awarded  410M in damages and  85M in legal fees to Williams  while also affirming a previous decision to reject Energy Transfer's  bid for a  1.48B breakup fee.We find no error with the Court of Chancery's well-reasoned opinions,  the Justice said, and the  litigation between the parties over their failed merger has now come to an end.",55,2023-10-10T11:55:44.000-04:00
Enphase Energy Outshines The Competition,"It is a rare event that high quality companies go on sale. Companies with an established track record of continuing to grow earnings can often maintain their lofty valuations, even during broader market sell-offs. As such, when these kinds ofAs a result of an ever-evolving business model, effective operational execution, shareholder-friendly management, a dominant position in a highly concentrated market with robust barriers to entry, and a historically attractive valuation, ENPH s common equity offers a very compelling risk-reward profile.ENPH s main product and major source of revenue is easy to identify  the solar inverter. This is the component in a solar energy system that switches over the DC produced by solarA traditional solar inverter  aka a  string  inverter  has all of the solar panels in the system plugged into it. This is not ideal, because if there is a problem with the inverter then the entire panel system may be unable to produce power. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify issues with individual solar panels. A good way to think about this problem is like putting Christmas tree lights up. If one individual bulb goes out, the entire string of lights will not light up., July 2023ENPH sets itself apart by offering a . The difference here is that a microinverter is mounted on the back of each individual solar panel. While this does add some cost for the solar user, there are several advantages. Microinverters on the back of each panel make it so that the performance of one individual panel does not impact how the other panels perform. If there are issues with individual panels  shading, malfunction, connection, etc. , they are easy to identify. In its early years, ENPH specialized in microinverters and now as a result they are on their 8th installment of their microinverter  IQ8 , capable of converting up to 384W of power per panel.However, ENPH is far from just a solar inverter producer. The second half of 2020 brought a major announcement in business strategy. As CEO Badri Kothandaraman said in his ,  Enphase is rapidly evolving from being the world s leading supplier of microinverters to becoming the world s leading home energy management systems provider.  Since this announcement, ENPH has added new products which complement their solar inverters in the form of storage  IQ Battery series , , and home energy management software and hardware. All of these new product developments have created new revenue streams, cost synergies for installers, and high switching costs as a barrier for competitors.ENPH Investor Presentation, July 2023The most recent pivot in business strategy has come in ENPH s expansion into European markets. The increase in home energy prices in Europe resulting from the Russia invasion of Ukraine has made for very effective timing on management s part. ENPH now sells their microinverters in Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Poland. Additionally, IQ batteries are now being shipped to Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland. While the majority of net revenues still originate domestically  58.723, to 41.27 , based on , the expansion into European markets has been a resounding success. Per the 2023 Q2 Earnings Call, European revenues grew 25  sequentially and almost tripled year-on-year. This has been a very effective strategy, as this growth in revenues has kept earnings afloat during a time when US sales have stagnated.ENPH Q2 2023 SupplementalThe evolution of the business model, product differentiation, and geographic expansion have combined to make ENPH a dominant force in the renewable energy space.Investors should be choosing businesses that operate in less competitive markets. Less competitive markets have a fewer number of businesses operating in them  i.e. fewer competitors , robust barriers to entry, high switching costs, and stable market conditions for the businesses already operating in those markets. This should result in low business turnover and steady market shares. With even mildly effective business execution, these conditions should result in consistent and strong profit generation over several years.All of these characteristics are clearly observable in the solar inverter market in the United States. ENPH and SolarEdge Technologies  operate in one of the best examples of a duopoly that exists. Together, these two businesses take up  for solar inverters in the United States. With significant secular and , the market for solar inverters and other solar energy-related products has a long runway of earnings growth ahead of it.Essentially, both companies produce solar energy solutions and systems. Both company s core product is a solar inverter, where ENPH makes microinverters and SEDG makes string inverters. , the most significant difference between the two companies is the markets they serve. ENPH has more of a residential focus, while SEDG has a greater presence in the commercial market.As was previously mentioned, both ENPH and SEDG are the nearest peer companies for comparison, but that does not mean they operate in identical markets. ENPH has more of a residential focus, while SEDG has more of a commercial focus . In terms of a total addressable market  TAM , it s almost certain that the residential solar market offers more total dollars to be had. With an estimated , the residential solar market simply offers more opportunities to grow earnings than the commercial market. In the coming years, ENPH will be able to capture more of a very concentrated and fast-growing market.While each business is promising in its own right, the objective of this research is to illustrate how ENPH is the more effectively run business. To achieve this objective, a range of financial ratios will be used to compare the two companies. Some of these financial ratios will be rear-facing in the form of trailing twelve months  TTM . However, other more pertinent ratios will require considerations from the most recent earnings reports  i.e. Q2 2023 . The obvious limitation here is that one quarter s results are not necessarily an indicator of a more well-run business. Furthermore, ENPH s third quarter results are due to be released on October 27, while SEDG s will be released on November 6, 2023. As a result, some of these ratios are subject to change.Liquidity is the ability of companies to meet their current liabilities  forms of debt due within one year  with current assets  designed to be used in less than a year . In increasing order of strictness, the typical measures used for liquidity are2. Quick ratio  This is a slightly more strict measurement, as it removes inventory from consideration. This may be useful, as inventory may not always be completely convertible into revenues or cash. Both companies actually mentioned inventory build-ups recently in the Q2 earnings calls. As a result, this might be the most important liquidity ratio on this list.3. Cash ratio   This is the strictest measure of liquidity, in that only cash or marketable securities that can be quickly converted into cash are considered. This less frequently used ratio is typically not available on financial research websites, so it must be derived from the most recent financial statements.It s clear that each of these companies do a great job of managing their short-term finances. ENPH comes out on top as the slightly more liquid business. While generally a more liquid business is an indicator of management effectiveness, it is possible for a business to be too liquid. This would mean that the management team is passing up opportunities to create value for shareholders.An analysis of liquidity is relevant to the investment thesis, as the ENPH management team recently announced what they plan to do with their excess liquidity. One of the most significant pieces of news from ENPH lately was the announcement of a whopping  1 billion share repurchase program. This was announced on July 27, when shares closed at the day at  166.8., Seeking AlphaThe phrase  the value we see in our stock  is key here. Immediately following the Q2 earnings release, shares continued to decline and have traded in a channel between  130 and  115 since mid-August. If management saw value in shares at a price at or greater than  166.80, that value increased even more as the share price has dropped further. If we assume that even half of the  1 billion has been used since the Q2 earnings call at an average price of  150  both are conservative assumptions , then the management team could have made at least 3,333,333 shares outstanding disappear. That would be almost 2.5  of the 136,689,000 of the current shares outstanding. As share repurchases boost EPS by making the denominator of the equation smaller, ENPH shareholders will soon be owning a larger piece of the earnings pie. Hopefully, the upcoming ENPH earnings report for Q3 provides some additional information on how much of the share repurchase program has been used since the Q2 announcement, and at what average price.This is likely, as the Q2 earnings call did contain information on a prior share repurchase program that was previously announced.CFO Mandy Yang, ENPH Q2 Earnings Call 2023, Seeking AlphaWith two share repurchase programs announced and either completed or in process, and multiple insider purchases by both  and  recently, these are about as bullish signals as an investor could get that a management team thinks their common equity is undervalued.Equity investors should not just be choosing businesses who are in sound financial health. Highly profitable businesses who have the capacity to continue to grow earnings should be prioritized.ENPH has a clear competitive advantage when it comes to profit marginsCompare these to SEDG s profitability marginsOne of the best indicators of how well a business model is functioning is the asset turnover ratio. It measures how well a company s assets generate revenue. A higher value indicates a business that is more efficient at generating sales from the assets of the business. Per Seeking Alpha,Return on Capital  Both companies operate in a capital-intensive industry, where research and development and effective product development are crucial. As a result, Return on Invested Capital  ROIC  might be the most important financial ratio on this list. This ratio measures how effectively the management team is allocating the capital generated from the issuance of equity and debt. A higher value for ROIC indicates that the management team is more effective at taking financial capital and allocating towards profit-generating business activities.In a less competitive market that essentially functions as a duopoly, a higher ROIC signals that one business has a competitive advantage over the other. At , SEDG has an impressive ROIC in its own right. However, ENPH s cash flow generated from investments in the business dwarfs SEDG .A substantially higher ROIC value for ENPH is not only important when considering the capital-intensive nature of this industry, but perhaps more importantly it is a strong predictor of future earnings growth.Cash Flow Accrual Ratio  While it is important to measure the total quantity of earnings to judge past performance, the earnings quality of a company needs to be considered as another method for evaluating the potential for future earnings growth. A ratio that is useful for judging earnings quality is the cash flow accrual ratio, calculated by  net income - free cash flow    average operating assets. This ratio is an effective measure of earnings quality, as it assesses the extent to which free cash flows contribute to the profits of the company. With most financial ratios related to profitability, the way to interpret the values generated by the ratio is  the higher the better  rule of thumb. However, as the accrual ratio subtracts free cash flow  which investors want a lot of  from net income, it s actually preferable to see a low accrual ratio. In fact, a negative accrual ratio is a strong indicator of very quality earnings, as that must mean free cash flows are greater than net income. The cash flow accrual ratio is usually not made available on most financial research websites, and must be derived from the financial statements of companies.Operating assets are those assets which are useful in the core business of the company  i.e. making solar energy products . Operating assets include items such as property, plant, and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and various intangible assets. Here s how the math works out for each companyENPH  Q2 2023 financial results  For this reporting period, ENPH had  157.19 million in net income, and  225.2 million in free cash flow. Using the above framework, ENPH had  1,356.5 million in operating assets. Therefore, ENPH s accrual ratio    157.19 - 225.2    1,356.5   -.05.SEDG  For this reporting period, SEDG had  15.1 million in net income. The cash flow accrual ratio requires the analyst to subtract free cash flow. However, SEDG actually had negative cash flow of  170,304,000 during Q2 of 2023. This renders the calculation a bit of a moot point here, as the intent of the accrual ratio is to determine how well free cash flow contributes to net income.SEDG Q2 2023 Earnings SupplementalNegative operating cash flows are a potential sign of a threat to the business model, and should be interpreted by investors as something to avoid in a new acquisition. With a negative cash flow accrual rate, ENPH has the massive advantage here in the quality of their earnings.These ratios clearly indicate that ENPH is the higher margin business, with earnings compounding more quickly, and a more efficient asset structure. All of these attributes become more significant when a company effectively has only one other competitor.At the time of this writing, ENPH s shares trade at  101.59. The last time ENPH shares hit these prices was October of 2020. . Currently, EPS is  3.98. Safe to say, ENPH has grown rapidly since the last time its shares were this at this price.ENPH currently trades at 28.56x earnings. , the 5Y historical average P E for ENPH stands at a sky-high 114.57. During the time that ENPH has been a GAAP profitable business, the only other time that ENPH s shares have had a lower P E ratio was during the March 2020 pandemic crash. The P E bottomed out at just under 19x earnings before increasing by over 12 times this amount in 2021.The obvious limitation of the P E measurement is that it is not forward-looking, as it does not consider the future earnings growth of the company. Forecasted EPS growth for ENPH is robust at  over the next five years. For this reason, the PEG ratio is the more effective measurement here. The PEG ratio is calculated by TTM PE   diluted YoY EPS growth. While valuations by PEG vary by sector and even industry, the smaller the number indicates cheaper earnings and stronger growth potential. A value of less than 1 is used as a benchmark for identifying growth at a reasonable price. Per Seeking Alpha, ENPH s PEG currently stands at a paltry .17.Readers may note that an intrinsic valuation has not yet been attempted for ENPH. Relative valuations based on share price multiples can be useful for identifying attractive entry points or for comparing competitors, but the best attempts at valuation contain both a multiple valuation and an intrinsic value calculation. I hope to overcome the limitation of this analysis in a future article.Despite ticking all of the boxes for  growth at a reasonable price , ENPH s common equity shares do come with notable risks. The most current risk to the business is the elevated borrowing costs, which were mentioned in the Q2 earnings call. CEO Badri Kothandaraman reportedENPH Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, Seeking AlphaAs ENPH offers residential solar systems where the total price is often high enough for most customers to require loan financing, ENPH s products have effectively experienced an increase in price as . With the recent messaging from The Federal Reserve Board of Governors being  higher for longer , it s reasonable to expect that the above problem will likely persist through 2023.ENPH has also experienced . These have been followed by further share price declines, and could continue .Even though there are significant barriers to entry to the solar energy solutions market, that does not mean that these barriers are impenetrable. Both ENPH and SEDG have been earning impressive profits, and the duopoly is unlikely to last. Notably, Tesla  has entered the residential solar energy market in recent years.Finally, ENPH s beta now stands at 1.51. With a share price that is 1.5x the volatility of the S P 500, ENPH s common equity has lost approximately 65  of its value from the all-time high in late November of 2022. Between geopolitical risks and the possibility of further interest rate hikes, a decrease in the S P 500 would very likely coincide with a proportionately larger decrease in ENPH s short-term share price. Potential new ENPH investors should have a long holding period, and be psychologically prepared for violent sell-offs. With Q3 on the horizon, potential investors seeking an entry point may want to wait until the results of the Q3 earnings call, which will undoubtedly contain significant new information.Yet, none of the above risks are any indication of a threat to the underlying business model. A temporary decline in earnings may be in process already, but investors who buy and hold for the long-term will be purchasing a fast-growing company at a very reasonable price.ENPH shows excellent operational performance on some of the most important financial ratios, has a sizable share repurchase program underway, and possesses the dominant market position in a duopoly. At historically low valuations, ENPH s shares offer substantial upside with minimal risk to the business.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Veolia's PE ratio is higher than the 5 peer companies  by Seeking Alpha.The share price historically dives on bad macroeconomic news but historically steadily climbs back into the  16 to  18 range per share. The high was  18.20 in early 2022. The most recent low was  9.20 per share last October. We estimate the share price has been ticking up again in anticipation of the August 2, '23 announcement that its Q2 '23 EPS will be reported nearly double  0.52  that of  0.29 Y Y. Historically, quarterly earnings reports are  when it comes to beating analysts' earnings estimates. Apparently, it is easier for Veolia to grow revenue than earnings, as this chart dramatically attestsSeeking Alpha analysts consistently rate the stock as a buying opportunity. Going back to 2021, 9-out-of-10 analysts assessed the stock as a buy. The S.A. Quant Rating is and has been for most of 2023, a strong buy. All the S.A. Factor Grades support our bullish position but the metrics and other factors are cause for skittishness.Organic revenue growth as of March '23, rose nearly 20  Y Y. EBIDA was up 8  and EBIT  14 . Annual FY '22 revenue hit  49.5B and estimated revenue for FY '23 is  52.8B. ROE is  8.4 . That brings us to the first risk in the numbers. is  30.6B but admittedly it has been used primarily to expand the business. Nevertheless, the debt-to-equity ratio of 104.7  is high. The company holds  14.4B in cash and equivalents, and its enterprise value is  45.75B.The second risk we see in these numbers lies with a thin net income margin of little more than 1 . The sense of risk might be reflected by the stock's high  rating sporting a Beta of 1.18.A third risk to be aware of is the insecurity dominating the dividend. It gets low grades from S.A. Quant for safety and growth, and a mediocre C  for consistency. The dividend payout ratio has recently been about 120  the free cash flow yield to dividend is less than 1  debt equity, debt capital, net income margin, and estimated sustainability of the growth rate, plus other  justify the worries about the dividend.Fourth, net operating  through 2022 rose 20.78  to  3.64B from  3.01B Y Y. Net operating cash flow from 2022 sales was only  8.5  that is down from 10.57  the year before. Free cash flow at the end of 2022 was -33.38 . The yield was 0.98 . Thus, the heavy reliance on debt to build out the company and sustain operations may jeopardize future dividend payouts and yields.A fifth factor contributing to the sense of risk if not an actual risk is the unknown  we cannot find substantial information about ownership and insider trading. This may be because as a  foreign private issuer,  Veolia is exempt from having to disclose  short-swing  profit with respect to their purchases and sales of shares. Nor are they  to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less information concerning our company publicly available from time to time than there is for U.S. companies at those times.  Simply Wall St claims just 0.03  of the shares are owned by individual  who thus have limited stake in the company's performance.A dip in the share price may justify a moderate buy opportunity of Veolia Environnement SA shares. On the whole, the risk to retail investors might be more marginal than a serious threat but the risks might also be the cause of the stock's volatility and it being undervalued. But we do not foresee any special event that is going to move the share price into the mid- 20s where it might otherwise be with better margins and bigger earnings. Nevertheless, Veolia is a company thriving and progressively pursuing the environmental sustainability actions the world so desperately needs.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

XLU: Hot Summer Could Lead To Another Strong EPS Surprise,"The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF  has underperformed prominently since the beginning of the year as the warm winter brought weakness to the utility players and turned the recession-resistant sector into a laggard.

The ETF, as its recession protection feature was overshadowed by the revival of the technology sector with a 38  gain YtD. The fund executed its feature fairly well during 2022, but the market landscape changed. The warm winter caused weak energy consumption dynamics in the first half of the year, where the demand for electricity decreased by .However, the current weather trends point out more positive results in the back half of the year. With unusual high temperatures in June and July, the electricity consumption profile  mainly for cooling  could be supportive for the electric utilities in the third quarter. In addition, EPS growth will be supported in the coming quarter by low base effect in 2022, when the sector was under strong pressure from high inflation. In the second quarter of 2023, the utilities sector delivered the third highest earnings surprise,  compared to  7.9  for the S P 500 index. And since the players in the industry operate under strict tariff regulations, it could be expected to take at least a few quarters, in my view, for the increased operating costs to be passed on to electricity rates. As a result, I believe that it is reasonable to expect the utilities sector to grow its EPS faster than the benchmark.I will base the calculations of the XLU upside potential on the weighted average target prices of securities that make up the fund. Based on the consensus estimates, the upside potential of the XLU should be 15.3 , which implies a target price of  74 and suggests a Buy rating.Not surprisingly, NEE provides the highest upside potential, or 4.4  to the fund s portfolio, while the contribution of companies with a share of  2   except for NEE  is 8.9 . I have coverage on  and find the strong focus on NEE reasonable, since the company is delivering decent growth due to clean energy trends, while the increasing backlog for renewable energy projects provides visibility for future growth. In addition, XLU trades at 17.2x forward P E, which has gone back by 16.5  from 20.6x at the beginning of the year, and is also below the 5y average of 19.4x. For comparison, SPY is currently trading at 20.3x forward P E, which is slightly above the 5y average level.Overall, the normalization in the industry would also be favored by the slowdown in annual inflation to 3  in June from the 9.1  peak a year earlier and the likely end of the Fed's monetary tightening cycle. From the macro point of view, these trends are supportive for the utility sector, as the players are actively going through an investment cycle due to the energy transition projects and could alleviate pressure on earnings.Declining inflation and interest rates could lead to a lower ROE authorization in future. On the other hand, if monetary policy continues tightening, players in the industry could undergo further pressure due to the significant debt loads. Last but not least, the uncertain macro environment and geopolitical tensions could lead to supply chain disruptions, while the summer season in the US is often marked by natural disasters that could put pressure on the expenditure part of business.

Morgan and Oppenheimer both downgraded NextEraJPM analyst Mark Strouse, who also slashed his price target to  40 from  69, said the stock is  caught in a vicious cycle of higher cost of capital, inhibiting its growth, and in turn further weighing on its cost of capital.Strouse is moving to the sidelines even while NextEra Partners'  long-term opportunity for dropdown acquisitions from NextEra Energy   remains compelling and investors should therefore keep the stock on their radar in the event NEP's cost of capital begins to materially improve.NEP's  latest moves  appear reactive to the current capital markets environment while aligning NEP's DPS growth rate closer to yieldco peers,  Oppenheimer's Noah Kaye wrote.With higher PPA rates for renewables, a favorable policy backdrop, and visibility to 58 GW of sponsor opportunities through 2026, we continue to see large future growth opportunities for the platform, but believe NEP needs to execute on accretive growth, key divestitures and 2024-25 debt refinancing,  Kaye said.",242,2023-09-28T12:14:39.000-04:00
Energy Transfer: Potential Energy Trade Of The Decade,"Energy Transfer  has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities bull run of 2022 as its units outperformed the S P 500 while the successful performance of its business thanks to the increase of energy pricesEnergy Transfer units appreciated by  10  since my latest  on the company was published in December and there are reasons to believe thatAt the same time, despite the price weakness, Energy Transfer's adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was  3.12 billion, just slightly below the  3.23 billion from a year ago, which indicates that the business has been able to successfully adapt to the new environment without suffering significant losses. Thanks to this, Energy Transfer was able to   1.55 billion in cash distribution to its unit holders in Q2 alone.Going forward, there are even more reasons for optimism. First of all, the overall improvement of the American  in recent quarters indicates that a hard landing that could've destroyed the demand for natural gas even more is no longer in play. This should help Energy Transfer to continue to increase its volumes as the market normalizes.What's more is that Russian natural gas is not returning en masse to the international markets, which is good news for non-Russian natural gas producers and all the other businesses from the industry. By the end of 2022, Russian gas supplies  for less than 13  of supplies to the European Union, down from 41  in 2021. This was possible thanks to the increase in supplies of American LNG to the old continent which now provides 50  of the European LNG demand.Add to all of this the fact that Russia  be able to redirect its natural gas supplies to Asia in the same volumes in the following decades and it becomes obvious that the supply would remain tight while the demand is likely to increase thanks to the projected  of the global economy. This is one of the main reasons why the IEA  that Asian spot LNG and TTF prices are expected to remain above their historic averages this year. That's why there are reasons to believe that Energy Transfer volumes would continue to increase and set new records as a combination of domestic and global developments would keep the natural gas flowing through its pipelines.Considering all of this, it seems that at this stage there's nothing not to like about Energy Transfer. At the current price, Energy Transfer  an attractive forward yield of over 9  and it expects its adjusted EBITDA for FY23 to range between 13.1 billion and  13.4 billion. On top of that, back in December, I noted that its units represent an upside of  40 . Considering that they already appreciated by  10  since that time, there's still around 30  upside left. This view is shared by the street as well as the current  price target for Energy Transfer is  17.28 per unit.I see two major risks that could undermine the bullish thesis. The first risk would be the inability of Energy Transfer to construct the Lake Charles export LNG facility and miss on global opportunities that the market offers. So far, the company signed deals to supply 7.9 million metric tons of natural gas per year to clients primarily from Asia, but it still hasn't reached a final investment decision on whether the construct the facility in the first place.Earlier this week the management  the U.S. Department of Energy to give the company a new export license for the facility as it won't be able to complete the project under the current license with a deadline in 2025. Considering that the request to extend the current license failed earlier his year and there's no guarantee that the new licensee would be issued at a time when others are already finishing the building of their export LNG facilities, there's a risk that Energy Transfer would miss the ability to monetize global opportunities.Another risk to Energy Transfer's bullish thesis is the return of Russian natural gas to international markets en masse, which would lead to an extended period of price weakness in the natural gas market and undermine the company's growth story. We already see how the Russian LNG slowly replaces the pipeline gas in  and  and poses a threat to American producers and midstream service providers. The good news though is that this risk is unlikely to greatly materialize in the following years as the Russian LNG is unlikely to reach the same export levels as the pipeline gas had before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While there are certain risks to Energy Transfer's growth story, the company has more than enough catalysts that could help it overcome any potential downsides. Add to all of this the fact that the current geopolitical environment favors non-Russian natural gas businesses, and it becomes obvious that Energy Transfer has everything going for it to generate decent returns in the future.At the same time, even if it decides not to proceed with expanding its Lake Charles LNG project, it will still have more than enough options to continue to create additional value for years to come. But if it decides to enter the export business and finish the export LNG terminal before the deadline, then its opportunities to create value would only expand further. That's why there's nothing not to like about Energy Transfer at this stage.The world is in disarray and it's time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way.  offers you exactly that  No matter whether you are a beginner or a professional investor, this service aims at giving you all the necessary tools and ideas to either build from scratch or expand your own portfolio to tackle the current unpredictability of the markets and minimize the downside that comes with volatility and uncertainty.  for a  today and see if it's worth it for you  Bohdan Kucheriavyi and or BlackSquare Capital is are not a financial investment advisor, broker, or dealer.

NextEra Energy Partners cuts long-term growth outlook roughly in half,"NextEra Energy Partners    pre-market Wednesday after saying it is  for limited partner distribution per unit growth to 5 -8  annually through at least 2026, with a target of 6  growth, citing higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy.AsTighter monetary policy and higher interest rates obviously affect the financing needed to grow distributions at 12 , and the burden of financing this growth has had an impact on NextEra Energy Partners' unit price and yield,  CEO John Ketchum said.The company said it does not expect to require growth equity to meet its revised growth expectations until 2027.NextEra Energy Partners  also said it plans to repower the majority of its wind portfolio in the coming years, and expects to continue to look to acquire wind, solar and storage assets from NextEra Energy Resources and other third parties.The company revised year-end run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA to  1.9B- 2.1B, and sees annualized rates of its Q3 distribution at  3.47 unit, payable in November, and its Q4 distribution at  3.52 unit, payable in February 2024.",203,2023-09-27T08:24:03.000-04:00
A Fragile Grid And Mega-Trends - Generac Is A Buy,"In this article, I want to take a detour. After an almost countless number of dividend and macro-related articles, we'll discuss a fascinating company benefiting from a very troublesome trend.That company is . Headquartered in theThe company also offers solar and battery storage solutions, smart home energy management devices, advanced power grid software platforms, and engine- and battery-powered tools and equipment.In recent years, Generac has evolved its business model by investing inThese distributed energy resources can be integrated into virtual power plants within grid services programs.Before this introduction gets too long, the reason I put GNRC on my watchlist is that it not only benefits from a number of , but it also benefits from increasing stress on the American energy grid, which could provide catalysts capable of pushing this undervalued stock much higher.So, without further ado, let's get to itGenerac believes it benefits from a number of long-term tailwinds. It calls these tailwinds mega-trends.While personal views may differ, I believe that all of these mega-trends are standing on fertile ground.However, one of these trends is more important than the others  legacy infrastructure investment.Below are some Wall Street Journal headlines from this year that support the company's case.In February, the  wrote that the U.S. electric grid is facing significant challenges due to the rapid transition to renewable energy sources.It highlighted a report from PJM Interconnection, one of the nation's largest grid operators, which raises concerns about the stability of the grid as fossil-fuel power plants retire faster than renewable sources are developed, potentially leading to energy shortages and blackouts.PJM traditionally maintains a surplus of power thanks to its extensive fossil-fuel fleet, which it shares with neighboring grids. However, PJM anticipates a significant reduction in its power reserves as coal and natural gas plants retire.The report estimated that 40,000 megawatts of power generation, equivalent to powering 30 million households, are at risk of retiring by 2030, accounting for about 21  of PJM's current generation capacity.Furthermore, the report underscored the increasing demand for electric power, driven by data center growth and government initiatives to electrify vehicles and heating.Unfortunately, renewables cannot consistently provide power 24 7, which raises concerns about the reliability of the grid as coal and gas plants are phased out.This is what the Bear Traps Report wrote in a bullish report on the companyI agree with this, which is the reason I'm writing this article.I'm not predicting a full-blown implosion of the grid. However, I do expect an increasing number of power outages, forcing people to be better prepared.I also expect the company's other mega-trends to provide long-term demand growth.Hence, and in light of these benefits, it helps that GNRC shares are attractively valued. We're not buying into a high-flying startup here but a proven giant in the industry.After accelerating annual EBITDA growth rates between 2019 and 2021, the company isn't doing so well right now. EBITDA declined by 4.2  in 2022, and analysts expect the company to see a 23  EBITDA decline in 2023.In the second quarter, the company reported that residential product sales dropped by 44  compared to the previous year, mainly because the prior year had benefited from significant backlog reduction for home standby generators.Field inventory for home standby generators remained high, and clean energy product shipments also declined year-over-year. Despite a strong sequential growth in home standby shipments, year-over-year numbers were significantly down. The field inventory normalization process is expected to extend further into the second half of this year.Furthermore, the good news is that consumer interest in home standby generators remained strong, with home consultations and sales leads maintaining levels significantly higher than in 2019.The number of residential dealers also grew, reaching approximately 8,700, an increase of 500 dealers from the previous year. The company is focused on expanding installation capacity and increasing dealer count while streamlining the installation process and raising category awareness.The good news continues, as global C I product sales grew by 24  year-over-year. This makes it an all-time quarterly record.Domestic C I product sales were strong, including shipments to key customers for applications beyond traditional emergency standby projects and industrial distributors.Unfortunately, the company's overall sales decreased, resulting in a lower adjusted EBITDA before deducting non-controlling interest. The adjusted EBITDA was  137 million, which accounts for 13.6  of net sales.This is a notable decline from 2022's adjusted EBITDA of  271 million, which represented 21  of net sales. The decrease in EBITDA margin was primarily caused by higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales and lower gross margins.Using the company's own numbers, this is expected to be the first year with lower revenues since 2015. Since its 2010 IPO, revenues have grown by 16  per year.With regard to balance sheet health, the total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was  1.62 billion, with a gross debt leverage ratio of 2.8x.The company expects this ratio to moderate in the second half of the year as LTM EBITDA increases.Despite seeing strong demand, the company downgraded its full-year outlook due to a softer consumer spending environment for home improvement, impacting residential product sales, particularly shipments of home standby generators.In other words, macroeconomic challenges are offsetting the company's secular tailwinds.Having said that, analysts are upbeat about GNRC's future. Both 2024 and 2025 are expected to see strong growth, potentially resulting in more than  900 million in annual EBITDA. Free cash flow is expected to rise to more than  520 million, which would imply a free cash flow yield of more than 7  in 2025E.Prior to the pandemic, GNRC traded at 12x EBITDA.A consistent valuation close to that number would imply that GNRC is roughly 45  undervalued.This would give the company a stock price target of  166. The current consensus price target is  141.Based on this context, I believe that the potential upside is higher in case grid stability turns out to be weaker than expected. Any surprises like large blackouts or related hurricanes can cause  temporary  spikes.I consider GNRC to be a wild card. It's an interesting long-term play on secular tailwinds and I think it's undervalued. It's a company that might do very well in light of longer-term grid challenges.I may open a small trade in this stock over the next few weeks.Generac Holdings is a captivating company poised to benefit from a number of mega-trends, including the evolution of the energy grid, the impact of climate change, and the need for reliable backup power. While the company faces short-term challenges, it remains attractively valued.The critical factor to watch is the aging infrastructure of the American energy grid, which is under stress due to the rapid transition to renewables. This trend, along with GNRC's other major growth drivers, may lead to significant long-term growth.Though 2023 may be a challenging year for GNRC, analysts anticipate a promising future, with potential annual EBITDA exceeding  900 million by 2025. The stock's current undervaluation suggests room for growth.While GNRC is a wildcard investment, it offers an intriguing prospect for those looking to capitalize on long-term grid challenges.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Is Devon Energy The Next Target Of An Energy Mega-Merger?,"The WSJ reported yesterday that Exxon Mobil  is in the late stages of finalizing a deal to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources  in a deal worth roughly  60 billion. A direct consequence of last year's boomThe potential Exxon-Pioneer deal is the latest in an emerging mergers and acquisitions boom in the oil and gas upstream sector. Enverus Intelligence released a  in July of this year stating M A activity in the oil and gas upstream sector totaled  24 billion in the second quarter of 2023, tripling from  8 billion in theThe natural question then, is which stock can investors look to next in the oil and gas M A boom  In this article, we will take a look at a stock that has been gaining attention from investors, perhaps attributable to the fact that it is one of the worst-performing large-cap oil   gas stocks of the year  Devon Energy Corporation .With a market cap of  28 billion, Devon Energy is the sixth largest publicly listed oil   gas exploration company in the United States and the worst-performing of the large-cap stocks in its industry.Priced at  43 per share, DVN stock is currently at 52-week lows, down a massive 45  from its 52-week high, down 28  YTD, and threatening to make new lows. In comparison, the iShares Oil   Gas Exploration ETF  is down just 1.95  YTD and down 14  from its 52-week high.Does this massive underperformance from DVN present a major opportunity for investors given the backdrop of an M A boom, or signal a major red flagThe market perhaps leans towards the latter. Following the WSJ report of Exxon's potential takeover of Pioneer, the reaction across the remainder of the industry remains muted. While, as of writing, Pioneer stock is up approximately 10  on the news of its pending acquisition, none of its peers have managed to gain more than 100 basis points. Devon Energy itself is up a mere 0.6  on the news. The market's response may change in the coming days as it fully digests the news, but for now, this signal  or lack thereof  suggests that the market doesn't have much faith in another industry mega-merger in the immediate future.In favor of a Devon Energy acquisition, it is perhaps the cheapest stock in the industry boasting a forward PE ratio of just 6.4 in comparison to Pioneer's forward PE ratio of 9.0  based on its price prior to the acquisition announcement .Putting aside any potential acquisition for a moment, Devon Energy may be worth considering on a pure valuation basis. Whether or not Devon Energy is a good value investment hinges largely on whether oil prices will remain elevated.  as recently as October 3rd, higher oil prices are here to stay attributable to the recent and extended period of under-investment, supply cuts, and relentless demand growth.Investors may also be attracted to Devon Energy's well-defined dividend strategy to share a substantial portion of its free cash flow with its investors. A couple of years ago, the oil company introduced a unique dividend framework consisting of a fixed and variable dividend. It pays a flat quarterly dividend that it aims to maintain even during periods of lower oil prices. Additionally, it distributes up to fifty percent of its remaining free cash as variable dividends. In the calendar years 2021 and 2022, Devon Energy paid investors dividends totaling  1.97 and  5.17 respectively. Yields of 4.6  and 12  based on the current approximate share price of  43. In 2023 YTD, Devon has paid investors total dividends of  2.10, or a 6.51  annualized yield.The idea that Devon Energy could be the target of an acquisition is also supported by the geographic location of the company's assets. The Enverus Intelligence report cited earlier states that M A activity is largely focused on operations and assets located in the Permian Basin. According to Devon Energy's The Delaware Basin is the second largest component of the larger Permian Basin and, according to , accounts for 64  of the company's combined production volumes across Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids.One factor working against the theory that Devon Energy could be a potential takeover target - at least in the immediate future - is the recent insider trading activity.When company executives are privy to the fact that their company is currently the subject of an acquisition negotiation, their fiduciary duty to shareholders prevents them from initiating new transactions in the publicly traded financial products of their employer. Put simply, corporate executives are understandably prohibited from front-running acquisition news and illegally profiting off of private information at the expense of public investors. As a result, insider trades can provide a useful source of information to public investors regarding the potential and likelihood of acquisitions. Specifically, it is common to see corporate insiders  go quiet  - stop trading in their company stock - for an extended period prior to an acquisition announcement. For example, in the instance of Pioneer Natural Resources shown below, insiders consistently sold batches of stock throughout all of 2022 until June of that year when insider sales suddenly ceased. One purchase transaction can be seen in November of 2022 and then not a single transaction occurred for almost one whole year, bringing us to the present day when it is reported that the company is about to be acquired.In comparison, Devon Energy insiders have been transacting in company stock as recently as August.This is not to say that Devon Energy could not be the subject of a surprise or hostile takeover bid, but it does almost certainly indicate that the company is not currently in talks to be acquired. One positive sign from insider trading activity is Devon Energy's own CEO stepping up to buy over  1 million worth of company stock in open market transactions and at prices .Personally, I am a sucker for value investments. If I see a stock down nearly 50  from its highs my interest is immediately piqued. That's not to say that I will immediately buy that which is out of favor with the market. In the case of Devon Energy, however, I am interested. Fossil fuels such as those supplied by Devon are an integral part of the modern economy and regardless of how much noise may surround the transition away from these fuels, I believe they will play a major role in the economy for decades to come. I like the cheap valuation of the business, which has come about due to recent weakness in the share price, and provides an attractive entry point regardless of any potential acquisition in the near future. I also like the concentration of the company's assets in a geography that has proven itself desirable to the majors and other acquirers, especially considering the growth in M A activity of the sector. As a final benefit, I like to see the CEO stepping up and putting his own hard-earned cash on the line, aligning his own incentives with those of the shareholders. Devon Energy gets my vote of approval and I believe shareholders entering at current levels will be rewarded in time.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

NextEra Energy Partners: Recovery Potential For This Oversold 15% Yielding Energy Stock,"Units of NextEra Energy Partners  were obliterated since mid-September after the partnership said that it was gutting its growth outlook in order to respond to high interest rates. The company's units lost more than half of their valueI have not worked on NextEra Energy Partners before, but I did cover the parent company NextEra Energy. I rated the utility firm also a speculative strong buy -- NextEra Energy Partners is a limited partnership that owns, acquires and manages clean-energy projects in the U.S. Projects include renewable energy assets in sectors like wind, solar, natural gas pipelines and battery storage. These assets generate long-term cash flows for the energy company which are then utilized to pay unitholders an attractive distribution yield. NextEra Energy Partners' natural gas assets are chiefly concentrated in Texas and Pennsylvania.Investments in the renewable sector are attractive for both corporations as well as their investors because the U.S. energy industry is expected to transition to a cleaner energy system in the next few decades that will include lower-carbon energy sources  at the expense of fossil fuels. As an example, the renewables and storage sector is expected to increase their capacity by a factor of 33X until FY 2050, resulting in a total market size and revenue opportunity of approximately  4T that NextEra Energy Partners can tap into.While NextEra Energy Partners owns new-energy assets that generate long-term cash flows and has grown its distribution rapidly in the past, the energy firm shocked the market two weeks ago when it said that it will curtail its growth outlook, chiefly due to financing headwinds in a rising interest rate world.While the new-energy market is rapidly growing and therefore represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for dividend investors, the partnership has said that it expects to grow its distribution at a slower rate in the future  the firm said at the end of September that it expects to generate just 5-8  growth annually as opposed to a previous forecast of 12-15  annual growth. The reduction in the distribution growth rate is due to the changing interest rate landscape which has made financial debt more expensive.NextEra Energy Partners' generates a significant amount of EBITDA and cash flow for the benefit of dividend investors. The energy firm reported  200M in cash available for distribution in the second quarter which was about flat year over yearNextEra Energy Partners has guided for  1,930- 2,130 in adjusted EBITDA for FY 2023 which should translate to approximately  730-820M in cash available for distribution. The firm had 93.4M units outstanding at the end of the June quarter, implying that the current distribution will cost about  320M annually.NextEra Energy Partners declared a Q2'23 distribution of  0.8540 per unit which, on an annualized basis, translates to a distribution yield of 14.80  which is significantly above comparable yields of large midstream firms such as Energy Transfer , Enterprise Products Partners  or Kinder Morgan .The dividend has a safety rating of A  from Seeking Alpha's dividend scorecard as well.NextEra Energy Partners is attractively valued on the drop, based on forward EV EBITDA. Energy companies are often valued based off of EBITDA as this financial measure does not include depreciation expenses  which capital-intensive energy companies tend to have a lot of. NEP trades at just about 10X forward EV-to-EBITDA now which is not an unreasonable multiplier factor for energy companies. NextEra Energy Partners is also only slightly more expensive than other midstream companies with considerable investments in energy infrastructure.Midstream companies currently trade at yields in the 7-9  range. NextEra Energy yielded about the same as peers just before the sell-off and since the company is not cutting its yield, just the distribution growth rate, I believe the market is overreacting and the firm's yield should normalize.I believe NextEra Energy Partners could reasonably trade at a 10-11  distribution yield once the market realizes the underlying value of NEP and understands that the company is only adjusting its growth rate lower. A 10-11  distribution yield would imply a fair value range of  31-34. With units currently selling for just about  23, NextEra Energy Partners has between 35  and 48  revaluation potential, in my opinion. However, I don't believe that NEP will trade anywhere near  50, like it did in September, for a long time.Based on the Relative Strength Index, NEP is now also oversold, with an RSI value of 22.68  below a value of 30, shares units are considered to be oversold, technically speaking, indicating recovery potential .Negative distribution announcements  either full eliminations, temporary suspensions, or distribution cuts  are often cataclysmic events for unitholders. Since units of NextEra Energy Partners have already dropped more than 50  since mid-September, I believe investors have had more than enough time to price in a changed distribution trajectory. As a result, I believe the risk profile has improved following the announcement of the new distribution growth outlook, not deteriorated.There is a strong speculative  and contrarian  buy opportunity with NextEra Energy Partners as the unit price has collapsed from  50 in the middle of September to  23 today, showing a decline of 54 . I am now the proud owner of 575 units.The market is likely overreacting to the slowdown in distribution growth and recovery gains could materialize once investors understand that the firm's distribution growth is going to slow but NEP remains an attractive high-yield play in the new energy market. I believe investors have a unique opportunity to add a 14.9  yield to their portfolios while potentially pocketing considerable recovery gains as investor sentiment towards the partnership normalizes   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Enphase Energy: Back To Reality,"The slowing enthusiasm for solar energy is leaving   shareholders with indigestion. The solar microinverter company reported massive growth during the early days of the war in Ukraine with energy supplies reduced in Europe pushing for aEnphase Energy reported  below analyst estimates by nearly  16 million while earnings topped targets. Though, investors need to understand Q2'23 sales were over  700 million and the updated guidance for the September quarter was for sales of between  550 to  600 million when consensus estimates were up at nearly  750 million.The stock is collapsing in pre-market trading dueThe company reported that sales slipped 16  in the U.S. and 34  sequentially in Europe. Enphase Energy is reporting high inventory at distribution partners in Europe on top of softening demand as the major contributing factors in the guide down.Investors need to remember sales were only approaching  200 million per quarter back in late 2019. The original guidance for 2020 was for sales of only  205 million for Q1'20.Enphase Energy spent nearly a year with sales at over 3.5x the previous peak demand levels. One has to clearly worry about demand pulled forward, limiting the need to purchase additional solar panels and microinverters now that the chaos caused by Russia has somewhat subsided.On the , CEO Badri Kothandaraman discussed the market dynamics as followsThe company sees some potential for demand to normalize by Q2'24 at the  450 to  500 million level, but investors should be cautioned that management didn't see the slump coming and may not correctly see the new normal level. With an inventory correction here, the market could easily face pricing pressures due to the excess microinverter supplies.Enphase Energy went into the earnings report with a market cap of  12.8 billion. After a 17  dip in pre-market trading, the stock has a market cap of  10.6 billion.The company now has a revenue run rate in the  1.2 billion range  based on low-end guidance . This run rate level is still some 50  above the 2020 revenue level.Assuming quarterly revenues do normalize around  500 million, Enphase Energy would have a run rate closer to  2.0 billion. The stock still trades at over 5x sales that aren't guaranteed.Back in late 2019, the stock traded around only  25 with a diluted share count of only 132 million, nearly 10  below the current share count. The after-hours trading at  80 still leaves Enphase Energy up over 200  with the prospects for growth far less limited now in comparison to early 2020 when growth was more promising.The guidance still predicts gross margins at nearly 50  with the net IRA benefit. The gross profit of at least  150 million leaves Enphase Energy with an operating income in the range of at least  60 million, though again investors shouldn't be shocked by unexpected margin pressures here leading to worse than expected outcome when the company plans to ship  150 million less product into the market than sell-through.The key investor takeaway is that the sudden weakness in the solar market should make investors question whether the market actually stabilizes at levels far above the 2020 levels. The market would appear to have more risk ahead, keeping us on the sidelines with Enphase Energy. Once the shakeout in the sector is complete, the stock will be re-evaluated.Stone Fox Capital  aka Mark Holder  is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

"NextEra Energy Partners: Is It Always Darkest Before Dawn, Or Pitch Black?","Over the past seven trading days the NextEra Energy Partners  unit price has fallen off a cliffAnalysts on Seeking Alpha and from numerous mainstream investment research groups have been piling on the gloomIn this article, we will take a look at whether or not the dramatic stock price decline is justified by fundamentals and then offer our verdict on whether investors should get out before the lights at NEP go pitch black or if NEP has a good chance ofYes, the market was likely not happy about the rough halving of the distribution growth guidance at NEP, though no one who knew  1  where interest rates were,  2  where its equity price was trading  even before it recently lost half of its market value , and  3  the sheer magnitude of its upcoming wall of CEPF and debt maturities believed that NEP was likely to achieve its lofty 12  distribution CAGR guidance.Moreover, negative market sentiment was likely spurred further by the slew of downgrades and steep price target reductions from previously bullish mainstream investment analysts. However, based on the analysts' commentary in most cases, many of these downgrades seemed to be at least partially driven by chasing market sentiment rather than truly driven by fundamental analysis of the company itself.The real reason for the sell-off in the stock price - in our view - was the vicious cycle created by two major factorsThe main factor preventing NEE from rolling up NEP at this point is that it wants to limit its direct exposure to renewables in order to keep regulated assets at a higher percentage and therefore make the credit ratings agencies happy. Could they eventually decide that they are going to roll up NEP anyway  Absolutely. However, NEE has made it clear that an independent and healthy NEP is important to them being able to achieve their long-term growth goals  by being able to develop and drop-down renewable assets to NEP, thereby generating attractive profits for NEE via its renewables development business while also preserving its regulated renewables balance to protect its credit rating and retain a relatively attractive cost of debt capital , so they are likely going to do everything they can to revive NEP's growth story before resorting to a roll-up.As a result, our view is that NEE is likely going to give NEP at least a few more years to try to recover an attractive cost of capital. If those efforts fail - especially if NEP faces a choice between a distribution cut or financial distress - NEE could very likely go down the path of reabsorbing NEP. This is a scenario that likely means that the current unit price decline is a case of it being darkest before pitch black.That said, we believe that there is still a very viable path for NEP to return to prosperity and that it could very well be darkest before dawn. Here is the mathAfter Q1, management was expecting a December 31, 2023 run-rate project-level adjusted EBITDA of  2,417- 2,617 million based on the following assumptionsSince then, the announced potential sale of their STX pipeline and the cancelation of an expected drop-down from their parent NextEra Energy  overwhelmed their other growth initiatives to reduce their December 31, 2023 run-rate project-level adjusted EBITDA by nearly  500 million to  1,930- 2,130 million.On the positive side, corporate expenses have declined by an expected  10 million and the IDR fees of  157 million have been suspended for the foreseeable future, reducing the hit to the December 31, 2023 run-rate NEP-level adjusted EBITDA to  320 million, or  1,900- 2,100 million. Moreover, debt service expense has also been reduced substantially given that the STX debt will be taken out and the expected debt costs on the drop-down asset also do not apply, so that improves the mid-point of estimated pre-tax CAFD by another  135 million. Pre-Tax Tax Credit deductions also declined by  135 million at the midpoint, Non-Cash Income deductions declined by  5 million at the midpoint, and Maintenance Capital deductions declined by  5 million at the midpoint. As a result, the decline in estimated pre-tax CAFD at the midpoint only ultimately declined by  40 million at the midpoint from  815 million to  775 million. Given that NEP is not expected to have to pay any cash taxes for a long time, their pre-tax CAFD can be treated effectively as just CAFD for our modeling purposes. The distribution per unit is expected to sit at a run rate of  3.52 at year-end. Assuming a total unit count of  191 million units  accounting for NEE's  51  stake in NEP , that leaves the CAFD per unit at  4.06 and puts the run-rate CAFD payout ratio at 86.8 .Moreover, assuming no other net impacts, this cash flow generation should be quite reliable for many years to come given that NEP's 2024E CAFD weighted average S P counterparty credit rating is a very impressive BBB  with a 2024E CAFD weighted average remaining contract life of  15 years.Clearly, the loss of the drop-down and the sale of the STX pipeline do not threaten the safety of the distribution in the immediate term and should not threaten it for years to come assuming no other impacts to the CAFD equation.However, the giant elephant in the room is that NEP has a wall of fixed-rate debt and Convertible Equity Portfolio Financings maturing in 2023 through 2025, which will put a dent in their distribution coverage ratio if refinanced at current interest rates.Taking a look at their debt , we see that NEP has  1.3 billion in debt maturing in 2024 at a weighted average interest rate of  2.75 . Given that the current going 7 10-year rate on corporate level debt at NEP's BB credit rating is  7 , we can assume a whopping  55 million hit to NEP's run rate 2024E CAFD from increases in interest expense alone, assuming no future changes in interest rates. In 2025, they have another  700 million in debt maturing at a weighted average interest rate of  1 , assuming interest rates remain at their current level until then, we can factor in another  40 million hit to NEP's run rate 2025E CAFD from increases in interest expense. NEP is expected to be generating a little bit over  100 million of CAFD net of its distribution in its run-rate December 31, 2023 guidance, so it should still be able to cover its run-rate December 31, 2023 distribution level by the end of 2025.However, the Meade pipeline will also be sold in 2025, which complicates things further and likely leaves the distribution not fully covered in such a scenario. Of course, this assumes that NEP does not generate any other growth over that period of time, which is highly unlikely, so the distribution is still likely in fine shape through 2025, assuming all goes well with the Meade pipeline sale and interest rates don't soar further. 2026 brings with it another  1.2 billion in debt at a weighted average rate of  3.5  maturing followed by  600 million of debt at a weighted average rate of  4.5  maturing in 2027. At current interest rates, that would add on combined additional interest expense headwinds of  60 million.Of course, these maturities are far out enough that it is hard to know what interest rates will be like at that point, but if NEP can keep growing its EBITDA at a decent clip if interest rates remain at their current levels through these dates, there is a solid case to be made that NEP can continue to cover its distribution even in the face of these maturities.Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that - according to its Q2 report - NEP also recently settled a significant amount of interest rate hedges that it can deploy to help offset increases in interest expense in the coming years. Finally, NEP plans to make use of tax equity and project-level debt to finance high-returning repowering projects in its current portfolio and high-graded drop-down projects from NEE, minimizing its need for equity.Between its expected  100 million in surplus CAFD in its run-rate numbers at the end of this year, the potential for surplus equity proceeds from its STX pipeline sale, and its interest rate hedge proceeds, NEP is positioned to weather increased interest expenses in the coming years and continue to invest in at least some growth projects. Moreover, management emphasized that it still has some wiggle room in its credit metrics before it reaches a downgrade threshold, so if it needs to, NEP can also take on a bit of debt to tide itself over until interest rates normalize further. This debt capacity will also increase as its EBITDA number grows through future growth investments.While the debt maturities appear manageable, what about the CEPFs  Here are the near-term CEPFs that they need to manageThe plan for managing these is to sell their STX pipeline sometime between now and the end of the year  with management saying on a previous call that this sale will likely be agreed upon in late Q3 or early Q4, making an announcement likely any day now  and sell their Meade pipeline in 2025. The proceeds from these sales  net of the combined asset-level debt of  1.2 billion  are expected to be sufficient to handle all  1.5 billion of CEPFs through 2025 while also providing additional equity to fund growth needs alongside retained cash flow.How realistic is management's plan and can they really continue to grow distributions and handle debt maturities while walking this line  The STX pipeline generates an annualized  185 million in EBITDA and is financed with  317 million in fixed and variable rate debt that is maturing in 2024. After accounting for the 2022  of the Monument Gas Pipeline which was part of the STX pipelines  for which NEP received an astonishing 45x EV EBITDA multiple due to it being strategically located for the right buyer , NEP  an  11x EV EBITDA multiple for these assets back in 2015. If it were to get the same valuation for them today, it would receive a little over  2 billion for them. However, given that long-term interest rates have risen sharply since NEP acquired these pipelines, we find it a bit bold to assume that they will be able to achieve the same valuation today.Perhaps they will due to strong demand from certain buyers that find them to be extremely strategic like the Monument Gas Pipeline, but for the sake or conservatism, we will assume they achieve a 10x EV EBITDA multiple on them. That would put the proceeds net of STX-level debt at  1.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Meade Pipeline was at a 13.5x EV EBITDA multiple back in late 2019. The Meade Pipeline is particularly attractive given that it is located in Pennsylvania  where it is extremely hard to install new pipeline  and is tied into the , which is considered to be one of the finest and growthiest pipeline assets in North America. As a result, we think it is more likely that NEP will be able to achieve a higher multiple on it than they are with STX, so - assuming interest rates remain in their current range - we could see them fetching between 11.5x and 12x EV EBITDA on this asset, which would imply  400- 450 million in net proceeds after Meade-level debt is assumed.This should give NEP at least  1.9 billion in net proceeds from these pipeline sales, giving them plenty of flexibility to pay down their CEPFs through 2025 while also generating  400 million in excess proceeds to fund growth investments. Moreover, these proceeds are largely front-loaded, giving them the ability to use some of the proceeds that they eventually plan to allocate to buy out the 2025 CEPFs towards paying down debt initially, saving them considerable interest expense in the interim.While it appears that NEP has a plan in place to address debt maturities and CEPF buyout requirements through 2025, it still has a whopping  2.7 billion in CEPF buyouts that are due between 2026 and 2032. Management has stated previously that these will be taken care of on an opportunistic basis between now and then through a combination of retained equity, opportunistic equity issuance, asset stake sales, and or debt issuance. Management also has the option of walking away from some of its future CEPF obligations and giving over virtually all of the distributable cash flow from the related assets to the CEPF investors if it deems it to be in the best interest of protecting unitholder value.While this looks good on a slide deck, what are the actual numbers looking like  Let's take a look, assuming interest rates remain at their current levelBased on this analysis, the math seems to be there for NEP to navigate its wall of debt maturities and CEPF buyout dates assuming two major things1. Interest rates do not continue to move materially higher. If some of these predictions of 7-13  treasury rates manifest, NEP is not going to be able to navigate this obstacle course of capital obligations and will inevitably be rolled up.2. NEP is able to achieve reasonably attractive prices for its pipeline assets. However, even if it gets a little bit lower multiples than the ones we used here, it will likely just mean that its distribution growth guidance will be lowered again to low single digits or even halted altogether, which - given where the yield is today - would not be a terrible thing.Also, if treasury rates fall - as some are also predicting - back to a 2-3  range instead of the current 4-5  range, NEP's pathway becomes far easier and it is likely that it not only sustains its current distribution growth rate guidance indefinitely, but may even be able to eventually increase it to a higher level in the future.NEP is truly a leveraged bet on interest rates. If interest rates continue to soar higher from here - as it appears that the market is currently pricing in - then it is truly growing darkest before pitch black at NEP. If interest rates remain in their current range through the rest of this decade, it will be very tight for NEP to navigate its CEPF buyouts while also absorbing interest expense headwinds from debt maturity refinancings, but there is a path forward for it to sustain its distribution and even grow it a bit more for a few more years at least. Keep in mind that my calculations did not factor in the substantial - though yet to be precisely determined - proceeds from their interest rate hedges that should give them a bit more wiggle room. That said, if anything goes wrong in this scenario, NEE may still feel compelled to step in and roll it up. Finally, if interest rates fall materially in the coming years back to a 2-3  range, NEP is poised to deliver phenomenal returns for investors.As a result, we rate it as a high-risk  or  speculative  Strong Buy for investors who - like me - think we are facing a recession next year and that the Federal Reserve will be forced to pivot on interest rates and restart its bond-buying program. Investors who are very risk averse and or who believe there is a high probability of interest rates going still higher from present levels for a sustained period of time should steer clear.

Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) Unveiling the Potential of Liquid Hydrogen: Innovative Solutions and Market Insights Call Transcript,"Plug Power Inc.  Unveiling the Potential of Liquid Hydrogen  Innovative Solutions and Market Insights Conference Call September 27, 2023 12 00 PM ETChris Rial - Director Business DevelopmentIan Richardson - Product Development, R D Manager, Plug Power's Hydrogen Liquefaction ProgramSo good morning, afternoon, evening everyone. Welcome to this month's episode of Green Hydrogen with Plug, where we're diving deep into the potential of liquid hydrogen. My name is Meryl and I'll be your moderator for today's session. I'm very excited to introduce you to today's speakers who both have deep expertise in our webinar topic. Chris Rial is Director Business Development at Plug. Chris comes from an extensive background in liquefaction, previously serving as the Vice President of Business Development at Joule Processing since 2015, where he specialized in developing customized solutions for gas processing and liquid handling needs to benefit customers across the globe. He has worked in the energy and environmental industry for over 20 years across various roles in management, compliance and safety. Chris received his bachelor of applied science in Bio and Bioenvironmental Science from Texas A M University and his MBA degree in global energy from the University of Houston, C.T. Bauer College of Business. Ian Richardson is our second speaker today, and he is the Product Development and R D Manager for Plug Power's Hydrogen Liquefaction Program. Ian is an expert in cryogenic systems and green hydrogen technologies. Prior to joining Plug, Ian Co-Founded a startup commercializing lightweight liquid hydrogen fuel cell tanks and the associated fueling systems to support the energy transition in the aerospace sector. He received his Ph.D. from Washington State University, focusing on cryogenic fluid mixtures for NASA. So really quick before I hand it over to our speakers, just a few things that are showing on theAnd then just on the right side, we have our speakers at the top of post-event survey. And then of course, we have our Plug Symposium coming up on October 11th, which we encourage you to register for. So with that, I'll hand it over to Chris to kick off today's webinar. Thanks, Meryl. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I know you're spread out across the world. Happy to discuss some of the potential of liquid hydrogen. We see it as an emerging market. And today, Ian and I are going to present some of the market insights and the products that are going to be delivered into these markets to help catalyze the market. Before we get in there, I thought it was appropriate to talk about how Plug, Catalyze, and application. Specifically, this was around fuel cells. We identified an area that had a tremendous need for a conversion to a different fuel that would increase utilization. And this ultimately became the catalyst for Plug s growth and the development of future development of reliable network of supply. Today, you can take a look at the various verticals in the distribution and material handling sectors at some of our customer base. We have over 1 billion hours of operation. We're dispensing over 40 tons a day of hydrogen to over 200 private fueling stations. With the adoption of Plug fuel cells in the distribution sector, a readily supply of hydrogen was needed. This led to a vertical integration approach and effort to build out our own infrastructure, ultimately trying to drive down the delivered price of hydrogen. Today, Plug provides equipment within the major components of the value chain as depicted here. You can see, we have products that serve the production, liquefaction, transportation, storage and handling, dispensing, and as discussed earlier, ultimately the use case in fuel cells. As seen here, the image in front of you, you can see the various points of manufacturing, production of hydrogen, and delivery points that support a force-majeure network, a Force-Majeure Resistant Network. We've set a target of 1,000 tons per day to be produced by 2028, and it's to serve the market that we're going to talk about here in a few minutes. Today, we're going to take a look at the projected hydrogen demand growth, the various use cases and applications, as well as the products that support the market today. Ultimately, Plug is offering a complete integrated solution to drive down delivery and cost. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Ian to talk about some of the markets and applications that we're going to be serving. All right, thank you, Chris. So before we dive into the liquid hydrogen markets, let's first look at why we even need to liquefy hydrogen in the first place. The answer really comes down to the increased density of liquid hydrogen versus gaseous hydrogen. This leads to a lower cost of transportation and a lower cost of infrastructure at the end user's site on  1 per kilogram basis of stored hydrogen. As a rough example, it takes approximately eight gas tube trailers to deliver the same amount of hydrogen as one liquid hydrogen tanker. This slide provides some general guidelines for when you would use different transportation modes for hydrogen, whether that's gas tube trailers, liquid hydrogen tankers or a gas pipeline. Now, we also have ammonia and liquid hydrogen ships on here, and we typically only talk about these energy carriers when we talk about intercontinental transportation of hydrogen for energy markets. The economics typically come down to how much hydrogen you're consuming on a daily basis and how far you need to transport it. Now, this is by no means set in stone. There is a lot of overlap in some of these methods, and there are also other factors to consider, like the end use application, what purity of hydrogen you need, and the footprint requirements or limitations at the end use site. But this table is general guidelines to help you break down those transportation options. And when you look at the markets that Plug is pursuing, these are well suited for liquid hydrogen truck deliveries. So if we dive deeper into the liquid hydrogen markets and the markets that rely on liquid hydrogen, we have our traditional material handling market, where we're actually transporting, delivery, and storing liquid hydrogen on site, outside of these large distribution centers. We see a similar model playing out with stationary power and commercial transportation, where we will be transporting and storing liquid hydrogen on site to fuel these fleets of delivery vans and semi-trucks. And as we look towards the future, we have heavy duty industries coming online. These are things like mining trucks, aircrafts, and ships that will require liquid hydrogen onboard the vehicle to get the required energy density for widespread commercial adoption. So we actually see the demand for liquid hydrogen increasing significantly over the next several years as industrial applications come online. So with that, let's take a quick pause for a poll question. So how much faster is it to refuel a hydrogen fuel cell-powered Class 8 truck compared to a battery electric Class 8 truck   25   50   75  or  98  faster  We'll take five or ten seconds here for the audience to populate their answers. Okay, let's take a look at how the audience has responded. Alright, it seems the prevailing thought is 98  faster. It seems we have a very acute audience. So let's take a look. When we compare the two available technologies for long-haul heavy payload transportation, we see the advantages of fuel cell versus battery. With a comparison of a Class 8 truck over 500 miles, you can see the limitations of battery in terms of available payload and refueling time. Due to the weight of the batteries needed for long distance and the charge time of batteries, we can see an increased payload of 25  and reduced fuel time of 98 . This increases productivity and utilization and has driven a number of truck OEMs to develop and start manufacturing a series of Class 8 trucks. Now let's take a look at projected hydrogen market demand in the U.S. and the future of liquid hydrogen for mobility. This table highlights the amount of incremental supply that would be needed to serve different mobility sectors beginning in 2030. First, we'll take a look at the U.S. transit buses. We're already starting to see a slow conversion of municipalities to fuel cell vehicles, and we estimate a 25  conversion to hydrogen fuel will result in an incremental demand of 300 tons per day. A much higher consuming application in Class 8 vehicles, just a 1  conversion of market share would result in an incremental demand of 150 tons per day. In a very nascent aircraft and airline sector, which still has some hurdles to overcome, we estimate just 0.5  of conversion to hydrogen fuel will result in a need of an additional 833 tons a day of supply. Now we don't see a lot of these sectors really coming on at tremendous scale until around 2030, which is not too far off. Roll all this up and we see an incremental demand in 2030 of around 1,300 tons per day. What this doesn't take into account is any conversion of combustion engines to hydrogen combustion engine, internal combustion engines, which we estimate would increase demand or supply of 20  to 25 . When we look at the global market for liquid hydrogen, data shows the earliest adoption and increased demand coming from medium duty and heavy duty trucking. Other sectors such as aviation and mining have some technology hurdles to overcome as I mentioned earlier, before we see additional demand. The speed in which these applications adopt hydrogen though, at scale are highly dependent on a number of growth drivers. You've got government incentives such as national subsidies and incentives to promote both the supply side and the demand side. You've got regulatory policies such as emission reductions and fueling mandates. You've got cost reductions, which come about via increase in manufacturing capacities, increased efficiency and standardization of equipment. You have the deployment of new applications, as we've discussed earlier, and ultimately the availability of supply is going to be needed to go hand-in-hand with the increase of new applications in scale. We estimate the demand for low carbon hydrogen for road transport only to be around 8,500 tons per day by 2033. As mentioned earlier, we see other sectors coming on, but at a later time in which we'll need incremental supply and infrastructure to support. So time for another poll question. For countries looking to import hydrogen for use in the mobility and transportation sectors, which imported carrier molecule results in the lowest cost at the pump  As you begin to think about that and answer it, it should be noted there are other carriers of hydrogen molecules such as liquid organic hydrogen carrier and methanol. Really, we compare these two, because the readiness of commercial and industrial scale technologies for those technologies is a bit nascent, and ultimately we had to base our assumptions off data that we have. So let's take a look at the results. Oh, this is closer than I expected this to come out at. So it looks like the majority selected liquid hydrogen. This actually coincides with what we have analyzed to-date. It should be noted that this graph and information is based off a tremendous amount of assumptions and really off technology that isn't readily available necessarily today and efficiencies and recovery aren't known today. But when you look at liquid hydrogen versus ammonia as the carrier in ultimately delivering liquid hydrogen to the market, you have to stack the processes together. And we look at the cost for liquid hydrogen that includes the liquefaction, the shipping, the storage and losses. That's compared to the cost of shipping ammonia, which includes the energy needed for ammonia synthesis, shipping ammonia, storing, cracking the ammonia to the hydrogen molecule, purifying the hydrogen to a purity that's needed for liquefaction and ultimately liquefaction.So when you stack all these processes together, the energy consumed in this, we see the price for delivered hydrogen or ultimately the liquid hydrogen to the market via ammonia carrier as higher than liquid hydrogen. With that, I'm going to hand it back over to Ian to talk about some of the products that we're building into the market. All right. Thank you, Chris. So when we take a closer look at our hydrogen production facility, you'll notice that there are several different critical packages that make up the facility, starting with hydrogen production. This can be either from electrolysis or chemical processing like chlor alkali plants, steam methane reforming or autothermal reforming. From there, that hydrogen goes through a purifier to remove any water vapor, hydrocarbons or oxygen before it enters our liquefier where it gets cooled and liquefied at minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit. That liquid then goes to on-site liquid hydrogen storage tanks, where it's then piped to loadout bays to fill our liquid hydrogen tankers, which are then sent out to refuel our gen fuel sites. Plug offers solutions in nearly every aspect of the liquefaction facility, and we have several of these facilities currently in construction. We've applied our lessons learned from building and operating liquefiers into our product design to offer an integrated solution to drive down costs and schedule. So let's do a deeper dive into the liquefiers to highlight some of those key differentiators.Though Plug is standardized are 15 ton per day and 30 ton per day liquefiers. These have been designed to operate over a wide range of ambient conditions that exist here in the U.S. from summers in the southwest to winters in the northeast. And Plug being focused on green hydrogen production, we knew that these plants would experience dynamic operations as renewable energy prices vary throughout the day. So we designed with that functionality and flexibility in mind and decided to use gaseous refrigerants throughout our liquefaction process to allow for faster turn down and ramp up of the system. Now this is quite unique. Plug is the only industrial liquefier provider that utilizes gaseous nitrogen as the pre-cooling refrigerant and gaseous hydrogen as the liquefaction refrigerant. Using these gaseous refrigerants allows us to reduce the amount of cryogenic equipment that is required in our liquefier and it allows us to ramp this plant much faster than traditional liquefiers without the risk of damaging our equipment, which can occur when you use liquid nitrogen or liquid hydrogen in your refrigeration loops. So ramping up and turning down quickly when you have liquid refrigerants can lead to large temperature gradients that put thermal stresses on your heat exchangers and can lead to failures. So let's dive into some of our key equipment. Plug's liquefier consists of two primary stages. We have our gaseous nitrogen pre-cooling loop, which is shown in numbers one through four and we have our nitrogen   which contains our nitrogen compressor, our cryogenic polisher which removes any trace impurities like oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and then we have our turbo expanders, which generate our cooling, and finally the Perlite Cold Box which houses our brazed aluminum heat exchangers that cool our hydrogen to an intermediate temperature. From there, that hydrogen flows through the gaseous hydrogen liquefaction stage where it's further cooled and liquefied at minus 420 Fahrenheit. Now we do have a video on YouTube that goes into greater detail on our liquefaction process that I would strongly encourage you to go watch if you're interested in learning more. That link should be in your related content box on your screen.And with that, I'll pass it back over to Chris to walk through some of our current projects.Thanks, Ian. Here we see some pictures from various stages of construction at our Camden County, Georgia facility. This is the first large scale green hydrogen facility that liquefies and distributes to our customer base in the U.S. and in the world. Due to the standardization of many of these pieces of major equipment, we've been able to construct this facility in 12 months. Compare this to industry standard of 36 to 48 months. This improvement and speed to market approach allows you to more closely align your supply with your projected customer needs. On the left, you'll see the aforementioned project in Camden County, Georgia. The phase one is 15 tons a day of green hydrogen production and liquefaction. We also have a 5 megawatt Electrolyzer producing 2.5 tons of gaseous hydrogen. This is supported by   the full facility supported by 45 megawatts of Electrolyzers. And next to that, we have the Port of Antwerp project, which is 35 tons a day of green hydrogen capacity, in which we're going to liquefy 15 tons per day there. That's supported by 100 megawatts of electrolyzes. This is currently one of the largest green hydrogen plants in Europe and in construction.Finally, we have what will be the world's largest green hydrogen facility in Genesee County, New York, totaling 75 tons a day of green hydrogen liquefaction, supported by 200 megawatts of PEM Electrolyzers.I hand it back over to Ian to talk about some of these solutions that are within these facilities and how they work hand-in-hand. All right. Thank you, Chris. So as I mentioned previously, Plug is vertically integrating around the hydrogen value chain to reduce the cost of hydrogen to the end user and develop a robust network of liquid hydrogen production facilities. When we look at this entire hydrogen ecosystem, there are numerous major equipment packages, both at the production facility side, as well as the end use site. All of these have to work hand in hand to optimize your hydrogen utilization and minimize your losses. So with that in mind, Plug has spent a great deal of resources optimizing these critical packages. And we're specifically focusing our time on optimizing the interfaces between these major packages so that they work seamlessly together, which is something that no other company can offer. So if we look at the front end of this process with hydrogen generation, Plug offers a standard Electrolyzer solution. For demonstration projects that need only 1 ton to 2 tons per day, we offer a five megawatt turnkey containerized solution, and for industrial applications, we offer 10 megawatt arrays, which produce 4000 kilograms per day each, which can be integrated together to meet the needs of your facility. One thing that I will highlight is that plugs PEM Electrolyzer Technology produces gaseous hydrogen at 40 bar pressure, which reduces the compression load at the front end of your facility. Continuing down the value chain, we have our liquefiers that I discussed earlier. Just to recap, we have two different standard sizes in a 15 ton per day and 30 ton per day design. These have been specifically designed targeting flexible operations to turn down and ramp up quickly. They've been optimized for reliability to increase our uptime. And much of the major equipment has been skid mounted to reduce the field installation requirements and decrease construction costs.Moving further down the facility, we have storage and transportation, which plug develops in-house. Plug offers the largest liquid hydrogen trailer on the market with just over an 18,000 gallon capacity. These are state of the art vacuum jacketed vessels designed to maximize payloads and reduce delivery frequencies. We also build our own liquid hydrogen storage tanks in 10,000 gallon and 19,000 gallon standard sizes, in both horizontal and vertical configurations. And finally, rounding out that value chain, Plug develops our own hydrogen refueling systems, where we currently have over 200 in operation. These hydrogen refueling stations are currently targeted at material handling applications, as well as medium duty vehicle markets like buses. Most of these sites have an 18,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank. That liquid is then pumped to 6,000 PSI and warmed in a vaporizer and stored in high pressure tubes before it gets dispensed into the vehicle. And as I mentioned, we have 200 of these stations operational in the U.S. and we're starting to expand into Europe and Asia. With this experience, we've gotten very efficient at working with local authorities to get the permitting, construction and site integration streamlined for our customers. These fueling stations really serve as a building block to larger scale systems as we evolve to heavy duty vehicle fueling and larger industrial applications. And one of those applications which I'm excited to share with you today is our portable refueler. We've essentially taken our experience and knowledge from our traditional hydrogen refueling systems that I just showed, and we've condensed that footprint to a custom drop deck trailer with a smaller liquid hydrogen tank. This fueling solution can still meet the same fueling rates and pressures as our traditional fueling systems without the infrastructure requirements. This product is targeted at demonstration products or projects where fleet owners want to test out fuel cells on a small portion of their fleet to get comfortable with hydrogen. And it can also serve as a bridge solution for fleet owners looking to increase their speed to market for deployment of fuel cell electric vehicles, because that permitting process for a permanent station can take several months. This unit can also be used to support a variety of new applications by recharging ground storage tubes and tube trailers. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Chris to wrap things up. Thanks, Ian. So why have we developed this product line and why are we talking about it today and looking at it as an end-to-end solution  Well, we've highlighted it for more than just self-fulfilling reasons. It's really about the intricacies of the process-to-process interfaces, as well as the process-to-balance of plant interface that can drive up contingency in a project, resulting in higher CapEx. Additionally, supplying individual systems within a facility to an EPC contractor can result in a facility that hasn't been optimized for efficiency. That ultimately drives up OpEx. But it's through the tremendous efforts of standardizing and optimizing this equipment line that is resulting in lower costs and delivery of ultimately a lower price per kilogram of hydrogen. And our estimate, this integrated solution saves roughly 5  to 10  in total installed costs and levelized cost of hydrogen at the end of the day. So through the continuous operations of these facilities, as we continue to operate and construct, we've gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience. And because we have consistency within the facilities and through the standardization across the platform, we can now transfer that knowledge base to the market. It's something that we're proud to offer, both serve our internal customer and offer the third-party market today. I think this concludes most of our presentation today. So I thank you for your time. I think we're going to enter into a Q A session. With that, I'll hand it back over to Meryl. Awesome  Thank you both very much. We will jump right into Q A. And really quick, I see one question that just came in about getting in touch with Plug on potential projects. So there's two links at the bottom of this slide here, which can be used through our Contact Us page if you guys want to get in touch. And then also, the recording of this and the PowerPoint deck will be sent around via email afterwards. I saw a few comments on that as well. So, all righty. To kick off here, first question is, what are Plug's boil-off losses throughout the value chain  Yeah, that's a good question there, and I'll jump in and take that. And the answer is, it really depends on which part of the value chain we are talking about. So let me go back to our value chain slide here. And when we look at our kind of the boil-off and transfer losses, when we're still at the production facility, from hydrogen generation all the way through truck loading here at the front end, when you're at our production facility, we actually take   we pipe all of those losses, boil off from our liquid hydrogen storage tank, blow down from our trailers, and unloading vapor from our trailer. Those get recycled back to the front end of our liquefier and re-liquefy. So we're not actually losing any boil-off at the facility itself. Really, when those boil-off lots start is as soon as you fill that truck and that tanker leaves your facility. Now for that application, let me go to our hydrogen refueling slide here. So this is our typical refueling system for a material handling site. So think a Walmart or Amazon distribution center here. These tanks work in fairly steady use cases. Most of those facilities are 24 hours a day. We do have boil off and transfer losses associated with that. But the end goal of these facilities is high pressure gaseous hydrogen to fuel a forklift with 5,000 PSI. So these facilities actually have hydrogen compressors at them. If you see those two white boxes in the middle of the screen, that's actually a diaphragm compressor, where we take our boiler off, compress it to 5,000 PSI or 6,000 PSI and put it into the storage tubes to get dispensed to the fueling station. So we actually don't have to have boil-off losses at these facilities if you have the right level of compression to max those losses. There are some things that are unavoidable. There are some transfer losses with purging near lines. We have to get all those impurities out. That's not able to get captured. But we are actively looking at reliquifiers to be able to just condense and reliquify any boil-off vapor, largely for our stationary applications where you have liquid hydrogen just sitting in a storage tank for a large amount of time, so. Something Plug is very actively pursuing and optimizing for our own value chain and we plan to roll out to the broader market. Great, thank you very much, Ian. Next question, for cars or fleet vehicles, do you have a good breakeven point of where it makes sense to use   switch from battery versus fuel cell  Yeah, I can jump in and take that one as well. It depends a lot on the application on how you're actually using that vehicle. Typically, we kind of see that 250 mile mark as you re breakeven for a passenger car. Below that, battery electric is usually just simpler. It also depends on the charging infrastructure availability and your hydrogen fueling station situation in your area. But typically that 250 mile mark is what we would see. Perfect, thank you. Next question, by fast turndown for the liquefier, do you have a typical ramp up rate available  We are actively exploring this. It's something we can go into greater detail. There are some other factors in there. So we're happy to take that kind of question offline if you have specific examples. Chris, if there's any other color you want to add on that, let me know. Oh, the only thing I would add, I mean we're balancing the thermal stress as Ian mentioned earlier, across the system, and trying to maintain the cold temperatures. So turndown in capacity is really about controllability and protecting that aspect, and the control system that we've put in place around this liquefaction system is such. But as Ian mentioned, we need to take a look at a number of variables to accurately answer that question. Great, thank you both. All right, next question. Is the HL4500DP still in concept or available today  HLDP, so the portable refueler. That is, it's still in development demonstration at the moment. I don't believe we've opened it up to the market at this time, but maybe if Eric's online, you could jump in and correct me there. Yeah, we are taking pre-orders on that product right now. It is in its first stages of production. So the first ones are coming off the line here in the next month or so, and definitely we are already taking pre-orders for that product. All right, thank you. Next question. Why do you ICE application as an additional consumption to FC consumption rather than a competitor  I think the question is whether or not internal combustion engine is in competition with fuel cells or it's additional to fuel cells. I think it depends on the application you're talking about for long haul transportations. I know some manufacturers of trucks or owners of fleets of trucks don't want to adopt a fuel cell for the fact that that means moving from mechanical repairs to electrical repairs. It requires different tooling and expertise in-house. So they might not want to diversify their existing truck fleet as such. So in some places you may see it compete, but I think in general, as this technology develops, it'll be accretive to the total volume end market itself. So hope that answered your question. Great, thank you Chris. Next question, what is Plug's view for the optimal size for a liquefier train to minimize capital costs and maximize operation flexibility  Is 30 tons per day train just right or is it a train much bigger than this desired  I have probably encountered this question multiple times a day. It's a great question and I would say the jury's still out. Obviously we saw significant savings going from 15 to 30 tons a day in liquefaction. To give you an idea, we're building two 15 ton a day units and 13, 30 ton a day units. So when we look at our business cases and the volume that we're trying to serve, we see significant savings at scale. I think the market itself is looking beyond 30 tons per day. We certainly are ourselves. We expect to see an incremental savings in scaling up to 50, 60, 70 times, whatever it should be. But then when you go into larger scale, pipe sizes, valve sizes, cold box sizes, all the equipment gets to a point to where you are now bumping up against the threshold for over the road transportation, modularization. You're moving into what we term stick built facilities that could have increased costs associated with construction and installation and also delivery time. So where the market will settle out, we don't know, but we do think that there will be a larger scale liquefier. Again, this has to be married with the increase in demand and the market growth, right. But we do think there will be significant savings when you look at a million dollars per ton of installation costs. We'll see that significantly drop as we get into the larger facilities beyond 30. Hope that answered your question. Thank you, Chris. Next question, does the plug liquefaction process require any steam  Steam  It does not, no. All righty. Next one. Does Plug self-perform the engineering of hydrogen plants or do you have partnerships with outside engineering construction firms  We do not self-perform. We're not a facility engineer or constructor, but as the question asked, we certainly have developed good relationships with the EPC providers that are building our existing facilities. And how we execute and how that EPC to OEM contract is executed, really can drive how the total installed costs plays out in a facility. So these are new facilities. There's not a lot of existing data and knowledge based in the industry for these facilities. So these EPC contractors as well are learning as we're going through this, but it's those learnings that are reapplied in the future examples and future projects that are going to start to lower costs. These EPC and just projects are littered with risk buckets and contingency buckets and layers of markup that are really driving up costs. And so the more that you can engage with an EPC contractor and talk about the optimization of these interfaces I highlighted earlier, that's really going to be what's lowering the risk, lowering the contingency and ultimately the installed costs. Great, thank you. Next question, why are liquid hydrogen tanks limited to 18,000 gallons at customer site  I can jump in on that one. So that 18,000 gallon typically correlates to 10,000 pounds of hydrogen fuel and you start reaching the PSM threshold above that size class. So above that there's another safety layer that you would have to go through for all of those refueling sites, which is why we keep it just under that threshold. Perfect, thank you, Ian. Next question, what is the molecular efficiency of the hydrogen liquefiers  I've never heard a phrase like that. I'm not sure, molecular efficiency, but in the liquefaction realm, we typically use the specific energy consumption, which is kilograms liquefied per kilowatt hour of electricity. Plug guarantees less than 11 kilowatt hours per kilograms. Perfect, thank you both. All right, next question. What is the status of the Georgia plant  Seemed to get a lot of questions about that. It's currently in commissioning phase. We had analyst day out there not too long ago when we partially commissioned part of the plant, but we're in commissioning mode and we'll have further updates at our symposium in October. Great, thank you, Chris. And I apologize, the questions are coming in quick. So I'm trying to keep up with them here. How do the production rates and purity of hydrogen obtained through fermentation compared to those obtained through conventional methods like steam methane reforming and electrolysis  Was the question around the hydrogen purity of fermented hydrogen or off gas from fermentation  You mind reading that one more time, Meryl  Yeah, no, sorry. How do the production rates and purity of hydrogen obtained through fermentation compared to those obtained through conventional methods like steam methane reforming and electrolysis  Let's see, I'm not personally familiar with the fermentation process for producing hydrogen. I know there's a lot of anaerobic gestures and things like that. Typically, there are different impurities you need to be aware of when you're dealing with different production sources, whether that's biogas or some kind of chemical processing. And the challenge is really when you get to the liquefier. So your liquefier has a pre-cooling stage. So roughly kind of the minus 280 to minus 310 range, around liquid nitrogen temperatures. So any molecule that's going to freeze out in that range needs to be removed, which is almost everything except for nitrogen, argon, oxygen and CO. So any water vapor, any hydrocarbons, all need to be removed to less than one part per million levels on the front end of the plant. So whether that's a PSA or a temperature swing absorber, that purification process will vary depending on the feed stock of hydrogen for that. Great, thank you, Ian. Can you please clarify the benefit of the H2 cycle versus HE cycleSure, so typically smaller liquefiers, so kind of your sub 10 tons per day, some of your 15 tons per day, will use helium refrigerant for the liquefaction stage. So they are actually using helium and expanding that through turbo expanders. Now, helium is not as efficient and it's not as efficient of a refrigerant. So your specific energy consumption increases. Essentially your OPEX increases. However, the equipment is slightly cheaper for helium, because it doesn't have to deal with the explosion requirements that hydrogen equipment does. So your CapEx is lower. So typically we see that that breakeven in OpEx versus CapEx at around 15 tons per day, where it now makes sense to transition over to hydrogen as your refrigerant in that liquefaction stage. Great, thank you. And what is the pressure of the liquid hydrogen that you produce  Oh, sorry, I was reading questions there. Can you say that one more time  No problem. What is the pressure of the liquid hydrogen that you produce  That pressure can actually vary slightly depending on the facility storage tank philosophy. Typically we output our liquid at 10 PSI gauge and can vary up to even a 30 PSI gauge, depending on the storage tanks at that facility. Perfect, thank you. And what is the reason for the two different dispensing pressures of the portable refueling stations  That dispensing pressure is usually dictated by the end-use application. So a lot of like, you know, forklift material handling applications use 350 bar standard pressure, so it's about 5,000 PSI. And then a lot of your passenger vehicles for, your Toyota's Mirai s, and Hyundai s and Honda s, those have a 700 bar refueling system, so about 10,000 PSI in your passenger vehicle. So that's not necessarily dictated by us. That's just what's out there in the market. Those are your two common fueling pressures. Great, thanks Ian. And I believe this is another one for you. If hydrogen is explosive to the environment, what precautions are taken to avoid the explosive nature of hydrogen  So, hydrogen is a fuel just like any other fuel, whether it's, diesel, propane, natural gas, they all have different safety characteristics with them. Some of the benefits of hydrogen is that it's the lightest molecule we have, so it goes up and dissipates much faster than anything else around it. It dissipates at 20 meters a second, so it won't pool on the ground like other fuels do. So the main thing with hydrogen is just isolation, so isolating your storage source if you do have a leak, being able to turn that source of hydrogen off. And then ventilation, don't allow your hydrogen to accumulate to flammable mixtures in any location. So vent it to the outside, just let it dissipate into the atmosphere. So our plants are all designed with these philosophies in mind. There's fire detection, there's hydrogen leak detection all throughout the facilities. Vent stacks are very common with hydrogen. You basically just vent it up above everybody's head safely so it can just dissipate out into the atmosphere. Perfect, thank you. Next question, can you talk about supply chain  Are most of the parts manufactured in the U.S.  It depends on how you look at it. You can look at it many different ways. You can do it by equipment count or part count. You can do it by percent of CapEx, there's different ways you can look at that. But in general, our supply chain is spread out across, and I would say most products that are serving the liquefaction market are spread out across Europe and North America. This scope of supply is relatively new to the market, so the supply chain is pretty small. But I can tell you, with things that we're doing with our supply chain, where we're building in volume, we're asking our supply chain to diversify, whether to serve different markets, whether that's to meet specifications, delivery or subject matter expertise. Various reasons we're asking our supply chain to look at continental delivery or manufacturing to serve, to broaden our reach into different markets, so. Great, thanks, Chris. Next question, what type of heat transfer or vaporizer equipment is required during the dispensing operation to change hydrogen phase from liquid to high-pressure gas  So in those fueling stations, let me pull a picture up here. Typically, so we actually have liquid pumps at these sites. So we're actually pumping that liquid in a piston pump. So most of that phase change actually happens in the pump itself. So it comes in as slightly sub-cooled liquid, and it gets pressurized to roughly 6,000 PSI. So that hydrogen is actually supercritical at that point. So it has changed phase into a supercritical state. It's no longer separable liquid vapor phase. So it comes out of that pump as supercritical hydrogen, and it is warmed up through our piping and in these vaporizers right here. So these are just standard aluminum vaporizers to warm that to ambient pressures before we put it in our storage tubes. Great, thank you. Next question, what indicators in the market should we follow to give us a sense that hydrogen demand is growing  That's a good question and I wish we all knew the answer to this, but it's a matter of   let me see if I can pull this up. It s a matter to a lot of these growth drivers here. So if you look at policy, that could be a big indicator. When you sector out geographically, Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, they all have different drivers. Europe and what happened during Ukraine and their heavy push for decarburization, they are solving for a little bit different equation than maybe the U.S. or Asia Pacific. And they may look at a different mix of hydrogen and ammonia in those sectors. So, I would say when you look at indicators, you want to follow public policy, which obviously I think would encompass both government incentives and regulatory policy, as well as monitoring the OEMs in these sectors and their commitment to developing technology in the fuel cell market or shipping market as well. So it's   again, it's an early market right now, but that's kind of how we monitor various sectors to understand when they'll be coming online or what scale they will be demanding. Its estimated Europe will have a demand of roughly 20 million tons per year by 2030. Their ability to produce a green molecule within Europe is limited due to access to renewable resources. And within Europe, you're going to see areas of export versus areas of import based on their access to renewable. And again, that's just on the green side of things. I think if you look at what Europe is doing, specifically Germany, in mandating retail fuel usage, that would be a good indicator that the need for liquid is going to be coming in the near future. So hard to answer in a nutshell, but basically these growth drivers as highlighted on the slide, those will lead you to areas that will highlight future demand. Great. Thank you. Next question. You've indicated liquid hydrogen is a good application for mining trucks. Any experience with this application  How would you engineer supply for 100 trucks with consumption of 50 tons per day  You want to tag team this one, Ian  I have my thoughts here. So, look, it's a developing market right now. And if you can develop the fuel cell technology itself or combustion, whatever it ends up utilizing, our estimate, because of the remoteness of these areas, the tough terrain that these areas, you know it's not like they have smooth roads that these transportation and low vehicles are going across. You're going to need close proximity production and distribution just to save on losses and other types of dynamics that are affecting mining. It is an area that is a high emitting sector. That is, the folks that we've been engaged with have a desire and are putting dollars into investments to understand what that looks like, adopting hydrogen as a fuel. So we have a ways to go before we fully see that sector really scale up. Ian, we've lost your audio I think. Well, might be his headphones. Okay. Well we can close that question now, for now. Yeah. All right. We will move on to the next question here. What are the primary energy sources and methods used in the liquefaction of hydrogen  And how do these energy intensive processes impact the overall feasibility and sustainability of hydrogen as energy carriers  That s a long   I ll probably give a presentation just on that question. Which question is that, so I can reference it  Question 53.Got you. Thank you. When you look at   so first questions, what are the primary energy sources and methods used for the liquefaction of hydrogen  I would say, we look at all forms of energy, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, you know any clean fuel or energy source is something that Plug is looking to utilize. That's really about the carbon intensity of the energy itself. When you look at liquefaction, you're in   because it is energy intensive, it's not near as energy intensive as the electrolysis aspect of this. But if you just look at the specific energy consumption, you can get blinded into solving for one answer. There are lower efficiency technologies that can be deployed. We could deploy one. The challenge with that is, you typically get there by adding rotating equipment, right. And that additional rotating equipment introduces new complexities, controllability and reliability. The more rotating equipment, the more opportunities for points of failure. You've got challenges with, well, your increased capital might not outweigh the savings on the energy. So when we look at power bands within certain regions, if the internal rate of return on capital savings can beat out energy savings in those aspects, so over a certain period of time. So you have to look at it dynamically. You can't just look at it statically at one metric. Would you add anything to that, Ian  I don't know if you can   have audio.Am I back  Can you hear me again  Yeah.Okay, perfect. No, I think you nailed it there on low energy. We certainly could go build lower energy liquefiers, as Chris mentioned, primarily by adding additional turbo expanders. They're fairly expensive and they limit your operational flexibility. So those plants would want to operate at a single point, 24 7, with very known and constant cooling water supply temperatures. They are not going to be able to vary or have the flexibility that our system does. And so we consciously went with the flexible route, because that suited our internal applications. And that's where we see the market, at least in the near term, being headed.Great. Thank you both. We have time for a few more. So next question. Can you discuss the cost drivers for liquid hydrogen  Certainly. So when you look at your cost drivers, electricity is a big part of that, especially if its electrolysis based hydrogen. You do have that energy input at the front end. Obviously you have your capital costs of your plants and the larger your plant, typically the lower production costs on  1 per kilogram basis. Then after kind of the spigot price of your liquefaction facility, you have your transportation costs. So that's your liquid tankers, how far you need to transport that. And that piece right there is typically why we go to liquefaction and liquefy our hydrogen. That transportation costs on  12 per kilogram basis is much less for liquid deliveries than it is for gaseous tube trailers because of that energy density. It's roughly eight times fewer loads for a liquid delivery versus gaseous tube trailers. And then at the site, you have additional infrastructure costs there. There are some power costs associated with either compressing or pumping that hydrogen to get to your end use application, whether that's 350 bar or 700 bar. So that's typically your value chain. You have your CapEx and OpEx and electricity consumption at your different stages of your value chain, depending on what you're dispensing into. Great, thank you. Are there plans to use your liquefaction technology for other potential applications  I'm not sure if the question is more centered around liquefying other products or providing liquid hydrogen for other applications. If the answer is the first, the answer is no. This is very specific to hydrogen. If the rationale was more associated with new applications, really it's about where the hydrogen molecule was consumed. We are constantly evaluating whether it's industrial processes or distribution facilities or transportation. All these sectors have different constraints that they're solving for. We see the industrial sector, whether it's steel, concrete, what have you or even refining. When you move into higher volume, you're probably moving more into gaseous rather than liquid, and that's just surely due to the amount of transportation and energy and costs associated with transportation good side here. So typically in those high consumption applications, you're going to have gas connection or pipeline connection in those areas. There's probably a volume that we haven't exactly calculated, in which it doesn't make sense to transport liquid, but you can get a sense of that very quickly when you look at the volumes and the number of trucks that would be needed to supply consistently for those applications. Awesome. Well, I think that brings us right up to time. So a huge thank you to our presenters today and for all of you who joined. Ian, Chris, I'll turn it over to you guys if you have any final things you want to say. But as we said, stay tuned. Next month is our Plug Symposium and the registration is right on the right-hand side of your screen there. So thank you everyone very much. Yes. Thanks, Meryl, and thanks for everyone that took the time to join. It's an exciting industry to be in. It's an emerging market. So stay tuned, its exciting products that are starting to be developed for this market. Yeah, thank you all for participating. And just as a last note here, if you do have any follow-up questions after the webinar, our Contact Us links are at the bottom of this slide here. So feel free to reach out. Thank you all. Thanks everyone. ",5,2023-09-27T15:24:02.000-04:00
Tesla Q3 Earnings Watch: All Eyes On Energy Margins,"  has long portrayed itself as  more than a car company  by showcasing its various other business lines, especially its Energy Generation   Storage vertical, known as Tesla Energy. As I CEO Elon Musk has for years promised big things from Tesla's energy segment. In 2019,  that Tesla Energy would soon be growing far more rapidly than its automotive businessMusk doubled down on this prediction less than a year later,  that Tesla Energy would eventually eclipse its automotive segment altogetherIn the years since, the reality has proven far more prosaic. While Tesla's energy business remains Tesla's only non-EV business segment of any meaningful size, its growth has fallen far short of expectations. Even so, Tesla Energy showed remarkable margin improvement last quarter, even as Tesla's automotive segment experienced considerable margin compression. That improvement, and whether it can be sustained, is worth examining ahead of the company's next earnings announcement on Oct. 18.Almost since its inception, the energy generation side of Tesla's Energy Generation   Storage business has been something of a problem child for the company. Tesla's solar division started out as one of many largely undifferentiated players in a crowded solar panel installation market. The company launched the Tesla Energy brand in 2015  solar deployments that year totaled 750 megawatts  MW . However, it was not until the following year that the epic saga of Tesla's foray into solar truly began.In October 2016, Tesla announced , a solar panel installer. As luck would have it, the chairman of SolarCity's board at the time was none other than Elon Musk. The company, which was run by a pair of brothers who also happened to be Musk's cousins, had found itself in a serious financial pickle. At the heart of SolarCity's woes was an inability to service the massive debt load it had accumulated in its ultimately quixotic effort to sustain top-line growth. Tesla's buyout offer was a lifeline for a company rapidly approaching insolvency. Musk touted the tie-up as a way for Tesla to leapfrog the competition to become the nation's top solar energy player. He also claimed it would help Tesla roll out its Solar Roof, a brand new product that was, he said, already ready for commercial launch.As things turned out, the planned expansion of Tesla's solar business never materialized. In fact, the company saw a steep decline in solar deployments. The 846 MW it deployed in 2016 was a new record, one which stands to this day. Deployments fell 38.3  in 2017 and another 37.6  in 2018. 2019 marked the nadir, with solar deployments of just 173 MW during the entire year, a 47  drop from the year before and down fully 80  from 2016.During the next couple of years, Tesla's diminished solar business showed some signs of bouncing back from the bottom. In 2020, solar deployments actually rose, albeit only modestly, with full-year deployments rising 18.5  to 205 MW. While growth accelerated in 2021, seeing a 68  jump in deployments to 345 MW, the positive momentum soon began to dissipate. Tesla managed 348 MW in solar deployments, eking out a year-over-year increase of less than 1 .This year, solar deployments are once again treading water. Tesla deployed 133 MW in the first half of 2023, 13.6  less than it managed during the same period last year, putting Tesla on track for yet another down year. In its , Tesla stated that it was only able to deploy only 66 MW during the quarter  predominantly due to a high interest rate environment that is causing postponement of solar purchasing industry-wide.Stagnant deployment numbers are not the only sour note for Tesla's solar business. Its bet on the Solar Roof has also largely failed to pay off. Tesla had promised 1,000 installations per week in 2019. As of March 2023, Tesla had managed .The storage side of the  Energy Generation   Storage story  is somewhat happier, at least by comparison. Tesla first announced plans to use its battery technology to develop a battery home storage system in 2015. This evolved into the Powerwall, which entered mass production in 2017. Tesla introduced a utility-scale product, the Megapack, in 2019.In stark contrast to its stagnant solar deployment figures, Tesla's storage deployments have been growing at a strong clip. While dipping slightly on a sequential basis, the 40 gigawatt-hours  GWH  of energy storage deployments Tesla reported in Q2 represented a 222  increase from the same period last year. Tesla  the increase to  the ongoing ramp of our first dedicated Megapack factory  Megafactory  in Lathrop, CA,  which the company has promised is just  the first of many  such facilities.Tesla's energy storage segment is growing fast thanks in no small part to rising demand for utility-scale energy storage solutions that can support industrial activities and power grids that are currently reliant principally on fossil fuel power sources. There is undoubted demand for this type of product. However, its real-world viability as a true replacement for existing systems remains far from proven. The extreme energy density of lithium-ion batteries makes their use at utility scale inherently dangerous. The past few years have seen serious fires and explosions occur at battery storage facilities from Arizona to Australia. While industry leaders are constantly seeking to improve designs in order to prevent recurrence of such incidents, they are limited by the simple fact that the technology is so new that there has been little opportunity for large-scale testing. That can be a problem, as Wired  last monthRegardless of these issues, Tesla is obviously gaining some traction. Thus far, Tesla has been able to find sufficient demand for its rising production, and there is little indication that this will change in the near term.Now that we have a solid picture of each component of Tesla Energy's business, what can it tell us about Tesla the company and Tesla the stockFortunately, Tesla breaks out revenue and cost of revenue attributable to Tesla Energy. Unfortunately, Tesla does not separate energy generation revenue from energy storage revenue within the segmentIn terms of Tesla's solar operations, the fundamental economics have always been iffy, to say the least. When Tesla's automotive business was turning the corner into profitability, its solar margins . Things have hardly improved since, as the company has failed to capture any of the hoped-for economies of scale that were supposed to come with increased production and deployment. The Solar Roof has largely been a bust, while its solar panel installation business competes in a commodity-priced market in which even the biggest players can struggle to break even. However, the profitability of Tesla's solar operations is almost a non-issue at this point, as the deployment counts are negligible compared to storage.Turning to the storage side of the business, we already know that Tesla is selling its battery storage system in ever-increasing volume. In Q2 this year, Tesla deployed 3.7 GWh of storage, 2.27 times the 1.133 GWh deployed in the same period the previous year. However, revenue has failed to grow at the same rateEven so, Tesla reported a major improvement in gross margins for Energy Generation   Storage last quarter. That is rather perplexing. Increased utilization and efficiency of its battery storage production operations can offer some explanation of the improvement, especially in year-over-year terms. The sequential step-change from Q1, however, is less easy to explain. Despite a dip in deployments and revenue, cost of revenue reportedly fell considerably further to result in a nearly 80  improvement in gross margin. That is impressive on its face, but it may prove difficult to sustain. Tesla's Q3 results will hopefully be able to shed greater light on the matter, namely whether the sequential improvement in Q2 was the result of one-off factors in Q2, or an actual durable improvement in operating efficiency.Tesla Energy has become more interesting than ever following its Q2 earnings report. While its automotive business continued to experience significant margin compression as a result of price cuts, its energy segment saw massive margin improvement. While Tesla Energy is still just a very , accounting for less than 6  of total revenue, it is critical to the narrative of Tesla being  more than just an automaker  on which its rich valuation partly hangs.Investors should pay very close attention to Tesla Energy's numbers when Tesla reports .If Tesla, Inc. Q3 earnings can show sustained margin improvement in its energy segment, it could help shift investors' focus from its ever-deteriorating automotive margins. That may be enough to sustain the stock in the face of flagging automotive profitability-at least for a time.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

A Resurgence Of Nuclear Energy?,"As of 2022, nuclear power wasPer the International Energy Agency  IEA , in the last 50 years, nuclear energy has averted over 60 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions - approximately equal to two years  worth of total energy-related emissions worldwide.Nuclear energy s consistent power output offers an efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuels and a solution to escalating energy demands, especially in rural regions where access to electricity remains sparse.Moreover, nuclear plants, unlike intermittent renewables such as wind and solar, maintain nearly full capacity operations. This ensures power delivery even during extreme weather conditions - anSource  Energy Institute. Data as of December 2022.The world's nuclear infrastructure is aging, with many reactors nearing their design end-of-life. The premature decommissioning of these reactors might disrupt energy transition plans, potentially leading to an additional 4 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions, per the IEA.Substituting nuclear capacity with renewables like wind or solar would demand an unparalleled deployment pace. The decline in nuclear power could also require an extra  1.6 trillion in investments from advanced economies, translating to higher consumer electricity prices.Importantly, in many scenarios   on a levelized cost basis over several decades   prolonging a reactor's lifespan is estimated to be more economical than constructing new renewable energy infrastructures.The nuclear sector is far from static  it's evolving. The spotlight on technology development in the space is currently on Small Modular Reactors  SMRs  which promise heightened efficiency, affordability, and flexibility.Their compact size and enhanced safety attributes make them highly adaptable, even holding the potential to replace older fossil fuel units.The market for SMRs, at present, is projected to grow to around  6.8 billion by 2030  around a 2.3  compound annual growth rate , with companies like NuScale Power  and BWX Technologies  at the forefront.Certain SMR designs have the capability to recycle existing nuclear waste as fuel. Additionally, nuclear fusion, the energy source of the sun and stars, is undergoing intensive research.Companies like Helion Energy and Nucor  are collaborating to harness this immense power. And on the tech frontier, giants like Microsoft  are exploring nuclear energy to power energy-intensive operations like artificial intelligence.Uranium prices have seen considerable fluctuations recently. Factors like long lead times for mining projects, reduced capital expenditure on new sources, existing supply deficits, and geopolitical tensions, notably in Europe, have driven prices upward.These dynamics are influencing the broader industry. Utility companies are grappling with escalating costs, whereas uranium miners are poised to gain, attracting increased investor interest.Source  S P Global Market Intelligence. Data as of October 2022.Source  S P Global Market Intelligence. Data as of October 2022.A glance at Japan provides a lens into the evolving nuclear narrative. After the Fukushima disaster, Japan curtailed its nuclear operations. However, faced with the global energy crisis and geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Japan is reviving its nuclear reactors, marking a significant policy pivot.Other nations like Germany, Belgium, and India are also re-evaluating their nuclear strategies. As countries grapple with energy security and decarbonization, nuclear energy, with its promise of reliability and zero emissions, is regaining prominence.The drive towards decarbonization, coupled with geopolitical shifts, has elevated nuclear energy's significance in the energy transition narrative.

Encore Wire: The Shorts Are Offside,"This is a follow-up and an  encore  piece to my original coverage, published back on November 11, 2022 , on  .Let's start with the elephant inGiven WIRE's robust free cash flow generation, this savvy management team continues to be effective stewards of shareholders' capital and has done a laudable job balance reinvesting in the business via smart Capex programs as well as aggressively buying back its own stock. Specifically, on the buyback front, from October 26, 2022 through JulySaid differently, the shorts aggressive tactics combined with Mr. Market's unwillingness to reward WIRE shareholders with much, if any, multiple expansion have paradoxically enabled this management team to take advantage of the situation and aggressively  opportunistically buying back shares. Moreover, back when WIRE reported its Q2 FY 2023 results, WIRE's Board of Directors re-upped its 2 million share buyback authorization, through March 31, 2024.Given WIRE's strong  and history of carrying out its buyback program, I'm befuddled as to why the shorts continue to double down on their bet, and risk getting further and further offside.Further, if we look at the composition of the holders, as of June 29, 2023, and we know insiders own 5   or about 900k shares , and passive ETF operators own about 5.5 million shares  see BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street , this only leaves a true float of about 10.4 million. In other words, ETF holders are perpetually long  unless there are index changes  and insiders are long term investors. Therefore, depending on price, of course, with continued buyback pressure, and a company that only trades about 250K shares per day, it will be very difficult for the shorts to be able to actually even attempt to cover this bet.Now that we covered the compelling short squeeze setup, let's talk about the business. First off, this management team is exceptional good. They have methodically built a better mousetrap.Through vertical integration, strong supplier relationships, smartly re-investing in the business, the best customer service  fill rates and having the best selection - think shapes to match demand application  use case , and retaining a skilled work force, the company is best in class. In this business, you have to be able to source the copper, in the right shapes to make the finished products demanded by customers, and get the orders to customers within two days, coast to coast.Arguably, the shorts are simply looking at mean reversion and WIRE's hockey stick growth of EPS and Adj. EBITDA and thinking this is purely cyclical.Lo and behold, and WIRE's management reminded Mr. Market, during its July 26, 2023 Q2 FY 2023 conference call, as well as on prior calls, copper spreads peaked back in mid-2021.Yet, strangely, the shorts somehow think WIRE's earnings, which have hockey sticked  from  3.69  FY 2020  to  26.22  FY 2021  to  36.91  FY 2022  are going to somehow revert back to  4 bucks.Sorry shorts  This cycle is total different, WIRE's market share is materially better, and the demand drivers and copper tightness are totally different.What WIRE can control is volume  i.e. market share  and they shipped a lot more pounds compared to pre-Covid.See here  emphasis addedSee hereThis was the quarter where the WIRE short thesis was going to show up.......as Copper prices got dinged by China  arguably  playing games, macro fears tied to interest rates and spillover effect of the Regional banking crisis.Guess what  During Q2 FY 2022, WIRE still put up  6.01 in EPS.In addition to the fact that WIRE has built a great business, where they compete on service, fill rates, and having the right product, there are two massively bullish tailwinds that could sink the shorts.1  Despite the weaker prices on China fears  or playing game with copper inventories in their warehouses , the physical copper market is extremely tight., per WIRE's management, there are at least 8 gov't programs designed to invest in the U.S.'s infrastructure. We're talking about  1 trillion bucks.... All of these infrastructure projects need copperSee hereDemand is multi-faceted and not going away.And to give readers a great example of how in the weeds this management team is on the demand side, see this commentary, by WIRE's CFOWe 16.8 million shares x  174 equals a market capitalization of  2.92 billion. As of June 30, 2023, WIRE had  667 million of cash on hand. So, we're talking about a  2.25 billion enterprise value.The company is smartly re-investing in its business. They are going to spend on CAPEXAnd  75 million is already spent, this year. And they spent  350 million, the past three years.This year, consensus EPS estimates are now pegged  21.36 in EPS. So that about  400 million of operating cash flow  notwithstanding changes to working capital .In terms of the technicals, as of yesterday, WIRE punched back through both its 50 DMA and 200 DMA.In closing, simply put, I don't understand the short thesis here, as the valuation of just north of 5.5X EV  normalized Adj. EBITDA is low. The company has a great balance sheet and has another big buyback program authorized by its Board of Directors. Lastly, and perhaps equally as important, very tight physical copper supply and massive demand driving tailwinds are very supportive of solid copper prices despite macro headwinds in China. If people want to bet against China, that is their prerogative, but either way, shorting Encore Wire Corporation seems liked a really mis-guided short thesis.

First Solar: The Sustainable Energy Giant On Sustained Growth Path,"Editor's note  Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Stanley Nwosu as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. First Solar  is the premiere and largest solar panel manufacturer in the entire western hemisphere. The company's superior technology and execution increase efficiency and drive down costs. Its R D in thin film tandem technology promises groundbreaking solar energy conversion yield. The company is growing capacity to meet growing demand, which in turns achieves economy of scale. The results of these show up in increasing margins, decreasing costs, increasing profitability and cashflows. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a welcome boost to growth and profitability. First Solar is undervalued. I rate it a strong buy. Technical analysis indicatesFirst Solar took the plunge into solar panel production back in 2002 with its first manufacturing plant in Perrysburg, Ohio. This was a time when people were not sure whether the solar industry would live or die. However, the company has continued to wax strong, increasing its manufacturing capacities, from a lowly nameplate capacity of 210 MW  to an expected nameplate capacity of 25 gigawatts by 2026. That would represent an 11,804.76   1GW   1000MW  increase in production capacity over that time span. Similarly, actual annual production of solar panels was at 21.5 MW per annum  and is now expected to reach 22.5 GW by 2026. To put this in context, the cumulative production of solar panels at First Solar, in the 20-year period from 2002 through 2022 was 50 gigawatts, but with this growth in manufacturing capacity and the attendant growth in productivity, it would only take the company less than 2.5 years to reach and surpass the same 50 gigawatts of production. That is an incredible growth storyAnother competitive advantage of First Solar is its superior execution and technology. First Solar takes pride in its investment in R D. And these investments have continued to pay good 'dividend'. Just from 2018 till now, it has gone from the Series 6 modules to the Series 6-plus modules capable of generating up to 480 Watts of electricity, to the Series 7 modules capable of up to 550 Watts of electricity. This is further optimized, in the CdTe CuRe Module  expected to launch in 2024 , for degradation rate, shading response, temperature response, air moisture spectral response, light-induced degradation, to yield  4  more energy giving the company  3.5X pricing power. Essentially, the solar panels of the company are optimized to produce electricity come rain, come shine.However, First Solar is not stopping here. The company is working on yet another game-changing technology - thin film CuRe bifacial CdTe modules. This would improve conversion efficiency, that is how much sunlight it converts to electricity compared to the amount of sunlight that it receives, from 15  to 25 . This technology was underpinned by the acquisition of Evolar, a European leader in perovskites and CIGS thin film technology. Based on this thin film technology, the company hopes to leapfrog to yet another groundbreaking Tandem technology, which combines the CdTe module and the c-Si module to raise conversion efficiency from 25  to a staggering 35  . This science behind this is that sunlight is first captured and converted to electric energy by the top module, and the portion of the sunlight that manages to escape conversion by the top module is captured and converted to electric energy by the bottom module. Once this 35  conversion efficiency threshold is reached, I believe that it would be final bye-bye to fossil fuels across the world. And with the company's increasing spend on research and development, it is sure to remain at the cutting edge of solar panel technology for a long time.In execution, First Solar employs vertical manufacturing process. This means that they would not be waiting on some third party, say, a company in China for example, to complete any part of their manufacturing process. This is also consistent with the de-risking of their logistics process, making them relatively immune to the vagaries of an unmitigated global supply chain. In summary, the superior technology and execution of First Solar make them the ExxonMobil equivalent of the solar energy industry. ExxonMobil occupied its premiere position in the oil and gas industry for a long time due to its superior technology and execution. Those are the same attributes that First Solar brings to the renewable energy industry.The growth in First Solar's production capacity has been in response to the growth in demand for its products - solar panels. From end of 2022 through July 27, 2023, booked volumes grew from 61.4 GW to 77.8 GW  backed by 100  security , 6.7 GW confirmed  backed by  100  security , and 16 GW in the process of being booked  pipeline  with 5.5GW of that already in mid-late stages of the booking process. Clearly, demand is growing by double digits. Another obvious but comforting characteristics of these booked contracts is that they are backed by financial securities. Every booked order is backed by solid 'collateral' analogous to the take-or-pay contracts that are rife in the fossil fuel industry. So, it is not just numbers on the book, these are actual money in the bank essentially. Of course, First Solar has to fulfil their own part of the contract as well, which is essentially why they are in business, anyway.To make these contracts  booked orders  all the more impregnable, First Solar hedges the associated price risk by securing 85  of the frames of the modules of all booked contracts, and 95  of their freight costs. That way, the company is able to lock-in a large portion of their profits from these contracts, irrespective of any changes in their manufacturing and delivery costs.It may be necessary to point out that First Solar had been a profitable company for over 20 years before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  of 2022. It is also no gainsaying that IRA has provided additional boosts both to its capacity expansion and to the growing demand for its products. For example, the IRA provides that US government could put up about 24  of the capital expenditure required for capacity expansion, which the company repays back to the government over a 6-year period. In addition, the government provides tax credit starting at 100  in 2023 and ending in 2032 at 25 . However, the IRA passed last year was not the basis for First Solar's success over 2 decades running now. What the IRA does is act as a catalyst that provides additional 'escape velocity' for the company's growth and profitability to move higher into the 'stratosphere', carrying her investors along for the ride.What is interesting is that at the time the IRA would completely expire in 2032, the net zero emission targets of many countries and companies would be within sight - many by 2040 and some by 2050. I imagine that there would be a frenzy of orders flowing in to First Solar from these companies and countries in their scramble to meet their net zero emission targets. The implication is that First Solar would continue to grow in both production capacity and profitability as far as the eye can see.Additionally, in 2019, long before the IRA, First Solar was already determined to be competitive vs its fossil fuel and nuclear competitionFurthermore, the self-sustainability of First Solar's business is evident in their financial data. For example, the company's cash balance at the end of 2nd quarter, 2023 was  1.899 billion. This compared to existing debt of  435 million in the same period, resulting in a cash-to-debt ratio of  4.36 1. To put this in context, all the other so-called competitors to First Solar, including Canadian Solar , SunPower Corporation , and Sunrun Inc. , have cash-to-debt ratios  1.0. In fact, the one common thread that runs through them is the high level of debt that they are laboring under. They are all heavily indebted. And the current higher for longer interest rate environment has further compounded their woes. This is reflected in their downbeat business forecasts. To a large extent, First Solar is insulated from the whims of the prevailing interest rate regime. This is because, the company's customers are mainly utilities, many of which have credible credit standing, and whose projects are likely backed by take-or-pay power purchase agreements. I have compiled the cash-to-debt ratios in the table below for comparisonFrom the table above, based on cash-to-debt ratio alone, it is easy to see that First Solar is in a class of its own as far as financial strength is concerned vis-a-vis the others who may be tethering on the verge of financial distress. On this score alone, First Solar is, far and away, the more financially stable company. In addition, the company has a 5-year credit facility of  1.0 billion, currently undrawn. This credit facility is like an extra ammo that the company does not need but is happy to have, all the same, for good measure. So, there is no risk of financial distress at First Solar. The company is clearly able to meet its debt obligations with the substantial cash pile at its disposal.In the same vein, First Solar boasts of double digits positive gross margin, and double digits positive operating margin even after you subtract the effects of the IRA  government incentives . These positive margins are expected to keep expanding in the coming years.Investors would be even more delighted to discover that at the same time that margins are expected to expand, the costs of producing 1 watt of electricity are also expected to fall at First Solar.This is further testament to the company's execution and economy of scale. Decreasing costs and increasing margins, that is the holy grail of profitability and sustainability.There are many ways to value a company, including the intrinsic value method, adjusted net present value method, EBITDA multiple method, etc. But extensive valuation is without the scope of this article. However, for the purposes of our discussion, here, if we look at the forward P E multiple for First Solar, we see that currently, that ratio stands at  150.77 7.82   So, if we hold this multiple constant and assume that the earnings per share would grow at 19.37  per year, just approximately in line with the expected average , then, the company would be earning about  18.95 per share in about 5 years' time. A 19.28 earnings multiple would take the price of the stock to about  365.42 per share. In 10 years' time, that price would be  885.66 share of First Solar, all things being equal. That makes the price today  150.77 share  look cheap to me.First Solar does not have any comparison, in the true sense of it. There is no other publicly traded, pure play solar panel manufacturer that I found in the US. The other companies, like Canadian Solar, that came anywhere close, have other lines of businesses like power storage, project development, etc., that I consider side distractions that make comparison with First Solar difficult. Still, other companies like Sunrun Inc., and SunPower Corporation are primarily into the residential side of the solar business, and worse still, have negative forward EPS values ,  so their comparison with First Solar is not quite apple-to-apple.However, for the sake of our discussion, if we compared these companies based on forward P E multiples alone, against expected growth rate, the picture leaves no one in doubt as which company is the best bet. In estimating the growth rate for Canadian Solar, I used the growth, YoY, in net revenues in the 2Q2023 vs 2Q2022. I thought that this value was more representative of the state of things at Canadian Solar. For context, whereas CSI business line revenues grew 11  YoY in the same period, recurrent energy business line revenues declined by -35   accordingly. Relatedly, Sunrun and SunPower are both expected to post negative forward PEs, so their forward PE ratios could not be calculated.The expected returns in 5 years and 10 years in the table above, everything being equal, speak for themselves. Very few investments boast of such potential returns.Just as in all investments, there are risks in investing in First Solar as well. The first to consider, in my opinion, is technology fail. If their expected technological improvements fail, or if some other company comes up with superior technology that guarantees higher solar energy conversion rate at a cheaper price, then, all bets are off. Another challenge would be if they are not able to continue to grow the size of their addressable markets, then, the company's growth would stall, and with that, its valuation as well. But so long as they can keep their eyes on the ball as far as R D is concerned, to keep pushing the boundaries of solar technology  and so long as they can keep making inroads into the other markets in Asia, Europe, and Africa, then, the company's future would remain on solid footing.From the foregoing analysis, First Solar is the biggest solar panel producer in the entire western hemisphere. It is also clear that the company is experiencing a growth spurt, and that this growth is expected to continue as far as the 'eye' can see. The company is profitable on its own to begin with, and this profitability has been boosted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. First Solar is also committed to research and development which keeps it on the cutting edge of solar panel technology, making it a manufacturer of choice to its customers. It has de-risked its supply chain and manufacturing process making them more reliable. The company has a good risk management process to hedge its price risks per booked contracts to ensure that inflation does not 'eat' too deep into its profits. Forward PE ratio and expected growth rate make the company's stocks look cheap at today's prices. An investor with a 5 - 10-year time horizon could profit handsomely as the stock prices move higher.A look at the stock price chart shows that the stock has broken an upward trend. I would wait to buy at the next strong support around  156 and  150   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Better High Yield Buy: Energy Transfer Or MPLX,"  and   are both high-yield BBB-rated midstream infrastructure businesses. Many investors prefer MPLX given that its distribution growth track record is much more consistent than ET's. Note that MPLX's large jump andThat said, ET has significantly outperformed MPLX in the nearly three years since we added it to our portfolioIn this article, we compare them side by side and offer our take on which is the best buy right now.MPLX owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure andMPLX's assets are typically strategically located within or close to Marathon Petroleum refineries and typically serve as the sole providers for the refinery's specific needs, creating economic barriers to entry for competitors. Moreover, MPLX's long-term 5-10-year contracts with minimum volume commitments for each Marathon asset give it a very stable cash flow profile, regardless of macro conditions in the energy industry and the broader economy.ET, meanwhile, owns and operates an extensive network of natural gas transportation pipelines, including interstate natural gas pipelines, storage facilities, and gathering and processing assets in multiple states. ET also sells natural gas to various customers, including utilities, power plants, and industrial users. Additionally, the company is involved in crude oil transportation, terminalling, and marketing activities, as well as the distribution of petroleum products such as gasoline and motor fuels. It also offers services related to natural gas compression, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide removal, and manages coal and natural resource properties. Unlike MPLX, ET does not have a parent that owns a large stake in it, nor is it beholden to a single large customer.Furthermore, ET has a much larger asset portfolio with an enterprise value that is nearly twice that of MPLX's. Moreover, it generates at least 11  and no more than 28  of its adjusted EBITDA from each of its five business segments  crude oil, NGL   refined products, natural gas interstate transport   storage, midstream, and natural gas intrastate transport   storage , giving it greater diversification than MPLX. Similar to MPLX, however, is the fact that it generates the vast majority of its cash flow  90  of expected adjusted 2023 EBITDA  from commodity price-resistant long-term fee-based contacts. As such, it has a fairly defensive business model that is quite resilient in the face of macro volatility.One important item to note is that - apart from a sharp dip during part of the COVID-19 and Saudi-Russian oil price war-induced energy market crash of 2020 - MPLX has consistently generated significantly better returns on capital than ET has. This indicates that its management team has been a better capital allocator than ET's has over the yearsBoth businesses have been deleveraging in recent years, and both have BBB credit ratings with stable outlooks from S P.ET's leverage ratio is now under its 4.5x long-term target and is likely to stay within the 4.0x-4.5x range for the foreseeable future depending on capital allocation opportunities for ET relative to the attractiveness of retiring rather than refinancing upcoming debt maturities.One major positive for ET is that it is expected to generate between  1.7- 1.8 billion in free cash flow net of distributions in 2024,  2.4 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2025,  3.1 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2026, and  3.5 billion of free cash flow net of distributions in 2027. This should enable it to cover most - if not all - of its upcoming debt maturities over that period of time. As a result, it enjoys significant flexibility in the face of growing uncertainty about the future outlook for interest rates. As a result, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.MPLX, meanwhile, has an even lower leverage ratio of 3.5x, down from 3.7x two years ago and 4.0x four years ago. Moreover, it has well-balanced and very manageable debt maturities in the coming years. Similar to ET, it is expected to generate very healthy levels of free cash flow net of distributions over that time period as well. It is expected to generate  1.2- 1.4 billion in free cash flow net of distributions each year through 2027, equating to a little over  5 billion in free cash flow net of distributions over that span. In comparison, it has about  6 billion in debt maturing over that period, giving it significant capital markets flexibility and minimal need to access bond markets if it chooses not to in the face of rising interest rates. As a result, as with ET, we feel very good not only about the security of its current credit rating but also its distribution level.As already pointed out, both distributions appear to be on very sound footing thanks to the stable cash flow profiles and strong balance sheets for both businesses. Moreover, MPLX is expected to cover its distribution by 1.56x this year and ET is expected to cover its distribution by 1.95x this year, giving both distributions very adequate coverage.Through 2027, MPLX is expected to grow its distribution at a 5.0  CAGR while ET is expected to grow its distribution at a 4.3  CAGR. ET's distribution is likely going to grow at a slower pace than MPLX's because it has more growth opportunities in front of it, so management will be investing in those instead. That being said, it is interesting to note that ET is only expected to grow its DCF per unit at a 4  CAGR over that span whereas MPLX is expected to grow its DCF per unit at a nearly as strong 3.4  pace despite growing its distribution faster and not retaining nearly as much cash as ET is expected to. This is because MPLX tends to generate higher returns on its capital, thereby reducing its need to retain as much cash flow as ET does in order to deliver similar growth rates.ET appears to be significantly cheaper than MPLX on an EV EBITDA and on a P DCF basis, though both offer near identical current distribution yields.ET appears to be the winner here given that it is significantly cheaper than MPLX and its portfolio is also quite a bit more diversified. However, MPLX has generated consistently better returns on capital over the course of its history, its distribution payout has proven to be more consistent, and has grown at a faster clip over the long term. Moreover, MPLX currently offers the same yield as ET and is expected to grow its distribution at a slightly faster clip moving forward while also having a significantly lower leverage ratio. As a result, we can definitely see the case for holding MPLX over ET.However, what gives ET the edge in our view is that it is not beholden to a parent major client like MPLX is to MPC. Between its greater portfolio diversification, a wider array of growth projects, significantly cheaper valuation, and better governance structure, we give the edge to ET, though we rate both as Buys.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Down 45%! I'm Buying The NextEra Energy Crash With Both Hands,"Markets are in turmoil. While the S P 500 is still holding up well, real carnage has taken place in defensive sectors. Looking at the data below, we see that utilities, real estate, and consumer defensive stocks were among the biggest losers of the pastWhat we're dealing with here is the realization that inflation is sticky. This means the Fed will have to keep rates elevated for longer. That wouldn't be such a bad thing if the economy were in better shape.The market is now putting a  90  probability on a  4.50  Federal Funds rate 12 months from now. In August, that number was close to 60 . In the first half of this year, it was 0 .The worst thing on everyone's mind  at least on my mind  is that Mr. Powell may have to choose between protecting the economy versus fighting inflation soon.Looking at the first chart of this article  it is no surprise that energy stocks are doing well in this environment. Energy stocks have pricing power. Most major players have low breakeven prices, healthy balance sheets, and the ability to be profitable at subdued oil prices.Consumer staples, REITs, and regulated utilities are different. While the strongest players have great balance sheets, they often come with high gross debt levels and business models that make it hard to hike prices.Regulated utilities are no different  emphasis addedThis brings me to . On August 11, I  that the company offered a compelling investing opportunity. I was wrong. Since then, the stock has fallen 23 .Now, the stock is down 45  from its all-time high, yet its 10-year total return is still 243 , 130 points above the weighted sector averageAs much as I hate being wrong, I'm doubling down.While we can expect pressure to remain high on utilities, the value is getting great at these levels, which is why I'm writing this article.So, let's get to itIn the lengthy introduction, I already briefly explained the core of the problem  sticky inflation and elevated rates.Bloomberg's  hit the nail on the head.Essentially, NextEra's success is built on three pillars  ownership of Florida Power   Light Co., a reputation for efficiency and cost management, and being the largest renewable power developer in the U.S. I remember in 2020 and 2021 when rates were low, and everyone was in love with renewables. NextEra was one of the most popular stocks on the market.However, the recent fall from grace can be attributed to the troubles faced by its subsidiary, NextEra Energy Partners LP . The subsidiary's reduced expectations for dividend growth and challenges in selling planned projects led to a significant drop in its stock value, impacting the parent company.According to the company  during the September 27 Wolfe Utilities, Midstream   Clean Energy Conference - emphasis addedThis is what Bloomberg wroteIn light of funding challenges and risks related to revenue growth, it also does not help that investors get a better yield buying treasury notes  as seen in the chart below . When it comes to income, there is no need to take huge risks. Especially not when it comes to NEE, which still yields less than 4 .Furthermore, during the aforementioned conference, the company acknowledged a slow start in the renewables market due to inflation, interest rates, and supply chain issues.However, they are optimistic about the market gaining momentum in 2024. Despite increased power purchase agreement  PPA  prices, renewables remain the low-cost generation option.Also, early signs of falling panel and battery prices, along with resolving supply chain uncertainties, are boosting the renewables market. may be one of the most important things to keep in mind when investing. However, I also like to buy good investments at great prices. When averaging down, catching falling knives may not be the worst idea. I've done it many times. In 2020, I did it with energy. This year, I'm doing it with defense contractors.For example, Goldman Sachs  did cut its buy rating from  83 to  73, yet it remained bullish.As reported by I agree with that. The company, which has a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewable energy projects, was very upbeat about its ability to grow its dividend during the .The current dividend yield is 3.6 , backed by a 58  payout ratio and the strong  aforementioned  dividend growth outlook. The company also has dividend aristocrat status and an A  score for consistency on Seeking Alpha's dividend scorecard.While we could see some downside after 2024  less than 10  dividend growth , the company continues to have one of the healthiest balance sheets in its sector.Next year, it is expected to end up with  80 billion in net debt. That's a huge number but less than 5.5x EBITDA. It has an A- credit rating from both S P and Fitch.Valuation-wise, it is also fair to say that the market has priced in a lot of weakness.This year, the market expects 7.6  EPS growth. Next year, that number is expected to be 9.0 . In 2025, that number is expected to be 7.9 .While these numbers are obviously subject to change, we do have an attractive risk reward. Purely technical speaking, if the stock were to hold its 10-year average valuation of 23x earnings, it could return 28  annually through 2025. All of these numbers are visible in the chart below.Even at a lower valuation of 18x earnings, the expected annual total return would be 16 .The problem is finding a bottom. If the economy goes off a cliff, we could see 10  to 20  more downside - especially if it comes with elevated inflation.In that case, we're talking full-blown stagflation.In light of the risks and opportunities, I stick to what I said in my prior article. I like NEE's long-term opportunities. Despite rate and inflation challenges, the company is doing well. Long-term investors looking for a good utility investment may benefit tremendously from buying NEE at these levels.Personally, I started buying NEE shares aggressively. For now, it's mainly a trade, as I'm not sure how much utility exposure I want to hold  in light of other investments . I'm just a big fan of the risk reward and may end up holding shares on a prolonged basis.People who are less aggressive than me  which I highly advise  may benefit from buying shares gradually. If the stock keeps dropping, investors can average down. If the stock takes off, investors have a foot in the door.This strategy is simple and has guided me very well in the past.In a market marred by inflation and rising rates, defensive sectors like utilities, real estate, and consumer staples took a hit, with NextEra Energy experiencing a substantial decline.However, despite challenges faced by its subsidiary and broader market headwinds, NEE remains a resilient investment. The company's trifecta of strengths - ownership of Florida Power   Light Co., efficiency, and renewable power leadership - positions it for growth.Investors should exercise caution but not dismiss NextEra. With a robust balance sheet, optimistic growth projections, and the potential for future dividend increases, NextEra Energy presents a compelling opportunity.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

NextEra Energy Partners Is A Sell: Evaluating CEPF And Take-Under Risk,"NextEra Energy Partners  has plunged to apparently distressed levels, with a distribution yield well into the double digits. The stock has plunged 50  over the past week alone, triggered by an announcement that the company has lowered its targeted distributionIn my last and first report on NEP , I recommended readers to avoid buying the stock. At the time, NEP was highly touted by my peers, but I couldn't reconcile the math to see why this wasn't just a 7  yield with poor growth prospects. The stock has been clobbered since then and now trades lower than it did 10 years ago.I didn't go far enough. My goal in that report was merely to tame bullish expectations. To that aim, identifying that higher interest rates would significantly hold back growth far from the company's then-target of 8  to 12  distribution growth was just enough. But had I spent more time understanding the ramifications of the convertible equity portfolio financings, then I would have instead rated the stock a clear short. I am kicking myself for that - and to add insult to injury, I even sold a couple puts at a  25 strike price that I have since covered at a nonsignificant loss. Even after a big valuation reset, I must downgrade the stock to a sell - better late than never.To the unsuspecting eye, the extent of NEP's stock price plunge looks unjustified. Sure, the stock deserved to fall after lowering both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution  'CAFD'  guidance from prior targets of  2.4 billion and  860 million, respectively. But the 50  plunge at first glance looks overdone, given that management is still targeting 6  distribution growth through 2026.The problem is that 6  growth still looks too aggressive. In my prior report, I have already discussed how higher interest rates should bring growth down to a crawl  due to the company's heavy reliance on external acquisitions to drive growth , but there I missed something  the convertible equity financing buyouts.This was an issue that was frequently dismissed due to the company having previously outlined plans to sell off their natural gas pipeline portfolio to raise funds, as well as parent NEE suspending  157 million in IDRs to offset that sale. We can see below that NEP has around  1.8 billion of convertible equity financing that needs to be paid off over the next few years.In total, there is around  4.6 billion of CEPF that needs to be addressed over the coming years.The sale of the natural gas pipelines is expected to address around  1.5- 1.8 billion of that if they are able to sell the pipelines at a 10x multiple. Even if we assume that they are able to execute on such a transaction  which is no guarantee given that the stocks of publicly traded pipeline companies are trading around that 10x EBITDA multiple , they still have around  3 billion remaining to deal with. I am doubtful that NEP could issue additional unsecured debt to raise financing, given that the company is already approaching downgrade thresholds.Moreover, issuing debt would likely need to come at a 7  to 8  interest rate if not higher, which would heavily impact cash available for distributions. 8  interest on  3 billion in debt would amount to  240 million - compare that against  820 million in projected 2023 consolidated CAFD.Still, though, many readers may be thinking that the price is right here, with the stock trading at its highest distribution yield ever.Again, it isn't so simple. We should first calculate the valuation. There are 190 million shares outstanding  inclusive of NEE shares , yielding a  4.3 billion market cap. As of the latest quarter, there was  5.9 billion of long-term debt,  573 million of near-term debt, and  587 million in cash. I have included a breakdown of the debt from the annual report to show the low interest rates of maturing debt.I have seen some peers use the above numbers to conclude that NEP is trading at around 4x EBITDA  using guidance for  2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA . But the problem is that this ignores the aforementioned CEPF, as well as the differential membership interests. NEP noted having  10.97 billion noncontrolling interests as of the latest quarter, but the bulk of that is not related to NEE's stake in the company.Adding  10.1 billion to the enterprise value yields  20.3 billion in total enterprise value - leading to a valuation of around 10x EBITDA  in line with that . This is a good moment to stop and point out that 10x EBITDA is not that cheap, at least not as cheap as the 15  distribution yield might imply. At this point, hopefully, it is at least clear that there is no reason to  back up the truck.But the final and most concerning risk is related to how NEP might address the CEPF buyouts. When the stock was soaring and soaring, these buyouts were not so concerning, given that NEP could simply issue stock to fund the buyouts. But now that the stock has plunged, issuing stock is highly dilutive - addressing  4.5 billion in CEPF would potentially dilute unitholders by as much as 50   and more if NEP continues falling . That puts NEP between a rock and a hard place. Issuing debt is difficult  due to leverage already being high  and expensive  due to high interest rates . Issuing stock is dilutive. So what is NEP to do  Fellow analyst Trapping Value  which, among other things, explains the take-under risk. A  take-under  refers to the event in which the company is acquired  often by the parent company  at a price near lows, or at least lower than where many investors purchased their units. At this point, an acquisition of NEP by NEE looks likely as it looks like the easiest way to handle the CEPF buyouts. NEE is incentivized to maintain the value of its ownership in NEP and likely does not want to dilute NEP unitholders  including itself . Acquiring NEP would be a drop in the bucket for NEE, given that NEE is a  100 billion company. NEE would likely have little issue raising even the full  4.5 billion in funds for the CEPF buyouts. As Trapping Value pointed out, there is now the risk that NEP decides to cut its distribution, which may lead to further selling in the units. NEE may sweep in at the lower prices to acquire the company and effectively save it from its liquidity crisis - but unitholders as of current prices might not feel so thankful.Unless interest rates plunge imminently or for any other reason NEP is able to soar  and raise equity through its ATM program , the CEPF buyouts look like a pressing liquidity risk. Either issuing debt or units look prohibitively expensive, making the company's target for 6  distribution growth look too aggressive. I expect a distribution cut to occur over the coming quarters, if not sooner, followed by an acquisition of the company by parent NEE at lower prices. I rate NEP a sell as higher interest rates have ruined the party here.Julian Lin is a financial analyst. He finds undervalued companies with secular growth that appreciate over time.

TC Energy Preferred Stocks: Better Than Any U.S. Preferred Stocks,"This is the second public article that I am publishing on Canadian reset-rate preferred stocks. The first one was on . One of the recommendations, symbol   ENB.PF.V on IBKR , is up  2.48 just since we recommendedAt our Conservative Income Portfolio service we take pride in the fact that we cover all preferred stocks, all baby bonds, and all traditional bonds, not just in 1 or 2 sectors but in all sectors. Additionally, we cover Canadian preferred stocks. In order to know which fixed-income securities are the most undervalued, you really need to do the work of covering all of them. And currently, Canadian preferred stocks provide the best values in the investment-grade preferred stock space and we are currently recommending some of these great values to our subscribers.TC Energy  was formerly known as TransCanada Corporation. It is a large Canadian energy company that has assets all over North America including close to half in the USA. Its operations include natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines as well as natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, it operates in the power generation business. So you get geographical and operational diversity which adds to safety.There is a way of investing in TRP where you can achieve a higher yield, greater safety, and very possibly more price upside than you get with the common shares. That is by investing in their reset-rate preferred stocks. TRP has a strong investment grade credit rating of BBB  which puts the rating on these preferred stocks at BBB-, still investment grade. When you consider the credit quality of TRP, the yields on their preferred stocks are just enormous and far outpace the yields on U.S. preferred stocks.Not only does TRP reset-rate preferred stocks provide higher yields and more safety than the common shares of TRP but they also give you interest rate protection as they have some preferred stocks that have their interest rates reset every 5 years based on the GOC  Government of Canada  5-year treasury note. Once the dividend is reset on one of these preferred stocks, they cannot be called for another 5 years at which time the rate will be reset again. And these preferred stocks trade way below par making a call quite unlikely and a bonanza win if they should be called.To give you an idea of the undervaluation of TRP preferred stocks I have screened all U.S. fixed-rate preferred stocks that have the same S P BBB- rating as TRP and that also pay a  qualified  dividend. I have excluded those preferred stocks that have a Moodys' rating 2 notches or more below BBB- and those trading over par.As you can see, the average yield for BBB- preferred stocks tends to be around 6.5  with the maximum being 7.31 . Now let's look at 2 TRP preferred stocks to see just how much better they are compared to these U.S. BBB- preferred stocks in the above chart.The preferred stocks that I am covering in this article trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSE  and are denominated in Canadian dollars.Last Trade  13.77 CADCurrent Yield 6.87Resets 10 30 2024 at the Canadian 5 Year Note plus 2.35Qualified DividendPar  25S P Rating BBB-The current stripped yield of 6.87  is better than the typical 6.5  on U.S. BBB- preferred stocks, making it a bit undervalued. So you are doing fine while you wait for the rate to reset. But what really makes this an extremely undervalued preferred stock is that the dividend is going to reset much higher with an announcement in around 11 months assuming no total crash in the Canadian 5 year yield.  This is a massively better yield than the typical 6.5  on equivalent U.S. preferred stocks and given that TRP-E  TSE  TRP-E  dividends receive a tax benefit  qualified , the after tax yield on this preferred stock will likely be huge.Thus, I expect a large rise in the price of TRP-E  TRP.PR.E CA  over the next 11 months as we close in on the October reset date. And so I expect a very large total return over the next year. It seems investors are not looking ahead with this preferred stock and are simply looking at its current yield. But with perpetual preferred stocks, they must be evaluated on their likely return over a decade or more.  Thus, no matter what happens to the yield on the Canadian 5 year note over the next year, TRP-E's yield will be relatively super good and we can expect a sizeable price upside regardless of where the 5 year note yield goes between now and its October reset date. If you want a preferred stock with super protection against interest rate moves, whether rates go higher or lower, this would be a top pick.Some may make a mistake when they add up the current Canadian 5 year yield of 4.25  with the fixed portion of 2.35  and think the yield will be 6.6  when TRP-E resets. But that yield is at par. With TRP-E trading 45  below par, the yield is 12.06 .If you are concerned about the currently rising interest rates, this is a place to be as the reset rate yield will be even higher than 12.06  if treasury rates continue to rise.Last Trade  15.08 CADCurrent Yield 6.51Resets on 4 30 2024 at the Canadian 5 year note yield plus 2.38Par  25Qualified DividendRating BBB-I won't repeat the write-up that I did for TRP-E for TRP-D  TRP.PR.D CA  as these preferred stocks are very similar and both very undervalued. The primary difference is that TRP-D resets 6 months sooner than TRP-E so you start collecting a higher yield sooner. At the current Canadian 5 year note yield, the reset rate would be 11.06  and currently the yield is 6.51  while you wait for the reset in April. I will compare the 2 preferred stocks further and give my preference later in the article.When I looked at these preferred stocks, I was very surprised to see what will likely be future yields that are massively better than other preferred stocks with similar credit risk. It seems that probabilities don't matter to investors and looking at probabilities is really what stock picking is all about. It seems that investors are simply looking at current yield which is an absurd way to analyze reset-rate preferred stocks. And if they are not looking at current yields only, then they must be assuming a crash in the Canadian 5 year note yield between now and April of 2024. If you have such certainty of this, shorting the Government of Canada's bonds would make you a killing. And you should probably exit all your stock positions because if rates crash like that it will almost certainly be a result of a financial panic or a sudden big downturn in the economy. So anyone who shuns these preferred stocks is really taking a position that disaster is about to hit and should not be in the market outside of treasury bonds.I believe that when the reset dates get nearer and investors become more certain that the current yields will rise steeply when the dividends are reset, prices should move higher and significantly so. And even if the 5 year note yield falls a fair amount between now and the reset dates, I still expect these preferred stocks to move nicely higher in price. This is because if yields drop, that means that we are in a lower interest rate environment and the reset yield, although it may be somewhat lower, will still be significantly better relative to other preferred stocks than it is now. What matters in pricing is not the absolute yield but the yield relative to other similar investments. And for investment grade securities, the huge spread over treasuries that exist with TRP-E and TRP-D matters greatly. Thus, TRP-E will still be ridiculously undervalued. This 10.7  yield will still be an incredible value relative to what will likely be a 6  yield on similar BBB- rated preferred stocks. So even if rates move down rather significantly between now and the reset dates, I still expect a strong price rise in these preferred stocks. The market just doesn't seem to get that.At current prices, I have a small preference for TRP-E over TRP-D. Although you have to wait an extra 6 months for the rate to reset on TRP-E, at the current 5 year treasury yield you are getting a 1  higher yield on TRP-E than TRP-D when the rate resets. Since I have no idea what will happen with rates between April and October of 2024, this looks to be a large difference. In addition, the current yield on TRP-E is higher at 6.87  versus 6.51  for TRP-D. On the other hand, TRP-D does start collecting the higher yield 6 months sooner than TRP-E which is an advantage, especially with rates high currently.But perpetual preferred stocks should be valued into perpetuity and in this case, we have 2 preferred stocks with very similar reset rates  that being the Canadian 5 year yield plus 2.35  and 2.38 . Given that the reset formula for each preferred stock is so close, the fact that TRP-E sells for a lower price,  13.77 versus  15.08 makes it currently a better value long term. But personally, I do own both as I do like the idea of getting the high yield 6 months sooner and eliminating some reset rate risk by getting the high rate locked in sooner in case rates drop between April and October of next year. But of course, rates could rise between April and October.For U.S. residents with taxable accounts, there will be a withholding of 15  of your dividends on TRP preferred stocks but you can recover all of that by filing a Foreign Tax Credit form at tax time.At our Conservative Income Portfolio service, we cover all of the Canadian reset-rate preferred stocks and there are many to like. Currently, Canadian preferred stocks are very undervalued and look to be much better investments than U.S. preferred stocks.TRP-E  TRP.PR.E  and TRP-D  TRP.PR.D  are both reset-rate preferred stocks that reset next year with the strong likelihood of huge jumps in yield making them enormously undervalued relative to other preferred stocks of the same credit quality.TRP-E  TRP.PR.E  is a BBB-  S P  rated Canadian denominated reset-rate preferred stock whose dividend will reset in October 2024 for the next 5 years. Based on its current price and the current yield of the Canadian 5 year note, TRP-E is set to see its current yield take a massive jump from 6.87  to 12.06 . When you consider that similar BBB- rated preferred stocks yield around 6.5  on average, you can see just how undervalued this preferred stock is. Investors seem to focus only on current yield when that is no way to value a reset-rate preferred stock.TRP-D  TRP.PR.D  resets sooner, in April of 2024. Based on its current price and the current yield of the Canadian 5 year note, TRP-D is set to see its yield jump from 6.51  to 11.06 .I expect the prices of these preferred stocks to move much higher as we move toward their reset dates. And this is regardless of where interest rates are when the reset occurs. If we take TRP-E, for example, the yield spread of more than 7.75  over treasuries is enormous for an investment grade security  12.06  versus 4.25 . Thus, if rates drop between now and the reset date, the yield on TRP-E will still be extremely high relative to the treasury yield and will still be grossly undervalued. As we move closer to the reset dates, investors won't be able to ignore the huge jump in relative yield that will occur with these 2 preferred stocks and will likely be falling all over themselves chasing these preferred stocks higher.If you are concerned by the sharply rising interest rates we are currently seeing, these preferred stocks provide great protection as if rates move higher their reset rates will be even higher than the 12.06  and 11.06  I used in this article.If you own EBGEF  ENB.PF.V CA , we strongly suggest you sell and move to one of these preferred stocks. At Friday's closing price, EBGEF is set to reset next year at 9.18  versus 11.06  and 12.06  for TRP preferred stocks.

In other words, sell when you have a nice profit and move that money into something with more upside potential and a higher yield. Rinse and repeat.targets the  with the .

Clearway Energy Has Gotten Cheap On Temporary Headwinds,"Clearway Energy owns over 8000 MW of utility scale energy production assets, primarily in the renewables category, and sells the generated power via pre-defined contracts.Clearway Energy Class A Shares  have a stable trajectory of earnings growth predicated on the company's long-term energy sales contracts. Given this level of visibility, valuation is key to investment in CWEN and it has become significantly undervalued. CWEN's share price has dropped about 34  in the last year while its run rate earnings have improved.At this lower price, CWEN.A is trading at just 11.5X proforma cash flow available for distribution  CAFD . The pace of growth and stable nature warrant a significantly higher multiple.Let me begin with why CWEN got cheap and follow with the fundamental outlook.The first half of 2023 has come in with not just a miss, but a huge miss. Here is the guidance adjustment.Source  CWENThat is a cut of greater than 15  at the midpoint and it is this weakness along with the early signs of this weakness that I believed drove most of the downward market price action.A closer examination of the reasons for the miss, however, suggests the market has overreacted. The miss was a combination of three factors, each of which is one-time in natureProduction came in light as discussed by CWEN.On the 2Q23 call, CWEN's CFO, Sarah Rubenstein described the solar situationThe miss is fundamental in nature and real, but I think the market is incorrect in punishing the stock so heavily as it is one time and the result of natural variance.Solar and wind have always and probably will always have variable output. It so happens that both solar and wind drastically underperformed the average in the first half of 2023.Going forward, one should still expect the result to be average. It is a two-sided risk in that these solar and wind assets also sometimes produce above average. That is why it is called an average.CWEN does not underwrite assuming maximal production it underwrites to the meat of the bell curve in asset productivity.In fact, the issues already seem to be resolving. CEO Chris Sotos stated on the 2Q23 earnings callThey even raised forward guidance.That seems like an overall good result to me. The earnings from a single quarter are not anywhere near as impactful as the forward run-rate of earnings.The market is looking at CWEN at its 2023 earnings and seeing  1.70 per share in CAFD which places it at a 13.95X multiple.Even at the reduced CAFD level the multiple is not that high but perhaps there is a bit of punishment in there for missing so significantly.If we use forward numbers instead of 2023 numbers, CWEN.A is producing  2.08 in CAFD which is an 11.5X multiple.That easily covers the 6.41  dividend yield with a cushion of safety as it is a 73  payout ratio. CWEN is targeting a CAFD payout ratio in the 80s so I anticipate continued raises. On the 2Q23 earnings report they announced a raise to  1.5564 annually.CAFD should naturally spring back up to the  410 million run rate simply by normalization of weather.Growth beyond that point comes from new projects. CWEN currently has two deals in the works which epitomize their typical sort of project.Rosamond battery storage has 10.9  yield and a 15-year contract. Cedar creek has a 9.3  CAFD yield with a 25-year power purchase agreement. These PPAs are why the cashflows are visible so far into the future.In today's market, anything AI related has been bid up to outrageous market prices. Even if companies are not directly AI related they have been bid up as if they are viewed as a supplier of the AI boom. NVIDIA being the most obvious example here.Well, in addition to chips, AI also needs a whole bunch of power. CWEN is positioned to supply that power. For public image and ESG scores, tech companies often like to claim they are zero emissions which you cannot claim if you are getting your power from the grid.This is how CWEN gets these power purchase agreements, often at prices well above grid power. When the electricity comes from a known powerplant, it is not just clean energy, but it is clean energy the end-user can brag about.CWEN also has regular utility style power generation as a catalyst given the consistently growing power needs from population growth and power consumption trends.It is not explosive growth, but it is steady, reliable growth with a large pipeline of similar 9 -11  CAFD yield projects. The net result is a revenue chart that is up and to the right.There is seasonal lumpiness and of course variance from weather, but the trendline is quite positive.Anytime one looks at a long-term revenue chart I find it essential to also look at shares outstanding. As investors it is not growth that we care about, but rather growth per share.Over the last 10 years, shares outstanding are up about 50  while revenues have more than doubled.A couple of years back, CWEN sold its geothermal energy and still has some of those proceeds to spend. Putting that excess capital to work at similar rates to their normal deals would result in CAFD of  440 million.Valuation is relative to other opportunities available. The S P trades at about 20X forward earnings. CWEN.A trades at 11.5X forward CAFD.It is, of course, a very different sort of company so we cannot just point at the multiple and say it is cheaper.Many analysts believe energy companies should trade at lower multiples than the S P because energy assets tend to be depleting in nature. As a result, you have great energy companies like Exxon Mobil  trading at 12X earnings. Eventually, oil fields run out of accessible oil so one should amortize that depletion over the expected life to get true earnings. I'm not an energy analyst so I cannot comment on whether this is being done appropriately for XOM.CWEN's assets are a bit different in that they are renewable rather than conventional energy. In theory renewable energy does not suffer depletion, but I do think there should still be amortization of replacement costs. The sun's functionality will last forever, but the solar panels will get old and need to be replaced. Thus, we should amortize the cost of this over useful life. Most clean energy assets last about 35 years at strong production capacity so I think CWEN's CAFD should be adjusted downward by 3  of Property Plant and Equipment  PP E .Amortization of this nature is about  249 million a year, so that takes a huge chunk out of the  420 million guided CAFD.However, I think the market is missing a hugely important detail in how CWEN calculates CAFD. Since CAFD is intended as a measure of cash which can be distributed to shareholders, the calculation treats debt paydown as if it were an expense. It is cash out the door, but that reduces CWEN's debt so it is not a loss. I think amortizing debt is healthy and in some ways it forces CWEN to pay for replacement of equipment ahead of time. By the time equipment needs to be replaced, the project level debt will have amortized to zero.Not only is the market not giving CWEN credit for this debt paydown, but it is a huge number coming in at  297 million per year. As this is not a real expense it should be added back to CAFD to get to true earnings.Finally I always consider stock compensation to be a real expense so I subtract that in calculating earnings. Summing up the numbers, we get true run rate earnings of  463 million.In a previous article we discussed more extensively the  behind these adjustments.Given that this earnings numbers account for the  depletion  of CWEN's assets, I think it is comparable to the S P.As such, I think CWEN's 11.5X CAFD multiple and 10.4X true earnings multiple with steady growth ahead is extremely attractive relative to the S P's 20X.I understand that people have a wide range of opinions on government subsidy of green energy. We are not here to discuss politics, but rather financial analysis of this investment opportunity and as such I want to point out that one's opinion on the matter doesn't really affect the viability of CWEN as an investment.The fact is that the government is handing out massive subsidies to green energy producers in various formsPartially as a result of these accelerated depreciation schedules, CWEN has amassed a NOL carry forward balance of  481 million as per the 10-QThat is a good amount of tax sheltering.There is a bit of an arbitrage available between the class A shares  CWEN.A  and the Class C shares .CWEN.A has less float so it has a bit less liquidity, but that can be dealt with through cautious trading behavior such as use of limit orders and a long investment horizon. In exchange for being slightly more work to trade, one gets to buy in at a 5.6  discount to the CWEN shares. We track this arbitrage along with others consistently on the Portfolio Income Solutions Arbitrage Tracker Spreadsheet.In addition to the discount, CWEN.A shareholders get superior voting power.Clearway Energy has some long-dated senior notes at very low interest rates. It also has a fair amount of variable rate debt at the project level and non-recourse to the company.These SOFR linked loans make CWEN's interest expense fluctuate a fair amount with interest rates. It will hurt results by a few pennies if rates continue to rise and help by a few pennies if SOFR goes back down.At this point in the cycle, I view the upside and downside of this as relatively balanced.Most of CWEN's counterparties in their PPAs are large and financially sound, but things can go wrong resulting in delayed or missed payments such as with PG E. As CWEN's counterparty roster is fairly diversified, it generally won't be a huge blow, but it is something on which to keep an eye.Unforeseen changes to the energy market could disrupt future growth. This could be anything from blockages in the supply of critical parts to major changes like the relative viability of various types of energy production.Right now there are abnormally great investment opportunities. With the market crash, some fundamentally strong stocks have gotten outrageously cheap and I want to show you how to take advantage and slingshot out of the dip.To encourage readers to get in at this time of enhanced opportunity we are offering a limited time 20  discount to .

IBM: All Those AI Patents Likely Aren't Worth Much,"In our  of International Business Machines Corporation , we compared the company with Microsoft , and we found contrasting fundamentals that present an opportunity for a Long-Short trade. We determined that MicrosoftIn this analysis, we examined IBM due to its distinction as the foremost US company in terms of AI patents. We aimed to investigate the potential for IBM, as a leader in AI patents among US companies, to leverage this position for growth stimulation. Initially, we delved into IBM's business model, aiming to identify the variousFurthermore, our analysis included assessing the benefits IBM gained from its patent-related endeavors. This entailed an analysis of the financial impact of patent sales and licensing. Moreover, we delved into IBM's advancements in AI across various sectors to identify its particular areas of focus. To comprehensively gauge the impact of IBM's AI endeavors, we also assessed its market share and revenue growth resulting from these developments. The ultimate objective was to ascertain whether IBM's leading position in US patents could be effectively harnessed to propel its overall growth outlook.In this section, we examine how IBM utilized its broad portfolio of patents. Besides product development, we highlighted examples of the company licensing its patents to third parties and granting them the rights in exchange for royalty payments, sale of patents and open-source initiatives of the company by making its patents freely available to the public.In 2005, IBM and AMD   on the development of chip technologies including  transistors, chip connection, packing and lithography , as well as a 22nm process. They continued joint work on 22nm and 32nm processes until . AMD paid IBM fees for joint development projects under the agreement.AMD gained  3.1 bln in revenue during that period from 2002 to 2008, which translates to its fees paid to IBM at 16.2 .In 2011, Google    1,030 IBM patents covering various subjects, including memory and microprocessing chips, computer architecture, servers, routers, relational databases, object-oriented programming, and business processes. According to IAM, Google has been a  of IBM since 2011, obtaining over 2,400 original IBM assets.In 2013, IBM  the OpenPOWER Foundation to promote Power Architecture and related technologies through an open-source . As part of this initiative, IBM made numerous patents available to the OpenPOWER community. One of its members includes Google, in 2020, Google Cloud started  IBM Power Systems as part of its cloud solutions, enabling customers to run IBM Power Systems on Google Cloud.However, while collaborating with OpenPOWER, Google is  creating its own Arm-based server processors. Also, Google already supports virtual machines using Ampere Computing's Altra processors. Google's in-progress projects include two Arm-based server CPUs called Maple, based on Marvell Technology's design, and Cypress, a custom design developed by an Israeli team.In 2014, IBM and GlobalFoundries  partnered to develop advanced semiconductor tech. GlobalFoundries  IBM's NY and VT , becoming the exclusive provider of server processor semiconductor tech for 22nm, 14nm, and 10nm for 10 years. The deal provided IBM with supply at market-based pricing for a decade and GlobalFoundries access to key manufacturing IP, becoming a major patent holder. However, IBM's server  fell from 13.7  in 2014 to 5  in 2021.GlobalFoundries  its ASIC platform, FX-14, utilizing its acquired technologies from IBM, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and 14nm FinFET process technology to enable customers in creating tailored chip designs. Its customers include   and   which launched products in 2022.However, IBM and GlobalFoundries had been embroiled in a legal battle over delivery delays and technology issues. IBM was   2.5 bln in damages due to GlobalFoundries' delays, while GlobalFoundries  with claims of damages and an injunction against IBM's use of trade secrets.IBM and Samsung  partnered to advance semiconductor technologies, introducing a groundbreaking vertical  that could reduce energy consumption by 85  compared to traditional FinFET technology, while also collaborating on manufacturing IBM's chips at the 5nm node for servers. This progress paved the way for IBM's 2nm chip technology capable of accommodating 50 bln transistors, with Samsung set to  mass production of the 2nm silicon manufacturing process in 2025.According to ,  Linux is the best-known and most-used open-source operating system . IBM provides  for Linux on its systems, offering an enterprise-grade operating system that serves as a reliable foundation for open-source and hybrid cloud infrastructures.

It digitizes processes, enabling secure data sharing and transaction visibility. Originally envisioned as an open and neutral industry platform, the partners later decided to deliver the solution through their existing . Despite the development, TradeLens faced challenges in achieving full global industry collaboration, leading to its  in 2022.IBM has open-sourced patents related to healthcare technologies In 2005, IBM  that its...In 2014, Twitter  over 900 patents from IBM and also  entered into a cross-licensing agreement .In 2012, Facebook  bought 750 IBM  encompassing networking, software, and various tech areas, potentially acting as a defense against a Yahoo patent infringement lawsuit.Based on the company's , IBM disclosed its IP and Custom Development Income of  664 mln in 2022 which is a growth rate of 8.4 . In the past 10 years, the company has had an average growth of 17 . However, that is mainly due to the surge in 2016 when the company's  Licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees  grew by 294  that year. Also, the company's Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income as a   of revenue had been flattish from 0.8  in 2013 to only 1.1  in 2022.Based on , the company's total patent filing had been on an increasing trend since 2003 until its peak in 2018 from 9,058 to 20,562 total filings. However, the company's total patents have been on a declining trend through 2022 at 13,344 total filings. According to , the company had longstanding leadership in patent filings in the US spanning 29 consecutive years. However, in 2020, as part of their commitment to continuous reinvention, IBM deiced to no longer prioritize numeric patent leadership. In 2022, IBM was for the first time not the top company in terms of patents since 1993. This shift reflects IBM's refocus towards specific areas, particularly...Based on the  above of the AI patents by companies worldwide, IBM has experienced a remarkable surge in the number of machine learning and AI patents, solidifying its position as a leader in innovation. From 2013 to 2022, IBM's active patent families in this field increased from 1,528 to 9,497, showcasing a substantial growth of over 520 . This translates to a CAGR of approximately 23 . Notably, IBM's impressive patent portfolio has enabled it to surpass Microsoft and claim the top spot among US companies in terms of AI patents.In this section, we highlight the developments of AI and classified them based on our segment breakdown which we derived from our previous analysis including Software, Internet Services   Infrastructure, IT Consulting   Other Services and Technology Hardware, Storage   Peripherals.We compiled the company's AI developments based on our derived segment breakdown and tabulated the number of AI developments based on the segments below.In the Software segment, IBM has developed  including IBM AIOps Insights, IBM Robotic Process Automation, and IBM Watson Orchestrate. Their Data   AI portfolio features IBM Business Analytics, Watson Assistant, and Watson Discovery. In Security, IBM offers the IBM Security QRadar Suite, IBM MaaS360 Advisor with Watson, and IBM Security QRadar SIEM. Red Hat, an IBM subsidiary, integrates AI into its hybrid cloud platform. In IT Consulting   Other Services, IBM Consulting employs AI for business transformation. In Technology Hardware, Storage   Peripherals, IBM integrates AI into services like PowerVM virtualization and AI ML services. IBM's Storage services support data-driven workloads and AI.Overall, as seen from the table, the company's AI developments are concentrated in the Software segment with 32 AI developments accounting for 84.2  of the total AI developments  38 . This is because Software accounted for the second largest segment of the company at 26  of total revenues and only behind its IT Consulting segment. Therefore, we believe that the company targeted the Software segment in terms of AI developments to support the company's growth. Moreover, the segment with the next most AI developments is IT Consulting   Other Services, followed by Technology Hardware, Storage   Peripherals and Internet Services   Infrastructure. However, these segments pale in comparison with the Software segment which has a significantly higher number of AI developments. In the next point, we determined whether its AI developments had benefitted the company in terms of revenue growth and market share.In the previous point, we highlighted the company's AI developments which are across all 4 segments but are strongly seen especially in its Software segment accounting for the most AI developments. In this section, we examined the company's revenue growth and market share change to determine whether its AI developments did have a positive impact on the company's growth and market share.In the past 10 years, IBM's revenue has trended downwards from 2013 to 2020. The company experienced a large decline in revenues in 2019 as it restated its revenue following the  of Kyndryl  17 bln in revenues  in 2021 and has a 10-year average growth of -4.7 . However, the company's revenue growth has turned positive in 2021, after the only positive year in 2018, and remained positive in 2022. Based on its segments, its growth was mainly driven by its Hybrid cloud  Internet Services   Infrastructure  segment which had an average growth of 16.6  in the past two years as seen in the chart below.However, IBM's market share in the Software industry has experienced a decline over the years, including in 2022. In 2016, IBM held a market share of 4.68 , which gradually decreased to 4.24  in 2021. In 2022, IBM's market share further decreased to 4.04  with a growth rate of only 1.8 . Meanwhile, Microsoft and Oracle  have maintained their dominance in the market, with Microsoft holding a market share of 10.41  in 2022 and Oracle holding a market share of 8.21 . Therefore, we believe that the company's AI developments, despite being largely concentrated in its Software segment, have not boosted its segment growth.Based on our cloud market share from our previous analysis, IBM Cloud's market share decreased from 17  in 2018 to 4  in 2022, experiencing a significant decline in 2021. In contrast, competitors like AWS  maintained a consistent 37  share, and Microsoft Azure steadily increased from 15  in 2018 to 23  in 2022. Therefore, we believe that despite its AI developments for hybrid cloud, it has not supported its growth as its market share declined.Based on our updated IT Consulting market share chart above, Accenture  and Tata Consultancy experienced an increase in market share from 4.3  to 4.8 , solidifying their positions as leading players. Capgemini  also saw a slight rise in market share from 1.9  to 2.1 . On the other hand, IBM's market share remained consistent at 1.5 . Therefore, we believe that despite its AI developments for IT consulting, it has not supported its growth as its market share had remained flattish.To conclude, the company had stronger growth in 2021 and 2022 which were positive compared to the previous 10 years which were negative except in 2018. However, its stronger growth was mainly driven by its hybrid cloud growth rather than AI developments as its Software revenue growth was only 1.8  and in line with its historical average despite the segment accounting for the most AI developments for IBM. Overall, we determine that despite the company's robust patent portfolio and technologies especially in AI, the company's growth had not benefitted as its revenue growth with a 10-year average growth of -4.7  and continued share losses in software and cloud markets while its share in IT consulting was flat. Moreover, we determined that its recent positive growth in 2021 and 2022 is attributed to its strong hybrid cloud growth rather than the AI developments targeted in its software portfolio.Overall, as the IP highlighted its shift towards concentrating its R D on developing patents for high growth areas including AI instead of focusing on patent breadth in the past which allowed it the secure the top US company by patents until 2022, we believe this shift is worth it for IBM as the company's IP and Development Income had been decreasing at a 5-year average of -13  and is worse compared to the company's total revenue growth was -4.7  in the period. However, as its IP and Development Income represents only 1.1  of revenue, thus we estimate the benefit that IBM could get in terms of R D savings is minimal at 0.12  by taking its IP and Development Income share of revenue at 1.1  multiplied by its R D expenses divided by its revenue in 2022.Therefore, we determined that IBM's business model in terms of its patents had been to develop a broad range of technologies and patents which it not only use for its own product development but also it licensed and sold its patents to other companies and also competitors. However, based on the first point, we believe that the company does not have a positive track record of patent utilization as the company did not significantly benefit from licensing and selling its patents as it accounted for 1.1  of revenue with an average growth of -12.8 . Moreover, we believe the patents did not significantly benefit the companies that IBM had licensed its patents, given the lack of sustained partnerships. Additionally, the company's total revenue growth was also negative at -4.4  despite the company's patent leadership over the years. Thus, we believe that although the company's AI patents had surged as it refocused on high growth areas, it does not reflect the company having quality patents and effective usage of it and we expect the company not to derive significant benefits from its AI patent leadership.Despite the company having the most AI-related patents as a US company, we believe one of the risks to the company is the competition from Microsoft with its AI developments which we covered in our . In 2023, Microsoft demonstrated a significant increase in AI-related activities, including new product launches, partnerships, integrations, and acquisitions. In our analysis, we determined that while we believe IBM has an advantage over Microsoft in the system infrastructure software category with a greater number of AI solutions, we believed Microsoft triumphs over the top software companies in enterprise, application development and productivity software due to its greater AI solutions developed and integration with the most powerful LLM in partnership with OpenAI.We updated our forecasts of the company's revenue growth with its 2022 full-year results. For Software, we based its growth on its 8-year average growth of 1.1 . Moreover, for Internet Services   Infrastructure, we based its growth on its 2-year average of 17 . For IT Consulting   Other Services, we based its growth on the market CAGR of 6.08  and Technology Hardware, Storage   Peripherals on its 2-year average of 2.7 .Based on a discount rate of 6.4   company's WACC , our model shows its shares are fairly valued.All in all, we identified that the company's AI development primarily centers around the Software segment, which accounts for 84.2  of AI projects and aligns with its revenue focus, trailing only behind the IT Consulting segment and we believe suggests a strategic use of AI for overall growth. Despite possessing a diverse patent portfolio, AI hasn't notably boosted revenue growth. Despite its patent leadership, the company's total revenue growth remains negative  -4.4 . Recent growth stems from hybrid cloud services expansion, with the Software segment seeing only a 1.8  revenue increase.In 2022, disclosed Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income grew 8.4  to  664 million, falling short of the 17  average growth over a decade. Although targeting AI patents for growth, we believe the company has not significantly capitalized on its portfolio, with IP income as a percentage of revenue growing modestly from 0.8   2013  to 1.1   2022 . While the shift to AI aligns with a decline in IP and Development Income  averaging -13  over five years  and worse total revenue growth  -4.7 , estimated R D savings in 2022 are minimal at 0.12  of revenue. The company historically built a wide array of technologies and patents for self-use, licensing, and sale to other firms, yet the impact on revenue has been limited  1.1  of revenue with -12.8  average growth . Hence, while AI patents surged after a shift to high-growth areas, we believe IBM's quality and effective utilization appear lacking, potentially limiting significant benefits from AI patent leadership. Based on our updated DCF, we obtained a price target of  and rate the company as a Hold  No information in this publication is intended as investment, tax, accounting, or legal advice, or as an offer solicitation to sell or buy.

Chesapeake Energy And The Electrification Of Energy Demand,"  EPS prospects are expected to deliver negative figures until summer 2024. Despite these lackluster prospects, I find this stock highly compelling.Personally, I've invested in Antero Resources In fact, I argue that this narrative revolves around a substantial and sustainable increase in natural U.S.-based gas demand in 2024. Presently, investors show little interest in this sector, but now is a really great time to engage with natural gas stocks like Chesapeake Energy.The global landscape is witnessing a monumental shift as we progress further into the electrification of diverse sectors.While the conversation surrounding this movement might not be as prevalent as it deserves, its impact isFrom the surge in demand for electric-powered appliances like air conditioners and heat pumps to the growing popularity of electric vehicles  EVs , the strain on our electricity grids is undeniable. Additionally, the proliferation of massive data centers, crucial for the digital infrastructure, further amplifies the demand for reliable and substantial energy sources.However, it's crucial to recognize that despite the widespread perception of a balanced energy production system, the reality is more complex. Energy sources vary significantly in their applicability and efficiency for generating electricity. The practicality of using diesel for electricity production, for instance, is fraught with numerous challenges, including environmental concerns and inefficiencies.Consequently, I argue that this leaves only nuclear and natural gas production to meet this increase in demand. I've already discussed nuclear energy , so I won't repeat myself  disclosure, I'm long Uranium Energy Corp. .These energy sources offer a dependable and robust means of generating electricity, providing what I believe to be the main viable solution to the challenges posed by the electrification of various industries.Natural gas serves as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels, emitting fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases. Furthermore, it's flexible, affordable, scalable, and lower in carbon emissions than coal.Now, let's discuss renewable energy.The electrification of everything movement cannot solely rely on renewable energy sources due to the current limitations of the electrical grid.The primary challenge lies in the lack of an efficient energy storage system within the grid infrastructure, specifically lithium-ion batteries. The demand for electricity needs to be carefully balanced with its production, a balance often disrupted by the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources.Although renewables generate a substantial amount of energy during the day, the peak consumption period typically occurs in the evening, after working hours. This mismatch underscores the critical need for a massive energy storage solution to bridge the gap between renewable energy production and demand, ensuring a more stable and reliable power supply for the electrification movement.Investors look at natural gas prices headed into yet another warm winter and presume that natural gas prices will not reach  4 MMBtu in 2024.I argue that this is a faulty assumption. The demand for U.S.-based natural gas is going to dramatically increase in 2024. Why  Because it doesn't make sense for prices for this coveted commodity to be so cheap in the U.S., while the rest of the world is paying more than 5x the price for this commodity.The feedback I get to this argument is that Europe's energy demands for this winter are already sorted out. And whilst this is true, everything that we've discussed here is about a short-, medium-, and long-term demand for natural gas.Furthermore, it's not only Europe that seeks U.S.-based natural gas, but Asia too. Consequently, I argue that natural gas prices will find a floor at around  3 MMBtu and steadily climb from this figure over the next several months.The other argument I've heard from investors is that CHK's EPS comparables look horrible and unpalatable.As it stands right now, analysts are not expecting CHK's EPS to stabilize and return to grow until summer 2024. Why would investors get involved now, for a stock that may not stabilize for another 6 months or moreBecause the market is always looking ahead by 6 months. The market isn't very forward-looking, but you can rest assured that right now, investors are starting to price in summer 2024.Despite projections of negative EPS for Chesapeake Energy until summer 2024, the stock presents a compelling investment opportunity.Anticipated growth in U.S.-based natural gas demand in 2024 underscores its potential. Presently overlooked by investors, the current market conditions offer an opportune moment to consider natural gas stocks like CHK.Further potential lies in the expected stabilization of natural gas prices beyond  3 MMBtu, with a gradual increase in the upcoming months.This positive outlook for natural gas, coupled with the growing demand, suggests CHK's long-term profitability.While challenges exist, including the complexities of the energy market and current EPS comparables, market trends are already reflecting expectations for CHK's future stability and growth. With a promising narrative underpinning its potential, Chesapeake Energy emerges as a favorable option as natural gas prices head higher.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

Castellum AB (publ) (CWQXF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Castellum AB  publ   Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2023 3 00 AM ETJoacim Sjoberg - Chief Executive OfficerJens Andersson - Chief Financial OfficerLars Norrby - SEBErik Granström - CarnegieMarkus Henriksson - ABG Sundal CollierWelcome to the presentation of Castellum Q3 Report.  Operator Instructions  Now, I will hand the conference over to CEO, Joacim Sjoberg  and CFO, Jens Andersson. Please go ahead.Good morning and welcome, everybody, to this Q3 presentation. Thanks for joining us this Friday morning. We jump straight into the figures and Jens will elaborate on the numbers further on in this presentation. But in summary, Castellum's core business continues to deliver stable results.Our total income increases by 9.7 , mainly due to indexation and completed projects. Income from the property management decrease is mainly due to higher interest costs, while NOI increases with 10.5 . Our financial cost increases by approximately 55 . Total changes in property values in the year so far, January to September, is 5.4 , corresponding to some SEK8.2 billion. The average yield requirement now sums up to 5.19  compared to 5.01  at the beginning of this year. The net leasing is positive for the second quarter in a row, plus SEK15 million. More on that later. Slightly decreased economic occupancy rate, mainly due to divestments of assets that were fully let at the time of disposal.So to those of you who are new to us, Castellum is one of the largest listed property companies in the Nordic region. We're a fully integrated company with local hands on present where our assets are located. The property portfolio is concentrated in attractive growth regions in the Nordics. And we're exposed to the robust market in Norway via our associated company Entra.On the map, you can see the locations of our properties. And as of last of September, our property value sums up to SEK168 billion, including our share in Entra. And of those SEK168 billion, 73  is located in metropolitan areas, 73  and 47  of our square meters or is sustainably certified. We have a yearly contract value of approximatelyJensYes. Income is showing good growth with a 9.6  increase in like-for-like holdings when we exclude currency effects from our portfolios in Denmark and Finland, the total rise in the like-for-like portfolio sums to 8.6 . Of total growth in income, the like-for-like portfolio stands for approximately 67  whilst completed projects stands for approximately 30 . The growth is weighted down by transactions.Completed projects have made a significant contribution, boosting the NOI by SEK213 million compared to the same period last year. Notable projects include in new headquarters and the new court in Malmö and the police building in Örebro. All green certified, long-duration, high-quality assets, improving the overall portfolio quality. Completed projects together with the like-for-like portfolio are key drivers increasing the NOI standing for 95  of the growth. Direct property costs have risen with 10.4  and 12.4  in the like-for-like portfolio. The increase is significantly lower for the third quarter, attributed primarily to the adjustment of property taxes and lower electricity costs in the third quarter.JoacimOkay. So our tenants, our exposure to individual tenant is low. Our 10 largest tenants stands for less than 15  of our total contract value and no tenant generates more than approximately 2 . Our strong tenant base with many of our larger tenants being publicly-funded operations, approximately 25  of our total contract value stems from public sector tenants. And the largest tenant we have is actually the Swedish Police.The average lease duration as of the last of September is 3.8 years. And ABB, our second largest tenant, has indicated that they will leave approximately 40,000 square meters in our portfolio investors. No termination has been made but contract expire in 2025. However, it's expected that this will be prolonged throughout 2026. And ABB continues to be an important tenant for Castellan also in the future. When the new ABB -- when the ABB leases eventually are terminated, we see good potential, both location-wise and out of an increased rent perspective as the area is the center for the electrification boom in Northern Europe with a significant presence from market leaders such as ABB, Alstom, Bombardier, Westinghouse and Hitachi.So looking at the rental income development. It's increasing despite the volatile net quarterly figures. The stable increase is shown on the graph in the dark colors and we have a net leasing of plus SEK15 million for the last quarter stand-alone. And that's the second positive quarter in a row after the first quarter of this year being negative SEK52 million. And we have a couple of very good leases, large square meters leased to a couple of logistics companies in Stockholm and also some med tech companies.So our net leasing for this year so far sums up to negative SEK16 million and we have a rolling 12 months summary of minus SEK8 million. We see a continued stable demand from our tenants. Contracts, however, take somewhat longer time to negotiate and conclude. We see no clear trend of tenants taking smaller spaces rather a combination where some expand and some decrease space.Bankruptcies are higher than previous years but from a very, very low level. Bankruptcies in net leasing January through September sums up to minus SEK44 million which is less than 0.5 percentage point of our total lease value. Bankruptcies are dominated by padded tennis courts. That's a bit narrow but that's the case for this year so far. And that leaves us with almost no exposure to pedal tenants left in our portfolio.Luckily, these sites are in good locations with high ceilings and we're making them good candidates for sitting near storage or warehouse customers.JensLooking at property values. During the period January to September, property values decreased with 5.4  equivalent to SEK8.2 billion. All properties have been externally valued in the first quarter and the large sample will be tested again in the fourth quarter. Complete the divestments of SEK3.8 billion give further support to our valuations.From July to September, the values declined by approximately SEK1.5 billion. This decline during the quarter is mainly attributed to specific properties expected to be vacated in 2026. Average yield requirements now sums to 5.19 , up from 4.75  end of the third quarter last year where the valuations peaked out. Since the end of the third quarter of 2022, Castellum has written down its directly-owned properties with a total of SEK15 billion, corresponding to 9.5 . Continued high interest rates and inflation will continue to put downward pressure on valuations. However, CPI indexations will mitigate most of the effect over time.Since the end of 2021, underlying interest rates have risen sharply. However, there is no absolute correlation between yield requirements and underlying interest rates which is so far supported by sales prices continuing to be more stable than many have forecasted. On aggregate, till the end of the third quarter this year, we have sold our properties 7  below the peak valuation end of third quarter 2022.And here are some highlights from the financial side. ICR rolling 12 months currently at 3x in line with our financial policy, however, is expected to fall slightly below next quarter. Rights issue will continue to strengthen the ICR going forward while rolling into the 12-month figures. Higher interest rates and expiring interest derivatives will, on the other hand, put continued downward pressure.An increase in the underlying interest rates by 100 basis points would increase interest costs of SEK236 million compared to SEK657 million if the entire loan portfolio was unhedged. Over time, we will bear the full weight of higher market rates, though well protected the coming 2 years.Average debt maturity improved thanks to new loan agreements of SEK8.3 billion during the quarter. Share of unsecured assets have declined during the year due to an increased secured lending. Please observe that the secured debt to total assets only amounts to 14  and that all undrawn revolving credit facilities already are secured and durable. Please also note that credit rating from Moody's at Baa3 with stable outlook and currently no indication of any negative action to our best of knowledge.And then a few words on loan-to-value. The loan-to-value has improved to 37.8  during the year. The rights issue has been the main contributing factor followed by successful divestments and funds from operations. Changes in property values of SEK8.2 billion have, on the other hand, put upward pressure on the loan-to-value. Average interest rates, 2.9 , up from 2.6  at end of 2022 despite increasing underlying interest rates during the year by almost 1.4 . Excluding cross-currency swaps, average interest rate amounts to 2.5  which is fairly good.Backed by strong Nordic banks, we have successfully increased our secured borrowing during the year at reasonable prices well below the bond curve. Nordic banks remain strong and supportive throughout all segments in which we operate. In addition, satisfying to see is that longer duration is more available today compared to a few years ago.Looking into debt maturity and also looking into the debt capital market. That is somewhat more liquid with 1 new bond issued during the quarter, SEK1 billion at 215 bps 2-year duration and another one after the end of the quarter, SEK400 million, somewhat longer, 2.6 years at 200 bps over LIBOR. Bond spreads have tightened followed the issue approximately 100 bps below the entire curve compared with July this year.Available cash and unutilized revolving credit facilities amounted to SEK25.5 billion, covering all the bond maturities until second half of 2026. Reduced project investments and no dividend this year will free up further funds. All outstanding bonds could potentially be repaid given nonaggressive assumptions for future interest rates also adding recurring earnings and reasonable divestments throughout the period.Our expectation is that the debt capital market continues to recover and hope to return to the Eurobond market early next year. Nonetheless, no one can say for sure. Therefore, we still prepare for tougher times in order to safeguard a Baa3 rating and in the long run, strive for an upgrade.JoacimThank you. The 7 largest ongoing projects in our portfolio are listed on this slide. We have an average occupancy rate of 83  and a total rental value of SEK195 million and an average lease duration of approximately 8 years in those projects. For projects that are ongoing after this year, the average occupancy rate is almost 100 .During this year, we have, as mentioned, completed 7 projects and they contribute with a total rental value of some SEK270 million. The occupancy rate for those are 92 , excluding the court building in Jens called Yatelan that is sold. The effect of all these rental values as of 2023 amounts to approximately SEK175 million that will be shown on this year's figure so far. And during the last quarter of this year, another 4 projects will be completed with a rental value of an additional SEK114 million. However, the full effect of these rental values will not be visible until full year 2024.We have approximately 560,000 square meters in our project pipeline that can be started within the next 5 years, given improved market conditions, good lettings and good progress in our development plans. Most of the volume is related to development of logistics assets. And speaking of logistics assets, we continue to create value through our projects. We have had a historic yield on cost for the last 3 years that varies between 5  and 20 , with an average of 10  yield on cost. Compared to our valuation yield of almost 5.2 , development projects have consistently overdelivered compared to acquisitions in the market.As mentioned, we have completed 7 projects. And Jens already mentioned the court building in Malmö. And -- but we won't see the full effect of all these new projects until next year. The pictures on this slide show our beautiful new buildings and one is for the police in Gothenburg. And the other one is the battery manufacturer of North Volt's plant in Latin investors.And talking about the electrification, the climate change is mankind's single most important issue. All other questions will become void if we're all dead. Sustainable in all aspects is something that is the main driver for us at Castellum. The investments must create value to allow us to continue investing. That means saving money, increasing customer satisfaction and meeting market requirements is essential for our sustainability work.Our 38  of our turnover is compatible with the climate change mitigation criteria of the EU taxonomy. A major focus is on reducing energy consumption and in the comparable portfolio rolling 12 months, we have made savings of approximately 6 .Castellum has installed 97 solar cell systems within our 100 on solar program. The installed systems produce electricity corresponding to some 14  of our total electricity consumption. There are several major solar cells that have been completed in the last year and we look set to achieve our target of installing 100 installations by 2025, well ahead of that schedule.So we have a green designation from NASDAQ. And once again, we have met all the conditions for securing that condition. And we have some 58  of the revenues and 83  of the investments meet the requirements for being considered green by NASDAQ. There's another award that we're quite proud of, the GGRESB award. And for the eighth consecutive year, we've been recognized as a global sector leader and we are scoring 100 points out of 100 in the category sustainability in projects.So lastly, some key takeaways. As Jens mentioned, we prepare for continued challenging times. But our core business continued to deliver stable results which gives us a platform for continued growth when that time comes. We have a stable quarter with positive net leasing for the second quarter in a row and we have income from completed projects during the period.We continue to create value through refurbishments, new projects and sustainability work but we do that at a somewhat slower pace than historically. We have a very sound balance sheet with sufficient headroom to mitigate turbulent markets. And the sustainability work remains in focus and energy efficiency initiatives that will pay off. So that completes our run-through.Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Lars Norrby from SEB.I just got into the call, so bear with me if I ask something that you've already given the answer to. But first of all, regarding net letting. Positive numbers again in the quarter. I remember in connection with the Q2 call, I think I asked you a question about what your expectations were for the rest of the year  Are you just as confident right now as you were at that point in time regarding being able to generate positive net letting also during the remaining part of the yearYes, we are, as a matter of fact. But of course, I mean the positive is above zero. So, I can't -- I won't state anything more than we're raving for something above 0. But market is looking good.Perfect. Second question, electricity subsidies. How much of an impact did that have in the third quarter  We have seen some companies supporting net positive figures from that.Insignificant portion.And did you have anything of that in the second quarter  Remind me on that one.Sorry.Did you have any such kind of impact in the second quarterNo. I mean, whatever we get, we will pass on to our tenants.Okay. So there's no net effect from that of any material size at leastNo.And then jumping to a different area, transactions. The thing you announced a -- was it a SEK900 million transaction a few weeks ago. Is there anything more in the pipeline in terms of -- that you're working with in terms of any size in terms of divestments.I mean with the size that we have and the local presence that we have, there's always divestment discussions going on. Whether they will materialize short term or not, I cannot say. But we are selling because we want to assets that are not strategic to us or where we get too good a price to say no. So we are not selling any assets because we need to, because we don't just -- but we're doing it because we want to. So, I think that we've established so far that we are delivering on our strategy but whether we would sell more assets this year or not remains to be seen.The next question comes from Erik Granström from Carnegie.Would like to start off asking some questions on your development portfolio. You mentioned that you've had an average yield on cost of 10  over time. What can you say of the current portfolio running  And what do you expect going forward  Can you still maintain that kind of an average in this sort of inflationary environmentIt's very hard to say. We have our internal thresholds and we try to uphold them, whether all of those will be at the same level as historic. It's very hard to say but we certainly have the ambition to stay on those levels.But given the market yields are coming up, does that mean that you're still expecting your returns versus sort of the market valuation to come down a little bit as we've seen pressure on market yields  Or can you compensate in terms of rent towards tenants for new projectsI mean it remains to be seen but at the same time, we have invested some SEK5 billion in 2022 in CapEx and projects. And we have communicated SEK4.6 billion for the full year 2023. And we've also said that we will try to cut that in half next year. So of course, we have a big pile of potential projects. And of course, if we choose the best ones most likely, we will not choose the ones with the worst return. But at the same time, we also have to be a bit -- I mean we have a lot of larger tenants and we want to have a good relationship with them. So from time to time, we have to choose projects with lower returns in order to safeguard relationships.Okay, fair enough. And sort of with that in mind, do you expect for next year, looking into what kind of indexation and CPI we can expect. We're not there yet. But do you think that the broader tenant base will be able to absorb a CPI indexation  Or is this a discussion that you've started with tenants already nowI mean, this has gone from a nonissue to an actual issue with discussing with tenants. So far, we have seen no sort of direct actions in terms of tenants being unable or unwilling to adhere to the contracts that they've signed. But of course, as time goes by and when these constant indexations become a reality, weaker tenant may have an issue. But so far, we haven't seen any of those questions. Whether that will change in the future is very hard to say.Okay. And my final question is regarding the footprint that you have right now. You mentioned that if you're divesting, you're divesting because you want to, not because you need to. And -- but in terms of the footprint that you have currently, do you feel that the portfolio is optimized for, let's say, the next 3 years in areas where you would like to be  Or do you think that there is some need for Castellum to consolidate the portfolio furtherNo, there's no need for us to do so. I mean, we have a very well-functioning maintenance and asset management operation in place. We like the areas where we are. But of course, given the constraints on the financial markets, we need to make sure that we allocate our resources, both the personnel and our finances to the areas where we'll get the best returns. And that is something that we are constantly evaluating, meaning that some areas where we are today might be weighted down and others might be weighted up. But I wouldn't say in the 3-year period that our portfolio will have changed dramatically but rather completing the trimming that we've been talking about earlier.The next question comes from Markus Henriksson from ABG Sundal Collier.I came in a bit late. So apologize if my questions have already been asked. First off, one on investments. You highlighted last quarter that the main condition was the reopening of the debt capital market. You've been quite active here in Q3. Is that enough for you going back to what you said in Q2  Or should we expect you to remain cautious for the time beingYes, of course. We will remain cautious. That's the short answer. And of course, we are glad to see that the SEC bond market has opened up and that spreads have tightened considerably. We've been able to issue bonds and we still see interest in buying our bonds and therefore, if the right opportunity arises, we will issue again. However, we want to see that the curve continues to tighten. And also important for us is to actually be able to raise longer money in the bond market.And coming back to that last, you highlighted earlier in the call that you might be able to go to the Eurobond market in the beginning of next year. What is it that you're seeing in that market or hearing from the marketI mean we have seen transactions being carried out by real estate companies in the euro market of late and therefore, it's not unreasonable to believe that we will be able to issue in that market again. I think we've done everything that is necessary to separate us to the group of issuers with a strong balance sheet. And looking a few quarters back in time, people looked at the Nordic real estate market as one entity. Now it's becoming clearer and clearer that there are different groups and we belong to the strong group right now.Very clear. Then a question here on electricity costs and hedging. Could you give us a bit of an update on where you stand today in terms of hedging average pricing krona per kilowatt hour and when the hedging is expected to wear offI mean, we bought a lot of expensive energy contracts in September last year and the effect -- we see no effect from those acquisitions of contracts in the third quarter. So I think that we are through the worst period. However, we still see higher prices. So looking into next year, the average spot price is around 70 or 0.07 or 70 or roughly per kilowatt hour. And you should compare that with a price that was much, much higher last year at the same time and therefore -- but I mean these things vary a lot but we, of course, noticed that. The gas reserves in Europe are pretty much full. The weather has been throughout the year relatively good out of an energy perspective. So I think that we can continue to see that the energy prices for Castellum and most others will continue to decrease.The portion of energy that we actually buy in the forward market amounts to roughly 80  in the coming year. But that also varies over time depending on prices and opportunities that we see.Very clear. And a follow-up on that, how should we expect you to hedge going forward  Is it 25  every quarter or once a year  Or how are we going to approach thatI mean, I don't want to make it too strict but the general rule is 80-60-40. So 80  should be hedged the coming 12 months and then 60  the coming 12 to 24 months and then 40  the coming 24 to 36 months. That's the methodology that most listed real estate companies in the Nordics use as far as I'm aware.Perfect. Last question, a question on Entra. You are defending your investment-grade rating in Castellum. Is that something you as a main shareholder in Entra, I think is the right way forward also for themI'd rather pass that question on to Entra. Actually, we remain shareholder in Entra. We are happy with the management and the Board's decisions on Entra's finances but any questions relating to how Entra will operate is better directed towards Entra.And also maybe a last follow-up on central ad. I mean it continues to be quite high. We've seen quite a lot of one-offs in recent years post-merger with Kungsleden. But could you give us some update on efficiency  We touched a bit upon that last quarter questions in the Q A. But what could we expect from Central Ad going forward  Is it going to come down  Is this a sustainable level where we're right now adjusted for the one-offs with recentlyNo, we are aiming to reduce the central admin. I mean, Castellum is now the result of a number of large transactions and mergers. And of course, there are long-term synergies to be taken out that has not fully been realized yet. There's also a shift in the market as everyone is painfully aware. And that means that growth is slower and that we need to make sure that our resources from a central admin point of view is allocated to the areas where we actually need them. So we have an ambition to reduce central admin and to be cautious incurring costs.The next question comes from Alexander  ph  from Green Street.You mentioned that the renegotiated SEK170 million worth of leases during the quarter. Can you give us an indication of the rent reversion gross negotiations with a positive negative growth atI think it's fair to say that it's flat compared to the market and the CPI indexation. The take up, I guess, varies highly between what kind of assets we're looking at. But we don't see any downward pressure on rent levels at all.And in your view, how has that number moved since the start of the year  So you're saying that -- let's say, for office specifically about that in the most recent quarter, was it a positive rental version in Q1In Q1  I'm not sure...I mean, in general as the number moves over the year.I mean we are -- the market is following the CPI indexation except for the very small areas where we have higher vacancies and where the demand is weaker. There, of course, it's tougher to follow the high indexations. But the take-up in general is higher and we see strong demand, especially in office and especially in attractive locations. So we don't see any of the downward pressure or the vacancy increase as you see, for example, in North America or in some parts in the U.K.There are no more questions at this time. So I hand the conference back to the speakers for any closing comments.We actually have a couple of questions in the chat. One relates to our derivative portfolio. I'm not so sure that we are able to disclose all of those issues actually. Is there anything else that sort of we were able to -- we have a question on budgeted CapEx for developments in the coming year. We've been quite vocal about the fact that we are reducing our investment portfolio and we're -- the plan is some SEK2.5 billion next year and we aim at staying on that level. That depends, of course, on whether we can utilize the projects to the yield requirements that we have internally.So, I guess that's -- there's no more questions. So, we thank you all for spending this morning with us and say goodbye.",0,2023-10-27T09:20:27.000-04:00
Germany's Economic Health Check Shows Further Signs Of Weakness,"By    Weak growth, worsening sentiment, and pessimistic forecasts have brought back headlines and public discussion over one key theme over the last few months  whether Germany is once again the  sick man of Europe . The Economist reintroduced theMore than 10 years ago, Germany was celebrating its Wirtschaftswunder 2.0 and grew by 2.1  on average per year between 2010 and 2015. The eurozone   excluding the German economy   grew by only 0.8  on average per year over the same period. Between 2016 and 2022, however, other eurozone economies picked up speed and Germany lost momentum. GDP growth in the monetary union  excluding Germany  was 1.7  on average per year between 2016 and 2022, compared withCurrently, cyclical headwinds like the still-unfolding impact of the European Central Bank s monetary policy tightening and high inflation   plus the stuttering Chinese economy   are being met by structural challenges like the energy transition and shifts in the global economy, alongside a lack of investment in digitalisation, infrastructure and education. To be clear, Germany s international competitiveness had already deteriorated before the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.To a large extent, Germany's issues are homemade. Supply chain frictions in the wake of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis have only exposed these structural weaknesses. These deficiencies are the flipside of fiscal austerity and wrong policy preferences over the last decade.Germany's low level of investment activity in recent years is evidence of the fact that the country has long rested on its functioning business model of importing cheap energy and exporting goods. While fixed capital investment in Germany grew by an average of 4.4  per year between 2010 and 2015, growth was only 3.1  between 2016 and 2022.Just like the economic growth story, the picture elsewhere in the eurozone looks quite the opposite. Excluding Germany, the eurozone's fixed capital investments grew by an average of 1.9  per year between 2010 and 2015. In the years 2016-2022, average investment growth per year was 4.9 .The structural transitions the economy is facing will come at a cost. Just think of energy-intensive production. In the production of food, beverages and tobacco, for example, more than half of the total energy consumption is covered by natural gas. Such a large share of consumption is met by renewable energy sources only in the manufacturing of wood and wood products. The shift from natural gas production to greener forms of production will initially come with productivity losses and, as a result, cause products to become more expensive.The good old growth driver, exports, is also stuttering. On the one hand, China's economic weakness and the expected economic downturn in the US are a burden on German exports. If both of its main trading partners are not doing well economically, this automatically does not bode well for German trade. Secondly, the globalised world as we know it will change. This does not necessarily mean deglobalisation, but rather that trade flows will change. Be it supply chain disruptions in recent years or geopolitical tension, there is certainly a case for diversifying trading partners more and, if possible, bringing production closer to home. However, this development will also be accompanied by efficiency losses and higher prices.The general lack of investment is reflected in crumbling infrastructure. The quality of German roads has been rated worse and worse by various indices since 2010, and digital infrastructure in Germany remains in need of improvement as well. Fibre connections, or high-speed Internet, only accounted for some 8  of total German broadband connections in 2022. The OECD average in the same year was 36 .Demographic change will also structurally weigh on the German economy in the coming years. By 2060, the German working population could shrink up to around 25  compared with 2019. Assuming high labour market participation and high net migration, the loss would still be 5 .Particularly over the next 12 years as the baby boomer generation retires from the German labour market, the shortage of skilled workers in Germany will become much more severe. However, in addition to labour market migration, another factor which could help to fill the gap in the German jobs market is automation. Nearly 80  of baby boomers currently employed in humanities and social sciences could be replaced by fellow robots. In the cleaning profession, more than 60  of employees aged over 55 could be replaced by automation.They say a real crisis only shows in the labour market. With a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of just 5.7 , the German labour market is holding up very robustly. Beneath the surface, however, the first effects of the tense economic situation are beginning to show. For roughly a year now, the number of job postings has been declining, and companies' employment expectations are also slowly becoming much more gloomy. For the time being, it is therefore likely that labour unions will increasingly argue for job security rather than strong wage increases.Taking all the above findings into account, it is clear that the German economy   like a patient that has not taken good care of itself over the last decade   is now paying the price for too little maintenance work. As a result, the country has lost international competitiveness in almost every single ranking. In the European Commission s latest industrial survey, for example, more companies than ever before stated that they expect Germany's competitive position to deteriorate   both within and outside of the EU.Germany has shown regularly in the past that it can master crises. At the current juncture, however, the remedy for the country's current economic problems is not a simple one. It requires a long list of policy measures, structural reforms and investments to bring the economy back to full speed. More than twenty years ago, it took around five years between the first diagnosis and the beginning of serious structural reforms. Let s hope that it will be less this time around.This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

"2 Champs, 1 Winner: Energy Transfer's 9% Yield Beats Enterprise Products' 7% Yield"," and  are two of the best Master Limited Partnerships on the market. The two giants are the backbone of America's energy infrastructure and valuable sources of income and capital gainsI have covered both in the past  EPD in this co-produced  and ET in this  and like both as long-term investments.However, given recent developments, EPD is yielding  only  7 , while ET can still be bought at a 9  yield.In this article, I'll share my thoughts on two similar yet different stocks and explain which one I would be buying if I could only own one.So, let's get to itOn a side note, please note that both companies operate in the midstream energy industry, which means they connect producers ofBoth EPD and ET benefit from throughput fees, which makes cash flows reliable and both stocks good income tools. MLPs are not necessarily a bet on higher energy prices. That's what upstream companies are for.Both ET and EPD issue K-1 forms, which means taxes are shifted from the corporation to its unitholders.Please make sure to be aware of what this could mean for your portfolio before buying.Also, bear in mind that shares are called units. Dividends are called distributions.In this article, I may use both, although it's not technically correct.Enterprise Products Partners always makes me think of a Toyota Corolla. According to multiple , it's one of the most reliable cars ever built. It's not fancy, and it's not fast, but it sure gets the job done, which is to get its owners from A to B  and back  without unexpected costs, annoying breakdowns, and whatnot.A few years ago, people got a good laugh out of a  from Craigslist.So, why does this remind me of EPDLike the average car, EPD and its peers are dealing with many uncertainties and costs. In the Midstream industry, that's mainly demand fears and high investment requirements.For example, over the past ten years, the Alerian MLP ETF  has returned just 10  - including dividendsThis poor performance is due to a number of steep sell-offs that were caused by demand fears hitting sky-high investment requirements.Since the Great Financial Crisis, the American energy industry has required a ton of new pipelines to facilitate rapidly rising oil and gas production, export facilities, and the production of related chemicals.As building pipelines is expensive, most MLPs and C-Corp midstream companies used debt to fill funding gaps, as operating cash flows were often not enough to deal with capital expenditures - let alone dividends.Energy Transfer is one of these companies, but more on that in a bit.Enterprise Products Partners has a large network consisting of more than 50 thousand miles of pipelines, more than 260 million barrels of liquids storage, 20 deepwater docks, 30 natural gas processing plants, and 26 fractionators.These assets connect producers of fossil fuels to buyers and turn these products into value-added products. They also facilitate exports, which is increasingly important in a world where the U.S. allies rely on its energy exports  for example, caused by the war in Ukraine .On top of that, there are a number of things that make EPD very specialAs of 2Q23, the company has a total debt principal outstanding of approximately  28.9 billion, with a weighted average life of the debt portfolio at 20 years and a weighted average cost of debt at 4.6 .Around 97  of the debt is fixed-rate. The consolidated liquidity at quarter-end was approximately  4 billion, which includes both availability under credit facilities and unrestricted cash.The aforementioned leverage ratio of 3.0x aligns with their target range of 2.75x to 3.25x.As a result, in the past four quarters, the company has distributed 57  of its operating cash flow to shareholders. CapEx accounted for less than 40 .EPD also has a track record of consistent dividend distribution growth. The company has hiked its dividend for 25 consecutive years, making it the only MLP with a dividend aristocrat track record.Even better, the dividend has consistently been covered by distributable cash flows, allowing the company to hike its dividend even in 2015 2016 and during the pandemic, when most of its peers were cutting dividends.Just like the Corolla of the Craigslist ad, it didn't matter to EPD how much trouble its industry was in. Oil price crashes, demand fears, a major pandemic, political fears, wars, and more didn't keep EPD from sustainably raising its dividend.This has allowed EPD to consistently outperform its peers, as shown by the YCharts chart earlier in this article.Currently, EPD yields 7.3 . The 5-year distribution CAGR is 2.8 , which means that dividend growth is barely above the Fed's 2  inflation target.Valuation-wise, the stock is trading at 7.7x operating cash flow, which is below its normalized valuation of 10.7x OCF. Next year, OCF is expected to grow by 2 , followed by 4  growth in 2025.This paves the road for consistent low-single-digit dividend growth, and it's backed by  4.1 billion in projects under construction.These projects include a natural gas pipeline expansion, a cryogenic natural gas processing plant, an NGL fractionator, and the PDH 2 plant in Chambers County.The company also announced plans for three new natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and the first phase of the Texas Western products pipeline.These projects will significantly expand their capacity and value-added services.The current consensus price target is  32, which is 16  above its current price. I believe it's a fair target.In general, I really like EPD. It's reliable, a source of elevated income, and undervalued.However, it may not be the best play on the market.If EPD is a Corolla, ET is that car you almost totaled but managed to fix a few times. As the chart below shows, excluding dividends distributions, ET lost 90  of its value during the 2016 commodity crash. It revisited these lows during the pandemic.It also cut its dividend during the pandemic.Overall, ET wasn't a great place to be.That has changed.Excluding the Crestwood merger, the company has a massive footprint in the United States, which includes 14,300 miles of crude oil pipelines, a million barrels of daily Permian crude oil takeaway capacity, and pipelines to other major basins, like Bakken.The company also has eight fractionators, close to 6,000 miles of NGL pipelines, and more than 54 thousand miles of gathering pipelines with almost 12 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity, making it a giant in the natural gas industry.Now, ET is a much healthier, more mature corporation.It could be a future Corolla.In August, the company's credit rating was upgraded to BBB, which means it's now an investment-grade rating. Its leverage ratio is expected to be at the lower end of the 4-4.5x target range, and its CapEx requirements are dropping, allowing the company to boost free cash flow.Looking at the table below, we see that the company is expected to generate  6.2 billion in free cash flow this year, which would translate to 14  of the company's market capBear in mind that free cash flow is operating cash flow after all capital expenditures.This would mean that there's a path to double-digit dividends down the road.In the second quarter, Energy Transfer announced a quarterly cash distribution of  0.31 per common unit, an increase from the  0.23 paid in 2Q22.The company maintains its goal of achieving a 3  to 5  annual distribution growth rate while managing leverage reduction, enhancing equity returns, and ensuring sufficient cash flow for investment in its growth opportunities.This month, the company hiked by 0.8  to  0.3125, which translates to a yield of 8.9 .Going forward, the company is acquiring Crestwood Equity Partners in a  7.1 billion deal that wouldn't affect its credit and add a business with more than 85  fee-based income to its portfolio.Meanwhile, the company's Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals continue to benefit from the increasing demand for ethane and LPG products, with plans to expand NGL export capacity at Nederland.Additionally, the company is considering an optimization project at the Marcus Hook terminal.In the Delaware Basin, several processing plants have been placed into service, supported by customer commitments.The Gulf Run pipeline, connecting gas-producing regions to LNG export markets, is nearing full subscription, causing discussions about capacity expansion.All of this supports low-to-mid-single-digit long-term operating cash flow growth, which makes the company attractive.Due to past troubles, the company has a more attractive valuation than most peers.ET is trading at just 7.5x forward EBITDA.The current consensus price target is  17.30, which is 24  above its current price.Thanks to the mix of a strong business, a juicy, well-protected dividend yield, and an attractive valuation, ET has turned into an outperformer.Since 2011, ET has consistently outperformed the AMLP ETF and the dividend aristocrat EPDGiven the attractive valuation and massively improved business, I expect that ET will continue to outperform, which is why I would rather buy it than EPD.Needless to say, this is not a call to get people out of EPD. I respect EPD's business a lot. I just have to say that the risk reward of ET is still better, even after two years of outperformance.When comparing Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners, I find myself leaning toward ET as the more attractive investment choice.While EPD is like the reliable Toyota Corolla of the MLP world, offering a steady 7.3  yield and consistent dividend growth, ET has transformed from a troubled past to a more mature, promising option.ET boasts a healthier financial profile, with an investment-grade rating and a path to double-digit dividends.With a current yield of 8.9  and strong business growth prospects, it has consistently outperformed its peers since the pandemic, which I expect to last.This is not to downplay the merits of EPD, which is reliable, income-generating, and undervalued. However, the risk-reward balance seems to tilt in favor of ET, making it my preferred choice in this comparison.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Please go ahead.Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and welcome to the Liberty Energy third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call are Chris Wright, Chief Executive Officer  Ron Gusek, President  and Michael Stock, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's views about future prospects, revenues, expenses, or profit. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2023 operational and financial results.Liberty delivered excellent quarterly financial results reflecting outstanding operational execution, focused customer engagement and agility across a softer North American frac market. Record pumping efficiencies drove sequential growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA while electing to idle a fleet during the quarter in response to softer market conditions.Adjusted EBITDA was  319 million, while fully diluted earnings per share was  0.85. The industry remained disciplined, championing steady pricing for quality services while withdrawing underutilized frac fleets from the market. Our superior execution, combined with expanded vertical integration and technology investments culminated in a trailing 12-month adjusted pre-tax return on capital employed of 44 . I'm proud that our team delivered a milestone achievement in operational efficiency.We achieved the third consecutive quarter of record average daily pumping efficiencies, delivered across our full fleet, safely pumping more hours and tons of sand than ever before. This success was driven by the unique culture of innovation and excellence at Liberty. Over the years, our investment decisions have grown our competitive advantage by driving value creation through technology, scale and vertical integration.Today, the latest piece in our digiTechnologies suite is demonstrating impressive operating results. The commercial deployment of our proprietary digiPrime units commenced in late September, quickly becoming the crew and customer's favorite technology on that location. We embark years ago with a blank slate to envision design and build natural gas powered frac fleets that would represent a step change improvement in frac technology. We didn't choose the easy route to simply extrapolate from existing pump technology, or the partial route, where we outsourced the power generation part of our frac fleet. We took on the whole enchilada, with a commitment to build the best dam next-gen frac fleet.Well, the effort was worth it. Today, we have a truly differential frac fleet technology that is setting operating performance records while delivering the highest efficiency, lowest emission fleets in the industry. To say that customer interest in digi is high would be an understatement. We are supplying digiFleets with robust, reliable compressed natural gas delivered and managed on site by our new Liberty Power Innovation's Division. We are on track to be operating four digiFleets by year end and six digiFleets by the end of January 2024. We are excited by the strong customer benefits and pull for our digiFleets.As we continue to transition our fleet towards more natural gas fuel technologies, we are also maximizing diesel displacement with natural gas across our dual fuel fleets. We have worked in conjunction with our technology providers to develop and deploy control software to significantly increase diesel displacement. Our year's long effort in predictive and preventative maintenance programs have positioned us to optimize equipment performance and availability, enabling us to run our pumps in optimal operating ranges to achieve maximum gas substitution.We are also starting to reap the advantage of vertical integration provided by LPI improving the reliability of gas supply to our frac fleets. There is much room to run here. Liberty's focus on asset optimization maximizes the uptime of each pump, driving higher equipment reliability and operational efficiency. Our predictive maintenance programs are better than ever before continually assessing asset health in real time.By applying advanced analytical tools and processes such as machine learning and AI, we're addressing issues before they become critical and using this data to prevent issues in the future. A year ago, we realigned teams to seamlessly work together on the shared goals of maximizing operational efficiency and optimizing equipment maintenance. Today, real time data is enabling our teams to execute on these priorities and hold themselves accountable in delivering superior results.Wireline was a new business adding Liberty in the one stem transaction. We knew our customers would greatly benefit from streamlining our frac and wireline crew interactions on-site to shave extra minutes off the day. Every minute equals efficiency and translates into a lower cost of producing a barrel of oil for our customers and improved profitability for Liberty.Today, we have more frac and wireline paired  red-on-red  crews since we first brought wireline into the fold. We are proud that Liberty wireline now ranks as the top service provider according to the most recent Kimberlite survey, an independent industry research that extensively polls E P customers across the industry.We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 40  in response to the significant growth in our per share earnings and cash generating abilities from our business transformation over the last three years. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1  of our shares outstanding or accumulative 11  since our buyback reinstatement in July 2022. We are focused on the opportunistic execution of our buyback strategy.We will move more aggressively during stock price pullbacks and moderate our pace when the stock runs up. However, we continue to see a large dislocation in our stock price, relative to what we believe is the intrinsic value of our stock. The goal remains the same, maximize the value of each Liberty share and drive higher total returns for years to come.Fleets across the industry were idled in response to completions activity softness, supporting a better supply demand balance of marketed fleets as compared to prior cycles. As the Shale Revolution matures, the industry has adapted to a new era in frac markets through consolidation, technological process, disciplined investment and serving increasingly complex customer needs.Frac activity has largely stabilized at current levels representing a baseload of frac fleet demand needed to sustain E P operators' flattish production levels. Fourth quarter trends will likely see seasonal softness, winter weather and holiday disruptions. We expect the recent strengthening of commodity prices will drive a modest increase in industry activity beginning in 2024.Liberty's internal analysis shows several natural gas levered E P companies are expecting to increase activity into 2024. The sustained strength in crude oil prices is also stimulating demand for frac fleets among smaller private oil producers. The resumption of modest growth in frac is within view.Global oil and gas markets found firmer footing during the third quarter, driving higher oil and gas prices. Volatility in commodity markets has emerged from the possibility of an escalating conflict in the Middle East and renewed recessionary fears. Recognizing the elevated uncertainty, global industry supply and demand trends infer that the delicate balance of oil and gas markets is tilted to the upside, given the relatively small spare production capacity today.But long term demand outlook for secure North American energy anchors a more durable cycle. OPEC  decisions, including the extension of Saudi Arabia's production cuts, further demonstrate a willingness to support commodity prices underpinning long term investments in North American shale. We just saw an industry tightened double down on North America's future.The positive outlook for North America is leading to consolidation and investment amongst E P operators focused on long term value creation. Liberty is uniquely positioned to support our customers ambitions to unlock value with our superior services, next generation technologies, integrated footprint and scale. Today's E P customer is focused on driving improvement, which can only be achieved with outstanding service partners and differential technologies.The transformative work our team accomplished over the last three years through technology investments, vertical integration of wireline, sand and logistics and now LPI natural gas, trading and delivery uniquely positions Liberty to address the diversity and complexity of customer needs.I would like to take a moment to celebrate the Liberty team record performance was a result of the collective effort of all of our 5,500 teammates across North America. I am proud to be your partner. We outperformed in the third quarter in the face of a softening industry, delivering significant operating efficiencies, outstanding safety record and attractive returns.In the fourth quarter activity is expected to slow modestly on normal seasonality and the related impact on efficiency. For full year 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be at the high end of our guidance range of 30  to 40  growth over 2022. We continue to deliver superior returns and a differential service for our customers. Our commitment to excellence and focus on company culture, our next generation digiTechnologies suite and LPI positions us well to compete in both near term cycles and over the long term. The best is yet to come.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Stock our CFO to discuss our financial results and outlook.Good morning, everyone.Liberty's year-to-date results have been outstanding during a period marked by softening activity trends using a slightly different return metrics from  indiscernible  Chris mentioned earlier, that we use to benchmark ourselves versus the industry in the S P 500. Our annualized cash return on invested capital is 37  year-to-date, an increase from 31  from 2022.Our third quarter financial results was notable marking a modest increase from the prior quarter and adjusted EBITDA and a most decrease in net income despite slower industry activity and the idling of fund fleet. Our results not only showcase the importance of leading reliability, technology and service quality to our profitability, but also highlight the importance of those features to our customers.Third quarter 2023 revenue was  1.2 billion, a 2  year-over-year increase and a 2  increase from the second quarter. Relative to the second quarter, record efficiencies across the full fleet, integrated services and a favorable product mix more than offset market headwinds and the idling of one fleet during the quarter.In the third quarter, we had the highest pump hours of sand pumped in the history of the company, even with one fewer fleet than prior quarters. Third quarter net income after tax of  149 million represented a 1  increase from prior year and a modest decrease from  153 million in the second quarter. Fully diluted net income per share was  0.85, a 10  increase from prior year, which highlights the per share benefits of our share buyback program and compares to  0.87 in the second quarter.General and administrative expenses totaled  55 million in the third quarter and included non-cash stock based compensation of  9 million. G A decreased  3 million sequentially as the second quarter miscellaneous expenses did not repeat. Net interest and associated fees totaled  7 million for the quarter.Tax expense for the quarter was  50 million approximately 25  pre-tax income. We expect the tax expense rate for the full year to be approximately 25  of pre-tax income. Cash taxes was  7 million in the third quarter and we expect 2023 cash taxes to be approximately 35  of our effective book tax rate for the year.In 2024, we expect to be approximately 24  effective book tax rate and a cash - similar cash tax rate. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 15  year-over-year and 2  sequentially to  319 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of  27 million and net debt of  196 million. Net debt decreased by  60 million from the end of the second quarter.Cash flows were used to fund capital expenditures  29 million of share buybacks and  8 million of quarterly cash dividends. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter including availability under the credit facility was  322 million. Net capital expenditures were  161 million in the third quarter which included costs related to digiFleet construction, capitalized maintenance spending and other projects.We had approximately  12 million of proceeds from asset sales in the quarter. Net cash from operations was  273 million for the quarter and returns to shareholders were  38 million for the quarter. Our capital expenditures remain on target for 2023 as we expect to deliver certain digiFleet components in the fourth quarter.In July 2022 and January 2023, we installed and then upsized the  500 million share repurchase program, respectively to take advantage of our dislocated share prices. We also reinstated our quarterly cash dividend one-year ago. We are pleased to share our Board has approved a 40  increase to our quarterly cash dividend to  0.07 per share beginning this quarter, reflecting our conviction their ability to generate strong free cash flow through the cycles.We also continue our returns to shareholders program with our buyback program, including the repurchase of 1.8 million shares in the third quarter, which represents approximately 1  of the shares outstanding in the beginning of the quarter for a total of  29 million. We have now returned to shareholders accumulative  325 million in the past five quarters.We continue to differentiate ourselves with an industry leading return of capital program while reinvesting in higher return opportunities and growing our free cash flow. Looking ahead, we see North American completions activity to slow modestly in Q4 on normal seasonality and the related impact on efficiency. We expect activity to increase modestly in 2024.In the third quarter, we reduced our active fleet count by one fleet, consolidating our planned activity with our higher efficiency fleets and improving utilization. While we expect normal seasonal softness in the fourth quarter, we do not plan to idle any additional fleets due to the demand in Q1 of 2024.As a result, we will now anticipate reaching the high end of our full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA outlook of approximately 30  to 40  year-over-year growth. In 2024, we continued - we see a continued constructive outlook for the oil and gas markets and even more so for Liberty. We anticipate free cash flow will exceed 2023 levels driven by incremental profitability from our current year investments, continued margin expansion and efficiency initiatives and lower capital expenditures. We will continue to deliver on our strategic priorities, including our industry leading return of capital program, a strong balance sheet and continued investment in differential technologies that position us well in the coming years.I will now turn it back to the operator for Q A. Afterwards Chris will have some closing comments at the end of the call.Operator Instructions  Our first question is from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead.Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two things for me. The first I'll start with, and I have to ask you, is the guidance - I mean you have, you had a really good quarter, a great three quarters start to the year, it feels like it would be hard to not get above the guidance range. I know there's some seasonality but could you just kind of give us some any additional color on how to think about the fourth quarter given you're not laying down anymore fleets. And you're at such a healthy level through the third quarterYes, Stephen. Yes, our guidance has always is our best estimate of where we're going to come in, we want to be close. And if you look at the fourth quarter seasonality, we've been very, very efficient with our customer's plans, as we've been through the first three quarters. So you are going to see a little bit of budget maintenance as they've sort of - they've completed things a little bit quicker than they would have expected. And so as we go through, you're going to see seasonal slowdowns with holidays and winter, a little bit of budget maintenance management as we go through the year and then I think you'll see everything pick up again in Q1.Okay, thanks Michael. And then as we think about next year and your capital spending needs, how should we think about CapEx. I think it should fall as a percentage of EBITDA. And it feels like that will lead to pretty robust free cash flow next year. And any color you can add on plans for that free cash flowWe will continue with - as our stated goals, obviously, the first year we managed was a very, very strong balance sheet to make sure that we can weather any situation that could come up in the future. We have an incredibly high demand for our next generation technologies. And as you see, we will have a very, very strong return of cash to shareholders program. We also have some interesting business opportunities with our Liberty Power Innovations business. So, I think we will continue with exactly the way we have invested capital over the last 10-years.And any ballpark on CapEx for next year at this pointNo, we will give you those details in our January calls as we always do as we like to give it to you once a year.Okay. Thank you.A lots of free cash flow as you said, Stephen, we agree very significant free cash flow next year.Yes, I mean, it feels like CapEx comes down and free cash flow is pretty strong. That's why I ask the question. Thanks, Chris and Michael.Yes, thanks Stephen.The next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Yes, thank you. And good morning. Just wanted to follow-up. One of the things I think Chris, you said was, you know, customers are obviously going to want more efficiency, better performance, et cetera. As we talk some of the E P companies, they also discuss, you know, hey we want the right sort of company rather than the single cheapest service company we can get. Can you give us any insights into how sort of we should think about that with pricing  We typically think of pricing power but what is the right way to think about that relationship here as to what it can mean for margins in '24You always have some companies in our industry, and I would say when Liberty started, they maybe when the norm that viewed frac as a commodity. Well, we bid it out, we get a whole bunch of bids, and our supply chain team sees who the two or three cheapest are, and then we go talk to them. That was the norm when we launched Liberty today that exists but it's not the norm anymore.I just think people have taken a broader view of shale. And on this line item, is that Liberty number higher  Well, yes, it is. But if you get wells done faster, safer, more efficiently, lower emissions, and better help on design and execution about how to maximize recovery from those wells. Hey, all in value, I would say Liberty holds up a pretty significant differential versus others.And one of the things we have rolling out now is this different fleet technology, right - that arbitrage between the cost of power fleet with diesel and the cost of power fleet with natural gas. That's a huge cost savings opportunity that benefits both our customers and us. And our fleets not only are burning natural gas versus diesel but these next generation fleets burn a lot less natural gas than a turbine driven fleet for the same amount of work. The higher thermal efficiency, virtually zero methane slip, so they're just cleaner and cheaper, more efficient.So that technology allows it to be a win for our customers and a win for us. But ultimately, there's always a back and forth dialogue with our customers. Hey, market is softening. We're seeing numbers like this. But we don't have customers saying, hey, these guys are 10  cheaper. So we're going to jump over there.I would say most of our customers and our partners, they get the value and the trust in the relationship working together. We didn't do everything we could have last fall when the market was really tight. Could we have jacked up prices a little bit more and missed people, but still held the work  Sure we could have. But we didn't do that. We act as long-term partners with our customers like this business thrives when we win, our customers win and over the long-term, you can generate better efficiency, smarter decision making and come up with new ideas that then should be developed. There's just huge benefits in long-term partnerships with our customers. And I am thrilled like a ton of our achievements, our innovations, they're not just Liberty, that's partnerships with long-term customers that lead to stuff like that.No, I appreciate that. Follow-up question for you, Michael, as we think about the combination of the ways to return cash to shareholders, dividends versus share repos, is there an overall framework we should think about here, or is kind of getting to Stephen's earlier question. If free cash flow is up, we should just think about that as incremental returns to shareholdersMost of it will go there, Roger, but look, we've been a believer to have a base dividend that's modest, it's a very small percent of our cash generation ability. And we plan to slowly and steadily grow that with time, that's sort of a base return, that's going to happen. We bumped it a larger chunk this year, because we're basically recalibrating it for the much greater cash generation ability we have now than we had three years ago on a per share basis.And then so that's a small piece. But that's sort of the base piece that's always there. Then there's obviously CapEx and that's always the biggest balancing decision we have. Wow. And then again, today, that's trickier. Because the demand for what we have new coming out is just tremendous. But we're not going to invest all the cash we generate or even more than half of it into CapEx but we're going to balance what are the most compelling investments and how do we structure that.And then that additional cash  No, the biggest use of it, the last year has been buybacks. That's probably the case, I'm not sure next year, that's going to be the case as well. There's - technology based acquisitions are generally not an AMD company. But if there's compelling things, we'll do those. And we always think it's critical to just keep the balance sheet, very strong because you never know what happens.And look, I know, you know the history, but in that top downturn in '15 and '16 and the top COVID downturn, we were positioned and able to make just compelling acquisitions, that massively grew our per share value and ability to generate cash and profitability. So buybacks are still the dominant thing, but we put for us it's not formulaic, it's not a percent of cash and a quarter. I don't think you should look at cash flow or profitability or any of those things on short-term timeframes. There's swings to them.So, we just take a longer term window on that. And I'm sure you've heard before in our buybacks, we have an internal view on intrinsic value versus stock price. And the wider that differential is, the more aggressive our buybacks are going to be. And if the stock price moves quickly, if it moves quickly downward, we're going to pounce on that. If it moves quickly upward, we're going to caution and take a breath and reflect what's happening. Not going to stock buybacks if there's still a large value dislocation but we're going to be more measured in the approach.Appreciate that. Thank you.Thanks.The next question is from Derek Podhaizer with Barclays. Please go ahead.Hi, I want to ask a few questions on your digiFleets. So you talked about getting the four by year end, six by end of January. How should we think about the digiFleets as far as incremental versus replacement  And then if we look into 2024 and how this  hydrates  your overall fleet  How do we think about that expanding your profitability  And then finally, just the future mix of the digiFrac versus the digiPrime  And who do you think is going to be the winner over timeGreat, great questions, Derek. First of all, in the replacement versus the digiFleets that just market dependent. I think when we talked a year ago, when the market was literally short equipment, we said probably a balance between the two. Look at the marketplace now, there's no shortage of horsepower out there. So all of these fleets were rolling in, are just replacement for our oldest equipment. You know, that's the cost of maintenance and lowest of quality equipment. They're just replacement fleets. The market stays like it is today, no reason to change that strategy.The fleet's themselves and maybe we've communicated less than perfectly here, there's not any different digiFrac fleet or digiPrime fleet. There's a digiFleet. There's two different frac pumps that have different strengths and different weaknesses that together we built to make a system that was just compelling. And that was differential. And I'm going to have Ron expand a little bit more on the difference between those pumps and how you can figure the optimal fleet, depending upon the customer needs.Yes, Derek. I like to think of them as complementary, not that there's going to be a winner and a loser in these technologies. So as Chris noted in his opening remarks, digiFrac the electric pump for us. And so that consists of two components, first of all, power generation trailers, so the Rolls Royce 20-cylinder, natural gas engine driving an electric generator, and then the electric pump itself that turns that electricity back into mechanical energy.That was a five-year effort for us to build from the ground up, fit-for-purpose electric system, and that included both innovation around the power generation side to make sure we delivered the most efficient low emissions power generation we could, that was modular, that was capitally efficient, that allowed us to deploy the right amount of power generation to match needs on location to be able to adapt to incoming grid power to the extent we had that available to us.And then to pair that with a ground up pump design that we again, think brings a whole host of benefits to the table. But in working through that design and ultimately, as we began to have conversations with our customers around the deployment of digiFrac, there was a recognition that not all of our customers are going to use grid power as part of this. And so that led us to recognize we had further opportunity. We had an opportunity to make this system more efficient yet, which is to say that we were going to remove the conversion of energy from mechanical to electrical and back to mechanical, there are losses associated with that. And so you burn a little more gas and as a result have a modest amount more emissions to accomplish the same thing.And that's what led to digiPrime. So digiPrime just removes that conversion mechanism, we take that same natural gas engine, incredibly efficient, lowest emissions profile you can find in the industry, and attach that directly to a transmission and a pump. Now there's a limitation to digiPrime and that the engine is a constant speed engine, it runs at one speed and one speed only. We have the ability to change gears, so we have some amount of rate control.But if when you really want that fine-tuning in a frac, when you're working up against the high pressure limitations that we might have, you want that ability to have some micro adjustment in rate. We don't get that with digiPrime, we get that with digiFrac, the electric version of the pump. And so you'll see these two - these two different technologies work together as what we'll call a digiFleet.And so, it's ultimately going to be a combination of the two. And the ratio of those two different technologies on location is going to be a function of whether or not the operator - our customer, our partner in this anticipates using grid power. So to the extent we won't have access to grid power, you should expect the digiFleet to consist of the majority digiPrime pumps and then a couple of digiFrac electric pumps on top of that for that fine-tuning.And then to the extent we have an E P partner who's going to have some grid power on location, we might access - have access to 5 or 10 megawatts of electricity, you're going to see the percentage of that fleet. That is digiFrac our electric pumps creep up a little higher, and we'll have less digiPrime on that. So that's how we'll think about that going forward. It's going to vary fleet-by-fleet, customer-by-customer, depending on the situation we find in the field. But ultimately, at the end of the day we are going to deliver to the customer, an unrivalled technology profile with the lowest emissions and lowest fuel consumption you can find in the industry.Great, I appreciate that rundown very interesting and very helpful. Second question, I know you talked about the opening costs. But I agree that integration is going to define the winners in a maturing shale cycle. Can you spend some time on LPI  I know is a recent acquisition, but maybe how impactful it was for third quarter  Or how should we think about it for 2024 and it being a profitability lever as you continue to scale that out across your fleetsYes, it's in line with other Liberty historical vertical integration. If there's something that's holding us back, slowing down the delivery of our quality of service, we look at how to solve that problem and to get on time delivered natural gas. There's not a lot of options today and the quality of that service is very spotty. Sometimes it's fine. Sometimes it's not enough gas. Sometimes these manifolds can hook up to some of the pumps, but not all the pumps.All of these things just hold back the substitution of natural gas into diesel. So, we just decided we're taking that problem into our own hands. And we're going to make sure all of our fleets have reliable robust gas delivery. As CNG is the right option that's done via CNG. If there's gas to process out of a pipeline or field gas, we have technologies to process that gas on-site and use that, we can blend the two together.So, we just decided natural gas is so critical. It's look, stepping back. It's the fastest growing energy source on the planet and has been for the last 10-years and likely will be for the next 10-years. So we are talking here about that specific application of using natural gas to power frac fleets, which absolutely is the future for many reasons, costs, emission, efficient abundance of natural gas. Now we're also - we want that expertise to build - you can call virtual pipelines, delivery and moving of natural gas to where we need or starting with our natural gas our frac fleets, digiFleets that without gas they don't run. Dual fuel fleets, if you don't get gas, they still run, you just burn more diesel, more expensive, higher emissions, and you should have been.So, we're building - LPI. First to power our frac fleets. But it's also of course going to supply other people's rigs, other operations in the field. There's other oilfield applications for that. And ultimately as you look ahead, what is Liberty generating expertise in. We're generating expertise, and having the highest thermal efficiency on wheels, mobile power generation there is. And we're generating expertise in how to move natural gas, how to remotely or on-site process natural gas to deliver natural gas, wherever it's needed and however it's needed.So, natural gas is 40  of U.S. electricity generation. And sadly, but unfortunately, we are driving our electricity grid prices up and our grid stability down. So expertise and moving, deploying natural gas and remote power generation is only going to grow in value.Great, appreciate all the color. I'll turn it back.The next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning.Good morning, Luke.Good morning. The whole digi initiative seems like it's going extremely well. And I guess specifically on digiPrime, this was just over testing a few months ago. It has now been in the field since September. You guys talked about this being the customer's favorite technology on-site. But can you maybe just talk a little further about the feedback and maybe what you've learned as well of having it live - on our well locationYes, sure can Luke. Feedback has been extremely positive since day one. So you have to imagine what really is a pretty big step forward for not only our operations team, but also our customers in terms of what they're seeing here. We're basically talking about power density, that's two for one relative to Tier 4 DGB. So you know where to optimize substitution on a Tier 4 DGB engine.Obviously, this is pressure dependent, but you might see that pump delivering maybe six barrels a minute or so. We've got digiPrime out there a single pump, effectively replacing two of those, delivering steady as she goes day-in and day-out 24 hours a day, at 12 barrels a minute. And it's doing so burning less gas than those two pumps would have combined. So remove the diesel and reduce the gas consumption. And we're delivering twice the rateSo it truly is an incredible step forward. It's fully integrated with our pump control platform. And so to our operations team out there, it is seamless in its operation. But you could - think of it just like a nuclear power plant on our grid. Once it is up and running it is steady as she goes in. It has been delivering day-in and day-out since we put it out there. The first customer for that is extremely excited and cannot wait to see some more of them out on location.Okay. Great. Thanks, Ron. And then Chris, I know you don't want to disclose customer's for their remaining digi deployments later this year and early next in the Permian  Are these in a couple of different basinsStarting in a couple of different basins, for me is the biggest basin. So of course, the majority of digi deployment is in the Permian. We've got requests in pulling to several basins, but - at year end we'll be running digi in just two basins and much room to grow in those two basins. But by the end of next year, that will certainly be more than two basins. That's one of our big questions we've got inside the right partners, the right timing to continue the deployment.Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.Thank you.The next question is from Waqar Syed with ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Thank you. And first of all congrats on a great quarter. My question is like in the Q3 results, how many digiFleets were active during the quarter on averageProbably  two in the weeds to quote  - two is probably a reasonable estimate but originally we feathering these pumps into existing fleet, that's one of the key things. The fleet keeps running just like it did and we feather in this technology. It's only more - and across multiple fleets. It's only more recently that we have fleets running that are entirely digi.Okay. And so, when you started running these entirely digiFleets, what the margin on those be accretive to the margins that you get on other fleetsThey are. They are. There's additional diesel displacement, there's lower cost to our customers and a higher technology solution. So yes, that benefits Liberty as well as benefiting our customer.So then taking that thought forward. So once you have, let's say, six of those fleets running in Q2 of next year, if nothing else changes, this record high margin that we saw in Q3, 25.5  or so EBITDA margins, you could be higher - running higher margin than that in Q2 or Q3 next yearIt's absolutely possible Waqar and that is a - right, that's the internal job. We call it self-improvement in Liberty. We have to always be in a position where if the market is flat, our profitability is growing. We're growing by doing things better, by doing things more efficiently, by delivering premium technologies. So yes, if the market stayed flat for the next three years, would Liberty's profitability continue to grow through those three years  Absolutely.So you're saying right now that 2024 could be modestly higher activity. So, when we translate that into Liberty's profitability or EBITDA, given that LPI could be contributing or EBITDA given that you'll have more of these digiFleets running with higher margins  How do you see 2024 EBITDA versus 2023Look, again, in a flat market conditions, it will certainly rise. But you know, that bigger factor swings in what's going on in the marketplace. But I think as you've seen over the last three quarters in a gradually softening market. Can our self-improvement offset that  It can, but the question is, how much is the market softened  Or how much is the market strengthened  Or does it stay flatBut I think the point is well taken Waqar that in a flat market, we have drivers of increased profitability. Absolutely, and we will always strive to have that. But you know that second factor is what is the market actually do  And we don't control that. But we are - you get the feeling that the volatility in that in market conditions, is likely to be lower in the next few years than it's been in the last few years. Thanks Waqar.Thank you.The next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Hi, Chris. I wanted to start with maybe a bigger picture kind of question. We've seen some recent consolidation in the Permian Basin with Exxon and Pioneer. And Exxon's key thesis is to significantly raise resource factors. And they cited called two-thirds of the expected synergies to come from higher recovery factors. So and a lot of that is driven by frac. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the ability of the industry to raise recovery factors. We have heard of some producers more recently touting a new kind of completion design and want to get your thoughts on that. And ability that maybe if you can increase recovery factors, the ability to improve economics in Tier 2 and Tier 3 wells, which I think would have a positive implications for your businessYes. So look, that is certainly been the story of the shale revolution is that continual innovation, we say design of the plumbing underground to increase recovery. Liberty was certainly an early mover, maybe first publisher of this extreme limited entry we got to get more fracs within each fracs stage more contact area. So, there we've seen a continual march-up in innovation, really ultimately recovery factors in shale oil productivity.That what's the mast over the last five years is probably a slightly declining average quality of location being drilled. And then this improvement, incremental improvements of recovery have offset that to at the beginning, have slowly increasing recoveries per foot. Now those increases generally are not happening anymore overall because the average decrease in rock quality is slightly out running this incremental improvements in technology.Now look, Exxon is a tremendous technological powerhouse. So if Exxon have their efforts, maybe more than incremental views of how to change recovery, I wouldn't bet against Exxon. We work with a lot of partners on some are incremental, some are more testing or investigating game-changing ideas for recovery. So yes, a lot of that going on. Yes, you're going to see continued technological improvement in recovery from wells. And some will be incremental and some will be bigger changes. But obviously, your bigger picture question is, is really a question for Exxon. But yes, our industry is moving forward. We'll continue to and there could be some exciting things in the next few years.Great, thanks for that. And shifting gears a little bit. Chris, we are in RFP season, talking to my E P coverage around, having discussions with frac operators around 2024 needs. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize the tone of those discussions, obviously. And maybe give us a sense of how you think pricing will play out this year versus last year when the supply demand balances was quite a bit tighterYes, so again, as I said, look all dialogues are generally one-on-one with our customers. We don't submit a whole bunch of bids, and then wake up in December and find out who we're going to be working for next year. That's never been the way our business works. Almost all of our business is continuing to work with existing customers. Do the bigger ones of those RFP  Yes absolutely. Did they get market checks  Absolutely. Might they ship their fleet composition  Absolutely.Generally less with Liberty fleets, we tend to continue to work with our existing partners and we have dialogues about what's going on in the marketplace. And what are reasonable responses to that. Yes, where market conditions much stronger 12 months ago than today  Absolutely. But are market conditions bad today  Absolutely not.As you've seen with our results, and where we're pumping, people want the right partners. We also - most of our dialogue with customers isn't so much about line item Liberty, pricing, it's what can we do together to drive down well costs  How can we move faster  How can we change the design  How can we swap out a chemical that we thought we needed with a cheaper example  How can we deliver sand more efficientlyHere price of sand is going down  Does that change our frac design that's driving well cost down, the price of steel and tubers are going down. The price of plugs is going down. There's some technology innovations. So look, always this dialogue around this kind of stuff but it's not as black and white, you know, like they win we lose, there's a price. There is a little bit of that. But the broader dialogue is how do we get more efficient and improve both of our economicsAnd so, in the spot market, is it soft right now  Is there idle equipment  Yes. You know, but for quality dedicated fleets is there a huge surplus of that  No. So no, I think pricing will probably continue to be relatively boring. It hasn't moved a lot over the last 12 months and probably not going to move a lot over the next 12 months. That's my guess.Great. Thanks a lot, Chris.Thanks. Good questions.The next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Yes. Thanks so much. And Chris, want to stay on the topic of the macro. I think you've said that you expect demand for frac fleets to parallel recent rig counts at approximately a one quarter lag. Is that still your thinking  And if so, how are you thinking about the rig count, which is showing some signs of stabilization, but your views around that, as that'll feed into the demand view as wellYes, but what we hear from our customers and it's obviously no secret. I think rig count is probably bottoming now. I think you're going to see rig count grow over the next 6 to 12 months. But in our new boring shale industry it's probably going to grow much slower, much more modestly. People are disciplined in investments, publics are low - change their plans too much. Privates are the more reactive ones, drilling economics are quite good today for oil.So, are we going to see an increase in private activity  Absolutely. Natural gas, we're going to see - growth in activity there but people, I think are wisely more waiting for the right market signals, gas prices affirmed a little bit, let's see what the winner does, huge new demand starting late next year through the couple of years after that from LNG export capacity. So definitely going to see rising gas activity.But in frac, maybe that starts in Q2. Could be some a little bit sooner than that. The winter is warm and if the frac can stay low, it could be Q3. But yes, a little bit of upward momentum and gas, a little bit of upward momentum in oil for private and publics are pretty slow and steady.That's helpful. And staying on the macro, we've talked about consolidation through the lens of your customer, we've also seen consolidation in the U.S. frac industry, what has that meant for discipline and your ability to sort of hold pricing in a softening marketSo it's absolutely helpful. The big companies just by nature have a longer term time horizon. So they retire a small frac fleet company, they acquire that may be struggling and my gosh, parking the fleet, they make nothing, they already bought those equipment, if they get them out there and they generate just some gross margin, it's a positive for them. But those assets get acquired by a bigger company.They've got - they just spent money to buy those assets, they're playing the long game. So they're just going to be managed, more intelligently, more disciplined then with a longer term time horizon. So absolutely, technology consolidation has led to more disciplined investment, more disciplined commercial arrangement and it's allowed those few bigger companies to invest in the future and try to drive the improvements. I think the whole industry wants to see.Thanks team.Thanks.The next question is from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks. I guess another one on kind of the guidance and pricing commentary. I mean if pricing is boring as you say. It sounds like the decline implied by your fourth quarter, your guidance for the year for fourth quarter is all customer budget exhaustion. It would seem like first quarter EBITDA should be able to get back to third quarter levels. Would you agree with thatYes, obviously we don't guide in detail for the quarter upcoming. But I mean, in general, if you had a flat market, your first quarter does have some weather effect compared to your summer quarter. So yes, if you had a dense flat market, your first quarter will be slightly lower than your summer quarters. But that's where we are. But again, I think next year is going to be slightly better than this year in total.Okay. The other one was on Liberty, power innovation, what is the spending that you're anticipating over maybe in 2024 and beyond  And how should we think about kind of the efforts to supply your own fleet versus perhaps supplying to third-partiesSo we have a third-party - they do some third-party deliveries here. But the bulk of the, probably the first year, a year and a half worth of growth of LPI will be to support this digi rollout and our expansion and our improvements in our natural gas usage across the rest of our fleets. It's an exciting business. And yes, we'll talk more about it in our January call. And we'll talk about spending as we sort of look at that market going forward. But again, the vast majority will be supporting our fleets in the initial point.Okay. Any bookends around the spending just to maybe set some early expectations for peopleWe'll chat about that in January, I think that's the best way to look at that one Marc.Okay. Okay. Thanks, Michael. I'll turn it back.The next question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the digi or electric fleet contracts. Some in the market have talked about those as being sort of multiyear type take-or-pay contracts. As you fold in more of the digiFleets, what have you learned about the contract structure for those, would you agree with the multiyear type of contract and if so, if not, how is the contract structure generally evolvingYes, look, if you're going to build the new fleet, deploy new capital that's different than deploying existing equipment. So yes, those are multiyear agreements.Okay, perfect. And maybe if we could just talk a little bit about the sand market, things have come off of peak levels. But is what you're seeing for sand demand in the Permian roughly commensurate with well completion count, or are you seeing other things, other trends like higher intensity, for example, maybe acting as a buffer on sand demand overallYes, I think overall, certainly, it's relatively well aligned with completion count. That's certainly a good way to think about things. We continue to see movement in amount of sand pumped in a well, we continue to have operators who are experimenting with alternatives to current design. And so that will have some modest implication, but at the high level, you're absolutely right, thinking about it just well count to volume consumed.Okay. Thanks so much.The next question is from Dan Kutz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe to just piggyback on that last line of questioning, but broaden it out a little bit. So outside of frac and also outside of LPI, could you just comment on what some of the other businesses like sand and PropX ST9 wireline just directionally, whether those have been, kind of moving consistent with the frac and LPI earnings or maybe moving a little bit lower and appreciating that the benefits of vertical integration will be an earnings driver for the overall business. But just if you were to isolate those other businesses, anything you could comment on in terms of trends that you've seen thereYes, look you made a key comment, you could isolate - like we never isolate those businesses, because we're in them because they make our core business better. They are actually good businesses in their own right - Michael if he wants to comment any more on that. But yes, we are in those businesses because they make the whole system work more efficiently. We have a Liberty wireline crew and a Liberty frac fleet. We have meaningfully lower downtime than when we have a Liberty frac crew and a third-party wireline.So look, our wireline is - and I think we mentioned in the release, it's now ranked number one by customer services in quality. So that makes that a good business in its own right. But even better, it makes the whole Liberty wireline and frac operate more efficiently, deliver faster results to our customers and better profitability to us.Michael, anything you want to comment on.The business leaders of those teams that focus - are focusing on those businesses and do an incredible job, you know, and I would say, you have a decent amount of competition between all our business leaders. And at the moment, I'd say they all racing across the line, neck-and-neck, right. They're all kind of travelling about the same pace and doing very, very well.Right, that all makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on how debt pay down ranks in the capital priority list. I know, you guys knocked out the term loan earlier this year and then you guys paid off a decent sized chunk in revolver and a third - of the ABL in the third quarter. But just wondering if there's anything that you could share in terms of whether you think that you'll maybe just kind of continue to chip away at the ABL balance or if there's potential for knocking out a big slug, and just kind of how does that back in the capital priority list relative to CapEx and buybacksYes, we have very small net leverage. So we're very, very comfortable with debt levels of where they are at this present point in time. It also really - our ABL level floats with our other uses of capital in that given quarter.Fair enough. Makes sense. Thank you both. I'll turn it back.Thanks.The next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning, Chris and Mike.Good morning.Good morning, Saurabh.Thanks. I guess I'll start with a little bit of more color on the digi side because clearly, there's strong demand over there. You will be at full fleet by the end of the year. Six by the end of January. I'm sure there's more demand. But when you look at the demand that's out there, right. I'm sure you're not trying to meet every demand point, right  You need to keep your CapEx in mind. You need to keep your returns in mind the right contract structure, customers all of that. How do you think about how much potential demand might be out there if you were to not be disciplined just a theory, right. I'm just trying to see the demand sent out there. How would you characterize thatI mean - look at that, the demand is gigantic, right  Think about that - seven years running, we've been the top ranked from customer's frac company in the quality of the services we deliver and now we have the lowest emission, highest efficiency, all natural gas burning fleets with actually longer lifetimes, likely higher uptime higher performance. So yes, look, there's no cap on the interest in that. RightSo the question for us is, it's always a partnership decision. It's not a top, we had 50 a month a lot. Yes, we could put them to work tomorrow, we wouldn't do that. And we never do that. Like they're going to be built individually for specific customers under specific conditions that have been partners and will remain partners for.Right, right. No, that makes sense, because we do hear that there is a lot of demand, right. And again, you don't want to satisfy all demand points. That's not the right way to work. So I get that. Just a quick follow-up. I think Arun asked the question on the RFP season. How is that going  Yes a follow-up question on that. In terms of how you think about contracting the duration of the contract, how quickly pricing resets within that contract  Are you are you thinking about that differently when you think about 2024 versus what you have in your portfolio right now for 2023No, again new-builds they have long-terms and they have different sort of structures a little bit. But no, in general. No, no different this year than last year, and we just continued in that sort of partnership mindset, existing customer base. Not a lot of change in the Liberty customer makeup.Okay, okay. Awesome. And then just one last quick one. Just a clarification. I think Marc asked that question. I think Mike, you said that you expect next year to be slightly better than this year. So 2023 was that an EBITDA comment, I just want to be sure of thatThat will be a general expectation.Okay. Okay. Okay, perfect. Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it back.Thanks, Saurabh.The next question is from John Daniel with Daniel Energy. Please go ahead.Hi guys, thanks for keeping - let me get on the call. I guess the first one is just any supply chain or labor concerns as we head into '24No, the challenge is that we're being a year ago, 18 months ago, don't look to be challenges today.Got it. And then Chris, how does the borings mature market influence your acquisition strategy  Because you should have a lot of free cash flow next yearI mean, yes, our outlook is for a lot of free cash flow and it's just competing usage. So yes - acquisitions are certainly a possibility. You're seeing we're not highly acquisitive. But if something's compelling, sure, sure.Okay. And I guess the last one from me, I'm assuming the initial rollouts of all the digi technology you're going to larger and higher quality customers, if you will. At this point, are any of the smaller E P operators inquiring about the technology  Or when do you see those folks wishing to learn more and possibly moving forwardOh, absolutely. No, they're fired up about it, you know, they're fired up about it. It really just gets down to that long runway right to do a deal for something like that. You've got to have a pretty clear plan of what your next two or three years are going to unfold  And for some of the bigger privates, they've got that. So it's, yes, that's not years away. But yes, the interest is, is quite large there as well. But you're right, the original deployment is not going to be in that sector.Okay, that's all I had. Thank you for including me.Tremendous. Barbecue John.This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Wright for any closing remarks.Thanks, everyone for joining today. Sadly, another global conflict has burst on the scene with heartbreaking scenes of death and destruction. War is as old as time, but that does nothing to lessen the horror of its ravages. War is a destroyer of security, personal security, food security, property security, economic security and our vision for a secure future that we all crave. I often speak of energy as the enabler of all human progress.It is, but it is also essential to satisfy our base needs, like security in all forms. Now that the spotlight is again on the United States, the most promising source of security for the world, how are we doing  We properly sprung to action on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts. But what about the energy front  It's underpinned everything. I would pause it, that we are not shining in this area, the area critical to our long-term future.Two quarters ago, I spoke about government policies that are raising up our electricity prices, whilst also destabilizing our electricity grids. Hence, we are not doing well in the power grid area. While electricity grids are arguably the most important networks in the world, in total they deliver only 20  of global energy. What about the total energy pie  Oil and gas today represent a record high of just below 70  of total U.S. primary energy consumption.Fortunately, we are today the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. Are we maximizing these resources to uplift Americans and provide security to our citizens and our allies. We have blocked the completion of large pipelines already under construction. We have dramatically reduced the granting of leases and permits on federal lands. We drained half our strategic petroleum reserves, not in a crisis but simply to short-term lower gasoline prices.We have used a myriad of regulatory bodies to impede the funding and development of our oil and gas resources, having the obvious and presumably intended impact of reducing U.S. oil and gas production at the margin, and therefore raising prices to consumers and businesses. But there is no stopping the rise and demand for oil and natural gas as everyone, not just Americans wants to raise their standard of living and expand the opportunities available to their children.So what is filling the gap created by suppressing American oil and gas production  Iran, predominantly, we have effectively stopped enforcing the oil export sanctions on Iran, resulting in a roughly 700,000 barrels of oil per day increase in Iranian oil exports over the last 12 months, nearly all flowing to China. The same is coming true for Venezuela. Is having more oil coming from Iran as opposed to the United States beneficial to the security of the United States and our allies  Is it economically better for our citizens and allies that this incremental oil production and related economic activity and tax revenues flow to Iran instead of the United States  Is it better for air quality and greenhouse gas emissions that these incremental barrels are producing Iran versus the world's cleanest production practices in the United States  The answer to all is obvious.Liberty's mission is to better human lives by improving the energy system in North America and the world. We do this primarily by driving improvement and innovation in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells, the dominant source of energy in the U.S. and Canada. We took an ownership stake in Fervo Energy last year to partner in bringing next generation geothermal into our energy system.Things are going quite well there. We took a smaller stake in nature on energy to help bring sodium ion-batteries to market, as they offer distinct advantages to our energy system. After years of watching and investigating we have recently invested  10 million in Oklo, which we view as the most promising of the small modular reactor companies.Why invest in Nuclear  Because it has the energy density, reliability and scalability required to economically meet the world's growing demands for energy. The world needs more energy, better energy. Thanks for joining us today.The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

"Energy Transfer: Some Compelling Narratives, But Not A Compelling Buy","The stock of Energy Transfer LP , an operator of a vast and diversified pool of energy assets, has a number of sub-plots working for and against it. In this article, we ll highlight two important sub-plots, and then closeEnergy Transfer s EBITDA comes from 8 different sources, but the segment we re most enthused by is the segment that focuses on the transportation of NGL  Natural Gas Liquids  and Refined Products. Last year, it was the second largest contributor to annual group EBITDA, but this year  as of H1  it has become the top contributor, accounting for of ET s total EBITDA.In H1, this segment saw impressive EBITDA YoY growth ofSecondly, the surge in the export of ethane propane, and other NGLs from America should not be underestimated. Domestic propane inventories may be at record highs, but what s key to note is that close to of this gets exported. This year we ve seen a few producers resort to production cuts, and that too has limited the supply of propane inventories in the international market  besides being a byproduct of natural gas production, propane is also sourced during crude oil refining . As a result, US propane exports have gone through the roof  see image  and could stay elevated all through this year.The trend of ethane exports is another shining light and should reflect well on this division s numbers. Note that in H1, ethane exports out of the country averaged barrels a day, translating to solid growth of 22 , but as recently as September, ethane exports were hitting levels of over barrels a day. We don t believe this is just short-term euphoria either  the EIA believes the country could continue to export at this 500k rate through the end of FY24.Readers would also be interested to know that ET management recently stated that they are in discussions to lock in close to of the aggregate ethane volumes that will come into the system over the next 3-4 years.It's also rather well known that ET is relatively well insulated from the capricious nature of commodity prices, as its contracts are predominantly long-term and fee-based, but what s also key is the dominance of take-or-pay transportation contracts, particularly in this segment. Currently, ET is benefitting from some very strong volumes, but even if volumes were to slow for some reason  which is not the base case , these contracts demand that payments be made to ET regardless of whether a fixed volume is transported.To flourish and build scale in this business, management needs to exercise good judgment with capital and leverage, and even though the jury is still out, it's fair to say that things are better than where they were a few years back.At the start of last year, Energy Transfer had intended to only deploy  1.575bn- 1.8bn by way of growth CAPEX, but primarily on account of the Lotus Midstream acquisition this year, further investments will also be made there, pushing up the overall figure. All in all, growth CAPEX for the year will likely come in within a higher range of , and the long-term plan is for the company to push the CAPEX runrate closer to  3bn p.a.We understand that this likely ramp-up in CAPEX won't please all stakeholders of ET, but we feel investors should be less skeptical in questioning the capital allocation and financing decisions of the management, particularly in light of some of the improvements engendered in recent years.Firstly, we bring to attention the manner in which ET has been financing its growing asset base in recent years. A couple of years back, around 53  of the asset base was being financed by debt  however, this has consistently crept down since then and currently stands at around 45 .It also helps that ET's assets are now generating some useful FCF  which in turn puts less pressure on the need for external funds , something it was barely managing to do during the pre-pandemic era.Admittedly ET still has a hefty sum of  of total debt on its balance sheet, and some of you may be wondering how best placed the company looks in a higher interest rate environment, but do note that as of H1-23, only 10  of its total debt consisted of floating rate debt.Note that as a function of EBITDA, ET s target debt level range is , and hitting the lower end of that range, is something they intend to do very soon. If that happens, investors have another added reason to feel more encouraged as you could see the company recommence its unit buyback activities, something which has gone dormant since. For context note that the company still has around  880m of funds that could be authorized towards this endeavor.Even though we can find plenty of reasons to appreciate the well-rounded business of Energy Transfer, we are not necessarily convinced that this is the right time to kickstart a long position in the stock per se. Here s why.Let s first look at ET s long-term price imprints on the monthly chart. Since dropping to the pandemic lows of sub  4, the stock has done well to make up lost ground by trending up in the shape of a rising wedge pattern. However, the issue with a rising wedge pattern is that it typically signs the increasing possibility of a after an uptrend.Now, an inverted V-shaped reversal in the price action may not necessarily come to fruition, but we do think the possibility of sideways movement has increased, rather than another strong move higher.We say this because firstly, the share has not resorted to any major pullbacks since the start of 2022, rather there s just been a pause for a brief while followed by another upward leg. Secondly, also consider that the stock has now revisited the old congestion zone which coalesced from Q2-2016 until Q3-2019. During this period ET had just chopped around within this zone lacking direction  don t be surprised to see the stock take another breather here.Then, prima facie, relative to most other alternatives a  9  yield is something to behold, but this should also be contextualized relative to what unitholders have typically received. Even though the recent distribution growth came in at an impressive rate of YoY, the uptrend in the stock has been such, that the current distribution yield falls short of the 4-year average by around.You also want to be getting into a stock when forward valuations are well below the long-term average, but with ET that is quite the opposite. Currently, the stock is priced at a forward EV EBITDA of 7.4x, close to the peak of its 5-year valuation range, and 8  pricier than its 5-year average.We wouldn t be averse to paying this premium if the degree of EBITDA growth over the next few years was strong enough, but data from YCharts show that EBITDA CAGR through FY25 will come in at an unremarkable pace of a little over 2 .Gauging insider sentiment towards a stock across different periods can also sometimes provide slight insight into what management thinks about the share s current valuation. Well, in that regard, what we can see is that aggregate discretionary purchasing in Sep had come off in a big way from levels seen in August, and in the current month, there have been no purchases whatsoever.The other thing to note is that even though ET primarily appeals to the retail cohort, there s also ample participation from the institutional segment  40 , the guys with deep pockets, who often drive big moves in the stock.If one looks at the size of the candles all through this year, one won't find too many large-bodied candles, implying the lack of institutional participation, and that's further reiterated by the data which shows that they haven't really participated in the rally this year, and have not shown any inclination to add to their positions all through this year. In fact, on a YTD basis, the net shares owned by institutions are down by over 15 . Granted, these guys don't always get things right, but yet still, when the institutional positioning is moving one way and the price is moving another way, one should perhaps pause and think twice.Finally, also consider that ET is unlikely to benefit from any rotational interest in the energy infrastructure MLP space. Note that the relative strength ratio of ET as a function of AMLP is currently trading well above the mid-point of its 7-year range, and is also not too far from hitting levels from where the ratio has previously pivoted.

Devon Energy: Ignored Oil Play,"The potential      should make   even more appealing. The independent energy company trades at yearlyDevon Energy was oddly left out of the recent rally in oil. The stock now trades at multi-year lows, even despite the big potential merger in the energy space and oil prices that spiked to  90 bbl.Exxon Mobil is potentially bidding for Pioneer Natural Resources in a move to boost oil production from the Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil actually hit an all-time high right prior to news ofWhile the details of a potential  60 billion merger are unknown and might not even happen, the interesting aspect is the valuation disconnect between Devon and Pioneer here. Devon trades at only 6.6x forward EPS estimates while Pioneer trades at 9.9x EPS targets and Exxon Mobil is rumored as willing to pay another 10  premium for Pioneer on top of the rally on Friday.Even Exxon Mobil now trades at 12.0x forward EPS targets. The stock market is oddly favoring the energy giant over the independent producers, hence one reason the company is probably targeting Pioneer. The deal could be very accretive with the use of cash, though shareholders are unlikely to want Exxon Mobil to pile on a bunch of debt again.Devon Energy continues to boost oil production with guidance for Q3 production reaching 322K b d to 330K b d, up from 323K b d back in Q2. Oil production growth reached 8  YoY and total production hit 662K boe d.The odd part here is that Pioneer Resources only produced 369K b d of oil during Q2 with total production at 710K boe d. The independent energy company had oil production at 52  of total production, slightly above the 49  oil production levels at Devon.One has to really question the valuation discrepancy between Pioneer with a potential offer for  60 billion and Devon Energy trading with a current market cap of only  28 billion. The issue really isn't the valuation for Pioneer at  60 billion with forecasts for annual free cash flow topping  5 billion annually with WTI prices at  80 bbl.Devon now offers investors a massive dividend opportunity. The energy company pays a fixed  0.20 quarterly dividend amounting to a 1.8  dividend yield while the variable amount hit  0.29 during Q2 and the higher oil prices are likely to help boost this amount.Based on a consistent  0.49 quarterly dividend, Devon would pay a  1.96 annual dividend offering a 4.5  dividend yield. On top of these dividend payouts, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares for  200 million during Q2 and the current stock weakness along with oil prices rallying to  90 provides an ideal opportunity to buy very cheap shares.The key investor takeaway is that Devon Energy just appears an ignored energy stock despite strong profits and capital returns. Exxon Mobil might be chasing Pioneer due to Permian Basis resources and a CEO looking to retire making a deal more possible, but Devon Energy is the much cheaper play here.Investors in Pioneer Natural Resources should use any offer from Exxon Mobil to flip the investment into Devon Energy. One can sell Pioneer at all-time highs and flip that investment into Devon at multi-year lows.Stone Fox Capital  aka Mark Holder  is a CPA with degrees in Accounting and Finance.

Enterprise Products Partners: Growing From Industry Improvements And Secular Trends,"Enterprise Products Partners L.P.  has for a long time been praised as a company that can deliver a strong and stable dividend yield to investors, even through downturns in the economy. The yield is The company is trading more or less exactly in line with the rest of the sector at a p e of 10.6 but at a discount of 26  based on sales. I think the business of EPD is a phenomenon and think further increases to the dividend are likely to occur. WithEPD offers midstream energy solutions to both natural gas and natural gas liquids  NGLs  producers and consumers, as well as those in the crude oil, petrochemical, and refined products sectors. The company's operations are divided into four key segments  NGL Pipelines   Services, Crude Oil Pipelines   Services, Natural Gas Pipelines   Services, and Petrochemical   Refined Products Services. This diversified portfolio allows EPD to play a vital role in facilitating the transportation and distribution of energy resources across various industries.A key point as to why EPD is so appealing to investors is the strong amount of FCF the company is right now. The company has a payout ratio of 86  for the adjusted FCF right now. The earnings are driven by positively growing commodity prices, which has been the case for quite some time now, and even with the volatility of the last couple of quarters, I would say that EPD has shown itself very much able to grow the dividend through tough times. Oil prices reached highs of  118 last year in June but have since returned to around  87 instead. In the last few months though the price has been trending upward and I think the third quarter of 2023 by EPD will showcase a very strong improvement in the earnings.The healthy improvements in the market seem to also be a leading cause for EPD and its ability to invest heavily in the space. Renewables and green energy may be on the rise in popularity and usage, but natural gas and oil remain to be very large sources of energy for our societies.Looking further at the profitability of the business I think the ROTC is a point that can be improved upon further, and that will come with growing commodity prices and further investments into the business. The ROTC for EPD is at 7  right now, below the sector's median of 10 . This is potentially a point that could lead to the share price going lower if EPD is not able to raise it to the sector standard in the next several quarters. It could weigh on the share price and cause lackluster returns.The last from EPD showed it was very much able to withstand some of the price volatility in the market over the last few quarters. The net income showed just a slight decline even though the quarter included far lower commodity prices.The co-CEO of EPD A.J. Teague said the following about the quarter and the performance of the business,  During the quarter, we established several operational records, including natural gas pipeline volumes, NGL fractionation volumes, and 11.9 million equivalent barrels per day of total pipeline volumes. We completed construction and began operations on  2.5 billion of organic growth projects that will begin generating new sources of cash flow for the partnership .Seeing the company able to offset softer commodity prices with higher volumes is very positive in my opinion and a continuation of that I think is likely. As mentioned above, EPD is investing heavily in the sector with  4.1 billion in the pipeline currently. That sort of optimism I think goes to show the potential the market still has and the strong potential of growing distributable free cash flows for investors.Unitholders of EPD face a prominent risk that stems from the company's growth being closely tied to broader macroeconomic trends in the United States. As EPD expands its operations, its volumes become increasingly influenced by the overall economic climate. Nevertheless, EPD has strategically leveraged its scale and integration capabilities to not only navigate this risk but also to achieve commendable margins and a robust return on capital.EPD is involved in various smaller sub-segments, including propylene and octane enhancement. These sub-segments present challenges in predicting sales margins and volumes, primarily due to limited data availability for most investors. Consequently, these areas of EPD's business may introduce additional uncertainties for investors seeking to assess the company's performance in these specific markets. It doesn't seem to have construed the broader results for EPD though as the net margins are near the company's 5-year average of 12.18  and the FCF margin higher than the 5-year average at 5.08  using the TTM numbers. Fluctuations for commodity prices like oil and gas are to be predicted but it doesn't affect the buy case right now in my opinion. EPD has been able to showcase that it can deliver a high dividend yield through tough times in the market and consistently increase it too.I think that EPD right now is a fantastic dividend opportunity that is yielding a high amount, which is supported by a strong asset base and market position. Despite the softer commodity prices for both crude oil and natural gas, EPD remains capable of growing the dividend efficiently, as it has done in the last 24 years.The valuation is in line with the sector and I think it's fair to make it a buy right now. The secular demand the company is experiencing as energy consumption is growing and prices improving is making for a very good investment case right now. Rating EPD a buy now.

Enphase Energy: Sell On Disastrous Near-Term Outlook," After the close of Thursday's session, leading microinverter supplier Enphase Energy Inc. or  Enphase  Non-GAAP gross margin included a 260 basis point Inflation Reduction Act  IRA  benefit as the company continues to ramp up domestic production in the United States.Enphase generated  122 million in free cash flow for the quarter but this was largely offset by the unfortunate decision to spend  110 million on common stock repurchases at an average price of approximately  130 per share.The company finished the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of  1.78 billion and  1.31 billion in convertible debtAs by me after competitor SolarEdge's   last week, Enphase's fourth quarter guidance missed consensus expectations by a milePlease note that the company's non-GAAP gross margin guidance for Q4 is net of an anticipated 800 basis point IRA benefit.At the low end of the provided ranges, income from operations would turn negative.In the company's  on form 10-Q, management blamed the shortfall on a number of factors  emphasis added by authorOn the , management warned of additional weakness in Q1 2024 with an expectation for channel inventory to normalize in the second quarter of next year, assuming no near-term improvements in demand.But even in case the inventory issue being addressed by Q2, revenues would only recover to a range of  450 million to  500 million according to statements made by CEO Badri Kothandaraman during the questions-and-answers session of the call.While management remained optimistic on demand trends in both Europe and California for the second half of next year, a number of analysts on the call appeared concerned about channel inventory not returning to historical patterns anytime soon.Quite frankly, I can't blame them following the company's second, massive guidance reduction within three months.Even when assuming demand to increase in the second half of next year, I would expect Enphase's 2024 revenues to be down substantially on a year-over-year basis with earnings per share in a range of  2.00 to  3.00 which would be a far cry from the current analyst consensusAs a result, shares continue to look expensive even when considering the after hours sell-off.Consequently, I would expect sell-side analysts to slash estimates and price targets across the board over the next couple of days with a meaningful number moving to the sidelines until visibility improves.Considering the company's abysmal near-term outlook in combination with general market weakness and potential tax loss selling, I wouldn't be surprised to see shares trading closer to  60 going into 2024.Enphase Energy's core microinverter products are facing major demand headwinds in both California and Europe which will likely take a couple of quarters to resolve.However, even assuming the current inventory glut being addressed in due time and demand to improve in the second half of next year, the company's revenues and earnings are likely to miss current consensus expectations by a mile.With analysts being required to rework their models, I would expect a host of near-term price target reductions and downgrades.Given the magnitude of the shortfall projected for the next two quarters and limited visibility into demand trends for the second half of the year, I would advise investors to move to the sidelines for now.Based on my expectations for 2024 revenues and earnings to take a major hit, I am reiterating my  rating on the shares with a near-term price target of  60 which might prove generous should demand not pick up in H2 2024.Given current market conditions, there appear to be little risks for the near-term bear case on the shares.However, any signs of residential solar demand picking back up are likely to result in the shares staging a major recovery rally.

NextEra Energy Partners sinks to nearly seven-year low after cutting growth view,"NextEra Energy Partners   in Monday's trading to extend its losses to 45  following its surprise  and the decision from parent NextEra Energy  not to proceed with an asset dropdown  NEPWells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton downgraded NextEra Partners  to Equal Weight from Overweight and slashes its price target to a Street-low  33 from  80, noting NextEra's  decision to not proceed with the asset dropdown and NEP's reduced growth goal  created a crisis in confidence in NEP that will be difficult to restore.With a structure that pays out nearly 100  of cash available for distribution,  the success of NEP is tied to the ability to raise equity and debt capital on favorable terms - as such, investor confidence really matters,  Kalton wrote.Despite NextEra Energy's  various attempts to prop up the partnership,  the prolonged slump in NEP's units - driven by high rates and CEPF buyout concerns - resulted in an unattractive cost of capital relative to NEE's other financing options. Still, management could have elected to drop assets down to NEP at a low multiple in order give the structure additional breathing room  but  decided against this, prioritizing NEE over NEP.Despite a still strong secular backdrop for renewables and a high quality sponsor in NextEra Energy , Kalton said NEP's  existing cost of capital  raises questions about the partnership's ability to execute.",59,2023-10-02T12:23:32.000-04:00
Exxon sees world missing climate targets even as energy-related emissions fall,"Oil and natural gas will continue to meet more than half of the world's energy needs in 2050, while the world fails to keep global temperature increases below two degrees Celsius, Exxon Mobil  said Monday in its Energy-related CO2 emissions will drop 26  from a peak expected this decade to 25B metric tons by 2050, Exxon  said, but that's still more than twice the 11B tons the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says would be needed for its two-degree scenario that would limit the impacts of climate change.The company's report projects energy-related CO2 emissions will peak at more than 34B metric tons sometime during this decade and then decline to 25B metric tons in 2050.An energy transition is underway, but it is not yet happening at the scale or on the timetable required to achieve society's net-zero ambitions,  Exxon  said in its report.At the same time,  fossil fuels remain the most effective way to produce the massive amounts of energy needed to create and support the manufacturing, commercial transportation, and industrial sectors that drive modern economies,  the report said.",327,2023-08-28T13:05:24.000-04:00
Why Dominion Energy Is Seriously Undervalued Right Now,"Investing doesn't always have to be a popularity contest, and going against the grain, or otherwise called contrarian investing, can potentially lead to outsized returns. Such may be the case right now with utility companies, which appear to have bottomed as of late.This brings me to Dominion Energy  which I last visited  back in June with a 'Buy' rating, noting its relative undervaluation and progress towards renewable energy. The stock has traded down by 19  since then, as higher interest rates have pressured D and the utility segment in general.As shown below, D now trades at a 10  year low not seen since 2010. In this piece, I discuss why the market may be overly bearish on the stock and why value investors may want to look into the stock for income and capital appreciation potential, so let's dive inDominion Energy is a large public utility that serves 7 million customers 16 U.S. states. Like other utilities across the country, D has made commitments to pivot its business towards renewable energy and it has a goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.To achieve this goal, D has had to sell off some assets, such as its natural gas pipelines in 2020 to Berkshire Hathaway Energy , and its remaining interest in Cove Point facility also to Berkshire Hathaway in July of this year for  3.5 billion. Its biggest sale was the one recently announced last month for the sale of three natural gas utilities to Canadian midstream giant, Enbridge  for after tax proceeds of  8.7 billion.This gives D the funding capacity it needs to pursue renewable energy projects, such as its proposal announced earlier this month to build more than a dozen  in Virginia, which if approved would generate 772 MW of carbon-free electricity. This is estimated to power around 200K homes at peak output. This would add to D's existing portfolio of solar projects, bringing the combined total to 4,600 MW of solar in Virginia, which is enough to power 1.1 million homes.Renewable energy obviously comes with upfront costs but can save the utility company money down the line due to far lower input costs compared to traditional fossil fuels. However, there are execution risks related to the renewable transition, and asset dispositions such as the ones above are near-term dilutive to earnings.Markets dislike uncertainty, and this is reflected by D's significant underperformance compared to the SPDR Select Utilities ETF . As shown below, D has returned -48  over the past 12 months compared to the 7  decline in XLU over the same timeframe.In the meantime, milder than normal weather, along with planned and unplanned outages at D's Millstone facility resulted in an earnings decline in the latest quarter. Additional headwinds include higher interest expense and the near-term dilutive impact the loss of Cove Point and natural gas utilities  through the aforementioned sales  result in a lower forward earnings outlook.While the headwinds and execution risks for the company are real, its business is nonetheless supported by regulated utilities that generate a steady income stream. Plus, management sees opportunities for rate growth down the line, as its residential rates are  below the national average. Dominion's aforementioned solar and battery storage projects would add value over time, and it also has 6 projects producing negative-carbon renewable natural gas, including its joint venture with Smithfield Foods, which captures methane from hog farms.Moreover, data center growth in D's key markets should fuel electric demand and it's seeing attractive customer growth in Virginia and South Carolina. As shown below, D saw 4  electric sales growth over the last 12 reported months, driven by commercial customer growth.Proceeds from the recent sale of gas utilities also strengthened D's balance sheet, which carried a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.8x. Applying the full proceeds from Cove Point and the natural gas utilities would bring the leverage ratio down to a much lower 4.3x.Lastly, D is trading at an attractive entry point at the current price of  42.96 with forward PE of 12.7, trading below its normal PE of 17.2, as shown below.Its 6.2  dividend yield is also covered by a 79  payout ratio, based on its reset forward EPS of  3.36. This payout ratio is positioned to decline with analysts expecting  annual EPS growth over the next 4 years.Based on my fair value analysis below, I believe D has a fair value of  64.81 per share, based on the current year EPS estimate, and a modest 5  growth rate combined with a 2.5  discount rate, sitting above the 2  long-term inflation target set by the Federal Reserve. While I wouldn't expect for the market to reward D with this fair value anytime soon, I believe it's a reasonable target for those with a long-term horizon.Dominion Energy's recent underperformance has created an attractive entry point for investors looking for income and value. While there are headwinds in the near-term, management's execution of its renewable energy transition along with a stronger balance sheet supports long-term income and capital appreciation potential. With D trading at a material discount to my fair value estimate and a strong dividend yield, it could be a long-term winner for patient value-seeking investors.Gen Alpha has teamed up with  to launch the premier income-focused investing service on Seeking Alpha.

Valero Energy: Another Solid Quarter,"San Antonio-based   released its third-quarter 2023 results on October 26, 2023. This article  my article published on August 26, 2023. I have followed VLO on Seeking Alpha since DecemberAmong the three refiners I track on a quarterly basis are Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum , and Phillips 66 . The first company to release its 3Q23 results is Valero Energy.The U.S. refiner reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of  a significant decrease from  11.36 per share in the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the results beat analysts' expectations again.Total revenues decreased from  51,641 million last year's quarter to , over the consensus estimate.VLO increased its refinery throughput volumes slightly this quarter to The Chief Executive Officer, Lane Riggs, said in the While the ethanol margin increased to  from  0.57 last year, the refining margin per throughput barrel fell to  from  21.34 this year.I have been a long-term shareholder in Valero Energy Corporation for more than 20 years, as I have stated in previous articles, and I plan to maintain a sizable portion of my long position. With a  dividend yield, VLO offers a safe and comparatively high yield, which explains the long-term investment decision.Nonetheless, I have frequently traded LIFO, or between  of my long position, in order to profit from the volatility associated with the refining sector. Just glancing at the chart will convince you that you must trade some of your position.The main issue at hand is the extreme volatility of the refining industry, which calls for a particular approach to trading and investing.I am well above my comfort zone when it comes to my assessment of VLO's valuation. Though I'm sure many investors will tell me that VLO still has a lot of room to grow, I'm not convinced despite what Valero Energy considers a solid business outlook.Lane Riggs said in the conference callThe demand outlook, which will rely on the severity of any global economic slowdown and the rate of its recovery over the coming years, remains, as usual, the largest source of uncertainty for refiners.The United States' consumption of gasoline and distillate has returned to its five-year average following over a year of low demand brought on by the COVID pandemic, which also forced the closure of refining facilities.In addition, for the fourth quarter, Valero Energy intends to run its fourteen oil refineries in North America and the UK at a maximum of  of their combined daily throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels.VLO is now down  on a one-year basis, underperforming Phillips 66 and Marathon significantly.  Estimated by Fun Trading.Valero Energy's revenue for the third quarter was  The company reported a  increase in quarterly income to  per diluted share from  7.19 in the previous year. The results were better than analysts had predicted.For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  per share.The total cost of sales fell to  from  40.431 billion last year. Net cash from operating activities was  in the third quarter of 2023, versus  2.045 billion last year. The cash from operating activities less capital expenditures is the generic free cash flow.VLO had  in trailing 12-month TTM free cash flow. The second quarter's free cash flow, which is  is much higher than the prior quarter.The quarterly dividend remained unchanged at .Also,  worth of VLO shares were purchased, or approximately  of common stock, in 2Q23. In the press release, the company saidValero Energy had total cash of  in 3Q23, up from  3,969 million last year. Total debt was significantly down to   including total lease obligations , compared to  11,592 million last year.The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was  as of September 30, 2023.During the third quarter, refining throughput volumes increased to  barrels per day from 3,005K barrels per day in the previous year.The most important component is sweet crude oil, as the graph below illustrates.In 3Q23, the U.S. Gulf Coast supplied about  of the total throughput volume.The dividend has been taken into account in the chart.VLO forms a descending wedge pattern, with resistance at  and support at  RSI shows  suggesting that a collapse might occur in 4Q23. If it does, though, it might run counter to the bullish pattern.I frequently advise holding onto a key position for the long run and using about  to trade LIFO while waiting for a higher final price target for your core position that you may keep as a well-secured dividend provider.Thus, the trading strategy is to sell about  between  with possible higher resistance at  and wait for a retracement between  with possible lower support at Valero Energy Corporation's stock is highly sensitive to the United States' demand for oil, and the rest of 2023 is probably going to see some extreme fluctuations. It will therefore be very advantageous to trade half of your position using TA charts and patterns. The T.A. chart must be updated frequently to be relevant. It is what I am doing in my stock tracker. The chart above has a possible validity of about a week. Remember, the T.A. chart is a tool only to help you adopt the right strategy.

XLE: Escalating Middle East Tensions Strengthen Energy's Bullish Thesis,"The energy sector saw a remarkable revival over the past three months, which saw the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  surge toward its September 2023 highs before pulling back.I have turned  onI assessed that Investors who took profit at XLE's September 2023 highs were right to ascertain demand risks as underlying crude oil prices hurtled toward the  100 zone. Recent data suggests consumers have pulled back on gasoline consumption, coinciding with theHowever, that story lined up the energy sector's thesis as of the end of last Friday's  October 6  trading. By now, energy investors should be keenly aware of the worsening geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the surprise incursion of Israeli border towns by Hamas militants on October 7. It led to a declaration of war by the Israeli government. Furthermore, the  of hundreds of thousands of reservists ignited worries about a large-scale ground offensive into the Gaza Strip that could escalate the tensions further.As such, oil prices   have already reacted positively to these unforeseen developments, with Brent up 2.7  at writing, as market operators attempt to price in the challenges. However, it should be noted that the futures are markedly below the  97 level it achieved in mid-September, suggesting buying sentiments have remained cautious.I assessed that market participants are weighing the demand supply dynamics from the Israeli-Hamas conflict and whether they could intensify. Reports suggest that the bullish sentiments on oil prices could  if Iran's alleged  in Hamas' attack planning comes under increased scrutiny. A military response by Israel or a tightening of sanctions by the US could compel Iran to respond aggressively. As such, it could hobble oil trade flows in the  a vital conduit that Iran has previously threatened to close.Given the relatively tepid response in crude's buying sentiments, I assessed that the oil market's base case remains lukewarm. In other words, the market isn't pricing in a significant escalation in the Middle East that could spiral into a broader regional conflict, leading to an oil crisis.As such, I believe the dip-buying opportunities from XLE's recent pullback over the past three weeks remain valid, as the surge hasn't materialized. However, it's also critical to assess where the key support and resistance zones are to avoid chasing unsustainable momentum if the XLE does spike subsequently.As seen above, XLE firmly held its March 2023 lows at the  75 level through late June before it took off through its September 2023 highs  94 level .Therefore, investors must ascertain investor psychology appropriately to make their move and improve their risk reward. At XLE's March lows, it could have given investors who picked those pessimistic zones  amid the regional banking crisis  a return of more than 25  through its September highs.Compared to XLE's 5Y total return CAGR of 7.5 , I believe it makes sense if these dip buyers astutely took profit three weeks ago, just as late buyers attempted to rush in.With the pullback looking to consolidate at the  85 level, I believe the recent geopolitical tensions should help to mitigate near-term downside risks, as potentially weaker demand dynamics could have been priced in.XLE looks ready to establish a new consolidation zone at the  85 level, reinstating its medium-term bullish bias. However, I must caution that I have yet to ascertain a validated bullish reversal underpinning my thesis at the current levels.Despite that, I assessed that buyers are expected to support XLE at the current levels as they anticipate firmer buying resilience from oil Bulls. While the base case seems to be a localized conflict between Israel and Hamas, a Bear case of a broader regional conflict could heighten the Bull case for oil prices, leading to near-term outperformance.Notwithstanding my optimism, I urge investors to avoid chasing XLE's highs at the  95 level, as I assessed it to be a stiff resistance zone that has attracted astute profit-taking since November 2022.Have constructive commentary to improve our thesis  Spotted a critical gap in our view  Saw something important that we didn t  Agree or disagree  Comment below with the aim of helping everyone in the community to learn betterJR Research is a seasoned investor with a background in economics.

Bet On Dirty Energy: Whitehaven Coal,"Coal stocks are lagging behind their uranium and fossil fuel counterparts. However, the picture is not that bad. Despite the low coal prices, the coal miners managed to maintain their standing, as seen in the image belowXAL1  coal prices  had declined 65.9  YTD. However, coal miners performed adequately, given the coal prices. Thungela TGA , Whitehaven , and Peabody  declined by 14 to 30 . I added Teck is not coal pure play, though it is one of the largest metallurgical coal producers moved sideways.Whitehaven is among the top players in that game.  its plans to acquire Daunia and Blackwater metallurgical mines from BMA . Both mines will expand the company s reserve base and push its assets LOM further, as seen in the chart below. Whitehaven will transform into one ofThe focus today is on Whitehaven Coal. It is an Australian coal mining company. The image below from  shows the location of the company s mines.The company has five operating minesThe company's assets include several developing mines  the Vickery, near Gunnedah, and Winchester South, in Queensland's Bowen Basin. The Vickery Extension Project is an underground mine planned to be constructed approximately 25km north of Gunnedah. Whitehaven's future projects are shown in the graphic belowIn the long term, Whitehaven has sufficient reserves to expand its production. Its mines have a LOM of over ten years and produce 18.2 million tonnes annually. Plans for next year are for output to reach 18.7-20 million tonnes.Whitehaven is among the highest-quality coal producers measured by Net As Received  NAR . This parameter accounts for the calories of energy contained in one kilogram of coal. The following graph shows that Australia produces some of the highest calorific value coal, and Whitehaven outperforms the national average.The coal caloric values are crucial for power plants and production facilities. The chart below compares various coal miners and leading coal mining countries.Whitehaven extracts the most energy-efficient coal. As the graph states, the required feed rate for all reference coals to deliver the same power output is higher than that of Whitehaven coal.Another crucial metric is the CO2 emissions for various coal types. The chart below compares the most popular thermal coals and their tCO2 MWh.Whitehaven coal is used in high-efficiency low-emission  HELE  plants. The power plants using such coal reduced their emissions by 27 .The main customers are Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.The main markets in which Whitehaven operates are the Far East, excluding China. Over 60  of sales are made in Japan and 15  in Taiwan. The remaining is split between South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore. The chart below shows the geographical distribution of revenue. Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia are net importers of energy commodities and depend on regular and cheap coal imports from Australia. This makes switching suppliers an uphill task because the cost of delivery will rise due to transportation costs due to the greater distances involved. The latter also means longer delivery times.The importance of Whitehaven coal for its customers could be illustrated with the following chartIn the long term, coal demand in Asia is expected to grow significantly despite the revival of nuclear energy. The chart below shows the growth of the market by country.The primary driver is India. As a significant buyer of Whitehaven s coal, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan will reduce coal consumption at the end of the next decade. A notable observation is the expected growth of HCC  high cocking or metallurgical  coal used in steel production to fuel the blast furnaces. PCI or pulverized coal could be used for metallurgical purposes such as thermal coal in power generation.In the long term, steel production will grow globally. The primary fuel will remain metallurgical coal till it is not discovered and implemented successfully inefficient and cheap enough blast furnaces running on renewables.On 18 October, Whitehaven  its plans to acquire Daunia and Blackwater metallurgical mines from BMA. The latter is a joint venture between Mitsubishi and BHP. Both mines will expand the company s reserve base and push its assets LOM further, as seen in the chart below.New mines are in Queensland, Bowen Basin. Their resources will increase the company's resource base by 75 . The recoverable reserves will grow by 29 . The acquisition will change the company's revenue structure. Thermal coal represents 83  of average ten-year sales. After the acquisition, metallurgical coal sales will dominate with 63 , as shown in the graph below.I think the shift from thermal to metallurgical coal is positive in the long run. Renewable energy sources will not replace coal in the foreseeable future. However, in the next 15 years, nuclear power plants will gradually substitute coal plants. I expect the demand for thermal coal to peak at the end of the decade due to the transition to nuclear energy in China and India. Nevertheless, this is not the end of coal.Coal is not required only for power generation. It is an integral part of steel manufacturing. Regardless of our energy sources, the world needs an astounding amount of steel yearly. Iron and metallurgical coals are the two primary inputs in the steel factory. In conclusion, Whitehaven has locked its position as the primary metallurgical coal player in the Far East for the coming decades.The company will use its funds and acquisition bridge to fund the acquisition. The chart below gives some details on that.The total cost of the deal is  3.2 billion. The company has  1.85 billion in cash reserves and a total debt of  125 million. The plan is to use  1.476 of own funds and borrow the rest. The transaction is expected to be completed in June 2024.Coal companies are a hidden gem. They offer robust balance sheets with formidable efficiency. They have excellent liquidity and solvency and, at the same time, realize double-digit ROI and ROE.The table compares Whitehaven with its major competitors.Whitehaven excels on all metrics I consider. The company is flushed with cash  1.85 billion  and has a mere  125 million debt. The company also has the lowest long-term debt vs free cash flow.Whitehaven has successfully reduced its debt levels for the last three years, as shown in the table below.It is worth mentioning even in 2019, the company's leverage was at 11.5 , measured by the Total Debt Equity  TD E  ratio. In 2020, the pandemic has shaken the global economy, and Whitehaven has increased its debt levels to 36.7  TD E to finance the company s operations. Since 2022, the company has repaid a significant portion of its debts.Coal prices are well below their last peak, yet Whitehaven is impressively profitable. Even if the coal price remains steady at its levels, the company's margins are high enough to sustain these results. The chart below compares the same enterprises based on their profitability figures.ROI, EBITDA margin, and FCF margin exceed the rest of the group with significant margins.Even at depressed coal prices, Whitehaven is minting money at a formidable rate. In the next few years, I expect the coal prices to increase due to the reasons affecting all extractive businesses  lack of investments, shortage of engineers, and legal constraints. No commodity is excused from the adverse impact of that triad.The most crucial profitability metric is the free cash flow generated by the enterprise. For capital-intense businesses in the long term, FCF is a function of the company s CAPEX. FCF yield and CAPEX as   of revenue are shown on the chart belowWhitehaven is an undisputable leader in its peer group. It achieved 82  free cash flow yields at 4.2  CAPEX Revenue. These numbers mean the company has abundant firepower to expand its operations, pay dividends buyback shares, and acquire other companies. Proof of that statement is the announced acquisition of Blackwater and Daunia coal mines from BMA.Let's see how the coal miners utilize their capital. The table below uses two metrics to assess a company's capital allocation efficiency  Return on Capital versus Total Debt Total Capital.Whitehaven holds the pole position in the group with 47  ROIC and 3.5  Total Debt Total Capital ratio. The second most profitable company, CONSOL, achieved a 39  Return on Capital at Total Debt Total Capital at 15.8 .Ten-year bond yields briefly touched the 5  level, squeezing the equity risk premium more. Buying a bond, we have guaranteed principal and cash flows. This could not be said for equity investments. When buying stocks, we need compensation for the excess risk we take. Dividends with yields higher than bond yields solve that issue. Coal miners distribute dividends with respectable yields.The following chart compares Whitehaven's dividends against EV EBITDA with several other coal mining companies.Whitehaven and Alliance maintain dividends with impressive yields. The former distributes dividends twice yearly, with yields expected to be 10-12.5 . However, Alliance has a 3.0 EV EBITDA multiple, while Whitehaven is 0.9. We pay less for similar dividend yields by buying a Whitehaven share.Using every metric, the coal mining industry offers excellent value at the current market prices. The chart below compares Whitehaven and a few other coal companies' multiples.Peabody has the lowest EV Sales ratio  Whitehaven comes second with 0.97. Looking at the EV EBITDA, Whitehaven is the leader, with the lowest value at 2.11. The situation with the P E TTM is similar. Being aware of the imperfect EBITDA is a valuable indicator of a company's long-term performance.Now, let's look at the big picture. The chart below compares EV Sales, EV EBITDA, and P E within three sets of dataEV EBITDA ratio in their data sets is in the bottom percentile, meaning the stock is extremely cheap. EV Sales and Price Earnings paint a similar picture.Despite the company's qualities and generous dividends, Whitehaven has been trailing for twelve months. The company is deeply undervalued against its past metrics and regional peers.The fundamental analysis tells why and at what price to buy. The price action tells us when the odds are in our favor. The chart below represents Whitehaven price action on a weekly base.I use the SQN indicator developed by Van Tharp. It indicates four market regimes  bull volatile  blue , bull quiet  green , neutral  yellow , bear quiet red , and bear volatile  dark red . Currently, the price is bull-volatile regime. Last week, the candle closed well above the resistance at  7.0. In my opinion, it is a confirmed breakout above the 30-week moving average. That setup is excellent for entry despite the market being in a bull-volatile regime.Whitehaven is exposed mainly to economic and market risks. Financially, the company is stable, and I do not expect any difficulties in case of long-term declining copper prices.The risk of another  green  driven political decision, a wave of measures against fossil fuels, will profoundly affect their prices. However, that will be a short-term issue. Politicians can stay detached from physical reality for a while  The longer they refuse to admit their mistakes, the higher the price we eventually pay. We have already observed these dynamics in nuclear energy.The markets have been under significant pressure due to the steep bond bear market and glowing issues with the US regional banks.The energy stocks hold their positions well. It's true for all consumable fuels. The uranium had a spectacular bull run last month, and oil and gas stocks are on the move, too. Coal stocks move sideways.Whitehaven is an excellent company positioned in one of the most overlooked niches of the energy sector. Acquiring BMA assets will transform Whitehaven into a metallurgical coal global leader along with Teck Resources. The company has ideal finances and maintains impressive profitability despite low coal prices. Its ROI and ROE are more suitable for biotech growth companies than not for a cost-intensive business such as coal mining. The company offers top value compared to its peers. Measured with EV EBITDA, it is the cheapest among its peers. I expect at least 50  repricing in the short term. On top of that, we receive dividends with exceptional yields while waiting. The weekly chart shows a supportive price action with a confirmed breakout and candles above 30WMA. Whitehaven is an outstanding business in an overlooked niche sold for pennies. The company gets a strong buy rating given its strengths.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel ended the correction, and crude oil was back above the  88 per barrel level on October 19. War in the Middle East caused supply fears for the energy commodity that powers the world.Since 2016, when crude oil prices fell below the  30 per barrel level, Russia has cooperated with the international oil cartel, coordinating production policies and turning OPEC into OPEC . Over the past seven years, production decisions have resulted from negotiations between Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Moscow. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's policies addressing climate change by supporting alternative and renewable fuels and inhibiting U.S. fossil fuel output and consumption handed pricing power to the cartel. Cool relations between Washington and Saudi Arabia and the incendiary relationship between Washington and Moscow have only increased OPEC 's desire to keep oil prices high.Saudi Arabia needs an  80 per barrel oil price to balance its domestic budget. Russia depends on oil revenues to fund its ongoing war in Ukraine. Moreover, Russia uses commodity production as an economic weapon against countries supporting Ukraine.The U.S. used its SPR to reduce oil prices after Russia's invasion, pushing prices over  130 per barrel. When prices fell to the administration's  67- 72 target range, the Department of Energy only purchased four million barrels after selling more than a quarter of a billion since early 2022. With oil prices heading higher and the U.S. SPR at 351.3 million barrels, the U.S. has far fewer barrels to address rising oil prices than it did in March 2022.Aside from crude oil and oil products, natural gas prices have recovered from the April 2023 low.The continuous NYMEX natural gas futures contract illustrates the rise from  1.946 in April 2023 to the most recent  3.471 per MMBtu high. At just under the  3 per MMBtu level on October 19, the bullish trend of higher lows and higher highs remains intact as the peak winter demand season is on the horizon. European natural gas prices rose to all-time highs as the continent depends on Russian pipelines, and supply fears gripped the energy commodity in March 2022. European prices dropped after last year's warmer-than-average winter.Last year's warm winter is no guarantee the 2023 2024 winter will be the same. U.S. natural gas now travels by ocean vessels to regions where prices are higher. The rally in European markets caused U.S. natural gas futures to rise to a fourteen-year high at over  10 per MMBtu in August 2022 before correcting. The upcoming peak demand season in the U.S. and Europe could cause natural gas prices to rally, with plenty of upside room from the current levels to the 2022 highs.Markets tend to reach peaks and bottoms at levels that exceed rational, logical, and reasonable fundamental analysis. The odds of an escalating war in the Middle East are now at the highest level in history. Israel, the U.S., and European allies face Hamas supporters in Iran, a country with partners against Israel in other OPEC countries, Russia, North Korea, and perhaps China.War distorts commodity prices as raw materials are global assets. Trade sanctions, rising insurance costs due to logistical risks, embargos, and other war-related factors could cause crude oil prices to soar. With OPEC  driving oil production policies and pricing, the potential for another spike to over  100 per barrel and even higher is a clear and present danger.The DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Energy Index Excess Return is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on some of the most liquid energy commodities, including WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, RBOB gasoline, Heating oil, and natural gas.DBIQ is a direct investing tool and barometer of traditional oil and gas market prices.The Invesco DB Energy Fund is the ETF product that moves higher and lower with the DBIQ energy index.DBE has been trading since 2007.

NextEra Energy Partners Stock: The 5 Stages Of Grief,"On our last coverage of NextEra Energy Partners LP  we focused on the fact that growth plans were completely out of touch with reality and a downgrade was coming soon.Source  While we would love to take full credit for the bloodbath that followed, we were a bit surprised at the magnitude of the move.A 40  rewrite obviously changes things. We give our latest thoughts below.The announcement did not seem too bad.Source  NEP  emphasis oursGrowth rate was cut in half but honestly, nobody who has been following the renewable space  massive margin compression  or looking at financing conditions, was buying the 12  growth story. So one might have expected a celebration of sorts. After all, the stock already was down by about half from its 2021 peak, before this announcement.So what we think is happening is that the market is not even buying those growth rate assumptions. The reason is that the distribution growth is tied to debt and unit count.Without growing either, distribution growth of any variety will be impossible. After all, NEP is paying most or all of its CAFD back as distributions. Sure, most contracts have inflation escalators so there's some natural growth from that. But it won't be enough to counteract the debt reset. You have  3.4 billion coming due in the next 4 years at a weighted average of about 2.6 .That needs to reset to over 7.5  in today's market. So roughly you would be jumping up 5  on  3.5 billion or about  175 million annually. So what does that mean for the company  The company did  1.03 of CAFD for Q2-2023 which was 8  below Q2-2023. Even this was boosted by lower debt principal payments, lower cash interest payments and lower maintenance capex. If you take away  175 million from higher rates, from that, you can kiss your growth and your current distribution goodbye. Even assuming a baseline run-rate growth from current operations of about 10  total over the next four years, your CAFD per unit falls below the distribution rate projected for Q4-2023. With these LP setups, we have seen the tango and the drama, and they follow a predictable arc. Though, each time it happens, investors act surprised.The first stage is coming to grips with the end of the growth story. This seems like a benign event but marks the limits to what the market will tolerate in a company that sends all distributions back to investors and then keeps tapping the market for equity and debt issuance. This is when the company goes from a regular dividend payer to a  high yield  as the stock falls a lot. We have this happen for NEP already.Woo-hoo double-digit yieldThe second stage is investors piling in just for the income. Hey, no growth is not a problem as long as the distribution can be maintained, right  We can sympathize, but investors tend to forget two important facts. The first is that these companies require capital spending beyond what they classify as maintenance capex to actually maintain the distribution. Most of these assets have a limited life, and maintenance capex alone is not enough to even sustain the distribution in the long run. The second is that their general partner did not throw them out there to throw a steady distribution back. It was designed as a drop-down vehicle and a way to access capital without destroying their own credit ratings. They have zero use for a regular distribution back to them when there's no growth.So that leads to the third stage, which is a distribution cut. It's blamed on capital markets, asset specific problems, specific events and occasionally the Easter Bunny. The company may even say they are cutting to fund growth, which is about the silliest thing they can say, but that's where this ultimately goes. In the case of NEP, well, you have the capital market clause already in play. The numbers don't lie. One point we want to make is that the debt profile shown earlier in the article is from December 31, 2022. By June 30, 2023, this was another  1.2 billion higher.Of course, the cut is not coming tomorrow. In the interim, the yield chasers will be up in arms against us every time the CEO mentions  distribution is important,  or  we have a plan to fund the distribution.  This is a long-term issue and NEP is likely to play out over a very long timeframe as the current payout is not a problem. So have patience with this.The final stage is the roll-up. The cut should take the equity down, and depending on market conditions, these stocks can trade very cheap. We would not be surprised to see 6X distributable cash flow at the trough. Then the sponsor NextEra Energy Inc.  will come in with  Hey would you like to see that distribution grow once more  There will be a premium involved, though it won't make investors whole. Anyone that got in before this guidance cut will struggle to make even positive total returns.There are a ton of examples, but one that immediately comes to mind is the TC Pipelines  formerly TCP ticker  rollup in TC Energy . The growth story was already tottering due to the problems with the Bison Pipeline. Then the FERC decision of 2018  no income tax collection for LPs  threw this down the gutter.TC Pipelines boasted a  prior to going down this rabbit hole. NEP can barely cover its current distributions. So keep that in mind as you try and dismiss the possibility for NEP. TC Pipelines froze the distribution for some time, and if you look back, it was still all going to be ok according to management. Then there was a Finally, the grand overture.Source  The premium was eventually , but still left notable scars. TCP traded as high as  70 at one point before this downdraft started.The fifth stage of grief is acceptance, and that coincidentally is the fifth stage of this roll-up saga as well. The wheels are in motion already, and the capital stresses from trying to fund a massive distribution while refinancing a huge debt load can be seen. Debt to EBITDA will be past 6X pretty soon. But don't expect a cut even in the next 24 months. NEE has given NEP a lifeline till 2026 by suspending the IDR payments and allowing NEP to deleverage a bit by selling pipeline assets.Source  Moody'sBut the idea then was that NEP's share price would rise, and we would be back to the old funding model. Since the price has crashed, NEE has little to gain by continuing the suspension beyond 2026. A lot can happen between now and 2026, but outside a rapid resurgence of ZIRP, we think this will follow the five-stage model. Keep in mind that TC Pipelines cut the distribution in 2018 and were assimilated into . These things take a long time to play out.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Enphase Energy: Avoid Ahead Of Anticipated Weak Results And Outlook,"After the close of Wednesday's regular session, leading solar string inverter manufacturer SolarEdge Technologies Inc.  or  SolarEdge  surprised market participants with an ugly   emphasis added by authorWhile the industry has been pressured by elevated channel inventories in recent months, the sheer magnitude of SolarEdge's warning is eye-catching, particularly when considering the fact that management already  Q3 expectations in early August.Apparently, SolarEdge's warning doesn't bode well for leading microinverter producer and competitor Enphase Energy Inc.  or  Enphase .However, I would assume the company's upcoming third quarter results to be much closer to current consensus estimates for two main reasonsUnfortunately, Enphase's core U.S. residential solar market has also weakened in recent months with market participants increasingly concerned about a more protracted downturn mainly as a result of the ongoing surge in interest rates.With  and  analysts no longer forecasting a near-term trough in inverter demand, current expectations for an almost 10  sequential revenue increase in Q4 will likely have to be revised following the company's Q3 earnings report and conference call next week.Considering the fact that competitor SolarEdge is projecting  for the fourth quarter, I wouldn't be surprised to see Enphase management guiding Q4 revenues below  500 million thus resulting in an approximately 20  shortfall relative to current consensus expectations.In addition, expectations for revenues to grow by almost 10  next year might be too optimistic.Moreover, with SolarEdge projecting a 30  quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross margins, Enphase's margin profile is likely to experience some pressure, too despite some anticipated offset from IRA benefits as the company ramps shipments of U.S.-manufactured microinverters.Assuming consolidated gross margin to drop into the mid-30s next quarter, income from operations would be down by an estimated 85  from Q2 levels.With demand headwinds likely to persist for at least the next couple of quarters, I wouldn't be surprised to see Enphase's 2024 revenues decreasing on a year-over-year basis. In combination with anticipated margin pressure, profitability would be nowhere near current consensus estimates thus making the stock look expensive even after the 50  decline in the shares year-to-date.Looking ahead to Enphase's Q3 earnings release and conference call next week, much will depend on management's Q4 guidance as well as commentary on customer demand, channel inventory and the company's ability to protect gross margins over the course of the current downturn.However, it's difficult to envision Enphase outperforming competitors by a wide margin with residential solar demand under persistent pressure.SolarEdge's dire warning might be a harbinger for Enphase Energy's near-term outlook.With residential solar demand likely to remain sluggish for the time being, I would expect the company's Q4 outlook to miss current consensus estimates by a wide margin.In addition, expectations for close to 10  year-over-year revenue growth in 2024 might prove too optimistic.Consquently, I would expect analysts to reduce estimates and price targets across the board following next week's Q3 earnings report and conference call.Given the increased likelihood of a more protracted downturn, investors should avoid the shares or even consider selling existing positions until industry conditions show tangible signs of improvement.Given muted expectations, any indication of the company maneuvering the challenging industry environment better than competitor SolarEdge or even a potential return to near-term sequential growth would likely be sufficient for shares to stage a major relief rally.

Energy Transfer: An Old Adversary Threatens A Material Future Change,"Energy Transfer  has had a quiet time since the Army Corps was ordered to come up with a new study on the effects of the DAPL pipeline. That has led more than a few investors to think thatMaking matters dicier was the fact that theNow it looks like the process will again get going. One of the main issues in the past included the Energy Transfer operator record in Pennsylvania. Those issues are now settled and a matter of record. How those results weigh into what is about to happen is another matter.Here is the note from Phillips 66 Partners, which is now part of Phillips 66 Source  Phillips 66 Partners .Since Phillips 66 Partnership was the smallest partner in the DAPL partnership and was its own legal entity at the time, there was a good deal more detail on the ongoing dispute in the legal filings of this entity  until it was merged into Phillips 66 . This management stated in several conference calls that they expected the court fight to continue for years.The problem was that everything  died down  until the latest study was complete. There really was nothing legal to be done until the results became public. Now it appears there will be a period of public commenting before the next step. That means that any court filings are likely to happen next year.The key is that as the operator of this partnership, this news is likely to overshadow anything else Energy Transfer does and the uncertainty surrounding this issue is one significant reason that the partnership common units are considered cheap and are likely to stay cheap until this issue is resolved.Those of us who have followed Energy Transfer long term know that the record here is probably on the minimal side from all these issues that are likely to detract from profitability.As the Seeking Alpha website shows, this is one of the least profitable operators in the industry. It is also very large and investment grade. A court case like this, if it goes in a  big time  unfavorable direction, could have a material impact on the future of the company overnight.One of the things about the Quant system is that it is primarily a numbers system. There is really no impact on a system like this for something like the DAPL case that is really a footnote in most official reports. The only real cost at the current time is legal fees, which are likely to be very small compared to the operations of a big company like this.Therefore, the quant system is really unable to forecast the effects of a potential liability like this. Instead, evaluating the liability is a qualitative process. Once the court case is decided and all appeals and other motions have been dealt with, then there will be considerably more certainty to the outlook that something like that quant system can deal with.Still, the system has a  hold  rating on the common units. This does indicate some trepidation in the market that likely relates to the uncertainty of all options listed in the Army Corps of Engineers report  study .One of the things that investors nearly always under-estimate is risk. David Dreman in his latest book  Contrarian Investment Strategy  The Psychological Edge  has noted this. But so have many other authors.The mathematical argument would be something like thisThe reason is that many will go for Case 2 because the returns look good until a loss year happens. Many times, that loss year is far in excess of the 25  shown. But many investors assume that year will not happen because it did not in the past.For me, I have followed many examples like this. The latest of those was my coverage of California Resources  up until the bankruptcy  year 2020. The comments to my articles clearly state that the company had  valuable land  that would get it out of trouble. Alternatively, the company had a lot of reserves behind each share  never mind that no one reviewed the high cost of those reserves or lack of profitability of the company compared to debt levels .So, when California Resources soared before bankruptcy, clearly it was going to go far higher based upon those optimistic assumptions and actually many more. So, there was no reason to sell. That stock did rally again after that  but not as much . That was clearly time to back up the truck.But then came fiscal year 2020 and my mailbox filled with investors that lost a lot of money and were disgusted. That was a total loss. The 100  brought more than a few investors to zero which was far worse than the chart above.I have many more of these in my profile. One 100  loss can hurt a lot when you have  backed up the truck .As against that are those who took that same level of risk and got away with it. Those comments are similar to the comments to my California Resources articles in the years leading up to the bankruptcy. Clearly there was no risk because nothing bad happened in the past. So exactly  what was I worried about  Because clearly, there was nothing to worry about.Probably there is still a lot of sentiment that Energy Transfer as an investment carries no risk because it has because the dispute has had no consequences so far and the last 18 months or so have been quiet  therefore there is no problem anymore .The Army Corps of Engineers clearly states that shutting down the pipeline and removing it is an option. It also clearly states that allowing the pipeline to operating at a higher capacity is also an alternative. But that range of possibilities is too much for income investors that demand a safe level of returns.There are many investors that assert that Energy Transfer is not going to go broke over this, and there certainly could be more years of court battles ahead. However, the company does not have to go under for that distribution to be cut or even eliminated in the future. Removing a pipeline under court order could prove to be expensive before you get to lawsuits claiming all sorts of things related to an unfavorable court outcome. There is a range of outcomes here, from a big negative number to a large positive number.That makes these common units  and probably the preferred as well  suitable for investors that can understand the risk. These investors can also take profits and walk away before trouble hits.This happened in the past for me when Mcdermott  got financially stretched and . I covered this as a speculative opportunity as McDermott had gotten stretched in the past. But the groups I knew got in and doubled their money and then were long gone before the company filed bankruptcy. So, for them, my coverage was an opportunity. It was not anything close to that for the average investor that cannot walk away.Energy Transfer management has long held in official documents that any possible liability cannot be determined, and management has strong defenses. That may or may not turn out to be the case when this is over. But the key for any investor invested in any Energy Transfer security is  do you have a plan that protects you just in case  Because so many investors have told me in the past that they did not and are now feeling the consequences.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Enphase Energy slides 15% as dismal guidance prompts three analyst downgrades,"Enphase Energy   in early trading Friday after reporting lower than expected Q3 revenues and guiding for Q4 revenues that are .The dismal guidance led to at least three analyst downgrades, including at Oppenheimer, which cut Enphase While analyst Colin Rusch said Enphase  is making the correct choice to aggressively manage channel inventories and that pricing and gross margin stability demonstrates the resilience of the platform,  broader market dynamics remain mixed.Even with higher electricity prices as a tailwind, we believe consumer concerns on the economy and prospect for persistently elevated interest rates suggest that a spring recovery in demand is not yet certain,  Rusch wrote.Piper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison is  throwing in the towel  on Enphase , cutting the stock to Neutral from Overweight with a  75 price target, slashed from  150, citing  limited visibility and a full valuation given no near-term growth.After revising forward expectations to capture the company's destocking commentary, Harrison said Piper's EPS forecast declines by  35  in 2024-25,  and while 2025 may represent a return to annual growth, our confidence in the velocity of the recovery is low.Enphase  also was cut to Hold from Buy at HSBC with an  86 PT.",485,2023-09-17T09:20:54.000-04:00

Devon Energy: You Might Think,"There is no justice in the oil patch these days. Good companies, supplying badly needed products to a  thirsty  market are getting pounded out by the financial markets. There really has been no safe haven for holders of shale relatedOn this platform,   has been taken out to the woodshed relentlessly over this period. DVN is one of the cornerstones of our portfolio, and as of today, it's down 30  YoY, and about 40  from its peak in late October of last year. Honestly Now, DVN isn't alone in this slow-rolling freight train of capital annihilation, but it's fared worse than rival Pioneer Natural Resources , down from  252 a year ago, to  215 at the close today-say 12 . Ok, getting back on track here as regards Devon. In another case, EOG Resources  is down 12-13  to  119 from 145 a year ago. So it makes me wonder, what about DVN singles it out for such a pounding by the marketIn this article, we will review some pertinent aspects of this beleaguered energy giant, and see if we can justify our continuing to hold the stock, and perhaps buy more at these distressed levels.You would be wrong, although there is a caveat to that statement we will discuss. As a nominal oil producer, the first thing  is that their wells are running dry and they are running out of good drilling locations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Devon is turning in some great wells with IP-30 rates three and four times the official new well average quoted in the . With a key acquisition of , DVN picked up some of the best rock in the Permian basin, which it has been developing since.In past articles, I've extolled the wonders of the Permian Basin, and in particular the multi-tiered, Upper and Lower Bonespring, and Wolfcamp A, B, C, and D in the Delaware sub-basin that is powering national shale production ever so incrementally higher. Here is a  to my earlier articles on Devon, which you can access for a deeper treatment of the Permian than I will do at this point.Here is  from Clay Gaspar, President of DVN pointing out recent successes on Delaware projectsIn a recent internal article on Occidental Petroleum , we discussed how shrewd operators are extracting Tier I results out of what would nominally be Tier II intervals-Wolfcamp B as an example. What Gaspar is describing with the Wolfcamp B is just that-Tier I performance. Deeper, with higher pressures, perhaps lower Total Organic Carbon-TOC's, and tending to be gassier than the upper  A  zone, without the elixir of technology, these new ,  might not exist. Gaspar goes on-If a company drills four hundred wells a year, a 9  increase in efficiency delivers 40 additional wells. For free. Ok DVN is making great wells. Let's move on.Certainly not. Across all of their shale portfolio, production is up 7  YoY. The Delaware decline YoY is probably explained by increasing gas production from the Wolfcamp B. That was the caveat, by the way, and a likely source for some of the pain the market has inflicted on the company. For those who are new to my work, here's a point I haven't covered in a while. Thermally, the  begins to convert to gas and gas liquids as wells become deeper and as a consequence-hotter. Deep and hot gets you dry gas.So, declining production is not the answer. One final point in regard to the Eagle Ford, the Validus acquisition is paying dividends in raising the oil content of DVN's daily output. In past articles, I've shown the EIA map of the Eagle Ford, I'll just link it . Give it a look and you can see DVN's showcase development on the Butler pad is right on the southern flank of the oil and gas condensate rich section of Karnes county. As of now, of the  looking for oil, 44 of them are in the Eagle Ford.Clay Gaspar details the results of their exploration work in the Eagle Ford-The Butler unit was part of the package that came with Validus. Something I've harped on-consistently, is rock quality matters above all. Sure, DVN spent a couple of billion to get this bolt-on to their existing acreage, but it is yielding impressive results.So they are increasing production and increasing the oil-cut of the same. What's nextYes they are. Great gobs of it... but revenues and margins are down. And now we begin to understand at least part of the reason why DVN has gotten whacked by the market. , DVN logged gross revenues of  3,365 bn, down sequentially from  3,584 in Q-1, and a big step down from  5,794 the year prior. Oil prices down by nearly half and gas dropping to  2.00 MCF explains the drop. DVN still managed to generate  1,575 bn of EBITDA,  1,405 bn OCF, and Free Cash of  690 mm for the quarter. This covered the fixed and variable to the tune of  0.49 per share, or a dividend expense of  313 mm for the quarter.Their operating margin-OM, for the quarter fell to 43.95 , an 18  drop QoQ, and a big step down from the 63.33  OM recorded in . I chose Q3 for comparison as it shows what the decline in gas has meant to DVN. For reference, though, PXD OM for Q-2,2023 is also 43 , so DVN is not necessarily underperforming competitors as oil and gas prices have slumped through Q-2.Let's look at another metric, Return on Capital Employed, or ROCE.On ROCE DVN outperforms PXD. The company claims more than 20  in the slide deck for the quarter. My calculation shows 31.16  on TTM basis, so we will run with that.What has been perceived as dividend cuts since Q2, 2022 have absolutely . I've made the point before that the company has stuck to their capital returns model, where 50  of free cash goes to dividends and share repurchases, but it hasn't mattered. Nor has it mattered that other shale high dividend payers have also moderated their payouts as cash flow has declined over the past year. In each case, in conjunction with or slightly in advance of the announcement, fickle investors have voted with their feet.The company expects to place online around 90 gross wells in the third quarter, with capital spending expected to approximate  900 million. The decline in capital spending is driven by the drop of a temporary frac crew in the Delaware Basin and efficiency gains that accelerated completion activity into the first half of the year. This level of activity is expected to drive oil production to a range of 322,000 to 330,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.Increased production at a time when oil prices are surging and gas has recovered from off the bottom should add meaningful cash flow and bump up the margins.It's been tough sledding for DVN the past year as we have discussed. My expectation is they will turn the corner with their Q3 earnings announcement that will come o a the First of November. EPS is expected to come at  1.46 per share, a 20  bump from Q2. If they hit that target, free cash should be back in the  1.0 bn range. Half that, minus the fixed at  0.20 or  127 mm leaves  322 mm for the variable or about  0.51, making the total payout  0.71 per share. With forecast EPS of  1.61 for Q4, the pot should continue to get fatter.We should also mention DVN's aggressive stock buybacks, bringing value to shareholders.  on the timeliness of these buybacks-It should go without saying...almost, that as the float declines more cash is available for future distributions.Right now Devon Energy Corporation is trading at a paltry 2.1X NTM estimated EV EBITDA. That puts it squarely in a buy zone. Investors looking for growth and income should definitely consider DVN at current levels. If I am half right, these prices aren't going to stick around long. I will probably add to my position tomorrow.Fluidsdoc is an international oil industry veteran with 40 years of experience having worked on six continents and in over twenty countries around the world.

Vertex Energy: A Hold With Growing Throughput Volume And Renewable Diesel Production,"The year 2023 has seen Vertex Energy , producer and marketer of refined fuel products make noteworthy progress in regards to its renewable diesel project since the beginning of 2023. Its Q2 2023 revenues of  734.89 million beat estimatesVertex Energy has transformed from a local oil refinery company to a significant renewable fuel producer in the US. It completed its renewable diesel conversion project in H1 2023 and is expected to increase its yield profile into 2024. The recently erected Texas Tower mobile refinery planned for start-up in 2024 is also expected to lower carbon dioxide emissions and raise hydrogen production.Despite growing its revenue by 6.34   QoQ  to  734.9 million in Q2 2023, VertexAmong the niche, high-value fuel products produced by Vertex are gasoline, renewable diesel, and jet fuel, which according to the company represented about 61  of its total production in Q2 2023.I believe that the current economics of producing renewable diesel from soybean oil  feedstock  are not as attractive due to the challenging market conditions. The price of Soybeans has been marked by great volatility with the commodity trading at  12.73 per bushel from under  9 in 2020.In its Q2 2023 earnings call, Vertex Energy explained that it was diversifying its feedstock supply to at least 8 different blends including distillers corn oil, canola, and crude degummed soy. The rise in demand for renewable diesel has also necessitated this diversification with the growing conversation around sustainability. As we know, after processing from fats and oils, the chemical composition of renewable diesel is  to petroleum diesel as  it meets the ASTM specification for petroleum in the US and N590 in Europe.  Unlike biodiesel which is produced through transesterification and is blended with petroleum diesel for usage, renewable diesel provides a near-perfect alternative.Consumption of renewable diesel in California  the largest consumer of renewable diesel in the US  from 2011 to 2021 has increased from 1 million barrels a year to 28 million barrels per year.The enactment of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard  LCFS  in this State in 2011 has been a significant driver towards the adoption of biofuels. Fuel producers under this law in California are required to lower the carbon intensity of fuels while encouraging the production of renewable energy sources. In essence, producers of high-carbon fuel  above the mandated targets  are required to purchase credits from companies selling cleaner fuels. The state is quickly moving towards its zero emissions target and has encouraged other states such as Kansas, Washington, Wyoming, and North Dakota that also sell renewable diesel to California.Estimates show that the  of renewable diesel is likely to hit 216 million barrels per year in 2024. At the same time, consumption is expected to reach 239 million, indicating a deficit of at least 23 million barrels per year. The production volume of renewable diesel and other biofuels  in 2023 , according to the  Information Administration stood at 3 billion gallons per year. It has increased by 1.25 billion, a 71   YoY  increase from 2022. In the US alone, the number of states now producing renewable diesel and other biofuels has increased from 6 to 11.In Q2 2023, Vertex Energy s  conventional throughput volume  at the mobile refinery stood at 76,330 barrels  day which was equal to 102  of its operating capacity. In Q3 2023, VTNR s mobile refinery is expected to range at 74,000 b d to 77,000 b d. Additionally, the company attained a full production capacity of 8,000 barrels  day of renewable diesel which it had planned in Q1 2023.I believe this production is impressive considering VTNR purchased the 90,000 barrel  day Mobile Alabama refining facility in 2021. It had then planned to renovate the standalone refinery assets to help in the future production of renewable fuels, a plan that seems to now be working.Into Q3 2023, Vertex indicated that it had already commenced commercial sales of renewable diesel from its Mobile Alabama refining facility. In June 2023, the company sold its first 110,000 barrels of renewable diesel to Idemitsu Apollo Renewable Corp. This purchase followed an  by the two companies made in February 2022, where Idemitsu agreed to buy a maximum volume of 14,000 b d from Vertex.The Alabama facility whose first phase cost about  115 million has a planned production capacity in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 b d  of renewable diesel . The standalone hydrocracking unit is the main process involved in this phase, and it was completed by the end of Q1 2023. It is noteworthy that locally sourced soybean oil was the only feedstock that was used in the production of renewable diesel.By inference, the increase in the range of pretreated feedstock  such as meat tallow, corn oil, vegetable oil, together with soybean oil  to be used in the production of renewable diesel will enable the facility to operate at full capacity. Another important aspect to consider is that the feedstock to be used will be sourced locally, thereby creating local employment opportunities. Such an organization needs community support especially since the Mobile Alabama facility is still in its infancy. However, Vertex has been developing and sourcing alternative feedstock for at least 2 decades. It now has more than 500,000 tankers and stronger logistical capacity to improve its fuel production line in the long run.VTNR's cash balance as of Q2 2023 stood at  48.5 million, a decrease of 44   QoQ . The company s total debt and lease obligations also stand at  466.1 million with accumulated losses  negative retained earnings  at  143.4 million in the quarter. However, with the net change in cash  in the 12 months to June 2023  at  45.9 million, it shows the company has enough money to last until June 2024.Vertex Energy s gross profit declined 92.8   QoQ  to  5.2 million from  71.8 million in Q1 2023. The company also registered a net loss of  81.4 million for the first time since the quarter ending September 30, 2022. I believe that this decline was attributed to the decrease in VTNR s refining margins when considered at market prices. Cost of revenues rose 17.79   QoQ  even as the company explained that it incurred a  1  barrel impact on its yields.In this case, we may also consider the impact of hedging since the company explained that it encountered the  1 devaluation of its crude products. The price of jet fuel in the quarter also dropped by about  30 relative to that of crude oil. Overall, crude oil prices were reduced by  8 per barrel indicating a capture rate of 34 . On a similar front, energy company Blue Dolphin  also  a  significantly weaker refining margin  in Q2 2023 that lowered throughput volume, production, and sales. The refining margin  gross  dropped by almost 100  to less than  1 from a high of  15 at the beginning of 2023. The company's gross profit in the 6 months ending on June 30, 2023, stood at  22.4 million against  23.4 million recorded a year earlier. Like VTNR, Blue Dolphin also claimed that a high jet fuel yield led to a drag on its capture rate in Q2 2023. However, I believe that the price of jet fuel is growing post-Covid while gasoline prices will soon move past their seasonal adjustment phase.In regards to valuation, VTNR s price-to-book  'TTM'  ratio stands at 1.77 against the industry average of 1.67  a difference of 6.33 . The forward price-to-cash flow ratio is 8.09 against the industry average of 5.11  a difference of 58.40 . These metrics, in my view, show that the stock is slightly overvalued. Still, the company is looking at various tailwinds such as the growth in the renewable diesel output in H2 2023 and controlled hedging that should raise the shareholder value into 2024.The increasing uptake of renewable biofuels across the US is a significant driver towards the growth of Vertex Energy. The company had a challenging Q2 2023 denoted by reduced gross profit and high net losses attributed to weaker refining margins. Still, I expect the company to overcome the hedging issues in 2024 due to favorable energy prices. For these reasons, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.

Oil Could Hit $300 A Barrel,"It has been a trope that oil is going to become an  orphan asset  and that its use would end, and it would become an obsolete energy source. This is because of the gigantic efforts to halt  climate change  caused by human CO2 emissions. TheThe end of oil is not going to happen, and the implications are huge.According to the IEA, the International Energy AgencyChina, India and Southeast Asian countries together are expected to account for three out of every four tonnes of coal consumed worldwide in 2023.From   Global coal demand set to remain at record levels in 2023.The IEA is not some pay-play NGO, it is a This implication is obvious  developing countries are not going to crucify themselves on a cross of sustainability. After all these years of accords, dramatic predictions, plans and - in the developed world - giant shifts in policy, developing countries have embraced cheap energy with both hands as a guarantee of their ascendancy.It s hard not to slip from being dispassionate about this situation but the magnitude of the facts speak for themselves.As oil is a  less worse  source of CO2 than dirty and sometimes very dirty coal, oil has no chance of becoming an  orphan  source of energy. As developing countries grow  as they will at a dramatic pace  so will their thirst for energy. With these countries  GDP per head only a fraction of their potential, their energy needs are also only a fraction of what they will be, and these needs will grow in parallel with their economies. Fortunately for them - and unfortunately for plans for  Net Zero  - there is no shortage of coal and likely never will be, with enough already found for half a millennium.This means, at the very least, business as usual for oil and that likely means  300 a barrel.This idea has proved rather emotive because the thought of oil at these levels brings a realisation of how much gasoline is going to cost at the pump, and it sounds like a wild prediction we so often seen on the web.Take a look at this chart of historic oil over the last decade or soThe simplest way to look at this chart is to see that for a period of six years  2008-2014  on a four-year average, oil was at or above  100 a barrel.When you inflation adjust this for recent years you get thisThe  300 a barrel number comes from taking the 2008 high and adding on the average US energy inflation of the last 60 years. You could also add the rolling inflation of the next two or three years on top for good measure but let s not worry about the exact number. The time frame is three-to-five years.Once you have decided fossil fuel consumption is not going down then all you need do is write in the inflation already baked into the world economy to have oil trade much higher than today.Investors therefore have a simple call to make  write oil off or factor into the price the impact of inflation  as must be done for any commodity in the long term  and then position accordingly. For me it is the latter  the fact this is not generally understood underlines the potential for investors. Futures traders will have no problems trading this with all the fun and games available with highly leveraged contracts but for the more conservative of us, sitting on Exxon  or Chevron  or the less highly-priced overseas listed Shell , BP  and Total  - all of which I own - is not a difficult theme to buy in on without playing with the risks connected to companies bellow giant status.Once upon a time the market was trusted to solve problems and when the price of hydrocarbon energy rises above the falling cost of sustainable power, then coal and oil will become niche commodities.I am happy to point out the former and work on the latter, and invest accordingly.  I own Shell, BP and Total. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.

3 Reasons Why TC Energy Is A Better Buy Than Energy Transfer,"TC Energy  and Energy Transfer  are two investment grade, high yielding midstream infrastructure businesses that have large and well-diversified portfolios. Moreover, we own both and think both are undervalued at present. While ET has long been - and stillBoth businesses have solid balance sheets and ET's balance sheet in particular has been strengthened considerably in recent years. After slashing its distribution in half in late 2020 in the wake of the energy market crash and its investment grade credit rating being threatened, ET management has aggressively paid down debt and brought its leverage ratio down to within its long-term target range ofMeanwhile, TRP has a better credit rating than ET, with a BBB  scoring from S P, albeit with a negative outlook. However, TRP took a significant step forward in securing its credit rating and strengthening its balance sheet by  a  3.9 billion stake in its Columbia Gas Transmission and Columbia Gulf Transmission systems. As a result, it is now on much firmer financial footing and has more flexibility moving forward to invest in growth projects and return capital to shareholders.In addition to its slightly higher credit rating, what sets TRP's balance sheet apart from ET's is that its debt maturity ladder is in better shape. As of the end of 2022, 41  of ET's debt  by the end of 2027 putting considerably pressure on them to either pay down debt aggressively as it matures  which would in turn limit ET's ability to invest in growth projects and or grow returns of capital to unitholders  or potentially absorb meaningfully higher interest expense given that interest rates have risen so rapidly in recent years.Meanwhile, TRP's weighted average term to maturity is a whopping 20 years, with much of its debt not due for decades to come. This gives it a very stable cost of debt profile, which is very valuable at a time when interest rates have risen so rapidly. Moreover, its recent large asset stake sales give it considerable capital to pay down debt that matures in the near future.While ET has closed some of the gap with TRP in this category over the past few years, TRP's recent asset stake sale continues to give it the edge in balance sheet strength.TRP's greatest strength relative to ET is its asset portfolio. While ET is certainly well diversified and generates the vast majority  90  of its cash flow from fee-based contracted assets, TRP has a superior combined contracted regulated exposure  95  compared to ET's. Moreover, much of its 95  contracted regulated exposure comes from regulated assets, which are utility-like in nature with investment grade counterparties, making them inherently more defensive and higher quality in nature than ET's contracted assets. TRP's contracted assets are also extremely competitively positioned with lengthy contract terms, giving them a more stable cash flow profile than ET's assets have, in aggregate.With some of the very best midstream assets on the North American continent, TRP's portfolio is built to last. As Morningstar  its portfolioLast, but not least, we think that TRP stock has more upside potential than ET stock at the moment. As you can see in the chart below, ET stock has risen nicely over the past year whereas TRP's stock price has lost nearly one quarter of its valueWhile ET remains slightly undervalued in our view - thereby justifying its stock price appreciation over the past year - TRP has traded down to at least some degree in a manner that is unjustified. Mr. Market disliked the uncertainty that came with the asset sale program, was somewhat disappointed by the valuation that the company fetched for its asset stake sale, and now appears to be a bit unhappy about its announced  of its liquids business. However, the underlying asset portfolio remains very high quality and performing quite well, the balance sheet is in quite solid shape, and we believe that the spin-off will actually  for the business. Meanwhile, the dividend remains very well covered, the yield is very attractive, and the long-term growth streak is highly likely to continue for years to come.While TRP's EV EBITDA is considerably higher than ET's at the moment, this premium is justified becauseMoreover, while ET trades nearly in-line with its average EV EBITDA of the past three years, TRP trades at a steep discount to its three-year EV EBITDA average. TRP also trades at a larger discount to its five-year EV EBITDA average than ET doesAs a result, we anticipate TRP achieving greater valuation multiple expansion in the coming years relative to ET. Moreover, TRP's growth outlook  5.4  EBITDA CAGR through 2027 compared to 3.7  for ET based on consensus analyst estimates  is stronger as well.While ET's yield is  150 basis points higher than TRP's at the moment, largely offsetting the expected growth differential, TRP's greater multiple expansion potential and lower overall risk profile - stemming from its stronger balance sheet and asset portfolio - make it a better risk-reward proposition than ET at current prices.Other factors to keep in mind are that ET is a U.S.-based MLP whereas TRP is a Canada-based company, so keep in mind the tax implications that come with both of these structures. Moreover, TRP is more defensively positioned whereas ET is more aggressively positioned relative to the overall energy industry. As a result, if the energy sector booms in the coming years, ET is likely going to outperform relative to TRP. However, if the energy sector stagnates or struggles, TRP is likely going to outperform ET. Overall, we rate ET a Buy and TRP a Strong Buy right now and think both make for excellent high yield picks.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Energy Transfer: The Juice Is Still Worth The Squeeze,"I write about Energy Transfer Partners MLP  on a regular basis. My primary objective is providing information that may assist investors better understand ET financials, business performance, and unit price valuation. Generally, I do not recap the quarterly earnings reports, though I willMy recent articles about Energy Transfer have been bullish. In my last  entitled,  Energy Transfer  Looking for Warts,  I remained constructive on the stock, while the upshot was to search for specific financial risks to the thesis.In this article, we will review Energy Transfer's debt leverage ratio and compare it with several MLP peers  namely, Enterprise Products Partners , Plains All-American , and MPLX LP . In addition, I've performed some valuation work for the same group. Specifically, we will examine EV   EBITDAIn years' past, Energy Transfer struggled with an overleveraged balance sheet. More recently, the problem has been rectified. The credit rating agencies targeted a 4.0x to 4.5x debt leverage ratio in order for ET to maintain an investment grade rating  BBB- or better .On  conference call, co-CEO Tom Long remarked,It's important to understand the credit rating agencies do not calculate the leverage ratio the same way. Therefore, there can be a variance between one outfit and another. It's also key to realize the debt leverage ratio isn't about just paying down   lower gross indebtedness. It's about the combination of net debt as a function of earnings power  namely adjusted EBITDA.I've calculated the debt leverage ratio using the methodology I believe closely followed the prescription utilized by S P.Following is a summary of the workup. The foregoing input data may be compiled via Energy Transfer  releases and  is determined by starting with total debt less balance sheet cash. Operating lease liabilities are added. One-half of all the preferred stock value is added.Next, due to Energy Transfer's capital structure, several additional adjustments are made.Bakken Holdings  Dakota Access Pipeline  total consolidated debt is deducted, and 36.4 percent of it is added back. This is because 100  of Bakken Holdings debt resides on the Energy Transfer balance sheet, but ET owns only 36.4 percent of the pipeline.Finally, debt incurred by Sunoco LP  and USA Compression Partners  is subtracted. Sun and USAC are stand-alone entities. Their respective debt loads are non-recourse to Energy Transfer, even though 100 percent of this subsidiary debt is on the ET consolidated balance sheet.Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by starting with Energy Transfer's adjusted EBITDA as recorded on the company's quarterly earnings release.Then adjustments are made for non-wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily DAPL , USA Compression, and Sunoco LP. These reflect proportional ownership and  cash EBITDA.  Specifically, the methodology goes like thisAfter going through the arithmetic, as of June 30, 2023, Energy Transfer's adjusted debt is  44.6 billion  and trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA is  11.2 billion.The net debt leverage ratio appears to be  4.0x.The table below summarizes Energy Transfer's leverage ratio versus peers  using the same methodology as described above, populated by data from the same respective SEC and company web site sources.By my estimation, Energy Transfer is well-within the credit agencies' investment-grade rating target range, though it's still above the peer group.The others are grouped within a fairly tight pack.Let's pivot to Fair Value as measured by EV   EBITDA.There are multiple ways to estimate a stock's Fair Value. When debt may be a significant factor when comparing companies within the same general industry, the EV-TO-EBITDA ratio can offer insight.In the way of definitions, EV stands for Enterprise Value. This is an approximation of how much a business may be worth if it were being acquired by an outside party. It's determined by the summation ofAdjusted EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Typically, management includes some other non-core puts and takes. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of EBITDA.  is even more of a Frankenstein. However, as an investor, I recognize that within certain industries adjusted EBITDA is a coin-of-the-realm. MLPs often highlight adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow.So, I've learned to live with it.Running the math for Energy Transfer, the current EV is  102.7 billion and trailing twelve-month EBITDA is 13.1 billion. Therefore, the EV   EBITDA ratio is 7.8x.Or is itIf we plug in the S P generated adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA into the equation, we get a materially different result. An alternative calculation shows  95.7 billion EV and  11.2 EBITDA, resulting in 8.5x EV   EBITDA.The difference is because backing out proportionate debt and EBITDA for non-wholly owned subsidiaries, Sunoco LP, and USAC are sizeable changes.Which one approach is betterOffhand, I believe the  straight  calculation is best.WhyMost investors don't consider  or know how to apply  the S P credit rating adjustments. Indeed, while the S P modifications make business sense, I suspect using them when comparing the valuation ratio versus peers may be trying to grind things into too fine a powder.The table below highlights the EV   EBITDA ratios for Energy Transfer and the peer group.The peer group retains better EV   EBITDA multiples. Energy Transfer lags.Is this reasonableOne may be able to reconcile the difference between ET and the pack through the lens of the debt leverage ratio  ET is higher and has a checkered past. However, the gap appears large in the face of Energy Transfer management's recent focus and results to bring down leverage per rating agency guidelines. In time, multiples better-aligned relative to peers seem to be a reasonable expectation.Before looking towards a Fair Value Estimate for ET units, let's look at one more datum set.Unsurprisingly, Enterprise Products has the best S P credit rating and greatest market cap. Energy Transfer, and the others have lower investment grade credit ratings.By a considerable margin, Energy Transfer offers a superior cash distribution yield.ET units have had a good run. However, the go-forward thesis isn't without risks. There are several key risks that have the propensity to upend the three-year uptrend.The first is an energy commodity price collapse. As ET is primarily in the energy transportation business, there is some natural insulation to energy price fluctuation. Materials continues to move regardless of price. Nonetheless, the company retains some exposure to commodity prices. Furthermore, history indicates the Street tends to sell off all energy stocks when commodities are under pressure.Second, Energy Transfer faces litigation risk. Currently, no issues appear pressing. Co-CEOs Tom Long and Mackie McCrea have been more conservative, taking more of a stewardship role. However, the nature of ET's business model and the industry in general tend to attract litigation.Third, there some investors continue to believe the company is on the verge of an unbridled spending spree, whereby growth capital is spent with disregard for adequate returns, thereby jeopardizing Energy Transfer's financial foundation. Even after the last earnings report, some investors interpreted management discussions about growth projects to mean the company was about to mortgage itself on the altar of business growth. On the Street, perception is often just as important as reality.Fourth, for a company with the size and span of Energy Transfer, there is always execution risk. ET has a lot of irons in the fire. Management must ensure new projects are completed on time   on budget, and the capital stack is well-managed, while operational and financial objectives are balanced with the expectations   promises made to the stockholders.Fifth, Energy Transfer units have enjoyed an outstanding run  leading the peer group. The differential is wider after considering Energy Transfer's superior cash distribution returns. From this point, the potential total return upside isn't as great as it was after the post-C19 crash. Here's a three-year price chart illustrating ET's performance versus peers.It can be hard to lead the pack year-in and year-out.Currently, Energy Transfer has the credit leverage issue fixed. The ratio is within the credit agencies' target range  thereby ensuring an ongoing  and stable  investment grade rating. While the debt leverage ratio is higher than peers, it's not a lot greater  and it's been coming down quickly.When considering the EV   EBITDA ratio, investors know that this particular valuation metric considers debt.We find the ET multiple lags peers by a significant margin. In my opinion, given recent events and management performance, the margin isn't justified.I believe the view is further supported by the fact that Energy Transfer common units offer investors a superior cash yield. The current distribution is well-covered by Distributable Cash Flow. Management has stated their intent to raise the payout by three to five percent a year. ET is not a company struggling to find its financial footing.Therefore, on balance, these data points point to higher multiples and higher unit values.If Energy Transfer maintains its current debt load, annual cash distribution, and adjusted EBITDA, I find it reasonable to forecast an 8.0x to 8.5x EV   EBITDA multiple. Backing into unit values, the following table provides a summary of projected unit prices as a function of EV   EBITDA multiples.Given my opinion Energy Transfer management is likely to 1  continue to raise the distribution, 2  meet or exceed TTM  13.1 billion adjusted EBITDA in 2023, and 3  maintain or improve debt leverage, I plant my FVE flag in the ground at  14.50 to  15 per unit.A  14.50 unit price plus the current cash distribution indicate a 20 percent uplift.

Vaalco Energy: Doubling Down On Acquisition,"   appears to have focused upon the growth aspects of the recent  of TransGlobe Energy  TGA . This likewise appears to be paying dividends in excess of what was publicly anticipated before theThe  Gabon has not affected the company at all, according to the press release. That is probably because the company's operations are offshore, and those operations provide some badly need currency. Offshore operations are less likely to be disturbed by something like this.Vaalco Energy began as a small player in theEven wells to add production are expensive for a company of this size. Therefore, enough cash and cash flow was necessary before more drilling could occur, as this management wisely decided to keep a debt-free .But the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy will allow for production growth in between the major offshore projects that were not originally available to Vaalco Energy. The TransGlobe Energy wells are onshore and actually very cheap onshore wells. So, activity is easy to rachet up or down as industry conditions dictate.Furthermore, both companies were small enough that production was  picked up  periodically rather than sold at the time of production as is typical in the United States and Canada. The combined companies have a smoother cash inflow than they did separately. Therefore, there is less need to keep as much cash on hand in between production sales.Both the Canadian and the Egyptian businesses showed growth in the latest quarters. have clearly improved. Since the majority of these wells are vertical wells, drilling time is a larger part of the total well cost than is the case when horizontal drilling and fracking would be involved. Management has not yet released payback periods and rates of return on these wells. But an improvement shown like the one discussed above is likely to significantly elevate profitability.The new issue is the horizontal well. Since that type of well is a brand-new idea, there is likely to be a period of time between this well and any potential horizontal wells in the future. In this area, horizontal wells were not needed for some very good production results. But an older field could change that attitude. That is what management is trying to figure out.Like any other production area, Egypt has a lot of  tired fields and intervals.  Success of horizontal drilling and  modern completion techniques  could spur a revival of production in some places that were deemed uneconomical, as was the case in the United States.Very long-term readers may remember that this acreage was originally considered natural gas acreage  especially by the seller . Clearly enough progress was made to find a very different production mix. Many times, in the years since this acreage was acquired, readers have wondered if it was  worth the effort  because previous management largely concentrated on the Egyptian business.It looks like not only was the acquisition worth the effort  by previous management  it also looks like the acquisition is going to turn out to be a  steal.  The kind of production mix shown above is far more valuable than just natural gas. It will also likely be more profitable as well.More importantly, Canada often has acreage nearby that can be acquired to cheaply expand operations if this initial venture proves successful. It is very likely that the current management will acquire more acreage in the future given the progress noted above.In summary, this management has brought more energy to bear on both of these businesses than I have seen in a long time. The result is progress I had nearly given up hope in seeing. If management keeps up the current pace, both businesses will be far more successful than many of us dreamed possible. of the original company production before the acquisition of TransGlobe Energy. Management had finished a campaign of drilling to expand production. The next step is to get those wells producing to the extent possible while rebuilding cash levels to  rinse and repeat.Therefore, management is considering another drilling campaign. The new production and storage arrangement is paying dividends for the company. However, there are some offsetting events that prevent shareholders from seeing all the anticipated savings.As a side note, it is a matter of  so far so good  with respect to the Gabon coup. What needs to be seen is the stability of the new government and the direction it takes. Management will likely be providing an update with the next report. But as a producer that provides hard currency to the government. The company is likely very much appreciated and has little to fear as a result.Equatorial Guinea is the site of the next major project that will likely increase offshore production. The planning of this one is proceeding to the partner approval stage. Once this is underway, it will be a likely major cash drain that will affect free cash flow for some time. But then again, projected benefits appear to far exceed costs.Vaalco has a strategy of developing discoveries that were considered uneconomical by the larger companies. This keeps competition low to allow for above average profitability while allowing the company to grow to the point where it can compete with larger companies. Focusing upon discoveries already made also decreases some of the very costly offshore risks.This is very similar to the Egyptian strategy of producing  unloved  fields. In the same way, Vaalco avoids competition with larger industry entities to allow for above average profitability. This will sharply lower the risk of failure.Most of the oil and gas industry is highly undervalued. That includes this company as well. The price-earnings ratio may have finally climbed above five by the time you read this. That is an extremely low price-earnings ratio compared to industry history.The only effect of the coup so far appears to be the effect on the stock price. That will likely fade over time as strong oil prices replace the coup news. Time will tell though.Management has further lowered risk by keeping a debt free balance sheet and lots of cash on hand. This company operates in Africa and is one of very few companies to do so successfully. Africa has long been a cash flow wasteland for many companies that have little to nothing to show for their efforts. Therefore, the success that this company enjoys in a nightmare area for a lot of companies should point to above average management.Management is often the most important asset not on the balance sheet. This Vaalco Energy management got a fantastic deal when it acquired TransGlobe Energy. Now that deal is turning out to be even better.In the meantime, management is fiscally conservative enough to keep a lot of cash along with a debt-free balance sheet. When combined with the low price-earnings ratio, the risk of long-term downside stock price action is very low. On the other hand, management raised production guidance to point towards a growth future.The TransGlobe acquisition should allow for growth each year that the market loves, along with big bulges in growth when an offshore project begins production. This company can grow a lot larger without encountering competition from large companies with the strategy management chose. It can grow relatively safely given that strategy as well. Seldom can that be said about an upstream company.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry. It takes patience, and it certainly helps to have experience.

Dominion Energy’s offshore wind project is powering through despite challenges,"Dominion Energy s  offshore wind project is beginning its next phase of construction. The  9.8B offshore wind project in coastal Virginia, which is estimated to power 660,000 homes when completed, will be over 600 feet tall and will have over 170 turbines. In a CNBC interview on Wednesday, G.T. Hollett, Dominion s director of Offshore Wind, said the company is shipping pieces of equipment to Portsmouth Marine Terminal to get the project off the ground.The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project will begin its offshore phase of construction  in earnest next year.The industry has been facing numerous headwinds, including rising interest rates and undeveloped supply chains, forcing some developers to renegotiate contracts or walk away from projects entirely, CNBC reported.The project, however, is getting  3B in IRA credits.Part of the project s success is that Dominion Energy  brought it to Virginia s State Corporation Commission, which approved the project and its spending plan. Now, about 90  of their costs are locked in.In addition, Dominion  forecasts about a  4 increase per month for Virginia ratepayers over the lifespan of this project. There is a difference between generation owners and transmission owners, and when you have a power purchase agreement, if you don't have a guaranteed offtake power price on the other side, then the cost can change,  CNBC reported.This was most notably seen with Orsted , not getting a high enough power purchase agreement or power offtake price to justify their higher costs.Dominion s stock is down 37.39  from last year, and down 35.02  year-to-date. It s gone downwards since August 2022. ",27,2023-10-18T13:30:15.000-04:00

"NextEra Energy plunges despite Buy rating reiterated at Goldman, as drop overdone","NextEra Energy  is Monday's biggest loser among utility companies,  to its lowest in more than three and a half years, swallowed up by  as well as a broad loss in utilityNextEra's  plunge comes even as Goldman Sachs maintained its Buy rating while cutting its price target to  72 from  83, saying the stock's recent decline is overdone.While recognizing that a higher cost of capital on renewables and the broader elevated interest rate environment presents challenges, Goldman's Carly Davenport believes NextEra's  valuation at current levels does not take into account the company's flexibility around financing and balance sheet capacity, ability and willingness to monetize other non-core assets and tax credits or explore sales to third party investors for renewables, or scale benefits that allow the company to maintain economics on new projects.Davenport continues to see above average growth going forward at NextEra , with a five-year earnings compound annual growth rate of 9 .The analyst notes that many investors have expressed concern that  13B of interest rate hedges that management has stated cover most of 2024 will fully roll off ahead of 2025, but the company has said the hedges have various durations, with some up to 10 years, which could provide some degree of offset in addition to the  3B of hedges on for 2025 and beyond.We believe NEE will be able to navigate these headwinds and remain the industry leader in renewable development with its scale and track record, an advantage in negotiating project economics relative to peers,  Davenport wrote.",45,2023-10-02T15:32:20.000-04:00

Peabody Energy - What's Up With Coal?,"Coal is in a tricky spot. In 2020, everyone was convinced that coal was dead. Newcastle Coal futures were trading at  50 per ton, one of the lowest numbers in modern history. Economic growth was in a very bad spot, and everyone wasWhile renewable energy is still a hot topic, coal isn't going anywhere. Currently, coal futures are significantly lower than their 2022 highs, which occurred when the world had to quickly transition to coal due to the high cost of natural gas. However, we are still far from the lows that were observed before the surge in coal demand in 2021.Coal seems to have plateaued, at least for the time being. For example, looking at the EIA's , which was published on July 3, we seeIn other words, we're witnessing that the US is playing an increasingly important role in facilitating international coal demand. Its production and exports remain strong, while domestic consumption is steadily declining, fueled by the ongoing energy transition. This is good news for , which recently released its earnings and continues to do quite well despite secular challenges in the domestic coal industry. While its stock price is trading roughly 34  below its 52-week high, the company is upbeat about its future and eager to let shareholders participate in its success. In this article, I'll walk you through the company's numbers and discuss the risk reward for investors. So, let's get to it  Because most investors  including me  went into the past winter with expectations of severe energy shortages, the surprisingly warm winter weather caused investors to unwind very bullish bets on coal, natural gas, and related. It also left some nations with large coal stockpiles. Even my home country, the Netherlands, briefly turned into a net export nation of coal because it had too much coal. The result was the decline in coal prices I discussed in the introduction. Having said that, there's good news - despite the ongoing decline in economic growth expectations. To quote Peabody Energy  emphasis addedHere's a recent screenshot from Google showing coal-supporting China headlinesNot only is this great news for American coal exports and prices, but it should also be reflected in the 3Q23 earnings of major American railroads, which ship coal from mines to export facilities. In the case of Peabody Energy, these railroads are Buffett-owned BNSF and Union Pacific , which services mines like its North Antelope Mine, the world's largest coal mine. Moving over to steelmaking coal, the seaborne metallurgical market experienced variable global crude steel output, with China and India showing notable growth.Metallurgical coal supply remained constrained due to weather events, keeping premium hard-coking coal pricing elevated.Despite challenges, demand for seaborne thermal coal remained robust, and supply constraints across key regions are expected to balance out due to peak summer energy demand and winter restocking.BTU's seaborne thermal coal exports in the second quarter surpassed expectations at 2.6 million tons, thanks to the completion of a Longwall move at its Wambo mine and improved weather conditions.Seaborne met coal shipments also exceeded projections, driven by strong sales from the CMJV  Coppabella-Moorvale Joint Venture  complex in Australia.The company also successfully resumed operations at Shoal Creek after a first-quarter fire, focusing on the new L panel area for better mining conditions.The PRB  Powder River Basin  experienced lower-than-anticipated shipments due to low customer demand, high coal inventory levels, natural gas pricing, and a tornado event. These are essentially the fundamental headwinds discussed in the first part of this article. Having said that, the company is preparing to boost coal output in 2024, which should  hopefully  come with a bottom in global economic growth, but it's too early to make that call. With this in mind, let's take a look at the performance per segment, including some comments, before we move to the company's revised outlook.So far, so good. But what about the outlookWe have already briefly discussed the company's positive comments regarding coal demand. This was reflected in its full-year guidance. BTU has updated its outlook for the remainder of the year. Seaborne Thermal volume is expected to be 15 million to 16 million tons, reflecting a 500,000-ton increase due to higher expected production at Wilpinjong, which is an Australian mine close  Australians would call it close  to Newcastle  the coal futures are named after this export town . Metallurgical volume is projected to be 6.5 million to 7.5 million tons, 500,000 tons lower than previously expected, mainly due to reduced production at the CMJV and Shoal Creek.PRB shipments have been revised downward to 80 million to 85 million tons, reflecting the impact of low natural gas prices, utility inventories, and mild weather.With that in mind, the outlook was a bit of a mix of one-off production changes and the impact of unfavorable macro conditions. Nonetheless, the company remains upbeat about its future, backed by the aforementioned longer-term outlook. This is also why the company sticks to its goal to return at least 65  of annual available free cash flow to shareholders. This shareholder distribution plan was initiated in the first quarter. Thanks to a healthy balance sheet, the company does not need to prioritize debtholders over shareholders. Bear in mind that the company is expected to end this year with  920 million in net cash. In 2Q alone, the company bought back 8.3  of its shares, which is truly spectacular. Putting a valuation on BTU is difficult. The same goes for other commodity-driven stocks, by the way. BTU is trading at 2.0x NTM EBITDA, which is fair. However, it doesn't mean a lot. If coal prices rise or fall 10 , EBITDA expectations will change dramatically. The chart below shows that despite its solid financials, BTU hasn't been able to gain momentum. The problem is obviously the decline in coal prices. Having said that, if the company is right and volumes get stronger, we could see a bottom in BTU's stock. Especially if natural gas gains upside momentum, I expect BTU to do well. For example, I recently wrote an  that explains my bullish view of natural gas and two of my favorite plays. In general, I prefer oil and gas over coal, as secular headwinds are less severe. I also do not like how volatile BTU is. So, if investors are interested in buying BTU because they like the longer-term outlook of coal and related energy commodities, please be aware of the volatility. For now, I will stick to a neutral rating. I will upgrade this rating once I can make the case that coal will get more cyclical support. In conclusion, the coal industry is experiencing a mix of challenges and opportunities.While global coal prices dipped due to high inventories and warm winter weather, demand for seaborne thermal coal remains robust, especially in China and India.American coal exports and prices are benefitting from this demand, boosting companies like Peabody Energy.Despite ongoing economic growth concerns, BTU is optimistic about its future and plans to increase coal output in 2024.However, investors should be cautious about the volatility in the coal market.As a result, I currently maintain a neutral rating on BTU, but with the potential for an upgrade if cyclical support for coal strengthens.Join  today to get the most in-depth research that includes REITs, mREITs, Preferreds, BDCs, MLPs, ETFs, and other income alternatives. 438 testimonials and most are 5 stars.

Energy Transfer: Strong Income Generator Amid Uncertain Times,"I last wrote on Energy Transfer  a bit more than three months ago  see the chart below . The  argued for a buyFast-forward to now, the stock has indeed delivered strong returns against an overall market decline. To wit, the stock has enjoyed aDespite the price rally, I see the stock as an even stronger buy at this point, and consequently, this article will upgrade my rating to Strong Buy. In the remainder of this article, I will elaborate on two of my key considerations for my upgraded rating. First, I will argue that a few new catalysts have happened since then, and they can provide ET with a better growth potential. Second, because of such a better growth potential, the stock valuation has actually become even more discounted from the Graham P E.Oil prices have recovered strongly since my last article. As seen from the chart below, Brent futures were in the  75 range at that time. It has since then reached a peak of almost  100 and currently hovers around  87. Now, I see a couple of catalysts to keep oil prices  or energy commodity prices in general  elevated and provide a tailwind for ET in the near future.The most important catalyst in my view, sadly, is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. In general, geopolitical risks tend to increase demand for oil and commodities for several reasons. Geopolitical conflicts tend to disrupt supply, transportation, and global trading. At the same time, both the general public and investors may seek to store more commodities as a hedge against the ongoing geopolitical conflicts.Specific to the Israel-Hamas conflict, I see more immediate impacts on oil and energy prices. The conflict could have nonlinear ramifications on other countries in the Middle Eastern region, many of which are important oil production export countries. Iran is the first specific example that came to my mind. Iran is a significant oil production country and also a known supporter of Hamas. As such, it's a possible scenario, in my view, we could see a tightening of restrictions on Iranian oil exports.Admittedly, these catalysts are relevant to the general energy sector and won't only serve as a tailwind for ET. However, I will argue that thanks to a few differentiating factors, ET is better positioned to navigate the ramifications of such geopolitical events than the sector average. The top differentiators are its scale and integrated operations. ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. Its assets are highly integrated, which allows it to achieve significant operational efficiencies. For example, its pipeline network connects production areas to processing facilities and storage terminals, which allows the company to move products quickly and efficiently to market.This unique strength has provided ET with the resilience to deliver strong results amid market turmoil. The following chart shows its recent dividend payouts as a reflection of such resilience. As seen, the dividend amount has recovered very quickly since the COVID-19 pandemic. It increased rapidly from  0.175 per share in the first quarter of 2022 to  0.31 per share at this point. This represents an increase of approximately 77 , and its current payout already is higher than its pre-pandemic level of  0.305 per share.The stock is currently yielding 9.06  on an FWD basis. Such a high yield, when combined with its resilience and discounted valuation  argued next , makes it a strong income generator in uncertain times like this.For the valuation of a  traditional  business like ET, I will follow the Graham approach as detailed in his book  Intelligent Investor . In particular, I will start with the so-called Graham P E. As detailed in my earlier articleIn ET's case, consensus estimates project an EPS growth rate of  1  CAGR at the time of my original article. The above projection was too pessimistic in my view. But even with a 1  growth rate, its Graham P E would be 10.5x. At that time, the stock was trading around a P E of 9.06x, about 14  below the Graham P E. Now, due to the recovery of commodities prices and the other catalysts mentioned above,  have upped the growth projection in the next few years to 3.0  as seen in the chart below.With this new growth rate, the discount has become larger despite the price rallies since as shown in my next table. As seen, its market P E is about 10.22x currently, about 29  lower than the Graham P E. There are a few other risks both in the upward and downward directions that are worth mentioning. In the upward direction, ET's assets are primarily located in the United States, which makes ET less exposed to the risks associated with geopolitical conflicts in other parts of the world than the sector average. Furthermore, its revenue model is primarily fee based. It charges a fee for transporting, storing, and processing energy products for its customers. As such, its revenue model is less exposed to geopolitical events should they take an unexpected turn.In the downside direction, the  shows a smaller discount, as you can see from my analyses table above. The Graham P E only takes into consideration the EPS, while the Graham number considers both the earnings and the book value. As such, the fact that the Graham number shows a smaller discount implies that the market is giving its assets a more favorable price than its earnings. But still, the Graham number also shows a sizable valuation discount of 16 .To conclude, despite the price rally since my last writing, I view ET as an even stronger buy under current conditions. The main factors involved in this upgrading are twofold. First, I see new catalysts that can support a better growth potential  and so do consensus estimates . Second, because of the better growth potential, I see its valuation as more discounted now compared to the time of my last writing.As you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

LyondellBasell's Cyclical Downturn May Be A Great Buying Opportunity For Long-Term Investors,"LyondellBasell  is in a very peculiar position. With the global economy teetering recessionary signs, management continues to transform operations by investing in the circular economy while improving shareholder benefits through the form of a dividend increase and share buybacks. As theManagement is very vocal in reporting their outlook for future business. Given the cyclicality of the industry, providing analysts some insight into the business is prudent in developing an investment case. As management has discerned, summer travel in 2023 has strongly supported LyondellBasell s oxyfuels and refining businesses. Though the summer season is about wrapped up as kids go back to school, gasoline prices and WTI remain elevated, as discerned by the EIA.Given the production cuts by Saudi Arabia and low US gasoline inventories, gasoline prices should be expected to remain elevated or continue to climb into the end of the year. Despite uncertain economic growth going into 2024, oil producers appear to be aligning production with demand.Despite these offsetting figures, management believes q3 23 will remain challenging for their olefins and polyolefins business given the challenging economic environment in China.Accordingly, China s manufacturing activity has shrunk for 5 months straight with their August Manufacturing PMI reading of 49.7  and Non-Manufacturing PMI falling to 51 , off from 53.2  in June. Economists have also cut GDP growth forecasts for the duration of 2023 and 2024, reducing expectations for 2023 from 5.5  to 5  growth. Despite this low reading, the production subindex rose to 51.9  and new orders rose to 50.2 , remaining in expansionary territory. The biggest drawdown in this reading was new export orders of 46.7 , pulling down the broader index. Coinciding with exports, industrial profits have fallen by 6.7  in China, resulting in a 7 consecutive month of declines. Though China only accounts for 5  of LyondellBasell s revenue stream, the global market for their products dictates their pricing power.New vehicle builds appear to remain in the normal seasonal range, which coincides with LyondellBasell s performance in sales to the automotive industry. In China, 27mm new vehicles were produced in 2022, a 3  increase from the previous year. Though this is 5  above 2019 production figures, it remains -7  off from the peak production in 2016.US new vehicle production also appears to be back to pre-C19 levels. The July 2023 figures for new vehicles produced in the US reached 11.87mm units, or 7  above July 2019 figures.For both the US and China, new vehicle production is beneficial to LyondellBasell given that their products can be found in the coatings and paint, upholstery, and floor mats, amongst other features found in vehicles.Management is currently in the process of transforming the business into a more sustainable, renewables-centric, and circular business model. One of their biggest initiatives is to produce 2mm tons of recycled renewable-based polymers annually by 2030. So far through Quality Circular Polymers  QCP , LyondellBasell produces 55,000 tons of recycled polypropylene and recycled high-density polyethylene annually, with a total of 220,000 tons of polymers produced since 2019. Though this is quite an ambitious goal considering their current positioning in the renewables space, it may become necessary as public policy pushes towards a more circular economy. This may also be further pushed by customers of LyondellBasell as ESG scores become more heavily considered in making business decisions.Management is also working rigorously in building their value enhancement program  VEP  with a target of  750mm in annual recurring EBITDA. The run rate is expected to reach  200mm by the end of 2023, a  50mm improvement from the initial projections of  150. Management denoted a variety of cost benefits in their Q2 23 earnings call, including a  50,000 investment in steam control improvements that increased butadiene yields with an expected benefit of  1.4mm in annual value. Much of the value added revolves around reducing energy consumption through process improvements and investments in modernizing equipment. Their biggest investment of  550,000 in a new filtration system at their Channelview, Texas facility is expected to improve annual recurring EBITDA by  5.1mm through margin expansion.Reviewing LyondellBasell s financial performance, the industry appears to be in a downcycle. How long this cycle persists will be challenging to forecast given the current state of the global economy and the drive towards a more circular economy. A few examples to be aware of are the reduction in packaging and the improving utilization of recycled materials. Management has been very proactive in transforming their operations through acquisitions to get the edge in this new market environment. In July 2023, LyondellBasell completed their acquisition of Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled, high-performing technical compounds. Management also announced the acquisition of a 50  stake in Stiphout Industries, a Dutch recycling firm that sources and processes post-consumer plastic packaging waste. Management also entered into a JV in June 2023 with AFA Nord to build a mechanical recycling plant to convert Linear Low-Density Polyethylene and Low Density Polyethylene waste into quality recycled plastic materials used in flexible packaging with production expected to begin in 1H25.It's clear that the firm is transforming their operations for future needs  however, the ultimate question is just how in demand will recycled polymers be  Unifi , a firm that recycles polyethylene, suggested weaker demand for their products during their fiscal year 2023 ending in July, pulling revenue down by -24 . Though this isn t necessarily an isolated occurrence related to the recycling business, it suggests recycled polymers coincide with the broader plastics industry.Despite this cyclical slump, the demand still remains.  published in January 2020, Coca-Cola , PepsiCo , Nestle , Keurig Dr Pepper , and Danone  are each targeting to utilize 25  post-consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2025, as mandated by the EU. Outside of mandated recycled content usage, utilization of recycled pellets is in competition with virgin plastics. , the cost for rPET has been experiencing downward pricing pressure in the US throughout 2023 due to higher costs in conjunction with margin management, inventory management, as well as overall demand for consumer packaging. Regardless of demand, LyondellBasell is positioning its operations to meet the demand for both virgin and recycled content.Accordingly, management has voiced challenging economic environments in European and Asian markets given both consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Given the lackluster post-C19 recovery in China, the 21  youth unemployment rate, and the slowing of economic growth, operations for LyondellBasell may experience a more challenging international environment.  in recessionary territory for three consecutive quarters in 2023 as households and government spending slumps. All major sectors are breaking down, including manufacturing, services, retail, and construction.Domestically, consumer spending continues to show resiliency  however, this data point doesn t necessarily show volume growth but rather overall spending. Relating to LyondellBasell, volumes in consumer spending will have the strongest effect on swinging operations back into an upcycle.Overall, LyondellBasell experienced a revenue contraction of -31  in q2 23, or a -10  reduction using TTM figures. Overall, segments are being pressured as the economy teeters around a potential recession. Accordingly, weak demand for durable goods largely effected their I D segment, which experienced a -29  year-on-year pull on revenue. Though refining is back in profitable territory, the segment experienced a -35  drop in revenue with favorable crack spreads  however, crack spreads are expected to moderate throughout q3 23. APS was down -33  year-on-year as demand from construction and electronics pulled back with automotive remaining strong.Management outlined in their q2 23 call that the duration of the year will experience some margin compression across operations. Using a top-down approach with this presumption, we can expect LyondellBasell to generate ballpark  3,280mm in free cash flow while using management s  1,700mm capex figure,  405mm net interest expense, and 20  effective tax rate. This provides LyondellBasell with a 7  flow through and a free cash flow yield of 10 .The ultimate question that comes to mind is when to invest in LYB shares. This will come down to determining where in the cycle we are. With the presumption that 2024 will be a year for slow, no, or contractionary economic growth, timing a position might need to wait until 2h24. With management s expectations of a challenging 2h23, 2024 may press some further challenges in consumer spending. My suspicion is that though consumers aren t slowing down spending, consumers are beginning to be stretched thin on disposable income and more heavily leaning on credit.These data points may be just be a minor anomaly or a persistent trend. If the latter is true, 2024 may be a pressing year for LyondellBasell, and shares may experience a pullback as valuations reflect next year s operations.That said, management has a few shareholder benefits in place that makes this stock quite appealing. In May 2023, shareholders approved the authorization for LyondellBasell to repurchase up to 34mm ordinary shares  share count, not dollar amount  through November 2024. Management has historically been adamant in purchasing shares, acquiring  170mm for the first half of 2023. The firm also has a robust dividend policy, paying out  5 share on an annualized basis to yield 5 . Though the payout ratio increased to 76  this last quarter, up from 52  sequentially, I don t expect the ratio to go above 75  for the duration of the year nor do I anticipate any near-term risk to dividend safety as management has  2,468 cash to lean on. The only near-term risk is the 4  2023 guaranteed notes coming due this year  however, only  425mm remains on the balance sheet which can be covered by operations.As far as valuation is concerned, LYB shares currently trade with a 10  free cash flow yield, an appealing figure for those value investors. The firm is priced relatively expensive compared to their historical EV EBITDA, which is typically rangebound between 6-8x.Assuming a continued challenging market, slight topline challenges and minor EBITDA margin contraction, we can discern a range to consider purchasing LYB shares. Though I presently think shares are expensive, I believe the value enhancements in the form of both dividends and buybacks add some risk benefits to the mix. My recommendation is a HOLD on LYB shares at this present price and to purchase shares as they fall into the more appealing range in the mid- 60-70s share and continue holding at these current prices.

"Canacol Energy: Buy For The 9.2% Yield, Hold For The Potential Capital Gains","I have been following Canacol Energy   , but I haven t really been too happy with the share price evolution. Despite being able to I will continue to keep an eye on Canacol Energy as it remains a sizeable position in my portfolio. The generous dividends are helpful, but I still hope to generate capital gains as well.Canacol s production rate has been pretty stable lately, asThe natural gas was sold at an  and whereas Canacol was  punished  for its relatively fixed price around US 5 mcf when the North American natural gas prices were trending higher, it's very clear Canacol is now taking advantage of the stable Colombian prices as the realized price is substantially higher than the prices in North America.As the output is stable and the realized price is pretty stable as well, it probably doesn t come as a surprise to see a pretty flat total reported revenue, which . That s almost exactly the result generated in the first quarter of the year, so there definitely aren t any negative surprises.That being said, the operating expenses and transportation expenses increased somewhat. Due to the very low cost nature of both, the increase sounds pretty bad when expressed in a percentage  the production cost increased by 30  but this represented just  1.8M, or less than 3  of the revenue .And of course the company remained profitable  The pre-tax income was  25.5M and there was a tax benefit of  14.5M resulting in a net income of  40M or  1.17 per share.As explained in previous articles, the tax bill varies tremendously in Colombia as the quarterly tax bill takes the FX changes on the available tax pools into consideration. The normalized corporate tax rate in Colombia is 35  with a small surcharge based on the oil production  but Canacol barely produces any oil, so that surcharge is negligible .Based on a normalized 35  tax rate, the underlying net income would have been US 16.6M for an EPS of US 0.49. That s approximately C 0.65 based on the current exchange rate.The cash flow statement also is a little bit distorted by those tax changes. The total reported operating cash flow was a negative 24.4M USD and even after adding back the  58.1M in working capital changes, the  33.7M implied result was pretty low. This was caused by an effective high cash tax payment related to a restructuring at the end of the previous financial year. The normalized tax payment would have been around  9M for Q2, but Canacol had to fork over in excess of  24M. The tax payments should normalize in the next few quarters.This also means that if we really want to figure out the company s normalized cash flow, we should work with the normalized tax payments, indicating we should add about  15M in taxes paid that were not owed. That being said, we should also deduct  12M in lease and interest payments as those weren t included yet.The normalized operating cash flow result was approximately  36.7M during the second quarter.As expected, the capex remained very high as Canacol spent about  52M during the second quarter. This means the company was essentially free cash flow negative but I already explained in the previous articles Canacol is currently temporarily  overspending  on capex to increase its reserves. It's aiming for a reserves replacement ratio of in excess of 200  and you can t make an omelette without breaking eggs  The  wells.As shown above, the total capex excluding the new pipeline and excluding the exploration drilling would be around  57M. And that s less than  15M per quarter.Am I thrilled the company is spending this much on capex  Not really. But it is a  necessary evil  as the completion of the Jobo-Medellin pipeline will boost the demand for Canacol s natural gas and it will remain important to keep the 2P reserves at an attractively high level.Meanwhile, Canacol continues to pay a  on a quarterly basis. This is costing the company approximately US 6.5M per quarter  and if it wasn t for the aggressive drill campaign, this dividend would be very well covered . With Canacol s share price trading at just C 11.26, the dividend yield is approximately 9.2   subject to the Canadian dividend tax rate .I have a long position in Canacol, and despite the generous dividend payments, I'm not a very happy shareholder as the company s share price has been pretty disappointing and at this moment my total return is pretty much zero.That being said, the company continues to deliver on its promises and the sole point of criticism I had in the past few years  reserve expansion  is now being dealt with. I have been adding a little bit to my existing position in the past few days.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Devon Energy: Love Is In The Air,"Devon Energy's  stock has been beaten down this year as earnings have declined. We believe that the selloff is overdone. The company is trading at an attractive valuation and is set for positive earnings momentum going in H2 thanksFor those unfamiliar with the company, Devon Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the United States. Devon's operations are located in five geographic areas  the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin, Powder River Basin and Williston Basin.Assets located in the Delaware Basin are Devon's most valuable assets, andThis year Devon has been punished by the market and their stock is down much more than similar firms. A potential reason the market may be discounting Devon is  about the quality of their assets and outlook for growth, and fears about where we are in the cycle. The market may view competitors as being in a stronger position than Devon, but we believe even if that is the case the current discount is too wide.In their most recent quarter Devon earned  690 million down from  1.932 billion in the year ago period. This comparison is a little misleading as commodity prices spiked hard in the year ago period and were at relative lows during Q2 2023. This pattern of lower earnings is common among all oil and gas exposed companies. Thanks to higher commodity prices, the outlook for Devon's operating profitability is looking much better for the second half of this year than it did in the first. Analyst estimates are calling for  5.80 in earnings over the next twelve months. We will be referencing this  5.80 earnings estimate when talking about forward PE for valuation purposes.The decline in Devon's earnings does not warrant such poor year to date performance and the stock should be tracking their peers more closely.Devon's valuation has continued to get more attractive relative to peers and now trades at an attractive forward PE of 8.47. Most notable is their discount to Pioneer  as Pioneer is set to be acquired by Exxon . This sets the standard for what sector valuation multiples should trend towards, and it is likely that Devon's valuation trends higher to narrow that gap. Their valuation discount could make Devon an acquisition target. In the event of an acquisition it seems reasonable to assume that this discount would narrow considerably. could open the door to more M A in the oil and gas sector. Chevron  has been looking to get active in M A and apparently  acquiring Occidental . These two events are a sign that activity is set to heat up in the sector and company managements are looking to make moves from a position of strength. Now that Exxon has officially made their move, it puts pressure on other supermajors and midsized firms to strengthen their asset base or risk getting outcompeted. These competitive forces are even stronger in commodity markets than other areas of the economy, and as a result deal activity can spread like wildfire.Devon's assets are complementary to many US oil and natural gas operators as there is a bit of infrastructure overlap in the industry. Due to their discount to peers and attractive Delaware Basin assets, Devon is no doubt looking like an attractive acquisition target. This could help to put somewhat of a floor on the stock, and could stoke investor appetite for the sector. For Devon investors, the main benefit of M A activity heating up is that it adds optionality to what is already an attractive investment. In this way M A can be a rising tide that lifts all boats.Our bullish thesis on Devon isn't reliant on M A, and the possibility of M A is merely a bonus. We believe that Devon represents an attractive buying opportunity for a few reasons. The company is fundamentally undervalued relative to their peers. The outlook for oil and gas is improving into the end of the year. M A activity in the sector could favor Devon due to the nature of their assets and discounted valuation. At worst this could put a floor on the stock, and at best they get bought out at a premium to where the stock currently trades. Lastly, investing into Devon provides exposure to US-based oil and gas production, which can serve as a hedge against both geopolitical risks and inflation risks, helping to further diversify a portfolio.As we covered earlier, the price action for Devon has been lackluster this year. We believe that the price action will improve going into year-end as commodity prices firm up and M A speculation builds.Devon is trading at an attractive forward PE of 8.43. As we all know, this forward PE is a bit misleading due to the nature of the industry. Their actual earnings over the next 12 months could be much lower if commodity prices decline again, but they could also be much higher. The important thing investors should ask themselves is this  Does an investment in Devon help to diversify my portfolio and or meet my investment objectives  The variable component of the dividend means that Devon may not be the best choice for income investors. On the other hand, Devon provides more leverage to oil and gas prices than some other investments in the sector, and is a great way to act on a bullish thesis regarding oil and gas. We believe that Devon is a fundamentally attractive investment at these prices and can be a way for even the most tech focused investors to hedge their portfolio against geopolitical and inflation risks.We believe that Devon should trade at a forward PE of 10.8, which is 90  of Pioneer's forward PE of 12. This is based on our opinion that Pioneer has slightly better assets.Devon's free cash flow leaves a bit to be desired, but the company is planning to cut back on capital expenditures in the second half of the year. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry capital expenditures can be somewhat lumpy. We aren't too concerned about the relatively elevated price to free cash flow ratio.Looking at Devon's balance sheet we can see the company has done well to limit their debt levels. While we would prefer for the company to de-leverage further their long term debt is only about 1 year's worth of normalized profits, which is more than manageable. Considering the capital intensive nature of their business this is a reasonably conservative level of financial leverage.Devon is fundamentally undervalued, has earnings momentum going into H2 2023, and a clean balance sheet. There are multiple catalysts on the horizon that could help to bridge the gap between price and value, including possible M A. We believe that bullish investors can feel good about accumulating shares at these levels.A risk to the bullish thesis is the potential for oil and gas prices to decline to 2020 levels and remain at those prices for an extended period of time. This would financially challenge the entire sector and damage the fundamental thesis for Devon. That being said, we have a long-term outlook on oil and gas that calls for stable or increasing prices as global economic activity increases and debt begins to be monetized by governments around the world. Even in a worst-case scenario we think Devon would be fine over the long-term as their cost base can support much lower pricing, but in such a scenario the variable dividend would be much lower.We view the risk reward as being attractive. Investors should understand that there are always risks to investing in commodity sectors. Investments into commodity sectors are not suitable for all investors due to the inherent volatility.Devon is fundamentally undervalued and the stock could end up getting a boost into year end from improving earnings and M A speculation. We believe that current prices represent an attractive buying opportunity for investors who are bullish on oil and gas. Devon can be a long-term buy and hold regardless of what ultimately happens regarding M A.  UFD Capital Value Fund, LP has long exposure to DVN and XOM.

Devon Energy: Time To Go Bear Hunting,"Devon Energy  has flat out taken a beating over the last 30 days, falling nearly 19  since the beginning of September. This has occurred while other companies in its peer group have been able to treadI  to identify a trading pattern that developed for sudden price drops following earnings. I correctly predicted the dividend payout and response following earnings in Q2. In this article, I use the same methodology to show that DVN's recent price performance makes it undervalued today.I propose an explanation for investors looking to understand this price performance as well as a target price to accumulate shares. The current price creates a valuable value to price dislocation for DVN that can be extremelyI will be blunt. The current price decline for DVN is simply not rooted in logic in any sense of the word. Other producers who sell the exact same product do not show the same dismal share performance. For comparison, there is a 25  difference in price performance between DVN and FANG over the last three months  I did not count PXD due to the 10  spike in share price prior to this article being published . The last time I checked, both of these companies sell oil, NGLs, and natural gas into essentially the same market. What can possibly explain thisSimply put, WE are the cause of this. DVN has an extremely high exposure to individual investors versus institutional investors compared to its peer group. As a result, its investor base has shown to be more erratic to market events than typical.This is in part created by its share price relative to its peers and the lack of a major shareholder like Warren Buffett in the case of OXY. In the table below you can see that DVN has 1.5x to 3x the amount of public ownership exposure compared to Occidental, Pioneer, or Diamondback Energy. All data was obtained from the SA page for each company.I believe the recent price performance is the culmination of individual investors finally having enough after several quarters of falling dividends. While in my opinion this should not have been expected, the market as a whole never tends to respond rationally.To prove this thesis, the impact of this can again be seen in the volatility of Devon's share price. DVN exhibits a significantly higher beta than either of the other three companies.Most investors would call this a negative, but I view this as one of my fundamental differentiators for why I invest in DVN and not either of the other three stocks. Having a higher beta ensures two things. Higher highs and lower lows.This presents investors with the opportunity to invest at more attractive entry points, and also the opportunity to trim their profits when they potentially become overvalued. You may need a strong stomach at times, but this can be counteracted by having a clear vision of what price DVN represents for a solid value purchase. Thanks to a fairly simple business model and highly public commodity prices, this can be derived from some basic math., the average WTI price in Q3 was  82.30 barrel. This is up from  73.76 barrel in Q2, a very sizeable increase. Yet, DVN is now at the lowest price so far in 2023, even exceeding the low set in March during the brief banking 'crisis' that developed after the run on Silicon Valley Bank.Further, DVN has guided both an increase in production and a drop in capital expenses for the quarter and the remainder of the year. DVN has guided for capex to  at the midpoint. This is down from  1.036 billion in Q2. Production is guided to rise to 326,000 barrels of oil production per day, up from 323,000 barrels per day in Q2.Running these variables through my model and the slight increase in average natural gas price in Q3 of  2.59 MCF generates net earnings of about  1.07 billion. This is up  when DVN only registered net earnings of  698 million. This number was calculated using  provided by DVN for production, price realizations, taxes and expenses.If the base dividend remains unchanged  0.20 share , I expect the total dividend for Q3 to register between . This is a sizeable increase from the  0.49 share that was paid out in Q2. I expect the headlines of a 40  increase in the dividend will help push the share price higher towards a more reasonable valuation in line with its peers. At its current price, an annualized quarterly dividend of  0.70 share results in a 6.4  yield.More importantly, this level of income also leaves around  300 million that stays internal to DVN as its 50  portion of FCF. This will go toward rebuilding the cash reserves and being opportunistic with share repurchases. Right now, repurchasing shares looks to be a tremendous opportunity.The P E ratio of DVN shows that it is leading the pack in terms of value. DVN has the lowest P E of the four companies by a wide margin. Repurchasing shares at this level looks to be an excellent use of the company's dollars, even if it does delay the cash reserve rebuild.The market is very quick to both forget and react. The good news is that this is all following the plan laid out by Devon's management during the last quarter's earnings call. The CFO  Jeff Ritenour  very clearly laid out exactly what has happened so far to date.Investors should not be worried about the current price dip. This represents a unique opportunity in two ways. First, it represents an opportunity for the individual investor to start or grow their position in DVN at an attractive price. Second, management has the opportunity to increase every shareholder's ownership stake by retiring more shares. Every shareholder will be getting a bigger slice of the pie thanks to the mispricing.We all need to remember that energy is a cyclical industry. As such, to determine relative value, we must have a rough gauge for what the average of that cycle is. It is very apparent that OPEC  desires to maintain a price floor of  80 barrel. To build in some protection, I will assume that the cycle average is  78 barrel.Under the same capital spend model, this hypothetical average price yields a dividend of approximately  0.60 share. A highly cyclical stock also needs to be highly rewarding to make tolerating the volatility worthwhile as an investment. My personal metric is to achieve no less than a 5  dividend at average market conditions. I can work backward from my payout projection of  0.60 share to derive a conservative mid-cycle price of  48 share. This shows that DVN is being valued at a price that is 10  undervalued compared to a fair mid-cycle price.With all the negative sentiment, there is a tangible risk of breaking through support levels for the stock. Fellow SA Analyst,  a bearish thesis that identifies that DVN is currently sitting near its lower support level of  44 share. Should the stock break through this level of support, there could be a near term shock to the share price.I have laid out my bullish case for Devon over a long term horizon. I acknowledge that, as pointed out by JR Research, the irrationality of the stock market may overpower logic here in the near term. It is something investors should at least be cognizant of, both from a risk perspective and also for another potential buying opportunity.Being the lowest share price of your peer group can be a two-edged sword. It can help a company obtain slightly higher multiples, but can also leave its share price susceptible to impatience and irrationality. I believe the investor behavior being displayed over the last three months is certainly the latter of the two scenarios.Devon Energy has been oversold as a result of a high percentage of individual investor ownership and being the lowest share price in the independent producer peer group. This allows the stock to be extremely volatile and has created a buying opportunity. I view the stock as at least 10  undervalued compared to mid-cycle oil prices.Using known commodity prices in Q3, I have shown how the company is projected to produce solid earnings and even increase its variable dividend by approximately 40  versus the prior quarter. As a result, I rate DVN as a buy under  48 share.Time to start hunting the bears.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Enphase: Top Solar Energy Leader On The Verge Of A Huge Bottom,"Investors in leading solar technology company Enphase Energy, Inc.  have been battered since ENPH topped out in December 2022. The sellers then went on a rampaging run that saw ENPH falling nearly 68  through its October 2023 lows, re-testingThat zone has held ENPH's long-term uptrend since May 2021. As such, I'm heartened to observe constructive buying sentiments in October, suggesting dip buyers have returned. However, it's still too early to ascertain whether ENPH buyers could muster a sustained reversal following its steep pullback. Notwithstanding that caution, I believe there are reasons to be optimistic.As seen above, ENPH is no longer overvalued relative to its sector peers. Seeking Alpha Quant assigned ENPH a  C-  valuation grade, suggesting it can be considered within the fair value zone. Furthermore, given its best-in-class  A  growth and profitability grade, theHowever, the growth normalization over the past year, resulting in its worst battering in recent times, is justified. Its weak guidance from its  earnings call contributed to its  D  earnings revisions grade, as it underperformed analysts' estimates.With ENPH still up by nearly 97  on a 5Y total return CAGR basis, I believe it's clear that buyers have not abandoned ship. Late buyers who chased its late 2022 highs are the ones that have been hurt, but not early dip buyers who bought well before its surge from its 2017 lows.Therefore, it's opportune to assess whether the current levels are reasonable for investors to consider returning, or should they wait for more clarity from management  Accordingly, Enphase is scheduled to report its third-quarter or  on October 26. I believe buyers have already priced in a relatively tepid Q3 release, given the continued decline through ENPH's October 2023 lows.Furthermore, analysts' estimates indicate Enphase could report negative revenue growth over the next three quarters, likely reflecting the inventory destocking challenges in its downstream customers. Hobbled by the high cost of capital with the Fed's unprecedented rate hikes, the market conditions could remain hostile for Enphase. However, with analysts having turned more cautious, I believe it sets the bar lower for management to cross, providing higher potential upside opportunities if the company reports a less-feared release.I believe there are reasons to be optimistic. Enphase remains a high-growth stock, as I highlighted earlier. It's operating within a secular growth market with growth potential outside of the US. In addition, it's no longer a one-trick pony selling just microinverters, but a suite of integrated solar solutions. As such, it should strengthen its competitive advantages.While the rivalry with Tesla  in solar technology needs to be observed carefully, the scale of Enphase's high potential growth drivers should help mitigate some of the competitive headwinds. Coupled with its rock-solid profitability grade, it should support the company's innovation efforts to stay in the front seat of the leading pack, fending off challenges from Tesla and other rivals.Moreover, ENPH isn't your 50x P E stock any longer. It last traded at a forward adjusted P E of 25.8x or a free cash flow yield of 4.3 . Given its high-growth profile, I believe it's reasonable for buyers to return to defend it from sliding further from the current levels. The question is whether the price action indicates such robust defense.I gleaned that ENPH buyers have returned this month since they tried to defend against a further slide in May 2023 but failed.Moreover, it is consistent with ENPH's bottom since May 2021, with firm buying support expected to defend ENPH's long-term uptrend bias at the  110 zone. However, I must caution that losing the  110 support level decisively is a red flag and could lead to much further downside volatility if buyers fail to hold it robustly. Investors may want to consider appropriate risk management strategies to deal with that possibility.Otherwise, if ENPH holds the level through the rest of October, it seems likely that the worst is likely over, as ENPH is no longer overvalued.Have constructive commentary to improve our thesis  Spotted a critical gap in our view  Saw something important that we didn't  Agree or disagree  Comment below with the aim of helping everyone in the community to learn betterJR Research is a seasoned investor with a background in economics.

A  them a week later, in an eerily prescient call, citing  Completion Weakness.  Ya think  Ok, I don't want to get too snarky here, but sometimes the million dollar prima donnas making  consensus calls  get under my slicker suit.Since then, the stock has traded in a rising channel pattern, breaking through support at the old resistance line at  23.84 on June 28th. Recently on Aug, 2nd it rallied to  27.50 before collapsing back to  25.26 on the same day. It is now trading higher above the resistance line, presumably on the strength of oil prices moving into the mid- 80's and the trend toward higher offshore day rates. The trend here looks bullish to me, let's see if we can justify the prices on fundamentals.In this article, we will review  and see if we can revise our opinion of the company.The company's signature Reservoir Description business has suffered in recent years due to a lack of exploratory drilling. I don't think there is any question we are in a new offshore development cycle. The question is, is it likely to fatten CLB's coffersThe best way to begin a story is at the beginning. Before Core Labs gets a call for reservoir description services, what has to happen  The answer is seismic data needs to be collected or accessed. Then it needs to be processed internally by an oil company. If things look good an exploratory prospect is generated. A rig company gets a call, and in the success case cores and fluid samples are taken. And, then Core Labs gets a call.Since 2013, the seismic industry has collapsed from about a dozen competitors with about 60 vessels sounding the marine depths to about 17 being marketed today. There are two major offshore seismic data collectors and only one is publicly traded. Petroleum Geo Services , is one  trading today at  0.74 per share  and Shearwater Geoservices,  a private Norwegian company  is the other.It is somewhat instructive to me that Seeking Alpha no longer publishes conference calls or financial data on PGS. Nothing in the chart above suggests an impending renaissance for offshore geophysical surveys.Now this early upstream exploration activity is not the whole story for CLB, reservoir description work is on the increase as has been noted in various calls. The source could be coring for stepouts on existing data sets or the MultiClient work subscribed to by a number of companies.Schlumberger  CEO Olivier le Peuch, and CFO Stephane Biguet commented in their  on the re-emergence of exploration activity and   emphasis addedNow let's compare that with commentary from the .As the global energy transition evolves, PGS expects global energy consumption to continue to increase over the longer term, with oil and gas remaining an important part of the energy mix. Offshore reserves will be vital for future energy supply and support demand for marine seismic services. The seismic market is recovering on the back of increased focus on energy security, several years of low investment in new oil and gas supplies, and higher oil and gas prices. Offshore investments in oil and gas exploration and production are expected to increase in 2023.Now let's hear from Larry Bruno, CEO of Core LabsTo summarize the above quotes, SLB notes an increase in reservoir performance revenue of 9  sequentially, which is pretty dramatic on a run rate basis. Both PGS and CLB report increasing revenues on the exploration side of things, and notably for PGS the portion coming from Contract revenue is on the increase. For CLB, 10  YoY largely correlates to what SLB is saying, and I would offer, anytime you are keeping pace with SLB, you are on the right track.I think there is a solid case for CLB's revenues to be on the increase in this critical area.On to CLB's Production Enhancement segment. Production Enhancement operations, which are focused on complex completions in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs in the U.S., as well as conventional projects across the globe, posted second quarter 2023 revenue of  44,500,000, down approximately 8  sequentially, and flat year-over-year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was  5,500,000, while operating income, ex-items, was  4,400,000, yielding operating margins of 10 , down 270 basis points sequentially  however, year-over-year, operating margins expanded 120 basis points. The sequential decline was primarily associated with lower international bulk product sales and a decrease in U.S. land completion activity.This segment's underperformance was the focus of a  - Scott Gruber - downgrade in Q2, as previously noted. Quoting from the article here.We have discussed CLB's business units in some detail in , so be sure and look those up if CLB interests you.CLB's core financials aren't hard to parse. Revenue is flat QoQ, and up about 5.8  from the same period a year ago. Reservoir Performance carried the ball with a 4  sequential and 10  YoY revenue increased to  83 mm. Production Enhancement was down sequentially and YoY at  44.5 mm. Operating income rose to  18 mm thanks to the two one-off items previously mentioned. Long term debt has been rising, ending the quarter at  182 mm, up sequentially and 5.9  YoY. Cash on the books sits at  26 mm. Free cash is running at  12 mm run rate, exceeding capex of  4 mm and divs of  2.6 mm comfortably and leaving  5.4 mm for debt paydown. CLB faces no short term liquidity issues.Core continues to anticipate a multi-year international recovery supported by increased spending on exploration in many regions across the globe and expanded development of existing fields to fortify crude-oil and natural gas reserves. This underlies Core's outlook for continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity, with ongoing projects across the globe, most notably across the Middle East, South Atlantic Margin and West Africa..The risk for CLB is the entry point. I was leery of them at  20ish, I am even more leery of them at  26. Entry points are everything in making money in oil and gas and OFS stocks. Get in too high, and you may have a decade to think about it.The six analysts that cover Core Laboratories Inc. have it rated a hold. Price targets range from  19 to  31, with a median of  21. Either of those two lower numbers would probably make an acceptable entry point in today's market.The company is currently trading at  and that's outside the boundaries for us.Summary  Long term, Core Laboratories Inc. is a solid performer with a rising market and we'd like to have a chunk of it. We will be patient and hope that a better entry point comes around, while understanding it may not this cycle. Core Labs remains a hold.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cenovus Energy Inc: Not Getting A Lot Of Value Here,"Cenovus Energy Inc  hasn't been that consistent with the dividend yield for investors. It has fallen quite a lot since the highs of  0.25 per share in late 2014. It is gaining quite quickly over the last couple ofCVE and its subsidiary companies are actively involved in the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, both within Canada and internationally. The company's operations are categorized into several segments, namely Oil Sands, Conventional, Offshore, Canadian Manufacturing, and U.S. Manufacturing. Within the Oil Sands segment, CVE is engaged in the development and production of bitumen and heavy oil, primarily in the northern regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The company's notable assets in this segment include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake, and Sunrise projects.CVE enjoys a noteworthy advantage compared to many of its competitors, primarily stemming from its thermal business. The reason is that the segment and expansion of it often necessitate a significant amount of capital upfront, and afterward the depreciation of the assets is in a way protecting against cash flows. We see this by CVE having positive FCF for nearly a decade, all the whilst the net income has had some years of negative results. Compared to Imperial Oil Limited  which had negative FCF in 2020, CBE outperformed here as they have remained cash flow positive since 2016. In this sector, significant upfront cash investments are typically required before production commences. Consequently, there exists a depreciation component that provides a level of protection for cash flow a feature less common in the unconventional energy sector.This unique characteristic means that thermal companies often generate substantial cash flow, even in scenarios where they might incur losses in other aspects of their operations. This can be a key cause for the higher p fcf that CVE is receiving right now, supplying an 18  premium to peers and the sector. Basing an investment on that would likely result in a hold, as you wouldn't be getting a good and appealing enough price to justify a buy.Over the last decade, the asset base has significantly increased to over  40 billion. This has resulted in stronger FCF for the company and has ultimately ensured that CVE can grow the dividend organically thanks to the amount of cash it generates. The company is committed to its base dividend for investors, however the net debts may be. When on the lower end though at around  4 billion, the management has made it clear they aim to return 100  of the earnings to shareholders. The net debts are at  6.9 billion right now, so it lands in the middle of the capital allocations strategy.CVE boasts top-tier that come with impressively long reserve lives, setting it apart in the industry. While many shale companies are gradually depleting their Tier 1 drilling assets, CVE stands strong with nearly 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves. To put it into perspective, this reserve base equates to roughly 31 years of resource sustainability, and this calculation doesn't even account for the potential of consistently increasing discoveries that could further extend this timeline, as noted in the investor presentation. With this sort of asset base, I think that CVE will continue to do very well and capitalize on appreciating commodity prices given the fundamental demand for both natural gas and especially .Valuation-wise, CVE is somewhat below the average it has had the last 5 years. With a median p e of 14 right now it still has a decent premium to other peers and companies in the broader energy sector. Given that most companies in the sector around 10x earnings, I find that CVE offers little immediate upside here. The dividend yield isn't that high and the buybacks aren't substantial enough either. Justifying a buy here seems difficult. What I think may carry the most weight though in terms of the valuation is the p fcf right now. Given that the earnings can be negative for the business, but the FCF has remained positive throughout the years, I would be getting my fair value from here. The energy sector trades at an average p fcf of 4.79 right now on a FWD basis. I find this to be the fair value, and that leaves a nearly 18  drop in the share price for CVE before I think it's appealing. The reason I base it on the sector is that getting a similar price or even a discount leaves a more immediate upside. In the case of a broader market correction, I think that CVE may have more room to fall because of this premium being applied. It's a personal preference, but it does mean my fair price range is between  16 -  17 for the company right now.As we have discussed, the dividend of the company seems sustainable right now, given that it's far lower than some years ago. At WTI prices of  45, the base dividend is sustainable, and as we know, we are more than 2x higher than that right now, approaching  100 even. Investors should be keeping an eye on the coming reports from the company and see if there is an acceleration of the buybacks for the shares. Given that oil prices have climbed quickly, there is a chance that CVE may be able to capitalize on this and return larger sums to shareholders. But time will tell if that is true, and maintaining a neutral rating now is the best risk-adverse approach.CVE has in the last few years prioritized more and more to maintaining a high cash position, which I find very positive. It now sits at  1.6 billion, up from  297 million in 2020. This improved state will enable CVE to make more strategic expansions and acquisitions if they see fit. The total assets have also seen a lot of growth, more than doubling since 2016.Debts have not seen such a drastic shift over the last few years, which is positive. They sit just above  6 billion and with CVE generating quite a strong EBITDA still, I don't see the debt levels the company has built up as something that would seriously hurt their expansion plans. In quite news, it was announced that CVE is increasing its tender offer for certain outstanding series of notes. The company announced it had increased the previous Pool 2 maximum from  250 million to  500 million instead.Cenovus currently lacks exposure to the rapidly expanding global liquefied natural gas  LNG  market, which is known for its robust profitability. This absence of involvement in the thriving LNG sector might lead to a comparatively lower valuation of the company and consequently, reduced potential returns for its investors. However, it's worth noting that CVE stock price has experienced a notable uptick in recent months. This rapid ascent could potentially signify an impending correction in the market, introducing the possibility of downside risk for investors who have seen substantial gains during this period.CVE has dedicated substantial efforts to reduce its debt burden over the past few years, a strategy that investors have been closely monitoring. The expectation is for the company to sustain this trend of debt reduction. However, should CVE encounter challenges in meeting these expectations, it could introduce additional risk to the investment landscape. In particular, a high leverage ratio in a period of elevated interest rates can be a cause for concern, potentially impacting the company's financial stability and valuation. Right now, the net debt EBITDA of 0.98. This is quite low and is under the expectations as well that CVE manages to continue paying down the debt levels and that EBITDA remains high. In 2020 the EBITDA was under  400 million. This was the result of lower commodity prices, which if it happens again could lead to a higher leverage ratio for CVE and in turn a lower valuation to reflect this.CVE has a significantly lower dividend yield right now than a decade ago, but it seems the market is thinking it will appreciate quickly as well as the buybacks. However, I don't see the immense potential that some others may, and given the premium it trades at it leaves little immediate upside potential. Without trading at a risk-free rate, I won't be viewing CVE as a buy currently, but rather a hold instead.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Trane Technologies: Powering A Sustainable And Lucrative Future,"Our current investment thesis isTrane Technologies plc  isTrane s share price performance has been exceptional since the company was spun off, gaining over 180  and significantly outperforming the wider market. This has been driven by a continuation of its strong financial trajectory.Presented above are Trane's financial results.Trane s revenue has grown at a modest 3  CAGR, with broadly consistent gains YoY. The vast majority of this growth has been achieved organically, with product and geographical expansion.Trane is a global leader in providing climate control solutions  HVAC . The company offers a wide range of products and services, such as air conditioners, heat pumps, furnaces, controls, building automation systems, and refrigeration solutions. It serves various sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional customers. The company is essentially a pure-play climate control business, with exposure to sustainable technologies and the future direction of energy consumption.Trane has a global footprint, serving customers in numerous countries. Currently, the majority of its revenue, and core market, is the Americas, followed by EMEA and APAC. This international presence allows it to tap into diverse markets and respond to regional demand variations, while maximizing its returns from product development and industry expertise.Trane provides comprehensive aftermarket services, including maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. This helps build long-term relationships with customers and generates recurring revenue, which is incredibly important given the cyclical nature of large-scale capital expenditure associated with HVAC. This has allowed Trane to create a smoother upward revenue trajectory, reducing volatility.A key criticism of the industry is its energy usage, as HVAC systems contribute a significant amount to global emissions. There is pressure across many industries to reduce their carbon footprint, with pressures slowly creeping toward this industry. Trane differentiates itself through its commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency. Their products and services are designed to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and help customers meet environmental regulations and certifications. The company has yet to reach zero, which is inevitably the end goal but is significantly more environmentally friendly relative to the industry as a whole.The company has set ambitious sustainability goals, including carbon neutrality and reducing customer carbon emissions by one gigaton by 2030. These commitments align with societal expectations and could significantly enhance its brand among the public and corporates. We believe this will be a major value driver to win clients, in addition to the wider pressures on the industry.The company invests heavily in R D to develop cutting-edge technologies and solutions, much of which is aimed at reducing its carbon footprint currently, as well as other factors such as efficiency, size, and quality. This focus on innovation enables Trane to offer a market-leading offering to the industry. We consider the company s offering to be compelling, with a future-proof approach due to its focus on sustainability.As the following illustrates, Trane is well-regarded for its sustainability efforts. It is worth reiterating again that potential customers will see this with extreme positivity, as they themselves are pressured to reduce their carbon footprint, which for many location-based businesses is significantly driven by HVAC systems.Management s current strategy revolves around the following three factorsWe are extremely positive about how Trane is run by the Management team and their strategy going forward. It is a simple approach but that s what makes it great. The company is not seeking to set the world on fire but instead do what it does well, exploit megatrends, and operate in an efficient manner through incremental improvements.Management believes shareholder value will come from the following four factorsTrane competes with other leading businesses within the HVAC industry. Key competitors include Johnson Controls , Daikin Industries , Mitsubishi Electric , and Lennox International , among others.Increasing regulations and policies aimed at reducing energy consumption and emissions are expected to continue in the coming decade due to climate change. Trane energy-efficient HVAC and refrigeration systems positions the business perfectly to be a market leader in this segment.Additionally, global warming and greater weather variability inherently increases the demand for heating and cooling services, contributing to strong demand within the residential segment, as well as continued growth in the commercial and industrial segments. This is why its clean focus works perfectly within the industry, as the business is fighting and benefiting from climate change while minimizing its contribution to it. Management estimates the current contribution to GHG Emissions is a staggering 25 , representing a substantial market it can capture.Although this is the biggest  megatrend , there are a number of other factors that will drive strong demand in the coming years. Such factors includeThese factors will all contribute to varying degrees of enhanced growth, with all factors inherently long-term in nature. When considered in conjunction with the broader Sustainability and Climate change factors, we consider an HSD growth rate to be achievable as a minimum.In conjunction with these industry growth drivers, we expect Trane to also maintain  the basics , namelyTrane s margins have impressively improved given the maturity of the industry, with EBTIDA-M increasing from 12  in FY13 to 17  in the LTM period. This has been driven by an operational overhaul by Management, with the belief that further improvements are possible. We are hesitant to suggest this is possible to a material level within a 3-5 year period, although 1-2  is reasonable. Given the level of innovation and its existing market position, we do not see any risks to maintaining its current level.Presented above is Trane's most recent quarterly results.The company has maintained its strong trajectory into Q2, with net revenue growth of  11  and a 1ppt increase in EBITDA-M. This is an impressive performance given the current macro conditions, which we expect to act as a drag on growth as infrastructure investment is discouraged by inflationary pressures and lending costs. This has been driven by impressive growth in APAC, as well as the delivery of healthy bookings across the Americas and EMEA.While the dip in Americas  bookings is slightly concerning  -8 , we note backlog is  3x historical norms, implying an inherently elevated position. With EMEA and APAC continuing to remain strong, with backlog  70  of historical norms, Trane s current trajectory appears sustainable.Trane s cash flows are attractive, moving positively in line with EBITDA-M. Further, we see some scope for improvement, as the business has seen inventory turnover fall below its decade average, and noticeably so. This is potentially a reflection of slowing demand  at least relative to Management s expectation , although this should be monitored further to see ascertain if this is a sustained trend given growth is currently very strong.Due to the strong cash flows, the use of debt has been limited, allowing the business to commit cash flows to distributions. The business has aggressively repurchased shares, with excess cash returned to shareholders, alongside dividend payments that have grown at an impressive 11  CAGR. Given cash has fallen below its decade average relative to revenue, we believe a slowdown in buybacks is inevitable, although dividend growth should continue.Presented above is Wall Street's consensus view on the coming 5 years.Analysts are forecasting revenue growth of 6  into FY27F, with margins remaining broadly flat. This appears reasonable in our view, with the scope for improved growth in the coming years based on our analysis above. In conjunction with this, the growth rate achieved post-FY17 has been noticeably higher, suggesting there is a recent track record of delivering an improved rate.Margin improvement is always difficult to achieve without a significant moat or transformational operational exercise  which has already been completed , with operational improvements usually offset by defensive actions to protect its competitive position. For this reason, we believe an EBITDA-M of 16-18  is realistic in the next 5 years, although at the top-end, Trane could achieve an improvement of 1-2   at an EBITDA-M level .Presented above is a comparison of Trane's growth and profitability to the average of its industry, as defined by Seeking Alpha  35 companies .Trane performs well relative to its peers, although not necessarily to the level one would expect given the quality business model. Trane s revenue growth has lagged the wider market, at both a 3Y and 5Y basis, reflecting a degree of market maturity and poor strategic efforts to grow the business further. Although it has yet to be suggested given how bullish we are of the business model, it could be argued greater reinvestment in the business is required. This could either be R D or M A based on what is expected to generate the best ROI.Margins are the company s area of strength, yet the business underwhelms  compared to our high expectations . Its EBITDA-M is slightly below the industry average, as is its FCF. The only noticeable positive is Trane s ROE, which is comfortably higher, owing to strong buybacks alongside its dividend payments.Trane is currently trading at 18x LTM EBITDA and 15x NTM EBITDA. This is a premium to its historical average.A premium to the company s historical average appears reasonable in our view, primarily due to the various industry megatrends that Trane is expected to further benefit from. Additionally, we believe its focus on sustainability is the correct approach, which will yield outsized growth in its core markets.Further, the company is trading at a 20-30  premium to its peers on an LTM EBITDA, NTM PE, and NTM FCF basis. Again, we believe this is justifiable as within the next 5 years, we see Trane s growth rate increasing above or in line with the industry s 5Y average  8.8 , while its EBITDA-M will again reach the average, if not exceed. Given the megatrends, we believe Trane s improvements will outstrip that of the peer group, while its strong ROE will mean outsized shareholder returns.At a NTM FCF yield of 5.4   lower than its historical average , the stock is not cheap, and means a degree of the upward trajectory is already priced in. This said, we still think there is some value here at the current price.The risks to our current thesis areTrane is a fantastic business in our view. The company has grown well in recent years, with megatrends expected to maintain Trane s heightened trajectory for an extended period of time. underpinning the improved demand is operational and commercial excellence, with quality product development and a focus on margin improvement. We particularly like the focus on sustainable products, which we believe will be a critical value driver in the years to come.Although Trane is not cheap, we believe its improved trajectory will allow for greater returns in the years to come.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Why Diamondback Energy Will Be The Next Permian M&A Target,"I predict that Diamondback Energy  will be the next publicly traded tier-1 M A target in the Permian and that ConocoPhillips  will be the likely acquirer. While Reuters  this morning that COPYou already know that the oil patch has seen a plethora of big deals since the pandemic hit in 2020 - and even before then with Occidental Petroleum's  purchase of Anadarko. ConocoPhillips was an early mover with its well-timed purchases of Concho ResourcesAs shown in the graphic above, this flurry of M A activity leaves only a few top-tier public Permian producers left, and I list them in the table below according to enterprise value  EV  per Seeking AlphaAs you can see, both OXY and EOG would be very large transactions - significantly bigger than either of the recent deals for Pioneer and Hess  HES , which only Exxon and Chevron had the ability to engineer.That leaves Devon and Diamondback, of which FANG is clearly the superior Permian play. And that's the reason COP - already a large-scale tier-1 producer in the Permian - will likely be the buyer.For long-term energy investors, EOG's pristine balance sheet - which is actually, net cash positive - bodes very well for investors in terms of dividends and share buybacks. That's especially the case given the current relatively strong O G commodity price environment.The following graphic, taken from a recent , shows the company's footprint in the Permian. FANG has large leaseholds in both the Midland and Delaware BasinsAs you can see, FANG has a huge inventory of long-lateral drilling locations  5,400  in the Midland Basin and 3,000-plus in the Delaware Basin.COP, as a result of its M A activity, also has large and excellent positions in the Permian, as shown from these two slides taken from an Together, the two companies would be a Permian powerhouse, with over 1.3 million acres and production, as of Q2COP  .FANG  .Combined  1,158,900 boe d.Such a combination would vault COP ahead of the Exxon Pioneer combination in terms of No. 1 Permian production, with more than double OXY's Q2 Permian production of .The combined companies would also significantly extend the life span of COP's already huge Permian inventory - out to as long as three, or perhaps even four, decades.However, Diamondback would be a large fish for COP to swallow. Note COP's previous two deals, for Concho and Shell's assets, were both under  10 billion  9.7 billion and  9.2 billion, respectively . However, the free cash flow from these deals is exactly why COP is now big enough to tackle FANG.COP's current market cap is  144.2 billion, with net debt of  9.6 billion, or an EV about 4.2x that of FANG. So such a deal is definitely doable. And the fact that FANG generates strong free cash flow  547 million in Q2  and is a very disciplined operator adds to its M A attractiveness.Meantime, FANG shareholders would get a much more diversified production profile because COP has significant  and growing ...  exposure to global LNG prices as well as strong Brent-based production in Alaska  see .I never advise investors to invest on the basis of takeover potential. In this case, the suggested deal could obviously not come to fruition for a variety of reasons, primarily that someone else could make an offer for FANG or that COP could decide to go through with an offer for CrownRock or some other company. In addition, the relatively high interest rate environment means such a deal - like most deals of late - would likely be an all-stock transaction. That being the case, COP CEO Ryan Lance might not want to take on what would be a relatively large and dilutive all-stock transaction.Energy investors have likely not seen the end of M A in the oil patch. However, the number of publicly traded tier-1 Permian operators has shrunk dramatically over the past few years. FANG remains a standout - and if the company does not merge with EOG, it will get squeezed by the bigger players and will likely be the next big tier-1 company to be taken out. COP, with its overlapping footprint in both the Midland and Delaware Basins, would be the most likely acquirer in my opinion.I'll end with a six-month stock price chart of FANG, which has risen sharply on the combination of improved O G prices as well as implied takeover potentialHowever, note the recent drop in FANG's share price after Chevron announced its decision to buy HES  as did OXY . The thought there being both Exxon and Chevron now have their hands full, taking the two biggest companies out of further M A transactions  at least for the short term . The biggest company left is obviously ConocoPhillips. And, as I wrote previously on Seeking Alpha, the only rationale for COP CEO Ryan Lance not to reward shareholders with much  much...  higher dividends over the past year or two is because he was keeping his powder dry to make another big acquisition. FANG certainly fits the bill. Yet for FANG shareholders, and like the recent PXD and HES transactions, I doubt COP would make a bid for much more than a 10  premium above where FANG is currently trading.

Cenovus Energy: Preferred Shares Could Yield 8-12% Upon Reset,"Cenovus Energy   is a large integrated oil and gas producer in Canada. The company produced in excess of 700,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day while its downstream throughput averaged in excessIn this article, I will explain why I think some of the preferred shares issued by Cenovus could be interesting to own. In Canada, most fix-to-float preferred shares lock in a preferred dividend for a period of five years and that makes some of the preferred share issues quite appealing.I won't go into too much detail on the financial results as the preferred equity isThe company reported a total revenue of C 12.2B in the second quarter of the year - I will use the company's Q2 results as these are based on a US 75 Brent and a C 74 WCS oil price. The oil and bitumen prices are substantially higher and were higher throughout the third quarter so while I'm expecting a strong result in the third quarter, I'm using the Q2 results for a more conservative approach.As you can see above, the company reported a net profit of C 866M which represented an EPS of C 0.45. Interestingly, Cenovus did not record any preferred share dividends from the reported net income, and after deducting the C 9M in preferred dividend payments, the net income attributable to the shareholders of Cenovus was C 857M, as you can see below.That's important  It means that, at US 75 WTI and C 75 WCS and the refineries not running at full capacity, the company needed just 1  of its net income to cover the preferred dividend payments. Expressed in a percentage, the preferred dividend coverage ratio was 9,600 .A second element I like to check is the asset coverage ratio. As of the end of June, Cenovus had almost C 54B in assets and the equity component of the balance sheet was C 27.3B. The company also had C 2.2B in cash while its long-term debt totalled C 8.5B for a net debt position of C 6.4B  rounded .As of the end of June, the company also had 36 million preferred shares outstanding. All preferred shares have a principal value of C 25 per share, which means Cenovus had about C 900M in preferred equity on the balance sheet. This means that there's about C 26.3B in equity ranked junior to the preferred shares and even if you would exclude the C 2.9B in goodwill on the balance sheet, there's in excess of C 23B in tangible equity on the balance sheet that ranks junior to the preferred shares.Long story short, I'm very happy with the preferred dividend coverage ratio and the asset coverage ratio.I used to keep track of the preferred shares of Husky Energy, but those shares had pretty low yields when the interest rates on the financial markets were low. This has obviously changed and although the underlying company is now much larger  when Cenovus acquired Husky Energy, the preferred shares simply remained outstanding  and the higher interest rates on the financial markets create opportunities.I'm keeping a close tab on the Series 1   and Series 3 preferred shares  issued by Cenovus. Both issues currently have relatively low preferred dividends but the next reset dates are coming close. As the image below shows, the Series 3 will reset first, at the end of next year, while the Series 1 will reset in Q1 2026.Looking at the Series 3, those preferred shares are trading at C 19.25  the principal value is C 25 per preferred share  and that series currently yields 4.69  or C 1.1725 per share per year. And based on the current share price, the current yield is approximately 6.1 . Not bad, but also not great.However, at the end of 2024, the preferred dividend rate of those preferred shares will reset to the five-year Canada government bond yield plus a mark-up of 313 basis points. The  is currently trading at 4.15  which means that in the current situation, the preferred dividend on the Series 3 would reset to 4.15    3.13    7.28 . This represents C 1.82 per year and would result in a yield of 9.5  based on the current preferred share price.We also can run the numbers from a different angle. The question could be  how high should the five-year Canada bond yield be to generate 7  on my investment after the reset date .  That's an easy one. The required preferred dividend is C 1.3475 per share per year  7  of C 19.25 . That represents 5.39  of the C 25 principal value and considering we know the mark-up is 313 bp, as long as the five-year Canada government bond yield exceeds 2.26 , you will earn at least 7  on your investment in the 2025-2030 period. And that's a bet I'm willing to take. Even if the 5Y bond yield drops to 3 , you would achieve an 8  preferred dividend yield based on a cost basis of C 19.25.We see a similar outcome for the Series 1 preferred shares although that one could be trickier because of the lower mark-up. While the mark-up is 313 bp for the Series 3, the Series 1 has a mark-up of only 173 bp. Those preferred shares are currently trading at C 11.78 for a yield of 5.5 .We can now run the numbers based on similar assumptions. The current five-year government bond yield is 4.15 . But let's assume a long-term yield of 3 . This means that in Q1 2026, the preferred dividend yield would reset to 3    1.73    4.73  or C 1.18 share. Which would mean that based on the current share price, you could actually lock in a yield of 10  for the five-year period starting in 2026. Applying the current five-year bond yield would result in a yield of close to 12.5 .And due to the low mark-up, the odds of Cenovus calling this specific series are pretty low. As all other series of preferred shares have higher mark-ups, it would make more sense for Cenovus to call the more expensive preferred shares first.And that's why income-focused investors should most definitely have a closer look at the preferred shares issued by Cenovus. I do like the Series 1 because I'm locking in a 5.5  yield until Q1 2026 and the interest rates would have to collapse completely before I would not see a substantial yield increase. If I'm aiming for a 7  yield from Q1 2026 on, all I need is a 5 year government bond yield of 1.57 . And I like those odds.Additionally, even if the company would see its preferred dividend payments increase by 50 , it would still be paying less than C 15M per quarter and less than C 60M per year on preferred dividends. At the same time, the total face value of the preferred shares is C 900M while the current market value is less than C 650M. And perhaps Cenovus Energy should try to buy back some of its preferred shares before their respective reset dates.I currently have no position in Cenovus Energy nor in its preferred shares but I may initiate a long position in the Series 1 preferred shares in anticipation of a preferred dividend reset in 2026.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Energy Transfer Is Doing Just Fine,"Dear fellow InvestorsLast night's    for  was, at first blush, a bit disappointing to me, not so much because of the small performance miss due to lower natural gas  NG  andFor some time, we have been watching ET management discuss how they were focused on reducing debt leverage as they seek a credit upgrade. For some time, we have been listening to management discuss how they are imposing strict criteria to any new project or acquisition they consider, suggesting everything will have to help ET deleverage while also being accretive to cash flow.Last night, the first time I listened to the Conference Call, II didn't have a problem hearing that ET was boosting capital expenditure expectations to  2 -  3 billion annually, but I didn't like hearing management suggest that they really wanted to do at least  3 billion. Sure, I love the idea of  3 billion in new investments generating 13  returns, allowing ET to grow EBITDA by roughly  400 million per year, but what I really wanted to hear was how ET was going to let  leverage drop below 4.0x  in my dreams . I felt that management's desire to grow conflicted with the way I might manage the company if I was in fact the King or CEO.Management expressed confidence and self satisfaction with their recent acquisitions, they even suggested the Enable deal was operating far above their S4 prior expectations, over 45  better in fact. Management also sounded very confident that the more recent Lotus deal was also going to greatly exceed prior plans. But while hearing these glowing remarks, I couldn't help but feel that one or two recent deal successes certainly do not tell the whole story. I felt I'd rather have heard more about a humble desire to pay down more debt and raise the distribution on the units faster.Feeling grumpy and unsure, I decided to listen to the call a 2nd time and take more notes. Early on, I realized that management did in fact explain that they were driving the leverage down to the  lower level  of the 4.0 to 4.5 range. This was new. Previously, management always emphasized that they wanted to reach this range and then reconsider what to do next. Now they were more or less committing to the 4.0x level. Then, later in last night's call, when asked about whether they would allow the leverage ratio to rise above the 4.0 to 4.5 range if an attractive acquisition required it, management said  no, they did not intend to allow the ratio to rise above this range   more or less, I paraphrased .Then I listened more closely to their discussion about Lake Charles and the LNG opportunity. While determined to do everything they can to move the project forward, management made it clear they do not intend to invest nor own more than 25  of the equity in the project  same as prior statements in the past . In fact, they emphasized that they already had lined up two very large equity investors eager to own the majority of the project. My mind went back to prior conversations where management also had said their 25  equity would include the assets and land at Lake Charles which ET would contribute to the deal.Thus, if the project ends up costing about  12 billion and ET expects to own 25 , then ET might need to invest  3 billion during the time frame required to build the facility. But possibly half or a third of their  3 billion might be counted on as the assets and land already constructed at Lake Charles site, so in truth, this project may only cost ET about  1.5 to  2 billion while the finished project would be a hugely valuable contribution to the entirety of the company. Mgmt's comments last night made sense and I started to relax as I began thinking about the numbers further.With management's EBITDA guidance for 2023 staying at roughly  13.25 billion for the full year, I suddenly realized  again  that ET management was excited about growth and might have good reason to be, but they also were taking for granted that we investors all understood that ET was generating SO MUCH cash flow that they surely were not going to issue any new debt to build new projects, the  2 to  3 billion in annual capital expenditures going forward can all be funded internally with cash. With  13.25 billion in EBITDA generated during a year in which NG prices and NGL prices were down 40  to 70  from the prior year, suddenly I realized these numbers suggest ET may easily continue to generate more cash flow than they can deploy. I began to wonder what ET might generate in the future if prices and margins lifted partially back to higher healthier levels  Maybe ET could keep paying down debt and continue to grow at a nice clip  Maybe I really am going to get growth and a stronger balance sheet all at the same timeLaying in bed, I couldn't help myself from reviewing the numbers. If ET generates  13.25 billion in EBITDA this year and  2.0 billion of that EBITDA is associated with their partial ownership of USAC and SUN, and  3.1 billion is used up servicing debt and maintenance expenses, then 13.25 -2.0 -3.1 leaves us with  8.05 billion to pay the distribution and invest in new projects or deals. With 3.1 billion units currently paying  1.24, that costs ET about  3.9 billion so ET still has about  4.2 billion to invest or spend on whatever they think is wise. I reminded myself that ET is generating this sort of huge cash flow in spite of the lower margins associated with the crash in NG and NGL prices which took place here in early 2023.Given that ET has expressed an interest in investing up to about  3 billion per year in new capital expenditures, that leaves management with  1.2 billion to pay down debt, buy back units  not likely , grow the distribution, or simply hold on to as a safety buffer. In other words, nothing has changed. ET is still internally funding their growth projects and continues to expect to generate enough cash flow to continue to reduce the debt leverage by about  1.0 billion a year if it happens to make sense to do so along the way. I should be pleased.I finished my thoughts on Energy Transfer LP thinking that today some investors may knee-jerk sell the units, but I realized that nothing has changed, this company is living within its means, it is seeking a credit upgrade, and it is demonstrating the sort of self discipline we need to see. The fact that management is also bullish on hydrocarbons and opportunities to dominate exports of light sweet oil, ng and ngls out of the GOM, well that certainly all makes sense to me too. 70  of the world is energy deprived and hungry for far, far more hydrocarbons than they currently consume. Energy Transfer LP is right, they do have enormous growth opportunities and as long they avoid using new debt and higher leverage, then the enormous dividend yield and the 3  to 5  growth management is pursuing seems rational, compelling and fine by me.

Chinese system Credit, bank loans, and M2 money supply have continued to expand at double-digit rates, despite GDP growth slowing to 5   or less . Moreover, it s classic late cycle  terminal phase  dynamics, with the runaway expansion of non-productive debt of poor and deteriorating quality.How can Beijing direct so much risky lending and Credit growth without drawing market angst over the soundness of its Credit and banking systems, the Chinese currency, and financial stability more generally  Because of the perception that China s massive international holdings provide the resources necessary in the event of a major bank recapitalization and or problematic capital flight.Analysts have been much too complacent. The exact numbers are unknown, but China has lent in size to scores of high-risk borrowers around the world  including Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Kenya, and Mongolia to name a few . Beijing has used reserves to capitalize and fund lending institutions that promote China s global superpower ambitions. How much of their international reserves is available today is an important mystery.Even assuming most of the  3.115 TN is available, reserve holdings have shrunk significantly compared to overall Credit and the size of China s economy. For example, in 2014   with reserves at a peak  4 TN   holdings equated to 39  of GDP and 17  of bank assets. Today, these ratios are down to 16  and about 5 . Or think of it this way  bank loans increased  1.3 TN in 2014, about a third of the  4.0 TN reserve positions. Bank loans expanded  3.3 TN over the past year, somewhat more than the current international holdings.Unfolding global de-risking deleveraging clearly has the potential to  break  things. Indeed, an alarming number of dominoes are today aligned. In currency markets, China s renminbi, Japan s yen, and EM currencies are vulnerable to disorderly trading. At Wednesday s intraday highs, 10-year Treasury yields had spiked 30 bps from the previous Friday s close. At home and abroad, bond trading is turning increasingly disorderly.It was an ominous week - with the destabilizing trifecta of spiking Treasury  and sovereign  yields, widening Credit spreads  risk premiums , and surging CDS prices. The potential for an escalating war in the Middle East could further darken sentiment.

A last-minute decision by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy to turn to Democrats to pass a short-term funding bill pushed the risk of shutdown to mid-November  But the mere fact the government came within hours of shutting down - with former President Donald Trump cheering on the idea and just four months after the nation almost defaulted on its  31.4 trillion in debt - raises concerns about Congress' ability to function.October 4   Reuters  Moira Warburton, Richard Cowan and David Morgan   A handful of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives  ousted Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as party infighting plunged Congress into further chaos just days after it narrowly averted a government shutdown. The 216-to-210 vote marked the first time in history that the House removed its leader, with eight Republicans voting with 208 Democrats to remove McCarthy.October 4   Yahoo Finance  Josh Schafer   The ousting of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could have ramifications for the stock market. McCarthy's recent moves helped the government reach a short-term deal that delayed a government shutdown and avoided any potential fallout in stocks. Without him, the path to a deal before the new shutdown deadline in November isn't so clear.  A leadership vacuum in the House raises the odds of a government shutdown when the current funding extension expires,  Goldman Sachs' team of economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote   We continue to view a shutdown in Q4 as the base case, likely when funding expires Nov. 17.October 5   Wall Street Journal  Greg Ip   The U.S. has long been the lender of last resort to the world. During the emerging-market panics of the 1990s, the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the pandemic shutdown of 2020, it was the Treasury s unmatched capacity to borrow that came to the rescue. Now, the Treasury itself is a source of risk. No, the U.S. isn t about to default or fail to sell enough bonds at its next auction. But the scale and upward trajectory of U.S. borrowing and absence of any political corrective now threaten markets and the economy in ways they haven t for at least a generation. That s the takeaway from the sudden sharp rise in Treasury yields in recent weeks.October 4   Bloomberg  Lu Wang   The US stock selloff is spreading panic among volatility traders at a scale unseen since the regional bank crisis in March. In perverse Wall Street logic, that s raising hopes that the equity rout is on its last legs.

Stocks have tumbled, government-bond yields have risen and the U.S. dollar has climbed since Federal Reserve officials signaled  they might hold rates near current levels through 2024. Entering the fourth quarter, the S P 500 is hanging on to a 12  advance for the year, but much of the enthusiasm that characterized markets in the first half has largely disappeared.

Firms in this booming  1.5 trillion market typically lend at a floating rate, meaning fund managers get much higher yields from borrowers as base rates soar. This in turn lets funds blast through so-called  hurdle rates,  the point where they can begin to collect profit   or  carry    on their returns. Now, many investors  are asking for more flexibility on how the carry is calculated because of the perceived unfairness of managers making fortunes just because a central bank hikes rates.October 6   Bloomberg  Janet Lorin   Massachusetts Institute of Technology s endowment lost 2.9  on its investments in the year ended in June, the second straight annual drop.

That s compared to a low of less than  4,100 in late 2021, according to automotive information firm Edmunds.October 4   Bloomberg  Carmen Arroyo, Scott Carpenter and Immanual John Milton   The selloff in government bonds and the Federal Reserve s tightening message is claiming another victim  the  8 trillion mortgage bond market. Mortgage-backed securities, which repackage home loans backed by the US government, cheapened to some of the widest levels in history in recent weeks  The selloff has brought the asset class near the post-financial crisis record reached in May.October 4   Bloomberg  Amanda Albright   Investors everywhere grow frustrated by losses, but mom and pop holders in the  4 trillion municipal bond market tend to exacerbate the pain by selling all at once.  No market further exemplifies the saying that negative returns beget negative returns better than the muni bond market,  said Wesly Pate, senior portfolio manager for Boston-based Income Research   Management. He said it s a  self-fulfilling prophecy.  The problem is that retail investors, unlike institutional buyers who typically have long investment horizons, often start selling municipal bonds when they notice poor performance and then continue unloading securities en masse. Since state and local debt is considered a haven, investors are quick to abandon the sector when they see losses.October 3   Wall Street Journal  Jack Pitcher   Asset managers have been counting on what BlackRock calls a  generational opportunity  in the bond market, now that yields are at decade-plus highs. Investors ranging from pension funds to retirement savers should be buying longer-term bonds to lock in higher rates, their thinking goes, spurring a flood of inflows to bond funds. BlackRock, for one, has projected assets under management at its bond exchange-traded funds to triple to  2.5 trillion by 2030. There is just one problem  Those flows have yet to materialize. Relentless losses in the bond market have spooked investors who appear hesitant to jump in until they feel more confident that rates have peaked. Investors pulled  78.6 billion from U.S.-based taxable bond funds in the 12 months through AugustSeptember 30   New York Times  Keith Bradsher   China s giant banking system, the world s largest, is heavily exposed to the real estate crisis  Nearly 40  of all bank loans are related to property. And pressure is building on those banks as dozens of real estate developers have defaulted or missed payments on overseas bonds, led by China Evergrande, the world s most indebted developer. The scale of China s property problems   enormous levels of debt, an oversupply of apartments and consumers increasingly wary of buying   means the government could be forced in the coming years to spend huge sums of money bailing out banks.October 5   Reuters  Xie Yu and Clare Jim   As developer China Evergrande Group lurched from one crisis to another over the past two years, Beijing avoided directly intervening to rescue what was not too long ago considered one of the country's  too big to fail  enterprises. With the world's most indebted developer now standing at the precipice after authorities launched a criminal investigation into its billionaire founder, some creditors, investors and analysts are now betting on authorities stepping in to manage the fallout.October 3   Bloomberg  John Cheng   Chinese developer stocks such as Sunac China decline, with analysts saying September s contracted sales showing no solid recovery and may require more stimulus by authorities. Value of new home sales among the 100 biggest real estate companies fell 29.2  from a year earlier to 404 billion yuan  55.4bn , narrowing from a 33.9  decline in August, according to preliminary data from China Real Estate Information Corp.October 5   Benzinga   China SCE Group Holdings Ltd. became the latest in a line of Chinese property developers to default on its debt Wednesday, after the company said that it could not meet interest and principal payments for up to  1.8 billion in senior offshore notes. The bonds were suspended from trading upon the announcement. The company was once ranked 6th in a 2020 survey among China s most-trusted property brands.October 1   Financial Times  Edward White and Mercedes Ruehl   The World Bank has cut its forecast for China s growth next year and warned that east Asia s developing economies are set to expand at one of the lowest rates in five decades, as US protectionism and rising levels of debt pose an economic drag. The gloomier 2024 forecasts from the bank underline the mounting concern over China s slowdown and how it will spill into Asia  Citing a string of weak indicators for the world s second-biggest economy, the World Bank said it now expected China s economic output would grow 4.4  in 2024, down from the 4.8  it expected in April.October 5   Wall Street Journal  Dave Sebastian   Hong Kong s  4 trillion stock market is having liquidity issues. Trading volumes in the financial hub have slumped over the past three years, reflecting fading investor interest in buying and selling stocks on the city s exchange. Lower trading activity has also contributed to bigger swings in share prices and has become a sticking point for some Hong Kong-listed companies whose stocks barely trade on some days. That has also made it harder for the exchange to attract listings from global companies. Hong Kong s stock-exchange operator said in August that  the sustained high interest rate environment, continued global economic fragility and weak market sentiment  were among the reasons for the trading declines.October 4   Bloomberg  Shawna Kwan   Hong Kong s government will refrain from selling commercial sites in land tenders this quarter as the office market continues to suffer from high vacancy rates.  It s reasonable for us to pause  on the sale of commercial plots in the fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn told reporters...  We see that the vacancy for commercial space is on average at 10  or more.October 6   Reuters  William Schomberg   British house prices fell at the fastest pace since 2009 over the 12 months to September , echoing other measures of the housing market which have cooled after a jump in interest rates. Halifax said house prices were 4.7  lower last month than in September 2022, compared with a 4.5  annual fall in August. It was the biggest drop since August 2009 when the housing market was still in shock after the global financial crisis.October 6   Bloomberg  Anup Roy and Ronojoy Mazumdar   The Reserve Bank of India struck a hawkish policy tone on Friday, saying inflation needs to be tamed and it may take measures to absorb excess cash in the market, sparking a run up in the local bond yields alongside a selloff globally  The jump in India bond yields came alongside worries about surging yields in the US. Treasury yields this week climbed through 5  for the first time since 2007. With inflation still well above the 4  target, Das surprised the market by announcing the RBI was considering selling bonds in order to soak up extra cash.October 5   Financial Times  Valentina Romei   The World Trade Organization has halved its estimate for exports growth around the world this year as manufacturing industries are hit by a slowdown and rising geopolitical tensions cause trade patterns to fragment. The  intergovernmental organisation said  it expected the volume of world merchandise trade to grow by just 0.8 , down from a 1.7  increase which it had forecast in April.

Policymakers have been warning all year   with mounting alarm   about the risks and sizes of bets taken by some hedge funds and private equity houses  In recent weeks, the UK s top financial regulator has drawn up plans for a probe into private capital valuations, while the Bank of England has declared such  non-banks  to be so important that policymakers should create a new facility to lend directly to them in times of crises. Global watchdogs at the Financial Stability Board have launched a new review that could limit hedge fund leverage and increase transparency on their borrowings. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought forward policies on fund transparency so stringent that some are suing in a bid to stop them.October 4   New York Times  Maureen Farrell   In 2009, as the banking business was on the verge of being reshaped by new regulations in the wake of the great financial crisis, the private equity giant Apollo Global Management found a way to make money off the retirement savings of millions of everyday Americans. Through Athene, an insurer it helped create and later merged with, Apollo acquired portfolios of annuities   a type of insurance policy that guarantees income streams, usually for retirees   from other insurers and used the premiums collected to help expand its lending businesses, from mortgages to aircraft financing. Athene, which now represents about half of Apollo s business, also issues annuities and has become the biggest U.S. issuer of such policies. Last year, it managed  236 billion of annuity policies and other securities.October 5   Reuters  Brian K Sullivan   Extreme heat is usually associated with drought and wildfires. But across five continents this year, it s also unleashed a different kind of disaster  deadly flooding. Cities around the world have seen record rainfall 139 times in 2023. A rare hurricane-like storm inundated Libya last month, killing thousands. More than 100 people died across Asia during an intense monsoon season in July. After fatal floods pummeled the US Northeast over the summer, torrential rains paralyzed New York City last week. Soaring temperatures were at the root of all these weather calamities.September 30   Yahoo Finance  Ines Ferré   Artificial intelligence is expected to have the most impact on practically everything since the advent of the internet.

Take for example OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT. Research done at the University of Washington shows that hundreds of millions of queries on ChatGPT can cost around 1 gigawatt-hour a day, or the equivalent energy consumed by 33,000 US households.  The energy consumption of something like ChatGPT inquiry compared to some inquiry on your email, for example, is going to be probably 10 to 100 times more power hungry,  Professor of electrical and computer engineering Sajjad Moazeni told Yahoo...October 4   Financial Times  Attracta Mooney, Steven Bernard, Chris Campbell and Aime Williams   The world experienced its hottest September ever last month after surpassing the previous record by an  extraordinary  0.5C, the European earth observation agency said  Scientists at the Copernicus Climate Change Service said 2023 was on course to be the hottest on record, after the average global temperature in September was 1.75C degrees warmer than the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900, before human-induced climate change began to take effect.

Coiled Spring Dividend Ready To Rip Higher: NextEra Energy,"As a society, we become very skilled at finding alternatives to things. Don't want the fat from ground beef  Have some ground Turkey  You don't like milk-based creamer  There are plenty of options between soy, almond, and oat. The list goes on. So it shouldWhen it comes to the stock market, for some reason, investors continue to try to have this alternative trend. Instead of simply owning fixed-income investments like bonds or preferred securities, they look beyond them to find  bond alternatives . Interestingly these are areas of investments that may have no direct correlations to bonds themselves. Yet now, because they've been labeled, they frequently trade in line with moves of interest rates just like a bond would.Some of these alternatives are REITs, and others are utilities. Both of these are widely accepted to be bond alternatives because of the steady cash flow they provide. Interestingly, many investors will then sell them when interest rates go up and buy them when interest rates go back down because they view them to have the same risks as bonds, even though those risks don't directly correlate. It's a mind game.As an income investor, I love to work against the mind tricks of the market to find great income investment opportunities to buy and hold for decades to come. The big difference between dividend companies and bonds is that when you hold a bond, you have a set interest rate for its entire lifespan. When you hold a company, the dividends can rise, or they can fall. There's not the same level of guarantee, and because of that greater level of risk, you often receive higher yields, which can grow with time as the dividend gets raised.Today, I want to look at an opportunity in a  yieldco , a company that holds electricity-producing assets and profits from selling electricity to utility companies. It enjoys substantial and growing cash flow. It has continued to raise its dividend even as the price of its shares has fallen.Why has the share price fallen  Mostly because it's treated like a bond alternative, and foolishly people are selling simply because interest rates are rising, even as the company maintains an outlook for 12  dividend growth.Let's dive in, yielding 6.8 , is an electrical utility that has seen its share price continue to trend down. Q2 earnings were poorly received by the market, which, as we noted in our earnings roundup,  had a particularly strong Q2 in 2022 and a particularly weak Q2 in 2023.Management reiterated guidance that the distribution will grow at a 12-15  annual rate through 2026. However, in the near term, it expects the growth rate to be closer to 12 . NEP has a great history of hitting guidance, and it should. After all, the bulk of its business is highly visible and is conducted with a related party.How can NEP management predict future cash flows with such precision  NEP doesn't have to predict what others will do  they just need to predict what they are going to do.Let's take a look at what NEP does and its role in NextEra Energy's  business. NEE owns Florida Power and Light, an electric company that has an insatiable thirst for electricity. Obviously, NEE is interested in ensuring that it has all the electricity it needs at an affordable price.In an effort to achieve that, it created NextEra Energy Resources or NEER. The primary role of NEER is to develop and build electricity generation. While much of the public focus of NEE has been on renewable energy, its energy generation comes from a multitude of sources that include nuclear, gas, oil, and even coal.So NEE needs electricity, NEER builds the assets to generate that electricity, and that introduces one problem  Development is a capital-intensive process, so where will the money come from  Once built, a power-generating asset is tying up capital, and it could be years before NEE gets enough electricity from the asset to match the upfront capital needed to build it. In the meantime, the demand for electricity keeps rising, and NEER needs to build more.NEP is the solution to that problem. It is a very classic question of capital allocation. NEE wants electricity, and NEER wants to build more capacity, but neither is interested in owning electric capacity for 20  years. Fortunately, there is a class of investors who have lump sums of cash and would be thrilled to convert that lump sum into 20  years of recurring cash flow. Those investors would otherwise be known as... US  As income investors, that is precisely what we want. We want to provide our capital by buying shares and, in return, get a recurring and growing income stream for many decades.NEP buys the power-generating assets from NEER, providing NEER with a lump sum of money that it can use to build more. Simultaneously, NEP enters into a Power Purchase Agreement  'PPA'  with NEE, agreeing to sell the power generated to NEE and providing NEE with electricity to sell to its Florida Power   Light customers. NEP then takes those cash flows and distributes a large portion of them to shareholders  that's us .NEE gets its electricity, NEER frees up capital for new investments, and NEP gets recurring cash flow. It is a win win win situation, and everyone gets what they want because everyone wants different things.NEP doesn't have to guess what assets they are going to buy because the folks managing NEP  the buyer of assets  are the same folks managing NEER  the seller of the assets  and NEE  the buyer of the electricity . So they know what assets they are going to buy, at what price, and that there will be a PPA. The left hand doesn't have to guess what the right hand will do.The assets that NEP will buy over the next three years are already built and in operation. The only uncontrollable variable is what NEP's cost of capital will be. In order to buy assets from NEER, NEP needs capital, which it has historically received from issuing common shares. This is an attractive proposition when the shares are trading at high prices but not so attractive below  60.As the share price declined, NEP was forced to find an alternative to get the capital it needs if it wants to continue the current growth trajectory. Worse, it had forward equity commitments that were going to convert to equity at not particularly attractive prices. NEP needed to find an alternative source of capital.The solution NEE NEP NEER came up with is to sell the gas pipeline assets that NEP currently owns. Gas pipelines are currently popular, and buyers are willing to pay good prices, meaning that NEP will likely be able to sell high for a gain. This is expected to produce enough capital for NEP to redeem all its equity requirements with cash without having to issue shares at a poor price.NEE, which owns slightly more than half of NEP, has  incentive distribution rights  or IDRs. When shareholders get paid, NEE gets paid IDRs. NEE agreed to waive its rights and bypass that cash flow, which ensures that NEP has ample cash flow to continue raising its distribution. No, NEE didn't do this out of the goodness of their heart. But remember the different goals  NEE doesn't want NEP for the cash flow   it wants electricity. Having NEP able to raise external capital to buy assets from NEER is very useful for NEE. So if waiving a few IDR payments results in NEP being able to continue to provide shareholders with a growing income stream, which in turn should encourage them to be willing to provide more capital in the future, it is a small investment. Everybody knows that right now is a tough time to be raising capital as interest rates skyrocket. NEP isn't unique  peer Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure  has experienced a very similar decline in its equity prices.Thanks to the new deal with NEE, NEP is in a position where it doesn't need to issue any equity at all to be able to pursue its current growth plans. It took the uncontrollable variable   the cost of capital   off the plate by making it so that NEP doesn't need to raise capital. Now NEP can proceed forward with the variables that it can control, and that means shareholders in NEP can look forward to a distribution that will be steadily raised to a range of  5.11- 5.68 by the end of 2026. Even if dividend growth stopped at that point, it is enough to justify an investment today. However, we believe the odds are high that NEP will keep growing beyond that level.With NEP, we can gain excellent exposure to NEE's top-notch management team running a utility like no one has seen before. NEE has an insatiable thirst for electricity, and by owning NEP, we can sit back and collect our growing income stream by selling electricity to NEE.As a professional income investor, I love to own investments that pay me. I think that I'm valuable enough that I'm worth being paid to be a co-owner of the company along with everyone else. With investments like utilities, when others are selling them because interest rates have climbed, I am willing to buy the shares they're selling because I know that the income that I'm locking in is connected to strong revenue streams by captive customers. Most of NEP's customer base is dependent on their power and has no other choice. NEE depends on power from NEP to continue providing power to homes. There's nothing better for your dividend stream than to have a customer base that has no choice but to pay you.When it comes to my retirement, I don't have to worry about if my money is going to come in or when it's coming in because I know that it is. All I have to worry about is what I'm going to cook for dinner tonight, which friends I want to have over to enjoy that dinner with me, or what hobbies I'm going to take up next. In the meantime, NEP is paying me  7  of recurrent income.That's the beauty of my Income Method.

"Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript","Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 10 00 AM ETRyan Cieslak - Director, IRNeil Schrimsher - President   CEODavid Wells - CFODavid Manthey - BairdChris Dankert - Loop CapitalKen Newman - KeyBanc Capital MarketsGreetings, and welcome to the Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call for Applied Industrial Technologies.  Operator Instructions  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 26, 2023.I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Cieslak, Director of Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead.Okay. Thanks, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, we issued our earnings release and supplemental investor deck detailing our first quarter results. Both of these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of applied.com.Before we begin, just a reminder, we'll discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations subject to the certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. In addition, the conference call will use non-GAAP financial measures, which are subject to the qualifications referenced in those documents.Our speakers today include Neil Schrimsher, Applied's President and Chief Executive Officer  and Dave Wells, our Chief Financial Officer.With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. I'll start today with some perspective on our first quarter results, current industry conditions and our expectations going forward. Dave will follow with more specific detail on the quarter's performance as well as our updated outlook and guidance. I'll then close with someSo overall, we had a nice start to fiscal 2024. We delivered strong earnings performance with EBITDA and EPS growing at respective 12  and 21  over the prior year and hitting new record first quarter levels. This was against a more modest sales growth backdropWe're also beginning to see LIFO expense normalize as inflation starts to moderate and inventory levels stabilize. As highlighted in past calls, LIFO expense was a notable headwind to margins and earnings over the past several years. While we anticipate inflation to persist going forward and there's a degree of uncertainty on the cadence of LIFO expense moving forward, we expect more normalized LIFO expense levels to provide a clearer view of the progress we continue to make along our initiatives as well as the ongoing evolution of our business mix and industry position.We also had another solid quarter of demonstrating cost control. In addition to lower variable expenses as sales growth normalizes, we continue to benefit from greater efficiencies and cost leverage following investments in talent and technology as well as an ongoing focus across our shared services model. Our operational discipline and execution commitment remain key guiding post as we navigate an evolving demand environment and continue to invest across our business for future growth.As it relates to the broader demand backdrop, trends were largely in line with our expectations during the quarter. As we highlighted in recent quarters and consistent with macro industrial indicators, we continue to see normalization in customer activity across areas of our business.Customer production facilities have settled into a steady cadence following a heavy utilization ramp in recent years. In addition, we continue to face a headwind from slower activity across the technology sector, which we estimate negatively impacted our year-over-year organic growth by over 100 basis points in the quarter.A slower technology vertical has impacted our year-over-year sales growth for almost a year at this point. Our exposure to technology vertical has increased in recent years, both with strong organic growth and acquisition. This includes essential solutions integral to the production supply chains and infrastructure across semiconductor and electronics manufacturing as well as data center operations.On a side note, orders within this vertical have stabilized and we believe the year-over-year sales trends will begin to improve in coming quarters as comparisons ease and demand starts to rebound considering the many secular and structural tailwinds within this growth vertical.Outside of technology vertical, underlying sales growth held in well during the first quarter against difficult comparisons. 22 of our top 30 end markets were positive year-over-year, which is relatively stable with last quarter. Growth was strongest in many of our top industry verticals and across our larger national account base.Trends were most favorable across food and beverage, lumber and wood, mining, pulp and paper, energy, utilities and refining verticals during the quarter. In addition, we continue to capture incremental growth opportunities from our industry position, local service capabilities and cross-selling initiatives.We're also seeing more benefits both directly and indirectly from reshoring activity and investments in U.S. industrial infrastructure as well as projects tied to the ongoing energy transition. This includes demand for our technical products and solutions as the broader industrial economy supports incremental production activity from these investments. We're seeing these benefits across many of our businesses in the U.S., including our service center and flow control operations as well as our core industrial and mobile fluid power business.Related sales across these areas on a combined basis were up a high-single-digit percent over the prior year during the quarter. This generally aligns with readings on U.S. industrial capacity utilization, which have been relatively firm at prior cycle highs in recent months. These trends suggest that the current market easing is more reflective of a cooling in customer activity rather than a retrenchment or contraction, while growing secular spending backdrop is providing incremental support.Within our Service Center segment, sales increased nearly 5  organically over prior year levels on top of 20  growth during the first quarter of last year. Our core U.S. Service Center network led the way with relatively firm trends through the quarter, which is an encouraging sign considering the shorter cycle nature of our Service Center sales and related correlation with the underlying U.S. industrial production activity. We continue to see strong growth across larger national accounts and fluid power aftermarket sales as well as benefits from our sales force effectiveness initiatives.As a reminder, these include greater use of prescriptive analytics, system investments and ongoing talent initiatives. We continue to benefit from our ability to consistently serve our customers' technical break fix needs at a scaled, but localized level, while providing them direct access to solutions for their fluid power, flow control, consumables and advanced automation needs.The progress we've made on our strategy and market position has enriched and deepened our customer relationships within our Service Center network. This is presenting a greater scope of business opportunities at all points of the business cycle as we are increasingly viewed as a strategic solutions provider for critical industrial infrastructure.We're also continuing to identify opportunities to further enhance our local service reach and accelerate our growth potential moving forward. This is reflected in the two bolt-on service center acquisitions we announced in early September  Bearing Distributors and Cangro Industries. Each company brings deep customer and supplier relationships as well as strong technical talent that will strengthen our footprint and strategic growth potential across the U.S. Southeast and Upper Northeast. We welcome both Bearing Distributors and Cangro to the Applied team and look forward to seeing their capabilities bolster our value proposition moving forward.Within our Engineered Solutions segment, sales were up close to 1  organically over the prior year. Segment growth has moderated from prior quarters, as expected, primarily reflecting more difficult comparisons and reduced activity across the technology in market, as highlighted earlier.Automation sales were also slightly lower year-over-year on an organic basis during the quarter, though partially reflecting the timing of more complex Engineered Solutions shipments as well as ongoing component delays and supply chain constraints. This was more than offset by positive sales growth across our off-highway mobile and industrial fluid power verticals as well as our higher margin process flow control products and solutions.Our mobile and industrial fluid power OEM and Engineered Solutions sales are benefiting from a healthy backlog that expanded over the past couple of years. Part of the backlog growth reflects market penetration as we continue to leverage our leading capabilities in electronic controls, IoT, electrification and autonomous systems. This includes design, engineering and software coding and the integration of these advanced features into hydraulic and pneumatic systems. Our expertise in these areas is strengthening our value proposition as the fluid power space evolves and is providing a robust pipeline of long-term growth opportunities as we lead the fluid power distribution space towards these next generation platforms.MRO activity and capital spending on process infrastructure also remains positive in our core flow control end markets with incremental support from backlog conversion and new business tied to our customers' decarbonization efforts. In addition, despite more muted sales growth in the quarter, overall customer interest and new business opportunities remained elevated across our automation operations with our sales funnel and pre-sales engineering activity remaining at record highs. We're very excited about the potential of our automation platform, including an active pipeline of strategic M A opportunities that we expect to further scale and optimize our industry position going forward.From a capital allocation standpoint, we remain very well positioned to drive ongoing organic investment as well as accelerate M A going forward. We have flexibility to return capital through other avenues if necessary. This includes a potentially more active approach to share buybacks considering our positive long-term outlook and the underlying intrinsic value we see across our company as we progress along our strategy and toward our financial objectives.Lastly, I want to highlight our recent published ESG report, which I encourage you to spend time reviewing. We've expanded the report this year to include energy consumption detail, broader information on our sustainability solutions and initiatives and more insight into our ESG actions moving forward.We remain focused on advancing our commitment and opportunity around this important stakeholder area both now and into the future. This includes building on our legacy of being a responsible corporate citizen by implementing greener practices in our operations, promoting diversity, fostering continuous learning across our organization and supporting our communities.At this time, I'll turn the call over to Dave for additional detail on our financial results and outlook.Thanks, Neil. Just as a reminder before I begin, as in prior quarters, we have posted a quarterly supplemental investor presentation to our investor site for your additional reference during the call.Turning now to details of our financial performance in the quarter. Consolidated sales increased 3.1  over the prior year quarter, acquisitions contributed 110 basis points and foreign currency had a positive 20 basis point impact. This was partially offset by a 1.6 percentage point headwind from one less selling day in the quarter.Netting these factors, sales increased 3.4  on an organic daily basis. As it relates to pricing, we estimate the contribution of product pricing on year-over-year sales growth was in the low-single-digits for the quarter and slightly below fiscal 2023 fourth quarter levels.Moving now to sales performance by segment. As highlighted on Slides 7 and 8 of the presentation, sales in our Service Center segment increased 4.7  year-over-year on an organic daily basis when excluding the impact of foreign currency, the initial contribution from our early September acquisitions and the one less selling day in the quarter.Growth was strongest across our U.S. Service Center network, partially offset by more modest sales trends across our international operations. Segment operating income increased 9  over the prior year, while segment operating margin of 13  was up 60 basis points.Within our Engineered Solutions segment, sales increased 1.2  over the prior year quarter with acquisitions contributing 220 basis points of growth, which was partially offset by a negative 160 point headwind from the selling day impact. On an organic daily basis, segment sales increased 0.6  year-over-year. We continue to see solid sales growth within our industrial and off-highway mobile fluid power solutions as well as sustained customer MRO and capex spending into process flow infrastructure.Sales however within our automation operations declined 5  on an organic daily basis over the prior year, partially reflecting delayed customer shipment and install activity of Engineered Solutions as well as the adverse impact of ongoing supply chain constraints.In addition, as mentioned earlier, segment sales trends continued to be impacted by slower activity within the technology end market, which negatively impacted segment growth by approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. Segment operating income increased 9  over the prior year, while segment operating margin of 14.2  was up 100 basis points from prior year levels.Highlighting now our gross margin performance. As detailed on Page 9 of the deck, gross margin of 29.7  increased 81 basis points compared to the prior year level of 28.9 . During the quarter, we recognized LIFO expense of  4.6 million compared to  9.1 million in the prior year quarter. This net LIFO tailwind had a favorable 41 basis point year-over-year impact on gross margins during the quarter.While directionally in line with our expectation of easing LIFO expense near-term, the overall magnitude of decline was greater than anticipated, reflecting ongoing normalization of inflation and more stable inventory trends across our business. That said, our underlying gross margin performance continues to reflect solid execution and our margin expansion potential. This is becoming more transparent as LIFO expense begins to moderate. When excluding LIFO expense, gross margins were up nearly 40 basis points over the prior year and 20 basis points sequentially.We continue to manage broader inflationary dynamics well through our ongoing focus on various gross margin countermeasures and initiatives. This includes enhanced analytics, freight expense management and channel execution. We also saw solid gross margin performance within our Engineered Solutions segment during the quarter, helping both segment profitability and mix dynamics during the quarter.As it relates to our operating cost, selling, distribution and administrative expenses increased 2.1  compared to prior year levels. SD A expense was 18.7  of sales during the quarter, down from 18.8  during the prior year quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, SD A expense was relatively unchanged over the prior year period. We continue to leverage labor cost, reflecting talent and systems investments as well as benefits from shared services deployment and operational excellence initiatives.Results also reflect the flexibility of our operating model, including inherent adjustments as sales growth normalizes as well as our ongoing operational focus. Our ability to hold operating costs relatively flat in light of ongoing inflationary headwinds and growth investments is another highlight of our solid performance in the quarter and execution potential.Overall, sustained sales growth, gross margin management, lower LIFO expense and nice cost leverage drove a 12.3  increase in EBITDA over prior levels during the quarter, while EBITDA margin of 12.2  increased 100 basis points year-over-year. This includes a 41 basis point year-over-year impact favorability due to lower LIFO expense.We also benefited from lower net interest expense during the quarter, primarily reflecting greater interest income from higher cash balances and investment yields. Combined with a slightly lower tax rate relative to prior year levels, reported earnings per share of  2.39 was up over 21  from prior year levels.Moving to our cash flow performance. Cash generated from operating activities during the first quarter was  66.2 million, while free cash flow totaled  61.9 million. Compared to the prior year, free cash was up over 200 . As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our lowest cash generation quarter from a seasonal perspective.Looking ahead, we expect easing working capital trends as the year progresses, including some benefit from the conversion of work in process tied to our Engineered Solutions segment as well as continued benefits from our working capital initiatives.From a balance sheet perspective, we ended September with approximately  360 million of cash on hand and net leverage at 0.5 times EBITDA, which is below the prior year level of 1.1 times. Our balance sheet is in a strong position to support our capital deployment initiatives moving forward as well as enhanced returns for all stakeholders.Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with organic growth and acquisitions, our primary focus areas. We remain disciplined with our M A approach, focus on targets and valuations, supporting our return requirements and strategic priorities.Turning now to our outlook. As indicated in today's press release and detailed on Page 11 of our presentation, we are raising full year fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect first quarter earnings performance and modest accretion from our early September Service Center acquisitions as well as lower assumptions for LIFO expense and net interest expense.We now project EPS in the range of  9.25 to  9.80 per share based on sales growth of 1  to 4 , including 0  to 3  organic growth assumption as well as EBITDA margins of 12  to 12.3 . Previously, our guidance assumed EPS of  8.80 to  9.55 per share, sales growth of 0  to 4  and EBITDA margins of 11.9  to 12.1 .Our sales outlook continues to take into consideration economic uncertainty and easing price contribution as the year plays out. We also assume ongoing moderation in broader market activity as customers continue to normalize production levels near-term. In addition, based on month-to-date sales trends in October and our near-term outlook, we currently project fiscal second quarter organic sales to decline by a low-single-digit percent over the prior year quarter. Please note, the second quarter represents our most difficult comparison for fiscal 2024 with prior year second quarter organic sales increasing over 21  and nearly 40  on a two year stacked basis.We are also assuming potentially more subdued scheduled maintenance activity within our core Service Center network into the seasonally slower late fall and winter months this year as customers manage calendar year end budget spending in an uncertain macro environment. Further, we're assuming the year-over-year -- technology vertical headwind persists and sales growth in our automation operations to remain muted near-term, partially reflecting the cadence of system shipments and difficult comparisons.Lastly, we expect second quarter gross margins to decline sequentially following the strong performance we saw during the first quarter. While we are encouraged by our first quarter gross margin performance, including ongoing traction with our internal initiatives, we believe it remains prudent to assume a more balanced trajectory near-term considering normalizing volume trends, ongoing inflationary pressures and the potential for modest mix headwinds.Further, the trajectory of LIFO expense remains uncertain pending greater clarity on supplier price adjustments as well as considering the long LIFO tail impact that we can see given the random consumption nature of our SKU mix. From the EBITDA margin perspective, our guidance assumes second quarter EBITDA margins to be flat to up slightly year-over-year, reflecting potential expense deleveraging on modest organic sales declines as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds and growth investments offset by lower LIFO expense compared to the prior year.With that, I will now turn the call back over to Neil for some final comments.Thanks, Dave. So to wrap up and summarize, we are encouraged by the sustained earnings growth into early fiscal 2024. We have many self-help growth and margin opportunities that we expect to manifest in coming quarters. That said, we remain cognizant of the uncertain economic backdrop near-term, including the impact of higher interest rates on business investment globally as well as increased geopolitical unrest.Combined with gradual improvement in supply chain dynamics industry-wide, our outlook continues to assume industrial activity remains more mixed near-term as customers realign production volumes to more typical seasonal patterns and take a more systematic, albeit still constructive, approach to capital spending.Importantly, the underlying fundamental backdrop within our core end markets and industry focus remains positive. This is underpinned by ongoing positive feedback from our customers, including planned growth investments as North American manufacturing activity, infrastructure spending and industrial capacity continues to expand.From greater equipment maintenance activity and system modernization to required investments in automation and IoT, our comprehensive portfolio of technical solutions, engineering talent and local service support are increasingly critical to our customers. This is evident in the resilience we see in our core U.S. Service Center network where booking activity is holding up well into the early part of our second quarter despite normalizing in-market demand.In addition, sales funnel activity across our automation business continues to grow with our increasing scale and application expertise, a significant value proposition for our customers and suppliers. This is unlocking cross-selling opportunities and the development of new solutions and tools that we expect to supplement our automation addressable market and growth potential for years to come.Further feedback from our team and customers highlight growing demand from our core automation solutions, including accelerated adoption of collaborative and autonomous mobile robots to address structural labor shortages and optimize workflows. We're investing in industry-leading engineering talent, premier supplier technologies and production capacity to optimize our automation growth potential long-term. Combined with an active M A pipeline, we expect our automation platform to scale significantly over the next several years and be accretive to our organic growth profile as we continue along our company evolution.We're also excited by the growth potential we see developing around modernizing fluid power systems. Our capabilities and strategy and electronic control integration is providing a strong foundation to develop new and advanced hydraulic and pneumatic solutions. This will be critical to addressing our OEM customers' needs around energy efficiency, autonomous systems and electrification of industrial and mobile equipment. We have a strong industry position in this area given our advanced and centralized engineering capabilities, investments in research and development and broad scale across the U.S.We also see steady growth across our process flow control operations, reflecting the longer cycle nature of this area of our business as well as expanding growth opportunities supporting the energy transition and a growing portfolio of business tied to the hygienic space.Combined with a potential rebound across the technology sector, recent stabilization in broader industrial macro data points and easing comparisons beginning in the second half of fiscal 2024, we see a favorable sales growth set-up building in coming quarters and into 2025. However, we're mindful of broader economic dynamics that can potentially influence the timing and impact of these various tailwinds near-term.Further, as we've shown in the past, our business model and operational discipline provides the playbook and flexibility to easily adjust if need be, while simultaneously generating significant cash flow. Our balance sheet and liquidity provide a strong support to opportunistically pursue ongoing organic investment and strategic M A in the current environment as well as other capital deployment that could augment returns for all stakeholders going forward.Once again, we thank you for your continued support. And with that, we'll open up the lines for your questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed.Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for the overview. And Neil, that was a great outlook on what we should expect as we look down the path here. So I'll refocus more on company specific items. Let's talk about the low leverage on the balance sheet. Right now, there's only so many outlets for cash flow, and we trust that you won't force an acquisition, of course, but share repurchase maybe with the stock being somewhat thin is a little problematic. Is there anything that you can do organically  Neil, you mentioned the automation area. Is there a more aggressive strategy that you can take there that would drive some attractive shareholder returns for cash invested internallyYeah. So Dave, I would say, we are taking those steps and actions. I think we talked about we've organically opened in some geographies. We have capital investment to augment or increase facility space to allow greater project throughput and velocity. We'll be doing things as we assemble these groups and operations in technology systems and investments that we believe are really going to allow engineering speed and velocity to occur and that those engineering -- application engineering teams can leverage one another's work and also have engineering standards that can allow us to go faster. And as we've touched on in the remarks, it remains a focus area for acquisitions along with the rest of our Engineered Solutions area. So we think we're going to have numerous opportunities to deploy capital into the business and continue to profitable growth.Yeah. And if memory serves, you've opened a couple of these greenfield locations. I'd be interested in just getting an update there. And along those lines, Neil, I'm wondering, is it something where you can really lean into it  I know you're looking at M A to augment that space as well. But could you open 10 a year  I mean, is that outside the realm  It seems like a very rapidly growing area people are interested in it. You have these secular themes lining up on labor and so forth. So any thoughts there that you could share with usYeah. I would say, I don't know that there's a specific number at this stage we feel like we have to. Obviously, we've proven that we can. We like the results that we're getting with the teams and the collaboration, the solutions that we're taking forward in that. And so we'll continue to evaluate what are best entry points into those geographies.But even with our serve footprint today, which is growing and expanding, we're able to reach into others with especially strategic accounts, customer-driven where they're looking for solutions and we've had success with them in other geographies. They're pulling us into those areas. And so we're having success. So we touched on it. We think in time this becomes 10  of our sales. And if we think about the growing addressable market, that's  10 billion and perhaps getting higher. There's more we can do. There's more we will do in this arena.And you're seeing some of that forward aspect of the incremental organic investment read through, Dave, and the higher capex kind of still 27 to 29 figure in terms of the full year outlook on capex spend. So the end of the day, just not terribly capital intensive too. As you think about greenfielding some of these sites, leveraging our Service Center footprint and the investment that goes in behind that. So continuing to step-up the organic investment. But once again, just kind of fits the nature of this business and not as capital intensive, so not big dollars committed to that.Yeah. It's a great problem to have. All right, guys. Thanks for the overview. Good luck.Thank you.Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Please proceed.Hey. Good morning, guys.Good morning.I guess, hoping to dig in a little bit more on gross margin here. I mean, really impressive beat in the quarter versus what we were looking for. I mean, can you kind of maybe parse apart what was really driving that  I mean, was it freight  Was it price cost  Was it just kind of the internal execution you've been going through here  Any other color you can kind of give us on what really drove gross margin in the first quarter hereYes. Beyond the 41 basis point year-over-year benefit from LIFO that we broke out, you're still up 40 basis point year-over-year. So Q1 is typically our seasonally softest gross margin quarter as some rebate programs, etc., reset. But really solid execution across all aspects, thinking about some of our margin enhancement initiatives focused on freight recovery, kind of the work around operations excellence there, really all the levers hitting there. So nice work by the team. Despite Engineered Solutions growth being more modest, nice contribution still from the mix standpoint there. And that we talked about it, segment gross margins and obviously the EBITDA margins up very nicely. So even on that lower volume, driving a nice mixed contribution there.So really that 40 basis points year-over-year operational improvement, 20 basis points sequentially, there's no one factor that just sticks out. Kind of price cost drill neutral as we think about how that's reading through the P L. And just really continued solid work by the team and thinking through all the levers, continuing to focus on the pricing for the value that we're driving on the Engineered Solution side of the business. And like I said, really hitting on all cylinders on that front.Yeah. And Chris, I'd say, I'm pleased with the execution and the performance in it. I think Dave covered from a LIFO standpoint. We would expect similar -- perhaps the  4.5 million to  5 million in the next quarter as we think. A couple of things did align in the quarter. So if I think about it for the second quarter, I think perhaps we may be down sequentially in that side, perhaps more at the 29.5 or so in that area. But still good strong performance as we'll operate in the second quarter.Got it. Thanks so much for the color, guys. And really nice execution by the team. I guess, to move to Service Center here, I know you don't typically comment on the month, but maybe just any comments on October-to-date there  I mean, is Service Center kind of down in line with the overall guide for kind of low-single-digit pullback here in 2QAs we think about it in the quarter performance, I think the Service Center segment has performed well. And so we think about flattish overall, we could have -- in October, we could have Service Centers probably being a little better than that at this stage.Got it. And if you'd indulge just one more, I'm curious, just on your backlog in Engineered Solutions has been pretty elevated. Is that kind of back to normal levels here  Have we seen any cancellations  Just any commentary on backlog would be great.Yeah. I'd say, overall, backlog as we think about it, we're still pleased. We think back pre-pandemic to those levels as historical norms. We're still going to be operating at a 2 times plus from a backlog standpoint. So that's encouraging for us as we think forward. In the quarter, we did have some conversion of that, as expected.We would expect further of that in this side, but teams are doing a nice job of how we're working to engineer new solutions and add to that anytime that including in technology. If there's a slowing or a little bit of lull, it allows teams to work on solutions. But we're encouraged, especially in industrial off-highway mobile, that backlog, that level and what we're doing to convert. So still remains at a good healthy level.And the answer to the cancellation question, no, you typically wouldn't see cancellations in that Engineered Solutions piece of the business given the nature of that business. You may see some rephasing of OEM shipments based on demand, but that's pretty modest. Really that 2 times backlog just continues to be driven by kind of strong order trends.And we are still seeing ongoing supplier constraints that are impacting adversely some of that shipment timing and getting those projects out the door. So continuing to see that impact the Engineered Solutions side of the business, some of that reading through to the lower growth for the quarter.Got it. Thank you so much for the detail, and congrats on the quarter here, guys.Thanks.Operator Instructions  And our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed.Hey. Good morning, guys.Good morning.Maybe if we can just start off with the automation demand and just how you're thinking about the cadence of that coming back in the back half. Just touching on the last comment. And Neil, some of your comments, in your prepared remarks, I think you talked about some timing of more complex shipments maybe being pushed out a bit. Can you just expand on that a little bit  I mean, what is still tight specifically in those orders  And then again, just how do you think about the cadence of those shipments for that vertical into the second halfYeah. So as I think about it, kind of the -- first, I'll start with kind of what's holding up. Two things. At times it can be small components, small things holding it up. It would be cabling or connectors or interface, PLCs in that area that can create. And then sometimes these projects are part of a larger project that the customer is working on. So those project managers will work their extended Gantt charts on managing that project. And if something else that we're not related to extends out, it impacts that window or that timing.And so as I think on some of those projects, we're going to see them move beyond our Q2 into the start of the calendar year perhaps in some of those. So as I think about overall for the back half, we would expect growth to resume in our automation business in that side. But if I look at that window, it could set-up that it might be similar in Q2 from a demand or a sell standpoint.Got it. Is there a way to, from a high level, kind of parse out the magnitude of what is more  Is it evenly split between these small components versus big project timing or is one a larger impact than the otherWell, it's hard to parse out each contributing factor to that. Is it external with projects or inputs or suppliers or components in that, but the teams are working it. We've covered in our operating reviews with them in the side. So we feel like we have a good line of sight. And the other that's encouraging, by the amount of sales collaboration and what the sales engineers are doing and the advanced work by the application engineers, I think it's building a good funnel of conversion opportunities.We touched on the set-up to address needs and problems around labor and material movement. So for collaborative robots and mobile, but we're also seeing it in vision opportunities of how that can positively impact quality and performance plus address some labor challenges that could exist from a customer's operations standpoint. So hey, we remain encouraged in that. Can't control perfectly the timing on some of this project release in the side, but again, we like where we're at. We know as we go into the second half and especially look forward into '25, we're going to expect continued outsized outgrowth contributions from the automation space.Right. Last quarter I think you gave us -- and sorry if I missed this, but I think you gave us -- you sized the opportunity funnel in automation. I think there were over 100 open projects last quarter. Did you provide an update to that funnel this quarter or are you willing toNo. I didn't. I would say, it's in a similar realm higher as it would go along. So there's some consistency in that. Obviously, many of those projects are moving to the next stage of the funnel. Plus teams are looking in areas to add to that. So if I draw the comparison to last quarter, it would be greater.Understood. Maybe if I could just squeeze one more in. Obviously, it seems like the biggest headwind, the only headwind really that you saw this quarter was primarily in the technology sector outside of the tough comps. But I'm just curious if you could just give any kind of other end market information on where you've seen any outsized deceleration, if any, in some of the other verticals you serveYeah. So we touched on technology. I think the only other one that could be presenting some headwinds, aggregates that we'd see in some areas and around the construction and building materials on that side. I think the stack up, as we talked about on the top 30 industries, all-in-all favorable, right, as it compared to last quarter. And many of those that are in the top half of the 30, doing well. But along with the technology, I think that aggregate side are ones that would be declining year-over-year.Understood. Very helpful. Thanks again.Thank you.And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to you for closing remarks.I just want to thank everyone again for taking the time to join us today. And we look forward to talking with you throughout the quarter. Thanks.That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",0,2023-10-29T08:14:10.000-04:00

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Operator Instructions  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Taryn Fielder, General Counsel. Thank you, Ms Fielder, you may begin.Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Veris Residential's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to remind everyone that certain information discussed on this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.Although we believe the estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved. We refer you to the company's press release and annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for risk factors that impact the company.With that, I would like to hand the call over to Mahbod Nia, Veris Residential's Chief Executive Officer, who is joined by Amanda Lombard, Chief Financial Officer. MahbodThank you, Taryn, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continue to build upon the strong results we delivered during the first half of the year. Since redeeming Rockpoint s preferred interest in July, we ve closed on the sales of four non-strategic asset releasing a  122 million of net proceeds which were used to repay the balance of the termOperationally, we continue to outperform during the third quarter achieving a blended same-store net rental growth rate ofThe  122 million of non-strategic assets closed since the end of the second quarter versus the total value of transactions closed this year worth  0.5 billion, specifically the most recent transactions completed include two further office buildings, Harborside 6 and 23 Main Street and two Land plots Harborside 4 and 3 Campus.The net proceeds realised from these sales combined with the excess cash flow from our now positive cash flowing operations and activities from the refinancing of Haus25 enabled us to fully repay the balance of our term loan and revolving credit facility in just three months resulting a substantial interest expense saving in the process.107 Morgan and 2 Campus remain on the binding contract and are anticipated to provide the company with additional liquidity upon closing.  Indiscernible  operations during the quarter same-store occupancy and our retention rates remain stable at 95.5  and 55  respectively. The blended same-store net rental growth rate remains strong at 9.3 , despite the end of the third quarter typically marking the start of a slower leasing season across the multifamily sector, and rent increases being based on high growth periods from 2022. While we anticipate further cooling of rents consistent with peers, we believe our highly amenitized Class A portfolio continues to be well positioned for the less active winter leasing season.Our continued outperformance relative to the broader market which saw rents rise by only 1  nationally year-over-year, and by 5  in New Jersey, reflects the resilient demand for our high quality Class A portfolio, and the strength of our operational platform in capturing that demand, approximately 30  of which was comprised of move-ins from New York City.Furthermore, new supply in the Jersey City waterfront market continues to be muted, with very few new deliveries expected in the next 18 to 24 months. The sustained revenue growth we achieved during the quarter coupled with our continued focus on expense management contributed to a 17.1  growth in same-store NOI compared to the third quarter of 2022, representing an additional  17.9 million of NOI generated in the nine months ended September 30th, excluding the significant contribution from Haus25. This continued outperformance is reflected in our decision to once again raise NOI guidance to 14  to 15 . Amanda will discuss this in further detail.As one of our industry leaders in ESG, we were proud to be named global listed and regional sector leaders by the 2023 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB, earlier this month. Despite 2023 being only the second year in which we participated in the benchmark, we once again earned a five-star rating for our performance, a testament to our ongoing commitment to sustainable operations, diversity, and the advancement of ESG action in supporting the wellbeing of our residents, employees, suppliers, and communities.With that, I'm going to hand it over to Amanda, who will provide an update on our financial performance during the quarter.Thanks, Mahbod. For the third quarter of 2023, net loss available to common shareholders was  0.60 per fully diluted share versus a net loss of  1.10 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of last year. The third quarter of 2023 includes interest costs of mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest of  35 million, or approximately  0.35 per share, related to the buyout of Rockpoint as we detailed last quarter.Core FFO per share was  0.12 for the third quarter as compared to  0.16 last quarter. The second quarter was positively impacted by two non-recurring items,  0.02 from the settlement of two real estate tax appeals and  0.03 from the IRBY  Ph  tax credit, which we typically receive in the second quarter.AFFO per share was  0.15 as compared to  0.18 last quarter for the same reason. Same-store NOI was up over 17  compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting 10.5  revenue growth and our continued efforts to mitigate property-level expense inflation. Controllable expenses were up 6.4  quarter-over-quarter due to higher costs related to the peak leasing season. However, year-over-year, controllable expenses ticked up only slightly, from 2.6  to 3.9 .Our non-controllable expenses continue to be variable period to period. This quarter, we renewed our property insurance, and while our insurance premiums increased by approximately 30  from the prior year, a reduction in our self-insurance based upon our annual review of that program offset the increase.In addition, real estate taxes, as compared to the prior quarter, are up significantly as a result of the  2.7 million favorable adjustment in Q2 related to the resolution of tax appeals, which was slightly offset this quarter by an increase of  0.5 million related to the finalization of Jersey City 2023 taxes.Next quarter, we expect that non-controllable expenses will be approximately half a penny higher than this quarter on a run rate basis. In regards to our general and administrative costs, after adjustments for non-cash stock compensation along with severance payments, G A was down to 8.7 million for the quarter. The fourth quarter may be slightly higher than the third quarter due to various costs that occur regularly in that quarter. However, overall, we remain on track to record the lowest level of G A in nominal terms in over a decade, and the lowest when adjusted for inflation since the 90s.On to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we entered into a transitional term loan and credit facility to complete the negotiated redemption of Rockpoint's preferred interest in Veris Residential Trust. The balance of these facilities was repaid in just three months using net proceeds from  122 million of recently closed non-strategic asset sales.Excess proceeds from the refinancing of Haus25 surplus cash flow from our now cash generative operations. We proactively refinanced Haus25, a fourth quarter 2024 maturity at an interest rate of 5.46 , reducing the cost on this loan by 124 basis points. As a result of this, we were able to increase the weighted average maturity of our total debt portfolio from 2.6 to four years while improving our maturity ladder with no more than 23  of our portfolio due in any given year, and an average of 15  maturing per annum over the next five years.As of October 24th, effectively all of our debt is fixed and or hedged with the latest refinancing s, which constituted 14  of our overall debt stack, increasing our weighted average interest rate marginally from 4.4  to 4.5 . While our net debt to EBITDA remains sensitive to earnings and prone to fluctuation, it is gradually trending down to 12.4 times pro forma for the recent repayment of the transitional loan. As we have prioritized that repayment, having reduced net debt by approximately  1 billion in addition to the redemption of Rockpoint's  520 million preferred interest since the end of 2020.Looking ahead at our upcoming consolidated maturities, Veris has  308 million of mortgages we expect to be refinanced as we move into 2024. While the commercial real estate debt markets are constrained there remains demand to lend for high quality multifamily assets like ours as evidenced by the recent financing.Accordingly, we anticipate utilizing cash flow from operations and proceeds from continued non-strategic asset sales to reduce our leverage on these loans as we refinance them to the extent required or as otherwise determined by the board and management.Turning to our outlook, as Mahbod mentioned, our portfolio's performance has provided us with the flexibility to raise our same-store NOI guidance range to 14 to 15  from 10  to 12 . This is largely driven by higher than expected market rent growth, which we expect to be in the range of 9  to 10  and better than expected outcomes on insurance and real estate tax renewals. We project expenses will end the year in the range of 2  to 3 .This concludes another strong quarter for Veris Residential during which we continue to demonstrate multifamily outperformance and advance the completion of non-strategic asset sales while further strengthening our balance sheet. With that, we are ready to open the line for questions.Thank you.  Operator Instructions  As a reminder -- the first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi Research. Please go ahead.Thanks. It s actually Nick Joseph here for Eric. Maybe just starting on the operating portfolio, can you touch on where you are seeing new lease rate growth today in October and then where renewals kind of are trending for October and then spent out for November and DecemberSure. Good morning, Nick. Thank you for the question. So we said last quarter that we expected rents to moderate now. We've had very strong rental growth, double-digit rental growth. If that's not sustainable in perpetuity, we indicated that we'd be in the mid-to-high-single-digit range going forward. You've seen us come in at the high end of that. I do think that will further moderate to somewhere in the mid-single-digit, which is much more, let's say, indicative of longer-term growth rates.Thanks. Is there anything you're seeing in terms of rent-to-income or any other affordability metrics that are impacting it, or is it just more normal seasonality and just coming off of such high rent growthYes, it's actually the two latter points that you made. So from an affordability standpoint, we actually remain in very good shape. We've seen good income growth. There was obviously some commentary about that slowing down more generally, but we've seen that sustained at around 15  or even actually slightly below 15  now in terms of rent-to-net disposable income. It's more a function of you're now lapping periods of extremely high rent growth, and that's just not sustainable. And we've also entered now the seasonally tougher period when it comes to the multifamily sector on the whole.Great, thanks. And then just on the insurance renewal, can you quantify the reduction in the self-insuranceSure, this is Amanda. I think as I said earlier, it's about half a penny that you'll see our non-controllable expenses go up next quarter. So I think that's what you can expect.Okay, thank you.Thanks, Nick.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Yes, thanks, good morning. Mahbod, now that you've, I guess, essentially completed kind of the clean-up of all the non-core assets, Rockpoint, you're really down to just one office property. I guess, how are you sort of looking at the organization as you think about moving forward as a standalone enterprise realizing that a monetization event's kind of out of your control  But how are you thinking about the organization, the people in place, and what else do you need to do to make this a best-in-class apartment companyGood morning, Steve, thank you. That's a great question and something that we've been giving a lot of thought to ourselves as well. The last three years, I would describe as the transformation phase where we've sold over  2 billion of non-strategic assets, but on the office and really tried to get ahead of that, exiting an asset class that is not strategic to us and pivoting to an asset class whereby we continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals and is very much core to our business. There's a little bit more to do, as you highlighted, in Harborside 5, and that's not insignificant given it's an unlevered office building and has substantial equity trapped in it. But the transformation phase is effectively over. What I would describe this next phase as is the optimization phase.And there we do have a number of levers available to us, a number of initiatives to allow us to now be able to really optimize what we have in this pure play multifamily platform and organically seek to continue enhancing its value. A number of different prongs to that, and we're evaluating those at this time, working with the board. Some of it will involve some further simplification that could touch on corporate structure, capital structure, and other areas. A large part of it is capital allocation. If you think about the capital within the business today, there is still significant amounts of equity that is either idle or generating a suboptimal return for us.And so reallocating that capital to a higher and more accretive use really has the potential to continue driving the top line and flow down to the bottom line for us. Going forward, given the size of the business, there are other areas potentially, we're looking at a couple of, on the whole we have a very young portfolio as you know, but there are one or two areas where we think there could be potential value add opportunities and continued operational efficiencies, all of which together really do have the potential to continue driving or enhancing value of the platform in this next optimization phase.But I guess as a, just maybe a quick follow-up, do you feel like you have kind of the right people in place to sort of make all these changes and steps or do you feel like you still need to add to the organizationNo, absolutely not. We've got a lean but very effective team as you've seen. To date, we've gone a long way towards rebuilding the operational side of things as well. So no, I'm very comfortable with the team that we've got that we can execute on this next optimization phase.Okay, and then there's been some articles about kind of rent control coming up in Jersey City and maybe some of the surrounding communities. Can you maybe just sort of speak to, I know it's a very complicated and long-winded answer and longer than this conference call, but just maybe high level, how are you sort of thinking about the rent control within kind of the market in your portfolio and are there things that you need to do to make sure that you follow kind of all the rules and regulations  Or is there any risk about rent control being imposed on any part of the portfolioSure. Look, we believe that we've taken all the necessary and appropriate steps to preserve the available exemptions from rent control ordinances, which may be applicable to the properties in our portfolio. We're, I'd say, in a fortunate position that we have a younger vintage portfolio that helps in that respect and that we've developed most of those assets and so feel comfortable with the position we're in.Great, thanks. That's it for me.Thanks, Steve.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Thank you. I guess first question is around non-core. Beyond Harborside 5, it does sound like you still have some things that you might consider getting rid of. Can you maybe just talk a bit more about what those might be and where there might even be liquidity that's acceptable to pursue other sales right now in the marketSure, good morning. Yes, Harborside 5 is the obvious non-strategic one. The question really beyond that is do we seek to potentially further rationalize the land bank which to the extent not developed really is just idle equity again in the business that isn't really generating a return. So that's really what I was primarily referencing with that comment. But there are further potential pockets of capital as well. If you look at the joint ventures, the remaining joint ventures where we may seek to reallocate some of that capital over time to put it to a higher and better use and a more accretive use.Okay, and then on the core, to appreciate just the strength and the rent growth in your market and what you've done operationally. I mean, the numbers are just outsized. Can you maybe just give us a sense as you look back over the last few quarters how much that's really just been the market versus just efforts you've made to hunker down either and change how you price or be more aggressive there or just on the operation side and just trying to understand maybe how much more runway might exist there if that was a big part of thisIt's a great question. Look, if you look at the New Jersey overall rental growth during this period, it was around 5 . We've come in at 9 . I do think that the quality of the assets is second to none. And I do believe we have gone a long way towards rebuilding the operational platform with new people, new processes, new technology, and that's an ongoing effort. So it's difficult to say how much of that is property, how much of it is people, how much of it is market, but the combination on the whole is what's delivering the results that you're seeing. And we do feel there's still some room to go there on the operational side to continue improving. It's an ever-evolving initiative. And so we're fortunate that we have great assets in great markets with supply-demand dynamics that put us in a very favorable position for the foreseeable future. And we have a team that is highly focused and capable in extracting the value from those assets.Okay, and just one follow-up. I think maybe it was perhaps mixed in with Nick's question earlier, but where are you sending renewal notices out todayI think you should assume for the next couple of months we'll land up in the mid-single digit, maybe a touch above that level.Okay, thank you. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Hey guys, thanks for the time. Just wanted to follow up on that operating platform initiative that you mentioned. I guess what's the main focus that you want to improve over the next 12 months and maybe what kind of benefit might we see from our perspectiveWell, good morning. You've seen already some of the benefits come through and the way we go about revenue management and the way we go about expense management. So you've seen that in how we price things and driving the top line, but you've also seen it in the improvement in our margins year-over-year. And that was really what I was alluding to is that there is, I do believe there's still some further room to go and we will update in due course what some of those steps are that we've taken or plan to take, but they're really centered around continuing to drive the top line, optimize and seek to mitigate the expense side of things, doing things differently, more efficiently, and utilizing technology where warranted to help us in achieving our goals there.Okay, and then I see there's some debt coming due in 2024. I guess, just what's the plan with that, that refi or just pay down or how are you thinking about it  And maybe if it's a refi, what kind of rate you'd sayWell, you've seen with the two refinancing that we just announced that despite the real estate commercial real estate debt markets being challenging at the moment, there is still liquidity available and there's appetite to lend on high quality assets such as ours. And so the two assets you're referring to for next year, those are high quality, very well-performing properties that we also anticipate getting attractive bids on. And so consistent with our approach this past quarter, you should assume that we'll be proactive and at the appropriate time, look at options available to us to refinance those.To the extent that we choose to or require to somewhat pay down those loans, we're also in a position of strength now and having liquidity available to us today, liquidity that we anticipate coming through the closing of remaining non-strategic assets that are under contract and potentially further assets beyond that. And the business itself is now cash flow generative and so that gives us another source as well to the extent we choose to or require to do something of a pay down on those.Thank you.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.Thanks and good morning, everybody. Maybe starting with Amanda, you had mentioned using the remaining or at least some of the remaining proceeds for the asset sales that are still under contract as you go to refinance the 300 plus million dollars that are maturing. When you finish those roughly 71 million of sales, that'll put you roughly at  90 million of cash. Do you have all of that earmarked for debt reductions or do you think you'll have some remaining for other sources and usesI'll take that if that's okay and then Amanda can chime in. So today, from a liquidity standpoint, we also have the line. So there's around  90 million of liquidity,  71 million of assets under binding contract today. That said, there's also cash flow coming off of the operation, surplus cash flow coming off of the operations that's adding to that and potentially further non-strategic assets that could be sold between now and next year that could further add to that. So there are plenty of sources available in the pot and I think over these coming months, we'll be working with the board to determine the highest and best use for that capital. Rates being where they are today, one would rightly assume that debt repayment would be a very accretive and appropriate use of any capital that's freed up, but that's something that we'll work with the board to ultimately determine and it could be a combination of things or it could go towards that repayment.Got it. And then, Mahbod you'd mentioned moving from in the response to Steve's question, moving from this transformation period to this optimization period. When we think of the rebranding and severance costs, that kind of cycle that you've gone through during the transformation period, now that you're in that optimization phase, do you think we're closer to that clean G A run rate or is there still some remaining or rebranding expense that you think is going to run through that line over the coming yearIt's going to take a little while to settle and not necessarily in relation to the rebranding, but more generally, just to give you an example, so repayment of Rockpoint, we've talked about how that will result in anticipated cost savings related to obligations we had with regard to that partnership that will cease to exist going to next year. Some of those things, it just takes time to work through and actually probably won't really come through into the numbers until back end of next year or second half of next year. And then between now and then, we also have factors outside of our control, such as inflation, which seems to be moderating at this point, but it still has an impact.So it's difficult to give you guidance on a run rate G A, but what I would say is it has come down a lot. We've now brought it down to the lowest level in a decade and actually in real terms, since the 90s. If you look at us, which is the only appropriate way to look at us, given scale is the most significant factor in looking at the various metrics when assessing G A, if you look at us relative to the mid cap is the percentage of gross asset value, which is really the asset base that we have to manage, we're right at the median there.And so I think gone a long way, potentially have some more to go, but also combating inflation and factors that are outside of our control, very difficult to give you a run rate at this stage.And the other thing is just the business is not, as we go through this optimization phase, there'll be pushes and pulls there as well. The reality is that we just haven't reached a mature stage as a pure play multifamily company where you could say, right, that is a mature cost structure. Capital allocation side of it has been addressed. So the revenue side of it is predominantly going to be driven by rents and rates. There are still things even that on the capital allocation side, if you just only think about the land, which is just over  200 million and Harborside 5 and several hundred million dollars, as I mentioned in joint ventures, that isn't all necessarily generating an appropriate return for us, but even between Harborside 5 and the land, that's  300 million that really isn't generating a return.And for a company of our size, that's meaningful having that much idle capital. And so I think the primary driver is going to be capital allocation, but other things we can do as well on the expense side before it reaches a mature state as a business. And until then, it's difficult to give that kind of guidance.Understood. I appreciate that. And then last one for me, you've obviously been at the forefront when it comes to ESG and integrating that into the company and platform. What's next on the sustainability front  You obviously have a modern portfolio, but do you have any near term CapEx plans when it comes to either reducing energy consumption or carbon emissions or anything else along that frontYes, everything I would say to date, the approach remains the same and it's a never evolving initiative. And so everything we've done and everything we continue to do, we evaluate based on a number of different factors, but ultimately it comes down to return on invested capital. And so either there's a direct return on invested capital, whereby we know by, for example, seeking an alternative to traditional heating systems, it may be that we have energy savings that result in a payoff of five years or whatever it may be, and we'll evaluate whether it makes sense to look at alternatives based on that return on invested capital and payoff periods, or to a lesser degree, it would have an intangible, but real benefit to the business when it comes to brand or retention rates and really differentiates us from the peers.So the approach is actually largely similar to any other CapEx that we spent. Every dollar of CapEx that we spend, the team presents based on a return on invested capital approach and we evaluate whether that's a sufficient return on that capital or not and we make decisions accordingly.Understood. Appreciate the answers, Mahbod. Thanks everyone.Thanks, Tom.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robin Liu  Ph  with Green Street. Please go ahead.Hi, good morning. Just want to get back on the question on rent control. Are you sensing local municipalities are cranking down on landlords and their adherence to rent control rules  Are you hearing the policy makers are maybe perhaps looking at tightening rules furtherGood morning, Robin. Difficult for me to comment on that. The only thing I can state is what I mentioned earlier, which is that we believe we've taken the necessary steps, necessary and appropriate steps to preserve the available exemptions from rent control ordinances across our portfolio. And so it's a very, that's a very property specific and jurisdiction specific thing, townships within New Jersey. So I can only comment on what we've done across our portfolio. I don't really know. It's hard for me to comment on where that goes more broadly.Okay, thank you for that. And then do you mind providing color on the preferred interest redemption in October  What drove the LP to redeem at a time when I guess operating fundamentals are still pretty healthy across your portfolioAgain, hard for me to comment on that, Robin. It's their decision. You'd need to ask them. They've had the ability to redeem and chose to redeem it at this time. So it's hard for me to comment what that related to. It would be some sort of, I guess, a requirement for the capital from their side, but I'm not sure. HelloYes.Are you done with your questionsYes, thank you.Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mahbod Nia for closing comments.Thank you everyone for joining us today. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter for Veris Residential and look forward to updating you again in due course.Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",0,2023-10-26T13:37:08.000-04:00

SQM: The Future Of Lithium Amidst The Energy Transition,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.  is priced at 5x this year's EPS. Anyone looking at this stock will immediately recognize that it's cheaply valued. So, this consideration is not the main factor that's weighing onThe problem with this stock is that there's so much uncertainty priced in. Undoubtedly, some aspects are worthy elements that  priced in.Demand for lithium is going to massively increase in the next few years. Accordingly, the long-term thesis is clearly intact. However, a combination of risk-off investor sentiment, together with a slowdown in the energy transition is overwhelmingly impacting the stock.Here I shine a light on why investors are eschewing this stock. Ultimately, even though there are some aspects that should be factored in, I believe that at 5x this year'sWhat's the energy transition  Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it was clear. Is the energy transition when we stopped using wood and dung and started to use coal as the primary energy source  Or is the energy transition when we started to use Diesel oil for mobility  Or perhaps, the energy transition was when we started to increase our usage of natural gas for electricity generation, heating, and cookingPerhaps, the energy transition is in the future, when we use a greater proportion of our primary energy supply from solar panels and wind turbines  Do you see the point I'm making here  That we are always transiting from one source of energy to another.Everyone talks about the energy transition as if it happens overnight. But the fact of the matter is that while we have energy transitions, they take time. And what do investors absolutely hate nearly as much as bad news  UncertaintyNot knowing how long we'll have to wait to get paid. And I get it. With the share price going up, nobody is going to bother with difficult questions.But when the share price starts to move south, everything that was an uncertainty before becomes bad news. Now.Investors' time horizons shorten, and unless something is expected to go up within the next 12 months with a high degree of certainty, investors lose patience.I'm not saying that SQM is unquestionably a good investment. I for one, invested with Albemarle   disclosure  I'm long ALB . Admittedly, both companies have been terrible performers in 2023.There's no clearer sign of investors' capitulation than the right side of the chart consistently moving down day after day, without respite.The top concern is the most obvious, and can even be discerned in the company's name. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile. When investors are risk-seeking, investing in Chile is a compelling opportunity. It's a fast-growing company, that's strategically located in Chile, which grants it access to abundant lithium resources and cost-effective mining operations.But when interest rates are high, plus investors' temperaments mercurial, all that investors can think about are the political and regulatory risks that arise due to the company's operations in Chile, not to mention the likely overreaching government policies that may capture some of the company's profits.80  of SQM's gross profits are tied to lithium's prospects. If lithium regains its footing, SQM will do well. And in time, lithium's prospects will improve.Lithium prices have fallen by around 70  in the past year. This has for the most part been brought about by the sustainable climb in prices in the previous 2 years.Again, the overall energy transition story is still very much intact. Demand for lithium is expected to increase in the future, primarily driven by the growing adoption of EVs and the expansion of renewable energy storage systems.As automakers worldwide increasingly shift towards EV production to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements, lithium-ion batteries, will play a pivotal role in powering these vehicles.Additionally, the renewable energy sector's need for energy storage solutions to stabilize  will further boost lithium demand, making it a crucial element in the energy transition.Moreover, lithium demand for energy storage solutions aimed at grid stabilization is on the rise as utilities and the grid seek reliable methods to store excess energy and balance supply and demand, especially given the increasing amount of integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar into the grid.I contend that lithium batteries have gained prominence in this role due to their efficiency, rapid response times, and ability to store and discharge electricity when needed, contributing to grid stability.I have a cautiously optimistic outlook on SQM. While it's trading at an attractive 5 times this year's EPS, there are notable near-term uncertainties and doubts that need consideration.The demand for lithium, while poised for substantial growth in the long run due to the shift towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, has faced recent setbacks, leading to a substantial drop in lithium prices and creating short-term volatility.Additionally, SQM's exposure to political and regulatory risks in Chile, coupled with market uncertainties, may dampen investor sentiment in the short term.However, the fundamental strength of SQM's lithium production and its strategic position in the industry suggest a potentially brighter future once these near-term challenges are navigated.My Marketplace highlights a portfolio of undervalued investment opportunities - stocks with rapid growth potential, driven by top quality management, while these stocks are cheaply valued.I follow countless companies and .

Flexible Solutions And Its Real Value,"  appears poised to take off in the near future. Despite not living up to the latest earnings report projections, FSI's CEO Mr. Daniel B. O'Brien remains optimistic about their growth. After all, FSI's Energy andSpecifically, FSI's main product lineup includes biodegradable polymers, detergent ingredients, water treatment, and crop nutrient availability chemistry. Flexible Solutions also manufactures biodegradable and environmentally safe water and energy conservation technologies. As touched on, it appears that the key to FSI reaching target earnings is continuing to develop their products and markets. This is auspicious news for FSI, as countries around the globe are treatingIn fact, one of the United Nations Sustainable Development  is providing safe, affordable water to all by 2030. As a result, Flexible Solutions will look to capitalize on a market primed with demand for their products. Additionally, it's worth noting that FSI reportedly has many products that are not yet commercialized.Year to date, the Specialty Chemicals market that FSI operates in has risen 3.1 . This upward trend is encouraging for the market, and follows news trends as we would expect to see. It's given this market outlook, and FSI's wide variety of product applications in this space, that FSI appears to be an attractive company to consider current investment in, before the capabilities of their products are fully realized.When considering these current stories about FSI, we need to determine which news topics will have a long-term and ongoing effect on the company and its share price. While reports of underperforming earnings may hurt the company in the short term, FSI's product development and continuous addition of product applications should have a more long-term and positive impact on the company and its earnings potential.While current news stories, good or bad, can sway our opinion about investing in a company, it's good to analyze the fundamentals of the company and to see where it's been in the past and in which direction it's heading.This article will focus on the long-term fundamentals of Flexible Solutions International, which tend to give us a better picture of the company as a viable investment. I also analyze the value of the company versus the price and help you to determine if FSI is currently trading at a bargain price. I provide various situations which help estimate the company's future returns. In closing, I will tell you my personal opinion about whether I'm interested in taking a position in this company and why. FSI currently has a company rating score of 79.4 out of 100. To summarize, FSI appears to have several fundamentals producing above average numbers, with only two unfavorable scores bringing down their overall company rating.Before jumping to conclusions, we'll have to look closer into individual categories to see what's going on.Let's examine the price per share history first. In the chart below, we can see that price per share has been on an upward trend over the last 10 years. Overall, share price average has grown by about 226.67  over the past 10 years, or a Compound Annual Growth Rate  CAGR  of 14.06 . This is a respectable return.Looking closer at earnings history, we see earnings have been on an upward trend of growth over the last 10 years. It's worth noting that of the last 10 years, there have only been 3 years in which the earnings did not rise, and in each of these cases, earnings rose again substantially the year after. Most recently, FSI saw its largest earnings increase to date, from 2021 to 2022.This large earnings spike in 2022 is encouraging for FSI, and could be attributed to the United Nations goal touched on earlier. As we get closer to 2030, the UN's goal date to ensure availability and sustainability management of water for everyone, FSI earnings should continue trending increasingly upward. While earnings over the next 8 years may not be as drastic as the increase from 2021 to 2022 was, general upward movement is predicted.Consistent earnings make it easier to accurately estimate the future growth and value of the company. So, in this regard, FSI is a good example of a stock to accurately estimate future growth or current value.Since earnings and price per share don't always give the whole picture,  The most recent decrease in ROE occurred in 2019. After this decrease, it rebounded significantly the following year, holding at this level in 2021 as well. Most recently, ROE has risen 63.22  in 2022, for a total ROE increase of 122.30  since 2019. For return on equity, I look for a 5-year average of 16  or more. Hence, FSI meets this requirement. the ROE of this company to its industry. The average ROE of 76 Specialty Chemical companies is 11.43 .Therefore, both  ROIC fell in 2019, before rebounding the year after. ROIC recorded the same spike upwards in 2022 as well, with a 20.01  ROIC that year. For return on invested capital  ROIC , I also look for a 5-year average of 16  or more. FSI narrowly misses this average, recording at 13 . GMP greatly rose in 2021, but then fell by even more, nearly 9 , in 2022. Even with the decline, however, overall gross margin percent is at high levels. Five-year GMP is good at around 31.5 . I typically look for companies with gross margin percent consistently above 30 . So, FSI has proven that it has the ability to maintain acceptable margins over a long period. However, I would like to keep an eye on the GMP to make sure that there is not a continual downward trend., we can see that the debt-to-equity is less than 1. This is a positive indicator, telling us that the company owns more than it owes.FSI's Current Ratio of 3.00 is satisfactory, indicating it has an adequate ability to use its assets to pay its short-term debt.Ideally, we'd want to see a Current Ratio of more than 1, so FSI exceeds this amount.According to the balance sheet, the company appears to be in good financial health. In the long term, the company has more than enough assets to cover its debts. In the short term, the company is generating enough cash flow to fulfill its obligations.FSI doesn't pay a regular dividend, but it does have a history of occasionally paying a dividend.This analysis wouldn't be complete without considering the value of the company vs. share price.The company's  when comparing FSI's PE Ratio to a long-term market average P E Ratio of 15.The 10-year and 5-year average P E Ratio of FSI has typically been 10.3 and 13.4, respectively. This indicates that FSI could be currently trading at a low price when comparing to its average historical P E Ratio range.The Estimated Value of the Stock is  4.19, versus the current stock price of  2.70. This indicates that FSI is currently selling at a bargain price.For more detailed valuation purposes, I will be using a conservative diluted EPS of 0.44. I've used various past averages of growth rates and PE Ratios to calculate different scenarios of valuation ranges from low to average values. The valuations compare growth rates of EPS, Book Value, and Total Equity.In the table below, you can see the different scenarios, and in the chart, you will see vertical valuation lines that correspond to the table valuation ranges. The dots on the lines represent the current stock price. If the dot is towards the bottom of the valuation range, this would indicate that the stock is undervalued. If the dot is near the top of the valuation line, this would show an overvalued stock.According to the facts, Flexible Solutions International, Inc. is financially healthy in a long-term sense in having enough equity as compared with debt, and in the short-term sense because the current ratio indicates that it has plenty of cash to cover current liabilities.This company has an impressive earnings record, which shows upward improvement of earnings over a 10-year period.Another consideration is that FSI's wide range of environmentally-friendly and energy-conservative products will see an increase in demand in the coming months and years. With world leaders across the globe pledging support to the environment by taking steps to limit energy consumption and prioritize water conservation, the demand for FSI's products should only rise.Now, let's see how FSI compares versus the U.S. stock market benchmark S P 500  over the past 10 years. From the chart below, we can see that the general market has outperformed FSI during a majority of the 10-year period. FSI, however, has shown remarkable resistance to down markets, and has seen encouragingly steady upward movement over the last 10 years. Notice that FSI has a repeated pattern of spikes and valleys that follow along with the benchmark. This pattern of volatility makes FSI an opportune stock to buy during the dips when FSI falls significantly in relation to the benchmark, then to sell when FSI peaks significantly above the benchmark performance.In addition, the average one-year price target for this stock is at  6.00, which is about a 122.22  increase in a year.The Expected Annual Compounding Rate of Return is 17.81 .If considering actual past results of FSI Company, the story is a bit different. Here are the actual 10 and 5-year return results.Initial Investment Date  8 30 2013.End Date  8 30 2023.Cost per Share   1.13.End Date Price   2.65.Dividends Received   0.15.Total Return  147.79 .Initial Investment Date  8 30 2018.End Date  8 30 2023.Cost per Share   1.50.End Date Price   2.65.Dividends Received   0.15.Total Return  86.67 ._________________From these scenarios, we have produced results from 10  to 13 . I feel that if you're a long-term patient investor and believer in FSI, and its existing products  polymers and water treatment , you could expect FSI to provide you with an average of 12  annual return over the long haul. But, if you're able to take advantage of FSI's pattern of price swings and buy when it's low in relation to the S P 500 and sell when it has peaked above the S P 500, you could experience gains near 20 .Overall, I'm impressed with the fundamentals of FSI. The return is as good or better than the S P 500 benchmark. I feel that when bought at a bargain price, the returns in Flexible Solutions can far exceed the benchmark. Additionally, I see plenty of potential growth for this small company and its involvement in the water conservation niche. Therefore, I'm interested in obtaining shares of Flexible Solutions International, Inc.Editor's Note  This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Billionaire Ray Dalio Says '50% Chance Of World War' - How To Invest?,"Billionaire Hedge Fund tycoon Ray Dalio - in a recent LinkedIn  titled  Another Step Toward International War  - offered some sobering takeaways from the escalating geopolitical conflicts involving Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine. Dalio underscored that these are notIn this article, we will look further at his reasoning behind this stark assertion, evaluate the potential damage that such a conflict would cause to the global economy, and share how weMr. Dalio's thesis draws on parallels between the current geopolitical climate and the periods preceding the two World Wars in the 20th century. He emphasizes that the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts have transitioned from pre-hot-war conflicts to uncontained hot wars, which will likely be brutal and protracted until one side decisively triumphs over the other. Furthermore, Dalio warns that these conflicts have the potential to spread and escalate, involving more countries and potentially leading to a world war if major powers like the US and China are drawn into direct conflict with each other.He believes that the conflicts involving Israel, Hamas, Ukraine, and Russia are - just like in the periods preceding the past two world wars - symptomatic of larger great power conflicts that will significantly impact countries allied with these nations. He suggests that the US is already indirectly engaged in these conflicts, fighting proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East while also preparing for potential conflict in East Asia. The spreading of these wars will not only be costly but will also risk drawing non-combatant nations into the fray, thereby expanding the scope and scale of the conflicts.In terms of solutions, Dalio's idealistic  pipe dream  would be for world leaders to recognize the catastrophic potential of hot wars and collaboratively establish pathways and processes to minimize the chances of such conflicts developing. Apart from that increasingly unlikely solution materializing, however, it appears to be only a matter of time before hot conflict between the world's major military and economic powers breaks out.For stock market investors, the implications of a global war would likely be devastating. The escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the potential for them to spiral into a larger, more widespread war could introduce significant volatility and risk into global markets.While the death and destruction that such a global conflict would cause are reason enough to shudder at the idea that they are growing increasingly likely, the economic fallout would be catastrophic as well given how interconnected the global economy has become. A war pitting China against the United States  and undoubtedly involving Taiwan as well  is anticipated to unleash severe repercussions on the global economy and some  put the damage at a 5  contraction of the  23 trillion US economy, marking the worst decline since the Great Depression. The stock markets in the U.S. and around the world would undoubtedly crash, likely surpassing even the 50  drop in the S P 500  and Nasdaq  witnessed during the 2007-2009 Great Financial Crisis and recession. If the market capitalization of the S P 500 were to be halved, it would wipe out around  18 trillion in wealth, which is equivalent to roughly two-thirds of the United States' current GDP. Some  even put a 10  GDP decline as probable in this scenario, which equates to a  2.5 trillion hit to annual economic output, triggering mass layoffs and plummeting consumption rates.Of course, a significant casualty in this conflict that would drive much of the global economic chaos in its wake would be the semiconductor industry given that Taiwan is a critical player in global semiconductor production . A major disruption of Taiwan's semiconductor exports to the world's major economies is estimated to potentially eliminate  1.6 trillion in corporate annual revenue. Moreover, the supply chain restructuring required in response to a potential conflict like this would easily surpass the adjustments witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Apple , Caterpillar , GM , Ford , Tesla , and Starbucks , among others, deriving substantial revenues from China.On the other hand, the economic effects would be even more severe for China and its companies like Alibaba  and Nio  due to disrupted trade which would dramatically reduce its exports, cut off access to advanced Western technology and investment capital, and potentially lead to a crisis level shortage of key commodities such as energy, copper, food, and iron ore, exacerbating internal political instability.Overall, the conflict would likely trigger a global depression owing to the intertwined nature of the US and Chinese economies with the rest of the world's economies. Companies, regardless of their national origin, would suffer from supply chain disruptions, impacting consumer and business investments globally.With such scary scenarios becoming increasingly likely, how are investors supposed to position themselves  It may be prudent for some to take advantage of elevated interest rates and hunker down completely in safe havens like investment grade bonds , treasuries , land , gold , and perhaps for the bold, even Bitcoin . Maybe even a small short position  on the S P 500 might make sense given how overvalued the market is right now according to .However, as an investor who is able to take on a bit more risk in pursuit of higher long-term total returns, yet still wants my portfolio to not suffer a complete wipeout in the event of World War 3 breaking out this decade, I am investing increasingly in the following types of securitiesBy investing in these assets today, I believe that I am positioning my portfolio to deliver attractive current income and risk-adjusted total returns regardless if World War 3 ends up materializing in the near future or not.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Crescent Point Energy: Refocus Almost Complete,"  recently announced a disposition of the United States operations for . In the future, the company will have only Canadian operations and . ThisThe  areas present an attractive payback period on at least some of the acreage. In addition, management has reduced debt to the point where there is an option to cease drilling and completion activities during times of hostile industry environments to wait for a cyclical recovery.This presentation may well mark the end of a period where the whole company portfolio was totally rearranged. By this, I mean there were billions of acreages purchased and nearlyManagement now has a very profitable choice of what to develop for the foreseeable future. The company is now far more financially strong with a lot of options in the future. This was a zombie corporation years ago when this management took over. That is clearly not the case anymore.Furthermore, at least some of these areas have stacked possibilities for future development as technology continues to advance and add more acreage to the important  Tier 1  classification that is so attractive to the market.The only complication is that all the acquisitions and dispositions have made quarterly and annual comparisons just about impossible.Anytime an investor sees this much activity, it makes comparability a lot of work if it is even possible. The reason is that there are usually significant amounts of production in a fiscal year that is not in the comparable time period. When still more happens, the issue gets compounded to the point that Mr. Market just gives up.Keep in mind that this was a debt heavy corporation when management took over. Many thought that it had seen its better days  to say the least . Now, you have a cash flow generating juggernaut with a conservative debt ratio. Few believed it was possible when we first looked at the company. Management has done a tremendous job. However, there is no track record for the company as it is now.As a result, a stock like this may need some history as it is currently put together. Therefore, the market is likely to assign a discount that slowly fades as management demonstrates the ability to run the  new  company.Fortunately, the very strong  allows for unforeseen challenges should they appear. In the meantime, it is far more likely that management needs a couple of years to optimize the operation of the newly combined acreage.The reason that optimization does not happen overnight is because the sizable acquisition needs time for any optimization efforts to become significant, and it also needs time for any higher cost wells to decline in importance to the company reporting.Many of these companies report superior well design and completion techniques as technology moves on. But it takes time for enough of those wells to be drilled and start producing before the quarterly reports actually demonstrate the benefits management presents as actually existing.Management hopes to increase company profitability in the future. Some of that hope will end up keeping the company profitable during times when other competitors cannot drill wells profitably. The new acreage will also likely lower the company's breakeven point over time as well.But the key is that if the wells are as profitable as management states, then drilling and completion will be profitable at a time when service companies are competing for business  cyclical bottoms . That could provide yet another cost advantage that lasts for the life of the wells drilled. In fact, it can be as good as any competitive moat that other industries desire.The end result for shareholders is a more defensible base dividend, along with the opportunity for variable shareholder returns that are proportionately greater during the good times.Another huge consideration is that current commodity prices are likely higher than the assumptions may during the negotiations for the properties purchased. That alone, if the high prices persist for a significant amount of time  or management hedges those prices  could significantly raise the return above what management expects. The time value of money means that money received now  from high commodity prices  is more valuable than money received later.Investors should expect that this relatively large producer should grow in the single digit range in the future. That growth will likely be augmented with an occasional opportunistic acquisition.Any management that turns a zombie corporation into a cash flow juggernaut deserves the attention of a wide variety of investors. Most likely, this management is just getting started, and the best is yet to come. A whole lot of risks go down when management accomplishes what this management accomplished.This management had originally taken over a zombie corporation. Yet, management managed to sell enough acreage to bring debt under control while increasing profitability along the way. As a result, execution risks are likely extremely low with this management.Initially, profitability is likely to grow faster as management optimizes operations. Therefore, profitability is likely to grow faster than production growth in the first few years. This management has done a lot of shopping  and buying . Therefore, management probably has a full plate when it comes to optimization targets.Nonetheless, this management could choose to grow larger through organic growth, acquisitions, or a combination of the two. Whether that happens remains to be seen.Now management has what it wants. Therefore, going forward could be very different from the past. This is good management. Therefore, this management is very likely to surprise to the upside in the future.Current management has completely transformed this company that the market left for dead a while back.The future operations will be located in Canada. The debt is nothing close to the worry it once was. The capital budget now can be easily financed with cash flow, as shown above. There is now plenty left for shareholders as well. All of this is very different from the zombie corporation I once covered.Furthermore, management is likely to improve on the measures shown above by optimizing operations and benefitting from technological advances. For these reasons, profitability is likely to improve at a faster pace than any production growth for the first few years.The fact that the picture has improved tremendously speaks volumes about the quality of management of the company. Growth for a company this size is very different from the growth of some of the smaller names I follow. However, management of this quality is very likely to outperform expectations of the market over the long-term.That probably makes this stock a strong buy consideration for those wanting to own a quality upstream company without that small company risk. This Canadian company is listed on the NYSE. That should give it far more exposure than the typical Canadian company that usually trades on one of the OTC markets. That exposure should result in a better valuation and less of a  Canadian discount.The combined return of dividends, variable dividends and some growth is likely to be in the middle teens for about 5 years or so. After that, the market can see what this management is planning to do with the company.People ask me all the time about takeover possibilities. The biggest thing is that any buyer wants a deal with few problems. Therefore, any well-run company is likely to be a takeover candidate. That is especially true for one with low debt like this company.High debt companies often incur debt during  high-cost  times, and the debt does not decline with the stock price. Therefore, those companies are often high cost. If they are not well run as well  because they are low on cash , then there are more costs still. As a result, high-debt companies are often the opposite of what an acquiring company is looking for.Long Player believes oil and gas is a boom-bust, cyclical industry.

Energy Recovery: Is CO2-Refrigeration Thesis Already Getting Cold? (Rating Downgrade),"Energy Recovery  is the global leader in energy recovery devices  ERDs  for the salt-water reverse osmosis  SWRO  market. However, the company has been on a mission for many years to establish new vertical markets for its patented PX pressure exchange technology. Today, I'll take a lookEnergy Recovery's patented PX pressure exchange devices and its dominance in the global SWRO marketMore recently, ERII has been working on two new markets to deploy its PX technology  wastewater and CO2-refrigeration. ERII's CO2-refrigeration solution has two primary catalysts going for itHFCs  hydro-fluorocarbons  used for refrigeration are up to 13,000x worse than CO2 and, as such, there is strong regulatory phase-out legislation  especially in the EU  that is causing a rapid increase in the number of CO2-based refrigeration installations. The slide below - taken from a  - shows, the HFC phase-out timelines and the corresponding jump in CO2-based refrigeration installationsEnergy Recovery estimates CO2-refrigeration is a  1 billion TAM and that roughly 100,000 supermarkets will be impacted in the U.S. and EU alone.So, let's see how the company is doing in its efforts to make inroads into the CO2-refrigeration market.In a nutshell, ERII's solution to displace HFCs and save energy in CO2-based refrigeration systems is by using its PX-G1300 devices to recycle high-pressure energyThe system above effectively reduces the amount of energy consumed by compressors in the system - and of course the PX device itself uses no electricity at all.And while progress has been slow in my opinion, ERII has been making progress in the CO2-refrigeration marketHowever, note that I wrote my first Seeking Alpha article on ERRI's attempt to establish this new CO2-refrigeration vertical over two years ago  see . So, let's see how much this new market is contributing to the bottom line.As mentioned earlier, last week ERII released its  and it was a disappointmentHowever, on the , investors learned that the top-line miss was primarily a result of timing for mega-shipment revenue recognitionSo taking that into account, the company actually would have exceeded its previous guidance for the quarter  20- 25 million .As for the new vertical markets, wastewater revenue was  600,000 or  2 million YTD. On the Q2 conference call, CEO Bob Mao saidSo, wastewater revenue appears to be ramping up nicely.However, CO2-refrigeration revenue recognition in Q2 was only  100,000, roughly flat with New order announcements for the PX-G1300 product have been slow in coming, but on August 2nd ERII did  plans forHowever, it was interesting that no dollar amount was mentioned and it was described as a  launch  and not an  order . Overall, the lack of concrete orders is rather disappointing considering the company started on its CO2-refrigeration commercialization efforts over two years ago. Could this be another Vor-Teq debacle  I don't think that will be the case but only time will tell.I say that because the good news is that ERII's PX-G1300 was awarded the  at the ATMO America Summit in Washington, DC in June. In addition, the PX-G1300 and Epta s XTE refrigeration system  that uses the PX-G  were, separately, selected as finalists for Refrigeration Innovation of The Year Award for the annual RAC Cooling Industry Awards.That said, arguably much of the good news and CO2-refrigeration potential appears to already be priced into the stockFrom my perspective, the problem here is that despite all the positive talk about new market verticals over the many years I have been following ERII, the company has never really had that  special moment  or quarter where it just blows away expectations. It always seems to be the case of overly optimistic expectations and then under-delivering. However, the market clearly thinks the CO2-refrigeration and wastewater verticals will be successes in the long-run, otherwise the valuation levels shown above do not seem to be substantiated by the SWRO market alone - and make no mistake, ERII is still, today, an SWRO centric company.Despite the pull-back after the Q2 EPS report was released, ERII stock is still up nearly 28  since my  in February. However, do to the lack of follow-thru on CO2-refrigeration revenue orders, and considering the high-valuation level, I am reducing my rating on ERII to a HOLD. In addition, I have ERII on my watch list and if the company does not announce some concrete CO2-refrigeration orders over the remainder of this year, and if the valuation level stays this lofty, I may downgrade the stock to an outright SELL. Meantime, the company ended Q2 with  97.5 million in cash - which equates to an estimated  1.73 share.  I am an electronics engineer, not a CFA.

Clean Energy Fuels: A Total Mixed Bag,"Clean Energy Fuels Corp  comes with an interesting premise  and promise  to produce renewable clean energy from byproduct of cows in shape of RNG  renewable natural gas  in order to transform the global transportation industry. The management's promises soundIn recent years the company was able to show some growth in its production and delivery numbers as well as revenues but none of that converted into profits and investors grew increasingly frustrated with lack of profits. Even though the stock is up 41  in the last 3 years, it's been in a downtrend during most of this time after an initial rally of more than 500 .The company received large investments totaling  800 million from TotalEnergies  and BP  which made the former the largest shareholder in CLNE. The company seems to have put this money into work by building a network of 580 fuel stations, a large distribution network and RNG production sites. These investments made the company a global leader in RNG fuel market for transportation. The company was able to increase its annual sales from 13 million GGEs  gasoline gallon equivalents  to 198 million GGEs between 2013 and 2023. The company currently sells about half of RNG used for transportation fuel in the US. These seem like good developments and the company has been making progress in reaching its long term goals but these have also been very costly for the company as it has posted some large losses.The company's biggest selling point is its positive impact on the environment rather than making a profit and this also appears to be its first priority. I respect the company's decision to emphasize its environmental impact over profits but at the same time I'd like to see some profits as an investor before putting my money into it. In the below chart you will see the environmental impact of different types of fuels in shape of carbon emission and as you can see, the company's two products seem to have the lowest carbon emission as compared to alternatives. Notice that RNG produced from manure actually has a negative carbon emission because it eliminates methane from the environment that normally would have been harmful so its net impact is actually positive.Meanwhile the company is facing a pretty big opportunity. Early next year one of the biggest truck engine producers in the world Cummins  is  its new generation of 15L engine platforms that will be used by new generation semi trucks. The platform includes hydrogen, diesel and biogas options. There are already some big customers lining up for the RNG version of these engines including Knight Transportation  which is one of the largest trucking companies in the country. The company already  Cummins' new generation X15N natural gas engine using RNG fuels from CLNE and reportedly has been happy with the results. In addition, several other companies such as Amazon , UPS  and Waste Management  are already using CLNE's natural gas in their fleets and shown interest in next generation RNG trucks. These companies all have ambitious goals to reduce their carbon prints significantly in the next 20-30 years. As a matter of fact, CLNE has a number of fuel stations that are specifically dedicated to Amazon trucks and the company wants to build more of those in partnership with Amazon.If the demand increases in a significant way, the company's current network of 590 fuel stations will not be sufficient and it will need to build more stations along with more production plants. Up until recently the company was getting virtually all of its cow byproducts from third party dairy producers but it also made some investments and took steps to have its own production sites which may help margins in the long term but will require a lot of initial investment.In the long term the company sees itself supporting transportation industry in multiple shapes and forms. Currently it's mainly producing RNG which it distributes to its customers from fuel stations but in the future there is potential for using the RNG to create other forms of energy such as electric generation. This would allow the company to provide energy for different types of vehicles even though it would be indirectly involved in those alternative energy types such as electricity. Currently many regions produce their electricity from carbon sources such as oil or coal which would defeat the purpose of using electric vehicles in order to reduce our dependence on carbon sources. RNG could at least replace some of this and help reduce our carbon foot print in the long run. Again, the company will have to do this in a profitable way.Even though the company hasn't shown us much in way of profits, it's been able to generate positive cashflow from its operations which is a good start and at least encouraging. The company's total free cash flow is still negative and still needs work though.Analysts are typically  on this stock because there is belief that once the company's aggressive investment period comes to conclusion, big profits will follow. Currently the company is spending a lot of money on building production, fuel stations, distribution networks and other infrastructure but this should all become scalable once the company reaches a certain size according to bullish analysts. This reminds me of how Tesla  was building a large network of charging stations and service centers a few years ago which ate into the company's cash flows but once those are built, they will contribute to the company's bottom line for years to come so CLNE might be also facing a similar situation but it's too early to tell.Another problem faced by this company's investors is dilution. In the last 10 years the company's diluted share count rose by almost 140  which is pretty large. The company seems to spend a lot on its stock-based compensation which totaled more than  45 million in the last 3 years. The company will have to be more careful with dilution if it doesn't want to frustrate its patient investors any further.RNG prices are typically determined by diesel prices but it's not exactly 1 1. RNG tends to be significantly cheaper than diesel on average but the general idea is that as one rises so does the other. Historically diesel prices had long periods of being range-bound but generally trended higher and higher in the long run. CLNE's profitability will also depend on RNG prices which are going to be directly correlated with diesel prices so this is one thing investors might want to pay attention to.Sooner or later the company will have to show some profits, or at least a path to profitability and take its dilution under control. Currently the company's management seems to put profitability as a lower priority which may be good for the environment but not necessarily for investors who want to see a return on their investment. Currently the company shows -10  for return on equity and -9  for return on investment capital which don't look good for investors.In the last 15 years the company spent more than  1 billion of capital on its initiatives and some investors don't believe it's making progress fast enough. The company has been ramping up its capital expenditures even more in the last few years and the next couple years will be very crucial for the company to show investors if it can reach profitability anytime soon.Until the management can show  the money  or at least a path to profitability, this stock will remain as a story stock or a speculation. It's fine to have a speculative position in CLNE but it should be probably limited to 1  or less of your portfolio and it should be no more than an amount you feel comfortable losing it came down to that.

Ensemble Fund Q3 2023 Investment Update,"The third quarter of 2023 saw positive, and similar, returns for both the fund and the S P 500 ,  through the end of August, despite a meaningful increase in the 10-year treasury yield. But the month of September saw longer term treasury bond yields spike to their highest level since 2007, driving a sell-off across the market and the fund.In the quarter, the fund declined by 5.96  while the S P 500 declined 3.27 . Our underperformance was driven by large declines in Illumina  and Masimo , our two holdings that have recently elected activist shareholders to their boards. The rest of our portfolio collectively outperformed.We believe both companies  share prices dramatically undervalue their core businesses, as investors have become focused on problems with a recent acquisition at both companies. We continue to hold our investments in these companies as we believe that even if the acquired businesses were written off as entirely worthless, the core businesses of each company is worth dramatically more than the current share price. This is of course also the thesis of the activist shareholders, who have established large ownership stakes and successfully won representation on each company s board.Across most of the third quarter, the S P 500 traded in a relatively narrow range. The real action of interest to investors was found not so much in the equity markets, but in fixed income markets. The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 0.25 , as widely expected in July, and then held the rate steady in September, again, as widely expected. But the 10-year treasury bond yield rose a remarkable 0.73  as investors recalibrated their long term interest rate expectations.Quarterly increases in long term interest rates of this magnitude   0.65  or more   have been rare over the past thirty years, occurring in just 10 previous quarters. Three of those ten quarters occurred in 2022, as a very rapid and intense surge in inflation caused the Fed to raise rates much further and faster than anticipated at the start of the year.But inflation is not the only driver of higher interest rates. Just as important is real economic growth. Sharply higher interest rates due to high inflation have a severe negative impact on the value of equities. But when interest rates move higher due to strong real economic growth prospects, the impact on equity fair values is mixed, but generally positive.Until their most recent meeting, the Federal Reserve had been forecasting that a recession   or economic conditions very near to a recession   was going to play out in 2024. And based on this outlook, they forecasted that they would cut the Federal Funds interest rate substantially, by 1  or more, as the economy slowed down or tipped into contraction. But in their late September meeting, the Fed revealed that they now have a significantly more positive economic outlook and no longer expect a recession to occur. And given this outlook, they forecasted that they would not need to cut interest rates as soon or by as much, given the resilience in the economy they expect.After nearly two years of rising interest rates being a sign of inflation worries, while falling rates signaled recession worries, it is worth remembering that inflation is not the only driver of rising interest rates.For instance, the significant increase in the 10-year treasury yield from the summer of 2016 to the fall of 2018, which included a single quarter increase of 0.85   even more than the increase last quarter , was driven by real economic growth reaccelerating after a period of slow growth. By late 2018, the US economy was breaking out of the low growth  New Normal  regime and over that two year and three-month period the S P 500 rallied a total of 45 .2009 and 2010 also saw quarters with large spikes in the 10-year treasury yield. Then too they were driven higher by the recovery in real economic growth after the Great Financial Crisis. Before that, a spike of this magnitude was observed in 2004, as it became clear that the economic recovery after the Dot Com crash was sustainable. And even earlier, in 1994 and 1996, spikes in the 10-year yield occurred during periods when the economy, powering through a  mid cycle slowdown,  was showing bouts of strong reacceleration.During each of the periods of surging, long term interest rates prior to the inflation plagued COVID era, the rise in interest rates was a function of a strengthening economy, or a materially improved economic growth outlook. But today, as recession fears grip the market, equity investors have focused instead on the way that higher interest rates exert drag on the economy.The interplay between real economic growth, inflation, and interest rates is complicated and multifaceted. But whether rates are being driven by real economic growth, or inflation, has extremely meaningful implications for equity investors.During the low growth, low inflation, low interest rate period between the Great Financial Crisis and COVID, a period that became known as the New Normal, investors came to believe that not only had realized growth been low, but the potential growth of the US economy had become permanently impaired. This dynamic led to a belief that inflation and interest rates would likewise remain low forever.On our Intrinsic Investing blog, we wrote about the New Normal concept multiple times  see ,  and , and explained why it was quite possible that the low realized growth was not due to the US economy becoming permanently less productive than generations of Americans had enjoyed in the past. But rather that the low growth was an outcome of the Great Financial Crisis, a period when American households binged on debt, particularly mortgages, and thus required years and years of household income needing to be directed to balance sheet repair rather than increased spending.By just prior to COVID, this balance sheet repair had been completed. Mortgage debt stood not at high levels, but at one of the lowest levels in decades relative to household income and home values. By early 2020, it appeared it had become time to learn if the American workforce of today was structurally less productive than the generations that came before, or if the incredible innovations of recent decades would indeed pay off in the form of productivity. But then COVID intervened, and the question fell by the wayside as the world grappled with an emergency of epic proportion.Real economic growth is made up of the growth in the number of workers, and the growth in the productivity of those workers.Despite the cries last year of  no one wants to work anymore  the fact is that today a higher percentage of prime working age Americans   those between ages 25 and 54   have jobs than at any point in history other than the strongest period of the 1990s economic boom. Americans have been pouring into the workforce, which is why our country has been able to add 3.2 million workers to company payrolls over the last year and still end up with more people looking for work than at the beginning of the period.Despite very reasonable worries that the Fed s efforts to contain inflation would require a destruction of demand for labor and associated job losses, inflation has come down dramatically even while labor demand has remained strong. This outcome is a function of supply and demand in the labor market coming back into balance not through a contraction in labor demand, but through a moderation of labor demand paired with surging labor supply.But while the economic outcome to date is approaching the hoped for  soft landing,  and the Fed s new longer term economic projections forecast a full soft landing playing out next year, the near-term future state of the economy is always full of uncertainty.It is absolutely true that the historical record shows that it is nearly impossible for inflation to fall dramatically from high levels without an economy experiencing a recession. Yet that same historical record includes no prior period in which a global pandemic had inhibited people s ability to work and companies  ability to supply goods and services.As Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago put it recently,  The past is not that great of a guide when you got weird things happening, and the COVID business cycle was maybe the weirdest of all.At Ensemble, we do not make investments based around short-term economic forecasts. We typically own companies in our portfolio for many, many years and assume that at some point during our ownership there will be a recession. But we do think it is imperative that investors maintain a strong understanding of the macroeconomic conditions in which their portfolio companies are operating. A simplistic review of past periods of central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation would suggest near total certainty of a recession, as many investors came to believe during 2022. But with a holistic understanding of the unique economic events of the decade after the Financial Crisis, and the unique economic circumstances of the global pandemic, it becomes clear that a kneejerk assumption that a recession must be coming is far from a sure thing.Of course, separate from a recession, investors worry that higher interest rates must mean that stock market valuations need to go lower. But this is not supported by either valuation math or stock market history. Certainly, the shift from very low interest rates to much higher interest rates popped the bubble in speculative stocks that we pointed out in our January 2021 client letter just a month before the bubble peaked. But for the mature, profitable businesses that make up most of the S P 500, valuations are maximized not by low interest rates, but by inflation, interest rates, and real economic growth that trends in a sweet spot of approximately 2 -3  real growth and 2 -3  inflation leading to about 5  nominal GDP growth and 5  interest rates.Today, the US economy is exhibiting real growth of 2 -3 , with inflation trending a bit above 3 , and the interest rate on the 10-year treasury bond a bit below 5 . So, while it is uncertain if these economic trends will persist, neither valuation math nor market history suggests valuations should be low or declining today.A small number of mega cap stocks trading at high valuations has led the market cap weighted S P 500 forward PE ratio to stand at 18.6x, within the 15x-20x range that current economic conditions have given rise to in the past, although above the central tendency of 15x-17x. But when removing the skew created by a small number of very large companies trading at high PE ratios, it is revealed that the average stock in the S P 500 is trading at a PE ratio of just 15.4x. Thus, the average stock in the S P 500 is currently valued at a level that is consistent with even higher longer term interest rates than we have today, so long as inflation and real growth can trend in the 2 -3  range in the years ahead. It is just these sorts of economic conditions that the Federal Reserve now sees as being most likely, and it is based on this outlook that they have told the market to expect interest rates to remain high.In other words, the Fed is not saying they will keep rates high because they must, but rather because they can.Notable detractors from our performance came from our investments in Masimo, Illumina, and Netflix In July, Masimo lowered their growth outlook for 2023. Most importantly, they said that their health care business would see revenue that was approximately flat vs the prior year compared to previously expected 8 -9  growth. This reduction in guidance came even as the company has been successful in signing up record levels of new customers. However, US hospitals are seeing fewer than expected patients this year and thus have shifted to using Masimo products they already have in inventory rather than needing to buy more. But over time, there is no reason to believe that patient visits to hospitals will do anything other than go up. In August, Illumina reduced their full year guidance, something that was not unexpected as life science tool providing companies have mostly all seen a slowdown in demand as customers have sought to cut costs and deplete existing inventories due to macroeconomic concerns and the bumpy recovery from COVID. The cut in guidance did not initially impact the stock, with it rising slightly on the day. But subsequently, investor impatience with the company s GRAIL related issues  a company they bought, which regulators are close to requiring them to sell back off  seems to have reached a crescendo with the stock trading down steeply as even bullish investors await a resolution to the regulatory issue. During an investor conference for Wall Street analysts, Netflix s CFO noted that profit margin growth in the years ahead would likely be less than it has been in recent years. But rather than this being due to some sort of problem with profitability, he said it was because there was more than enough growth opportunity ahead for them to invest at high enough levels that would lead to lower growth in profit margins. Noting that there would be an eventual point at which margins would peak and growth potential would be exhausted, he said  I just don t think we re anywhere near that yet.  These comments simultaneously validate long term bullish investors  views of significant profit margin and revenue growth still to come, as well as short term bearish investors  concerns that profit margin estimate for 2024 may have been a bit too high.On the more positive side, we saw notable performance contribution from Booking Holdings , Google , , and Broadridge Financial Solutions . Despite macroeconomic worries and inflation eating into global consumers  ability to spend, households around the world continue to prioritize travel. While so called  revenge travel,  or increased travel spending after being stuck inside during COVID, has likely run its course, global hotel room nights have only recently returned to pre-COVID trends. As COVID has mostly ceased to have an impact on travel, other than in Asia where China s extended lockdown means a recovery is still ongoing, growth going forward is likely to be more modest. But during COVID, Booking stayed on offense and has been taking market share. Notably, the company s alternative accommodations offering has grown substantially and in recent quarters has grown faster than Airbnb. Separate from all the discussion of artificial intelligence, Google s core Search business, having experienced a significant slowdown in 2022, now shows clear signs of reacceleration. While the future of AI and its impact on Google is still subject to a healthy debate, the company seems to have put to bed investor concerns about any rapid negative impact. With Search revenue growth accelerating, and the company rolling out lots of new AI tools, the investor panic from the beginning of the year about AI immediately hurting Google appears to have been overblown. In August, the company reported the close of their 2023 fiscal year and offered a better than expected earnings outlook for fiscal year 2024. Paired with a 10  dividend increase and the successful go live of their challenged rollout of a new wealth management software service for their anchor client UBS  the biggest global wealth manager  investor confidence in the company s long demonstrated balance of growth and stability seems to have returned.Analog Devices, known in the industry as ADI, makes semiconductor chips that predominantly operate at the boundary of the physical world and the digital world, more commonly referred to as analog and mixed signal chips. These chips usually play a supporting role to the sexier  digital brain  that is the latest and greatest processor from Nvidia , Intel , , Apple , or Qualcomm . While the digital brains get a lot more media attention, the supporting analog chips are as vital as those big expensive digital processors in driving value in electronic devices, which are becoming ubiquitous and intelligent throughout our lives.Anything with an on-off switch requires lots of these analog chips if it is going to relay input and output information with the physical world as well as manage the electrical power supply feeding the device. While these analog chips are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute, it takes a long time to design and build a catalog of literally thousands of specific products to create the scale that makes them economically attractive businesses with a reputation of dependability and quality.What s unique about this class of chips is that companies making them do not need to make the huge investment bets that digital chips require in both R D and manufacturing to stay ahead on the Moore s Law performance treadmill. Analog chips usually use manufacturing equipment that s several years or even decades old, which are much cheaper to buy than the latest and greatest that digital chips require.In addition, consolidation has reduced the number of players in the semiconductor industry to a few big players globally and just a handful in the US, with analog chipmakers demonstrating a focus on strong returns on invested capital, high levels of free cashflow, and good competitive advantages built on scale, reputation, and a cornered talent resource of specialized analog engineers that we ll explore further.To understand why we believe ADI is both different and valuable, we have to delve a little bit into the technicalities of semiconductors. While we think of chips as  thinking  in ones and zeros, the real world does not operate on ones and zeros. The forces in the physical world have more of a continuous analog waveform that is not binary   examples of these are light color and brightness, sound frequency and volume, pressure, temperature, etc.Mixed-signal chips will take those continuous signals and transform them into digital data that digital processors and memory chips can understand. Then the digital chips can operate on that data to compute new information or activate an output signal, which are translated back for consumption in the physical world by a mixed signal chip. Analog chips perform a similar role, but usually in the realm of power regulation and communication. Analog and mixed signal chips are often made by the same companies and sometimes referred to interchangeably.As technology has broadly penetrated our world and everyday lives, semiconductors have also done the same as the underlying hardware substrate. Moore s Law has allowed their capabilities to grow, and their cost and energy consumption to fall at an exponential rate, which has driven their adoption and use in a broad range of applications in all industries, bringing us to where we stand today, on the verge of ubiquitous connected intelligence.As devices are able to do more and become more intelligent, their semiconductor content has increased, relying on more sensors, power management, and communications capabilities. These devices and systems are dispersed throughout our lives  from smartphones to computers, cars, planes, microwaves, ultrasound machines, HVAC systems, cellular radio towers, data centers, factories, etc. Given their role, it s important to recognize that the more powerful and capable the main digital processor is, the more data it needs to bring new applications and value to market.A lot of these applications also leverage connected devices   think your smart bulbs or fridge or cars   and all of these applications that can do more, generally require more analog chips to do the  sensing  that creates the data that feeds the application or main processor. In the case of the latest cars, those with adaptive cruise control, fancy smart LED lights, and electric vehicles   which are basically getting close to becoming computers on wheels   the number of chips required is multiples that of vehicles just a few years ago and is 10-100x as many as traditional products we think of as technology products like iPhones, PCs, and game consoles.Therefore, we believe that the analog segment of the semiconductor market can see faster growth ahead, but without the risk and high levels of ongoing cash reinvestment necessary for the sexy digital brain part of the industry. In analog, the pace of technological change is slower and product cycles are much longer, spanning decades in many cases. This results in sustainably higher returns on R D and manufacturing investments, along with more consistent secular forecastability. In addition, the markets they sell into are global and across all industries making them relatively less dependent on one or two end markets, like smartphones or the data center.Companies like ADI and Texas Instruments , which the industry refers to as TI , two of the largest analog companies, have built broad portfolios of tens of thousands of products, each with over a hundred thousand customers who make millions of products that sell billions of units. The product needs and lifecycles across all industries can vary from a year to decades, which is why ADI derives half of its revenue from products that are over ten years old  Historically, the prices of these chips have ranged from less than a dollar to a few dollars while volumes in the billions of chips result in  10-20 billion dollars of revenue for each of these companies at operating profit margins of 30-50 .Once these chips are designed into customer products, it is generally uneconomical to switch them out for a competing chip because the average selling price is so low relative to reengineering costs, especially when you consider software that is built on top of the designed in hardware. This makes ADI s products sticky once they are designed in, resulting in a competitive moat that spans across the scale of products and distribution, switching costs, and service capability.Another source of competitive advantage and value to customers is that unlike digital chip design, there is a lot of  art  or experience-based know-how that goes into analog and mixed signal chip engineering that deals with its own unique set of design challenges. This results in an engineering talent pool that is hard to replicate at new companies or even at customers  product design teams. Consolidation in the industry has meant that these resources are even more concentrated at the largest companies, which enable them to drive further efficiencies in product development.Taken together, in most end markets outside of consumer electronics, all of these factors make it hard for a new entrant to build enough scale in any timeframe under a decade to become a profitable competitor.While consolidation has mostly played out in the industry, increasing complexity, automation, and integration create other avenues to grow revenue and margins, one that ADI has been particularly focused on with the diversity of functional chips it has in its catalog of nearly 80,000 chips. Customers are coming to rely more and more on buying complete solutions from ADI, which is becoming more of a solutions partner rather than just a chip components vendor. This allows ADI to get closer to its customers  engineering teams and help design and build subsystems comprised of multiple chips that its own engineers have integrated to perform complete functions. Historically, engineers at the customers  design centers would be buying chips from multiple companies and integrating them onto system boards themselves.Delivering more complete solutions has enabled ADI to increase its average selling prices and build a higher margin business over time, while also providing further protection from competition and deleterious price pressure effects in the future during more economically challenging times.Examples of this are battery management and infotainment systems in autos, 5G cellular radio infrastructure, digital systems in healthcare instruments, and smart factories. ADI has targeted and successfully built systems level businesses in these high growth industries.Based on what industry leaders like ADI and TI are saying and our own broader understanding of trends in various industries, including auto, energy, communications, industrial, and healthcare, it appears that trends in this part of the semiconductor industry is at an inflection point of acceleration. Whereas historically organic growth has trended in the mid-single digits, the next few years are forecasted to grow closer to 10  per year. In fact, these companies are so confident in that forecast based on customer conversations that they are allocating billions more in capital to build out new manufacturing capacity to meet the demand.In the meantime, valuation multiples in this area are reasonably cheap since the semiconductor industry, outside of booming AI related names, has been undergoing an inventory correction as a result of rebalancing from the COVID disruption years. We believe we are at the latter part of the cyclical adjustment that fluctuates around an accelerating secular trend.The future is bright for analog leaders like ADI and TI, although they are pursuing that opportunity with different business strategies that lead us to currently prefer ADI over TI. However, we believe both could be winners at different stages as the industry evolves to capture the growth opportunity ahead.Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble Fund investors, we occasionally tell them that we re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa . Most people carry both.People carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high-end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren t going to get paid.Importantly, these companies do not lend any money. If you look at your credit or debit card, you ll find that it is issued by a bank. If it has the name of a non-bank company on it, such as American Airlines or Apple, these companies have just partnered with a bank to issue the card. In American Airlines case, its Barclays and the Apple credit card is issued by Goldman Sachs. The issuing bank is the one whose checking account a debit card is tied to, and they are the ones lending the money to fund credit card payments.On the other side of the transaction is the merchant and its bank. No matter whether you swipe your card, or wave your smartphone, or use an online digital wallet to make a payment via your credit or debit card, in each case your bank and the merchant s bank need to exchange information across a communication network. And that network is almost always provided by Mastercard or Visa. While you might hear about how merchants pay 2  or more in credit card fees, Mastercard or Visa are only collecting between 1 10 and 1 20 of that fee, with the banks, the ones taking the credit risk and covering the risk of fraud, earning the bulk of the fee.Americans are so used to using debit and credit cards that it is easy to lose sight of how amazing the Mastercard and Visa networks are. The fact is that when you walk into a store anywhere in the United States, you take it for granted that the merchant will allow you to swipe a little piece of plastic with either the Mastercard or Visa logo on it and they will then let you walk out with your purchase. The reason you carry a Mastercard or Visa is because you know they are accepted everywhere. And the reason they are accepted everywhere is because everyone carries one. This is a classic example of a  chicken and egg problem . Before everyone accepted these cards, it was difficult to convince consumers to carry one. And before everyone carried one, it was difficult to get merchants to accept them.Having solved this problem, Mastercard and Visa now have a competitive moat around their businesses, which makes it very difficult for any new company to compete with them. Let s say that some new payment network was launched that offered superior benefits to merchants and customers. To be successful, a new payment network must offer superior benefits to both sides of the transaction because driving a change in the long ingrained behavior of using credit and debit cards demands a change by both sides.Even if a new network offers superior value to both sides of the transaction, adoption is still difficult. While early adopters might be attracted to the new payment option, they will find it difficult to actually use until there is widespread adoption such that a customer can expect most merchants to accept it, which will only occur once merchants can expect most customers to have adopted the new offering.Building a globally accepted payment network was hard in the past. But today it is even harder because not only must a new company in the payment industry solve the chicken and egg problem themselves, but now that it has already been solved, a new competitor must solve the problem in a way that is much better than the existing solution. Credit and debit payments were a significant improvement compared to paying in cash and checks for both customers and merchants. But even with so many technological advancements in the payment industry over the last decade, there has been little in the way of significant improvements versus the existing debit and credit card payment networks. The one major improvement has been the increasing ease of use of credit and debit cards for both merchants and customers, such as the ability to carry a card within your phone, or a merchant s ability to easily set up and accept card payments via tools like Square or online services like Stripe.While some companies are subject to highly unpredictable changes in macro factors, such as an oil company being dependent on the price of oil, Mastercard s business is driven by far more stable trends. The key metric for them is global consumer spending trends, which even during recessions do not decline by more than a couple percentage points and which we are confident will grow at a modest, but steady rate over the very long term. On top of that growth driver, the company benefits from the relentless shift of consumer spending from cash and checks to credit and debit. While it might seem that this shift has already played out in developed markets, we can look to near cashless countries like Sweden to see that even US consumers are likely to see continued declines in their use of cash and checks.Despite their incredible ease of use, and the broad-based benefits that card-based payments have brought to consumers, merchants, and the global economy as a whole, it is not uncommon to hear complaints from merchants about what they view as the high cost of accepting credit cards. But it is important for observers to understand that these complaints are primarily an argument between merchants and banks about the share of economic value they each capture from the existence of card networks. One way to illustrate this reality is by noting that if accepting credit cards was inferior to getting paid with cash, merchants would simply refuse to accept credit cards. But instead, we see the opposite trend. More and more merchants are no longer accepting cash. Why are they refusing cash and requiring customers to use credit or debit cardsCash is expensive to accept.At first glance it appears that cash has no transaction costs. A customer simply gives cash to a merchant and there are no fees involved for either party. But it turns out there are actually a lot of costs to accepting cash.Retailers are a powerful political interest group. If you track which politicians try to rally support for new laws that reduce acceptance fees, you ll notice that many of them represent districts that include very large corporate retailers who spend heavily on lobbying. Likewise, the politicians who push back against these proposed regulations often represent districts that include very large banks, the entities that receive the vast majority of credit card processing fees.Both sides often frame their arguments through the lens of consumer benefit. They argue that their intent is to help consumers, who are the voters after all. But when was the last time you thought to yourself  credit cards are great, but they are too expensive for me to use  Never. Rather you likely appreciate the benefits you get from using credit cards. Rewards are part of it, but with a credit card you take for granted that if you experience fraud, it will be covered by the bank. Just like if a customer never pays their bill, it s not the retailers problem. And with credit cards you get data too, that can easily populate household budgeting software, just as retailers benefit from card-based data. And with a credit card, you don t need to keep your checking account balanced constantly. You can spend over the course of a month, and then settle up by tapping your bank account once to pay all credit card charges. We know these benefits are valuable, because in much of the world outside the US, credit card rewards aren t even a thing. And yet credit card adoption is rising steadily all around the globe.It is easy for a ubiquitous product or service to be taken for granted. Once in place, it can be easy for the people who benefit to wonder why they have to pay anything at all. But a world without payment cards is a world with less economic activity. Where more resources need to be deployed to processing transactions due to the higher implicit and explicit costs of non-card-based payments.In closing, we note that the COVID era showed an explosion of payment-related innovation. Massive amounts of capital were invested in potential payment solutions such as so called Buy Now, Pay Later financial technology companies, and cryptocurrency-based systems that were supposed to make payments easy and free and perfect in every way. But in the end, the technological innovations that actually matter, the ones that actually get deployed and used, have again and again been those innovations that make accepting payment cards more often, for more transaction types as easy as possible.

Exxon Mobil: A Strong Sell Ahead Of The Last Age Of Oil,"At the close of 2021, a popular Seeking Alpha contributor posted an  detailing why she believed that oil would experience a big move up  in the 2020s decade,  setting the stage for what she callsStill, in late 2021 I had arrived at the same basic conclusion  a change in the energy sector is upon us and will dramatically take shape, and shape fortunes, throughout thisRegarding the long-term future of the energy sector, my viewpoint is based on the following phenomena and developmentsBecause of these developments, I believe that the energy boom in the aftermath of the Russia Ukraine conflict marks the last time that oil and other fossil fuels can be relied upon to enrich contemporary energy companies that comprise much of the energy sector today. In my opinion, these companies, as well as their investors, would be wise to transition away from fossil fuels as soon as possible during the 2020s.In the following sections, I will explain in detail why I believe that this decade represents the last age of oil, while also exploring how this affects one of the world's largest and most vertically integrated oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corporation .After the forced breakup of Standard Oil, an American oil behemoth, Exxon became one of the most successful divisions to be spun off the company. Exxon is among the largest privately owned and publicly traded oil companies in the world, and produces a large amount of the world's energy  in 2018 . It is vertically integrated, and therefore controls the upstream  exploration, drilling, extraction , midstream  transportation, storage, refining , and downstream  retail sales and distribution  handling of oil and natural gas. While it may not be the world's largest oil company  a title usually held by state-owned Saudi Aramco , Exxon is rightfully considered a giant in a massive industry, making it significantly appealing to investors.As formidable a company as it may be, the oil giant's past decade of financials reveal the consequences of a  to capitalize on the US shale boom in the 2010s, and the effects of expensive pursuits of less profitable oil projects during that time.Revenues for 2013 and 2014 were in the  350-400 billion range, but declined to the  200-250 billion range from 2015 to 2019. Revenues for 2020 were disastrous, with the company pulling in only  178 billion that year. However, 2021 was a return to form with a haul of over  275 billion, and in 2022, the year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that prompted Western governments to reject Russian oil, revenues of Exxon increased to nearly  400 billion, since the energy giant had many more customers than usual in need of its supply.Regarding net income, the trends are about the same, with different numbers   32 billion earned in 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  15-20 billion range from 2015-2019  with a notable drop to  8 billion in 2016 , a disastrous decline to a loss of  22 billion in 2020, a return to form of  22 billion earned in 2021, and a sharp rise to  55 billion earned in 2022.Lastly, cash flow from operations tells a similar story   45 billion in cash flow earned in both 2013 and 2014, a decline to the  20-30 billion range for 2015-2019, a decline to  14 billion in 2020, and a rise to  48 billion and  67 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Notwithstanding the mishaps in the past decade that affected its finances, Exxon's performance is relatively impressive for having missed out on such a big opportunity in the US oil industry. A misstep like neglecting shale shouldn't have been catastrophic for the company in any case, considering it is structured to be a major player in all areas of the oil industry's operations. This means, however, that if the US and global oil industry were to collapse, there's a good chance Exxon would follow as its oil-based revenue streams unraveled.As the stock of a well-known giant in the energy sector, I would expect to see XOM trade at a premium over its peers nearly all of the time. As I've said in previous articles, quality and reliability are often worth a premium in investing, and XOM is no different.At time of writing, XOM trades at a trailing P E ratio of  8.7x, a negligible percentage higher than the energy sector. However, its forward P E is 12x,  15  above sector peers. This premium exists for XOM's P B  price to book  and P Cash flow as well, trading at a premium of over 25  and over 50  above the energy sector, respectively. Even though XOM's P S  price to sales  is slightly discounted at  10  below sector, most indicators suggest that XOM is a bit pricey, as is expected for such a dominant oil firm.As long as the oil market remains healthy, XOM's premium is likely a fair price to pay to own one of the world's premier energy companies. However, a collapse of the oil market will rob Exxon of the revenues it needs to prop up its finances, ultimately devaluing XOM stock. Those with faith in the continued dominance of oil might feel comfortable investing in XOM, but in my opinion, this stock might be ripe for a decline, one that is not yet priced into its stock's somewhat rich valuation multiples.As I have stated, Exxon and XOM's fate is intertwined with the greater oil industry, due to oil's overwhelming centrality to Exxon's business model. Accordingly, to understand why XOM and Exxon are set to decline, we must understand the reasons why the oil industry, and fossil fuels overall, are set to decline. These reasons are what I will detail for much of the rest of the article, culminating in my rating for XOM stock.To understand the argument for why the Oil Age is ending, we have to understand the dynamics of a central premise of the argument  the fact that renewables are rising. Why is this happening, and why does it mean the end of oilTo start, the scientific innovations that first birthed renewables have birthed many other things in our history, especially in the last century or so. Technologies, chemistries, and scientific knowledge unimaginable just a few centuries ago have advanced so much that they are taken for granted today. These include new ways to generate energy.Regarding renewable energy generation specifically, to make  short, scientific innovations continued to improve on the technologies that made renewable energy possible. Experimentation with different configurations of various elements and other substances, different manufacturing methods, designs, and other scientific pursuits of trial and error eventually drove renewable generation components to become better at siphoning energy - more compact, energy dense batteries, greater energy absorption from solar panels, better optimization of wind turbines to capture more wind power, improved conversion rates for electrolyzers to generate energy and hydrogen, and greater durability and longer lifespans for all of these technologies and more.These improvements to renewable technologies were ultimately aimed toward making them as efficient as possible - producing and storing as much energy as possible, for as long as possible, with the longest lifespans possible, and with the fewest materials and resources possible. As an overlooked side benefit, these innovations also ended up making these technologies very cheap. Similar to how innovations in computer technologies shrank computers from billion dollar room-sized behemoths to hundred dollar hand-sized devices, innovations in renewable technologies allowed renewables to evolve from inefficient, expensive energy production pipedreams to efficient, cheaper, viable mass-market energy sources.Over several decades, the prices for renewable technology have fallen by very large double digit percentages due to these innovations. Now, in the 2020s, this technology has virtually reached price parity with the dominant energy sources  see Lazard data referenced later , i.e. fossil fuels, and is on track to become cheaper than fossil fuels in the coming years. This will have several profound effects on the overall energy market, which I will detail later in this section.As the prices for renewables fall, renewables will become a favored energy source for the people and entities whose price brackets they fall into. A major reason for this is that renewable generation devices are small enough in size, and efficient enough in energy production, that smaller industrial firms, factories, power plants, businesses, and many individual households will all be able to use renewable power technology to generate sufficient amounts of free power for themselves at will. This means that due to competitive pricing, high efficiency, and high scalability, renewable power generation is readily decentralized, setting it up for rapid mass adoption.This is not possible with fossil fuels, it and never will be. The entire fossil fuel apparatus is as humongous as it is centralized. Massive mining and drilling devices take massive amounts of fuel out of the ground, transport the massive fuel deposits on massive vessels to massive refineries, then take the end products to massive power plants to combust it for energy that travels massive distances on incredibly long powerlines. Only production and distribution companies as massive as the fossil fuel supply itself could ever make fossil fuels as cheap an energy source as they are, because the sheer scale of fossil fuel extraction, transportation, refinement, combustion, and distribution is too large for any small firm, let alone a single household, to handle in a reasonably cost-effective manner.By contrast, renewable energy is derived from the environment itself and is all around us almost all the time, with no transportation or combustion necessary. Extraction of renewable fuel only involves setting up the device to collect the energy, and then letting the environment fill it up from there. Distribution of renewable energy at smaller scales, such as in a virtual power plant or via vehicle-to-grid transference, is optional, but is much cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent. The refinement process for renewables  i.e. converting renewable energy to electricity, switching its current from DC to AC or vice versa, switching its voltage from 120V to 220V or to any other desired voltage, etc.  is quick and highly efficient at every step. Simply put, the process of producing renewable energy has fewer steps and is cheaper and easier to do than producing energy from fossil fuels.Even so, one of the most attractive features of renewable usage is that renewable energy is generated by the buyer of the technology, and the only cost he or she pays is for the generation technology itself. While fossil fuel energy sources require customers to pay for the energy  at a variable cost with no decrease over time relative to units of energy used , renewable generation devices only require a fixed cost  the one-time payment for the devices themselves  to generate power  the renewable energy produced afterward is free, and the one-time cost of the technology decreases over time relative to the free renewable energy produced.Renewables therefore lend themselves well to the decentralization of energy production, and the favorable economics of decentralized energy for the masses means that more and more people will opt for decentralized, free power over centralized, pricey power production where possible. This does not bode well for oil companies, other fossil fuel companies, or for traditional electric and gas utility companies which are tracked by Utilities Sector SPDR ETF , Reeves Utility Income Trust , DNP Select Income Fund , Vanguard Utilities Index ETF . Whether or not these utilities are as fossil fuel-dependent as oil firms and other pure play fossil fuel companies, the wave of demand for decentralized renewable energy will put all their business at risk due to their inherently centralized structure. Put another way, when energy consumers are able to generate their own renewable electricity at home for free, they will rarely, if ever, need to pay for energy from utility companies.Furthermore, as demand for renewables increases due to improving economics, and the costs of renewables decreases due to continued innovations on renewable technologies and devices, economies of scale will start to ramp up. High demand and lower prices will drive up sales of renewables, which will prompt greater production of renewable devices tech, which will drive costs down due to increasing economies of scale, which will prompt further cost and price declines, which will prompt greater demand, and so on. This vicious cycle  or virtuous cycle  stands in stark contrast to the oil market, where prices seem to rarely decrease for long, no matter how much customers want or need oil and energy. As demand for renewables rises, and its unique benefits become clear, demand for oil and other fossil fuels will fall, as their disadvantages by comparison become more pronounced.With these market dynamics at play, renewables will continue their precipitous cost declines, and will continue to see increasing demand serviced by increasing supply  meanwhile, fossil fuels will see ever-decreasing demand, and soon will not be able to compete as energy sources.For about two centuries, oil and coal were the only high-energy density fuel sources available to nations trying to rapidly advance their economies and industries. Other fuel sources emerged to compete with them, such as nuclear power and natural gas, yet oil and coal maintained their dominance to a large degree. But recent trends are tipping the balance away from these classic fuels. Natural gas itself has become  in recent years, and renewables are now competitive with, if not cheaper than, fossil fuels.According to Lazard Ltd's  of the Levelized Cost of Electricity Energy  or  LCOE , essentially the lifetime cost of energy produced  for renewable energy sources vs fossil fuels, most setups of renewable generation had comparable or lower LCOEs than fossil fuels under various conditions the firm modeled - without renewable subsidies, with subsidies, adjusting for fuel prices, a hypothetical carbon tax, component costs, and so on. Ultimately, Lazard's data demonstrates that renewables, which were once  back in 2009, have generally reached price parity with fossil fuels over their operational lifespan. In fact, it has been argued that renewable energy sources, specifically solar, wind, and battery storage, have already been cheaper than fossil fuel energy sources for  as measured by LCOE. Regardless, the cheapness of renewable power, once added to the energy market, stands to significantly lower the cost of energy wherever it is installed.Consider the example of Texas. The state is famous for its history of oil production on account of its nearly 50 years of undisputed  beginning in the early 20th century, and Texas still  of the United States' oil today. The state has no qualms about diversifying its energy sources though, as it also consumes and produces large quantities of natural gas as part of its energy mix, along with notable amounts of coal and nuclear energy. As the major producer of its most in-demand energy sources, Texas, unsurprisingly, has had some of the country's lowest energy prices over the last 50 years,   opens in Excel .This was all made possible on the back of cheap fossil fuels produced close to home. Yet even in Texas, renewables outcompete fossil fuels on price. Based on an  of Texas's power grid with vs. without renewable energy, renewables saved Texans up to several billion dollars in electricity costs annually between 2010 and 2022. This demonstrates that renewables can easily be a cheaper source of power than fossil fuels under real world conditions, even when fossil fuels enjoy the benefits of historical dominance and favorable market forces that contribute to their entrenchment in a given region.All this to say, renewable energy sources are now a cheap alternative for cities, states, provinces, and countries to use to power their economies. From the  to the , from  to  to , and even in , renewables are often the go-to option for power plant buildout, since they may now be one of the less expensive options available. Furthermore, renewables are not just cheap in terms of direct costs, but are also cheap due to their lack of external costs .Now that renewable energy combined with storage is about as cheap as fossil fuels, with  and  still falling, future technologies and energy projects will likely use renewable power, displacing some aging fossil fuel-based projects on the basis of cost alone. This will devastate oil in particular, especially in the US. Electric vehicle registrations are , and the adoption of electrified industrial machines powered by renewable energy , both spurred on by lower renewable energy costs compared to fossil fuels.Assuming these trends persist and broaden, they will destroy most of the demand for oil, since in recent years the transportation and industrial sectors have generated  and about   aggregating Road, Rail, Aviation, and Industry . As these sources of demand dry up, the oil industry will almost certainly be forced to shrink significantly to adjust to the new normal.To round this section out, let me highlight two important points. ,  t he global energy crisis is driving a sharp acceleration in installations of renewable power, with total capacity growth worldwide set to almost double in the next five years,  and  renewables are set to account for over 90  of global electricity expansion  in that same time span. Additionally, there is now  within the scientific community that it is physically possible to replace fossil fuels with renewables in the majority of countries in the world, and eliminate over 99  of global carbon emissions to boot. If renewables are becoming the cheaper option for the nations of the world, renewable supply and demand are ramping up worldwide, and almost every nation can physically switch from fossil fuels to renewables, then almost every nation will do so. This will allow fast-spreading renewable energy sources to proliferate until they comprise virtually the entire energy sector, in turn giving renewable energy companies a global total addressable market.In short, not only are oil and other fossil fuels set to fall out of favor with the arrival of cheap renewables, but renewables are also being installed at a blistering pace around the world, surpassing fossil fuels as a proportion of new energy installations. Further, renewable energy is liable to completely replace global fossil fuel use based solely on market forces and nations' economic preferences, and will be mostly unhindered by differences in national landscapes.But the bad news doesn't end there.As with our ability to switch to renewables, the science is also clear about the nature of our current bout of climate change  humans are , and the consequences are being felt, and measured, . If the climate becomes as unstable as current models predict, it will negatively affect the weather patterns of many cities, nations, and whole continents. Severe storms, floods, freezes and droughts are already becoming more commonplace, and things are only set to worsen. Left unchecked, climate change will  and cause devastating , a one-two punch that will greatly disrupt the living conditions of many people and significantly increase human suffering.Because of this, governments and regulators the world over are starting to flex their muscles, putting laws and policies in place to keep the damage done by climate change to a minimum. Some nations, such as those that joined the Kyoto Protocol, acted faster than others, but virtually all nations now acknowledge the threat of a world destabilized by climate change, or are being forced to act on the matter by politically active constituents.Accordingly, , various pieces of European Union  EU  legislation and policies like the European Green Deal, and US laws like the Inflation Reduction Act  IRA , are stuffed with climate-related mandates and incentives. Governments and regulators are getting serious about curbing the flow of excess carbon into the atmosphere, including tackling the root cause  fossil fuels.  and  have decided to ban sales of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, this being just one of several steps taken by governments to reduce citizens' fossil fuel consumption.Additionally, the aforementioned climate mandates and incentives passed in recent years have made private investment in climate-friendly programs and technologies much more appealing - possibly more appealing than investment in fossil fuels.For instance, , much of the IRA's funding is  designed to  in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing   emphasis added . In other words, IRA funding is meant to jump-start an  buying spree of renewable energy tech, as well as even greater spending on its deployment in multiple industries  this is likely the goal of all climate legislation being introduced and passed into law.Needless to say, regulators and governments actively codifying incentives and mandates that favor the renewable energy industry over the next 10-15 years is a major secular headwind for the fossil fuel industry, and does not set it up for a decade of success. Some may point out that there are fossil fuel goodies baked into these climate pronouncements, but the long-term trend toward fossil fuel elimination is unmistakable.To illustrate, a portion of IRA funding goes toward propping up the US fossil fuel industry, to the  of many environmentalists  however, an  of the law by  t he think tank Energy Innovation calculates that  due to measures governing buildings' energy use, home electrification, and green lands set aside as carbon sinks   emphasis added . While the real-world ratio for carbon saved vs carbon emitted under the IRA may differ from the estimates, the intent and impact of the law is clear  ramp up renewables, curb carbon.These legal and regulatory headwinds to the oil industry, and to the fossil fuel industry at large, will only get stronger as the effects of climate change become more severe and more frequent this decade. For all intents and purposes, governments and regulators have announced last call for fossil fuel use, and their word is law.Governments subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of . The US is an infamous example of this, having lavishly funded the industry . However, as renewable energy technology has evolved, governments and other entities have begun to invest in it as well. , global renewable energy investments in 2022 rose to match investments in fossil fuels for the first time, representing a 31  increase from 2021.As renewable energy investment continues trending upward, governments will find it fiscally unpalatable to spend money on two competing energy sources, especially governments of countries with large debts and deficits like the United States. Soon, these governments will be forced to subsidize just one.Assuming they are rational in their decision, they will opt to subsidize the energy class that has low direct costs and fewer externalities  i.e., choose renewables , and phase out their fossil fuel subsidies. Even if they choose to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry without redirecting those funds to renewables, it will be a big financial blow to the industry, including oil firms.If cost alone doesn't make the decision for governments easy, the following consideration might force their hand.What are two things that Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have in common  They are among  in the last decade, and they are geopolitical adversaries of Western nations. Western nations' interests consist primarily of protecting human rights, defending global law and order, and preserving political liberalism  not to be confused with partisan liberalism . By contrast, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran are disinterested in, or actively opposed to, these notions.To be fair, these three nations do not represent all top oil producers or exporters - Canada and Norway are top producers too, after all. But many such nations do often engage in very destructive behavior that runs counter to Western interests, and they fund their activities in part by selling their oil to the world. Should the world and its governments transition away from oil and produce their own renewable energy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other such oil-rich nations' influence and ability to cause trouble would decline. Therefore, Western governments will come to view the abandonment of oil as a national security objective, and will pursue it as they do other national security issues.Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC OPEC , which was formed to set global oil prices by controlling output levels, is capable of disrupting Western and world affairs by  as it sees fit. Switching to renewable energy sources would grant energy independence and price stability to not just Western nations, but most nations on earth, and would diminish OPEC's influence on energy prices and global affairs. Many nations would therefore follow the West in abandoning oil for renewables, if only to free themselves from OPEC's price controls.All of this will further contribute to the steep decline in oil demand, as well as the decline in revenues and profits for the oil industry.As if the consequences of using its main product were not already controversial enough, the oil industry often courts scandal and . From the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, to the constant stories of lies and real or perceived corruption involving the oil industry, be it  or ,  or , the well-publicized fiascos surrounding oil companies have caused many people to view them with negative sentiment ranging from cautious suspicion to reflexive conspiratorial distrust. This sentiment is captured in well-worn tropes in entertainment media that oilmen are immoral robber barons, and that the entire industry is led by crooks, thieves, and liars in fancy suits.More importantly, the industry's scandals and reputation, its , and the rising prices of gasoline petrol have earned it a conspicuous lack of customer loyalty. These companies have a lot of  built into their customer base, and by the same token likely have low organic fidelity among consumers. This isn't all that surprising - people, especially Americans, have held negative opinions of oil companies dating back , and such disdain likely has a much longer history.What's more, oil companies don't seem prepared to use consumer data to boost customer loyalty. According to , only a third of the oil industry has invested in utilizing Big Data and data analytics to improve their business. This includes building systems and programs that leverage consumer data to improve customer retention and increase customer loyalty. Without these Big Data approaches or other strategies, most of the industry will find it even more difficult to woo new customers to their business, or ensure existing customers keep using their products instead of the viable substitutes that will become widespread this decade.When the ease of switching to renewables for consumers and institutions becomes readily apparent, and when the severity of headwinds to the fossil fuel industry reaches a critical mass, ordinary consumers and large entities will both flock to renewables in droves, resulting in sudden, severe, and sustained demand destruction for oil and other fossil fuels.This is almost certainly true for Exxon, which even has an oil spill named after it. Unfortunately for Exxon, the reputational damage and name recognition from the spill never quite faded from the public consciousness  this increases the likelihood that consumers will pivot away from its products at the downstream level earlier and faster than for other downstream oil firms, worsening its position as the energy transition kicks off.Taken together, all signs point to a grim prognosis for Exxon Mobil, the oil industry, and the rest of the fossil fuel industry, as the world and the energy sector replace fossil fuels with renewables. As such, I believe investors should mark the 2020s as the last time they can profit off of companies in the fossil fuel industry, and should strongly consider abandoning these companies, including Exxon, as long term investments.Companies that are heavily invested in fossil fuels and are slow or reluctant to embrace renewable energy will perform poorly over time, and will likely experience a major crash by the end of the decade from which they probably will not recover.This includes Exxon, of course, as well as names such as Chevron Corporation , The Phillips 66 Company , Sempra , ONEOK, Inc. , OGE Energy Corp. , Brooge Energy Ltd , WEC Energy Group, Inc. , White Energy Company Ltd , Magellan Midstream Partners , Sunoco LP , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. , Enbridge Inc. , TC Energy Corporation , TotalEnergies SE , , Marathon Oil Corporation , Marathon Petroleum Corporation , Valero Energy Corporation , NuStar Energy LP , Ovintiv Inc. , Cenovus Energy Inc. , ConocoPhillips Company , Eni S.p.A. , , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Ring Energy Inc. , VAALCO Energy, Inc.  Occidental Petroleum Corporation , Petróleo Brasileiro S.A.  aka Petrobras  , Pampa Energía S.A. , , Callon Petroleum Company , Imperial Petroleum Inc. , NiSource, Inc. , Devon Energy Corporation , Energy Transfer LP , Ecopetrol S.A. , Vistra Corp. , The Williams Companies, Inc. , Canadian Natural Resources Limited , Koninklijke Vopak N.V. , , InPlay Oil Corp. , Inpex Corporation , , Shell plc , , Dominion Energy, Inc. , Duke Energy Corporation , Baker Hughes Company , Enterprise Products Partners L.P. , APA Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , Warrior Met Coal, Inc. , PBF Energy Inc. , and many more.On the other hand, pure play renewable energy companies, and other firms fully entrenched in the renewable energy space, have a bright future ahead of them in this decade and beyond. These include Enel S.p.A. , , Ørsted A S , , Iberdrola S.A. , , ReNew Energy Global plc , Carnegie Clean Energy Ltd. , Ocean Power Technologies , Tesla Inc. , Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. , Brookfield Renewable , , Freyr Battery , Array Technologies, Inc. , Nano One Materials Corp. , Novonix Ltd , , LiCycle Holdings Corp , Maxeon Solar Technologies , First Solar Inc. , Azure Power Global Ltd , Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A.  aka Eletrobrás  , Acciona, S.A. , Nextracker Inc. , AmmPower Corp. , Enphase Energy, Inc. , Fluence Energy, Inc. , and Vestas Wind Systems A S , , among others. Investors who stick with companies like these will be able to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that stands to imperil fossil fuel producers, including the oil industry.As an aside, you may notice the presence of renewable energy utility companies among the  winners  in the energy transition, despite my belief in the likely disruption of utility companies in the long term. The reason I list them here is because I believe that if any group of utility companies can survive and endure the transition to decentralized renewable energy, it will be the renewable energy utilities. These are the types of utilities that government regulators and average citizens would be most likely to support keeping as grid stabilizers, much like natural gas peaker plants support the current fossil fuel-based energy grid today. This is assuming that grid stabilization by renewable utilities is even needed in the future, considering the  in tandem with the transition to decentralized renewable energy use.Nevertheless, even if renewable utilities see a slump in demand long-term as renewable energy production decentralizes, they will still be winners compared to traditional utilities, which will likely decline much further by comparison due to their centralized nature combined with their fossil fuel-based energy generation, a double whammy for their prospects.Like the contributor who wrote the article stating her belief in a new age of oil, many investors assume that demand for oil will remain robust for an extended period of time  they may even have a multi-decade timespan in mind. Therefore, the coming wave of demand destruction throughout this decade will likely catch investors and the oil industry by surprise, and will trigger a collapse in industry revenues and profits. This in turn will cause an investor panic and a selloff of oil stocks, creating a vicious cycle of oil industry underperformance and investor backlash.This cycle will be compounded by the transformation of productive and valuable oil assets  e.g. drilling equipment, pipelines, refineries, thermal power plants, gasoline petrol station infrastructure, etc.  into unproductive stranded assets that further damage company balance sheets across the industry. Investors who keep their faith in the industry will ignore the warning signs and may double down as this all unfolds, retaining their shares or even buying dips on the expectation of a recovery. When the dust settles, many oil investors will have lost significant sums of capital. They won't be alone, though - investors in companies across the fossil fuel industry will sustain similar losses.For Exxon Mobil, all of these negative consequences will be felt even more severely, since it is exposed to all three streams  upstream, midstream, and downstream  in the oil industry. Exxon's exposure to all three streams also makes it the likeliest to feel these consequences first, since they could appear in any one of these streams before the others. Perhaps in the medium term Exxon will be able to shift its primary operations to whichever stream seems to be declining the slowest, but the eventual collapse of all three streams will ensure that, barring an exit from the oil industry, Exxon will decline severely along with the oil industry.Meanwhile, as fossil fuel projects age, become socially or politically unpopular, or become uneconomical to operate or maintain, they will be replaced by renewables. As fossil fuel firms start to fail, renewable companies will proliferate and grow. Renewable firms will take market share and capital from the old guard, and will become the vanguard leading the energy sector. These renewable companies will then steadily increase in status, value, and market cap, and will handsomely reward investors who sent capital their way - especially the early investors.For those currently invested in oil companies like Exxon, and fossil fuel companies in general, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of the energy transition is to get out of these companies as soon as possible, and pivot to renewable energy firms.Several fossil fuel companies have claimed that they will engage in renewables adoption, carbon emissions reduction, and carbon capture so as to reach  carbon neutrality  or  net zero carbon emissions  by 2050. This includes many oil and gas companies listed in the last section, including , , , and of course, . Respectfully, I believe that these pledges to be carbon neutral by 2050 may amount to plans to be bankrupt by 2035.The renewable energy transition will transform the energy sector, and other sectors, in a span of years, not decades. Former fossil fuel companies like Enel and Ørsted have already invested heavily into renewables, and now only have to focus on expansion, demonstrating much greater foresight in the past and reaping the rewards for it today. In my view, the factors causing the ramp up of renewable energy usage will trigger rapid, exponential demand destruction of fossil fuels throughout the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors during the 2020s decade, leaving little room for fossil fuel firms in most markets by the mid-2030s. Fossil fuel companies that have no plans to be carbon neutral or renewables-focused by then would consequently have little recourse as multiple sectors of the global economy leave fossil fuels behind.Further, while many fossil fuel companies are taking credit for building up renewable energy generation capacity, these companies still rely almost entirely on fossil fuel energy to prop up their business. Shell is a good example  a renewables-focused section of its website touts its wind and solar projects as contributing   expressed as 1000 gigawatt hours  of renewable energy to the grid, but even if Shell's total renewables amount was doubled to account for nuclear, hydropower, green hydrogen, etc., it would still account for less than one percent of Shell's  of total energy produced in 2021, with the difference being made up of fossil fuels. This is at a point in time when, according to the International Energy Agency and International Council on Clean Transport, electric vehicles jumped from  to  of the global car market for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.In other words, as one of the biggest sources of global demand for Shell and other oil companies products, gasoline petrol, is being eroded at an annual rate of 4-5  in absolute terms, and with an acceleration of such erosion very likely due to the factors detailed throughout this article that will boost renewable technology adoption, Shell declares that it is still more than 99  dependent on the very product whose demand is being eroded. This clearly does not bode well for oil companies' prospects during the energy transition, as many, if not most, other oil companies are in roughly the same condition of oil dependence as Shell, and display a severe lack of urgency in switching to renewables.But even when these companies promise to transition to renewables or go net zero, there is no guarantee they will follow through. Oil firm BP p.l.c. ,   to cut natural gas production by 40  and end oil and gas exploration for the foreseeable future, among several other climate initiatives. Yet now, the company is  on its climate plans, perhaps due to a banner year for its finances on the back of record oil profits in 2022 that the company is loath to give up. Whatever the reason, such backpedaling shows that oil and gas companies cannot be counted on to fully commit to transition to renewables.On top of this, many fossil fuel firms list natural gas as a renewable fuel, and count it as part of their net zero goals. NiSource is a good example of this. Its   page 14  is to reach net zero by 2040, which sounds impressive on its face, but the company goes on to say that it will do so by  advanc ing  other low- or zero emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and , and support the deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies,   emphasis added .At baseline, the inclusion of natural gas, to be sure a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal and oil, is nevertheless at odds with any zero-emissions goals. Pivoting to this slightly cleaner fossil fuel will only delay the inevitable for any company trying this strategy, because natural gas, even renewably generated gas, still produces carbon dioxide emissions when burned for energy, just like oil and coal do. To add insult to injury, the main component of natural gas, methane, has more much  than carbon dioxide when it leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned. Natural gas is also usually mined or otherwise extracted from the ground in large deposits with other fossil fuels, with all the related environmental concerns that such extraction brings  this makes natural gas prone to the same centralization issues and market quirks that consumers dislike regarding oil. For these reasons, I think natural gas is on the fossil fuel chopping block this decade, along with oil and coal.Worse yet, while NiSource acknowledges that its reliance on gas necessitates engaging in carbon capture to reach its 2040 net zero goal, the company cannot even guarantee that it will be able to capture as much carbon as it emits in 2040, since it is uncertain of the technological and economic feasibility of carbon capture by its 2040 timeframe. To be fair, I doubt any company can predict the long-term feasibility of carbon capture at this time. Logically, then, all companies relying on the assumption of feasible carbon capture to mitigate their natural gas or other fossil fuel usage are, in fact, merely  for net zero emissions by their stated timeframe, not actually committing to net zero.Sadly, NiSource isn't the only firm choosing the speculative path of carbon capture. Per the company's , Exxon states that  t hrough 2027, we plan to invest approximately  17 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions   and  help in  reducing others' emissions through commercializing and scaling     emphasis added . Exxon's 2023 Climate Report also states that  a ll energy sources are projected to remain important through 2050, with   emphasis added . This is in addition to the  sustained investment  in oil and gas, presumably by Exxon, that the company claims will be needed to meet the world's energy demands in 2050.Setting aside the strong possibility that oil and gas won't even make up a double digit percentage of the 2050 energy mix, this report makes me question whether Exxon's management is just skeptical of the coming wave of renewables this decade, or is simply ignorant of it. Either way, management's assumption of the continued reign of oil and gas, its implicit decision to divert even more funds toward oil and gas production over the next 27 years, and its inclusion of carbon capture as part of its net zero plans, reveal how unprepared it will be to steer the company out of danger if and when renewables begin to rapidly displace fossil fuels in the 2020s and beyond, putting Exxon's oil business and financial security at risk.For all their backsliding and sluggish execution, oil and gas companies appear to at least be talking the talk on adopting renewables and reducing carbon emissions. Coal companies seem content to say and do nothing, despite the even greater risks to coal as one of the dirtier and  fossil fuels  notwithstanding the current transient  due to the 2022 energy crisis . Case in point, coal companies Warrior Met Coal and Thungela Resources Limited  appear to have no plans to reach net zero anytime soon, even with the looming threat of electrified steelmaking technology indirectly , an industry central to both firms' businesses.In the end, the announced renewables projects and net zero goals by many fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, are unlikely to amount to anything substantial enough to save these companies from the harsh consequences of the energy transition, and they certainly won't be substantial enough to imperil my thesis. At the current glacial pace of renewables adoption these companies are engaging in, fossil fuel firms' oft-stated goal of net zero by 2050 is all talk. Unfortunately for these firms, while talk is cheap, renewables will be cheaper, and consumers will at least want to buy the latter by the mid-2030s.I believe that the oil industry, and the fossil fuel industry at large, is experiencing its last boom. Renewables are virtually at price parity with fossil fuels, declining further in cost, increasingly supported by regulators and governments, less risky in terms of geopolitics and national security, and are universally adoptable. Oil companies in particular have gained a negative reputation and a lack of loyalty from their customers, who will abandon them at the first opportunity. The headwinds that will catalyze said abandonment will strengthen over this decade, and soon the house of cards that is the oil industry's financial security may collapse quite suddenly. Subsequent revenue and earnings shortfalls will then trigger a major selloff of oil stocks, leaving many investors as blindsided bagholders.Since Exxon Mobil's fate is intertwined with the oil industry, all of these events mean that Exxon Mobil, once a king in the energy sector, is likely doomed to shrink into a shadow of its former self as the oil industry contracts, assuming the company does not go into bankruptcy during the oil industry's decline. Significant sums of shareholder capital invested in the energy sector could be lost along the way if investors refuse to acknowledge this likely reality.Meanwhile, renewable companies will become preferred providers of power, since their energy generation is a cheaper, safer, less risky alternative to fossil fuel use. Consequently, pure play renewable companies will gain the preferential treatment and market share advantages that fossil fuel firms, including oil companies, once enjoyed. This is in spite of fossil fuel companies' purported attempts to cut emissions and adopt renewables themselves  their lack of urgency exposes their renewable adoption efforts to be, at best, inadequate to address the challenges ahead of them as the energy transition proceeds in earnest.The trajectory of both renewable and fossil fuel energy sources is well-captured by a figure in a presentation by RethinkX, the think tank claiming that renewables have been cheaper than fossil fuels for over a decade. It visually depicts the feedback loops that tend to occur with most, if not all, innovative and disruptive technologies as they are introduced to the market and compete with traditional technologies. It also demonstrates the effect that these feedback loops have on market share  in effect, these loops propel disruptive technologies to exponentially capture share from traditional technologies until the disruptors completely replace the traditional players.This specific RethinkX figure shows the S-curve of market share transfer that will occur in the energy sector as positive feedback loops boost renewables, labeled the SWB  solar, wind, and battery storage  System, and simultaneously crush oil and other fossil fuels, labeled the Old Energy System. If you come away with nothing else from this article, at least remember this figureUltimately, the trends taking shape this decade foreshadow a steep and lasting decline for the oil industry, and massive losses may be in store for investors who believe the runway for oil is many years, or even decades, long. I therefore strongly recommend that long-term investors in the energy sector pivot to renewable firms now, and ensure that they are on the right side of the energy transition before it's too late.As for Exxon, needless to say, the company as we know it today is likely done for. Even if it becomes the undisputed king of the oil industry, it would make no sense to own the company's stock as the energy transition progresses, since Exxon will be taking a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. While renewables rise, fossil fuels, the oil industry, and Exxon itself will all be forced to contract in size, meaning that XOM stock will likely decline. As such, buying or holding XOM for the long term would only result in the destruction of shareholder capital.Therefore, for long-term energy investors, I rate XOM a strong sell, and I suggest that long-term investors also reconsider their ownership of all other fossil fuel holdings.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Hints Of A Major Economic Slowdown In Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Data,"Monthly estimates of Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE  contained in the report on , published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA  constitute some of the most important high frequency indicators of economic activity in the U.S. The most recentlyWe begin our examination of the BEAs report on PCE in the month of August 2023, with summary data and analysis which we highlight in Figure 1. We recommend that readers pay particular attention to the percent rank of Month-on-Month  MoM  growth, MoM acceleration, and the surprisesThere was a very major deceleration in nominal and especially real  inflation-adjusted  consumption expenditures. However, since the median forecast was expecting an even greater deceleration, the PCE data actually represented a modest upside surprise. Looking a bit deeper, most of this upside surprise is attributable to the fact that the median forecast was expecting the PCE Price Index  PCEPI  to reflect inflation of 0.5  compared to the actual figure of 0.4 . In other words, the modest positive surprise in real expenditure was primarily due to the PCE inflation surprise rather than nominal expenditure surprise.In this section, we highlight the impact of inflation on this month's PCE data. Inflation affects the purchasing power of any given dollar amount of money that is spent by consumers. In other words, inflation affects the quantity of goods and or services that a given amount of money can buy. In Figure 2, we show PCE in both  current dollars  and in  real  terms. The  real  figures adjust the nominal current dollar figures for the changes in purchasing power caused by inflation deflation . The purchasing power adjustments to the PCE consumer spending data are made by applying the appropriate PCE price indexes  PCEPI , that are published on the same day as the report on Personal Income and Outlays.As can be seen above, the MoM real growth in spending for goods was actually negative, particularly in the most economically sensitive sectors such as in Durable Goods category. Durable goods prices experienced some deflation in August, reinforcing the impression of economic weakness in this economically sensitive sector.For the remainder of this article, all figures will be presented in  real   inflation adjusted  terms.In this section we break down Real Personal Consumption Expenditures into major components, scrutinizing their annualized growth rates over various time frames  1m, 3m, 6m and 12m . The purpose of this analysis is two-fold. Our first purpose is to identify which components of PCE are growing at a faster or slower rate than the overall aggregates. Our second purpose is to determine whether, and to what extent, growth rates are accelerating or decelerating over various time frames.As can be seen from this table, the divergence between growth in goods and services is quite notable. For example, while 1-month and 6-month growth in Services is registering at historically above-average rates, growth in goods is well below historical averages. Indeed, the growth in the more economically sensitive goods sector is similar to what has historically been seen in periods prior to past recessions.In this section our analysis is focused on the component contributions to the MoM Change and MoM Acceleration that are attributable to select major components of PCE.What we can see in the table above is that the deceleration in overall PCE is primarily attributable to the significant deceleration in the goods sector -- despite the fact that the goods sector has a much lower weighting in PCE than the services sector. This is important to note because the goods sector more  economically sensitive  than the services sector and it therefore tends to lead trends in economic slowdowns and recessions.Personal Consumption Expenditures, including import content, accounts for slightly more than 70  of the BEA's estimate of total expenditures  for final consumption  in the U.S. If imported content  not included in calculation of GDP  is excluded, PCE account for roughly 62  of US GDP. If all expenditures on goods in services in the US are taken into account  including business-to-business spending in primary and intermediate stages of production  the share of PCE in total expenditures is slightly less than 30 . Whichever way one looks at it, PCE data provides important information about the major tendencies and trends in consumer spending and consumption in the US.The PCE data for August indicates a major overall slowdown in consumer spending in the US economy. When excluding expenditure items that are non-cyclical, such as healthcare and other types of services that tend to be somewhat insensitive to overall economic changes that are impacting spending and production in other more sensitive areas of the economy, it can be seen that the slowdown in PCE is quite significant, with real spending growth in economically sensitive categories exhibiting growth that is similar to historical precedents in pre-recessionary periods.In our view, the significant weakening in consumer spending is being somewhat masked in the overall PCE data by economically insensitive and lagging categories. Indeed, some of these insensitive categories are somewhat misleading because they don't represent spending by consumers at all. Such is the case with  imputed  expenditure items and other items that reflect expenditures  on behalf of  consumers  e.g., Medicare and Medicaid expenditures .We believe that weakness in consumer spending will become an increasingly notable trend in coming monthsWe do not think that most financial market participants have caught on to the incipient weakness in real  inflation-adjusted  consumer spending, particularly in the most economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy.In the short-run, evidence of an economic slowdown may be taken as  good news,  since many market participants will believe that this will take pressure off of the Fed to continue their hawkish policies and rhetoric. However, we believe that on a multi-month time view, as the extent of the slowdown in consumer spending becomes more serious and more clearly understood, this will likely exert downward pressure on bond yields and downward pressure on the prices of common stocks, particularly in economically sensitive sectors.In the short-term, markets will probably enjoy a bit of a respite from this relatively weak PCE data. But readers should be on the lookout for economic data that indicate deepening of the currently incipient economic slowdown. If and when this occurs, the current complacent attitudes of  bad news is good news,  will tend to shift towards more fearful sentiments of  bad news is bad news.The data on Personal Consumption Expenditures provide some of the most  if not the most  significant indicators of economic activity in the US, available at a monthly frequency. The most astute investors are able to capitalize on sound analysis of macroeconomic indicators such as PCE to boost performance and minimize risk in their investment portfolios. How  First of all, the cyclical  and sometimes even major sub-cyclical  movements in the macroeconomy tend to be major causal drivers of movements in financial asset prices  bonds and equities . Second, assets associated with particular industries or  factors  tend to outperform during specific phases and stages of the U.S. business cycle.As a general matter, we think that recent evidence of an overall economic slowdown, which has been strengthened by this PCE report, requires investors to conduct an in-depth review their portfolio strategy and allocations.If you are really serious about improving your investment performance -- during this historic moment that is providing once-in-a-decade opportunities -- I highly recommend that you subscribe to  This service is designed to empower you to become a successful strategic manager of your investments.

ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy Q3 2023 Portfolio Manager Commentary,"Energy MLP stocks were a bright spot in a challenging third quarter for equity markets, with the Alerian MLP Index returning 9.89  as the S P 500 Index ,  declined 3.27 . Supply cuts from OPEC  combined with lower U.S. inventories pushed oil prices higher, fueling further inflation and interest rate concerns   a headwind for broad equities, but a positive for energy stocks.The dynamics affecting the MLP market remain unchanged. Global economies continue to face multiple headwinds, led by a combination of stubbornly high  though recently moderating  inflation, elevated geopolitical uncertainty and lingering supply chain and policy impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., we have begun to see the dampening effects on the economy of tighter monetary conditions. During 2022, equity markets began pricing in a reasonable chance of recession, both in the U.S. and abroad. Thus far in 2023, global equity markets have recovered most of the losses incurred during 2022 and expectations are increasing that developed economies might avert a severe recession.Crude oil prices fell from more than  120 per barrel in June 2022 to  70 per barrel to end June 2023. Recession fears left oil market traders fearful of global demand downdrafts for crude oil in 2023 much like those witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis  GC . A stronger U.S. dollar and large-scale releases of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  further pressured oil prices. On the other hand, demand fear was partially offset by some optimism for a rebound in China consumption with the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. The surprise OPEC  supply cut of 1.1 million barrels per day at the end of March also likely puts a floor on oil prices over the near term. With better visibility on global demand impacts from rising interest rates, oil prices steadied and rose in July, August and September.Essentially all of this oil demand growth is expected in developing nations, rather than OECD nations. We would argue that oil prices of roughly  70 per barrel at the end of June discounted that oil demand growth will not approach levels expected by oil economists in 2023 and 2024. Said differently, oil traders seem to expect a material contraction in global oil demand growth rates compared to oil economists. A final twist to oil demand analysis remains the timing of the U.S. refilling its vastly depleted SPR. After drawing down the SPR by roughly 275 million barrels  or  45  in the previous 18 months, the U.S. government announced in June initial plans to begin refilling the SPR beginning in September. Thus, what has been a meaningful source of supply in the crude oil markets will become a source of demand looking forward.If global oil demand growth does approach roughly 2 million barrels per day in 2023 and another 1.0-1.5 million barrels per day in 2024, we see upside in oil prices over the balance of 2023 and into 2024. The supply side of the global oil market will meaningfully struggle to meet that kind of demand growth. We would also argue that the incremental barrel of oil supply in such a scenario will almost have to be a barrel of U.S. oil   continuing to drive visibility in U.S. oil production growth to the benefit of U.S. midstream companies.Looking at natural gas, the short-term outlook is decidedly negative while the intermediate- to long-term outlook remains robust. An almost complete lack of typical weather last winter left natural gas storage levels 32  higher at the end of March 2023 than a year before. Higher storage levels entering the spring and summer also equates to lower natural gas demand to refill storage levels. As a result, U.S. natural gas prices fell from above  5 per mmbtu at the end of March 2022 to  2 per mmbtu at the end of March 2023. In our view, pricing for U.S. natural gas will not meaningfully recover until the beginning of winter  with an effective reset on storage levels .With continued organic domestic demand growth and increasing demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas  LNG  in the international markets, the intermediate- to long-term outlook for U.S. natural gas prices and necessary production levels remains constructive for U.S. midstream companies.Valuation for U.S. midstream companies remains well below the levels seen before the pandemic. Entering 2020, enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  multiples stood at roughly 10.5x. Despite the rebound the sector has experienced since the March 2020 lows, the sector today trades at 8.4x   despite what we view as a vastly better business model. Dividend distribution coverage has moved from 1.1x to more than 2.0x. The sector has moved from being free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive  increasingly so in 2023  and balance sheet leverage  debt EBITDA  has moved from more than 5.0x to below 3.5x. With no need for midstream companies to access capital markets for the foreseeable future, we increasingly expect excess cash flow  above and beyond capital spending and dividends distributions  to be used for increasing share buybacks and further increasing dividends distributions.With improving financial metrics and continued low valuations, we still see solid upside potential for the U.S. midstream sector despite strong performance in 2022 and thus far in 2023.The ClearBridge Energy MLP Strategy underperformed its Alerian MLP Index benchmark during the third quarter. In terms of absolute performance, all four subsectors in which the Strategy is invested made positive contributions, with the diversified energy infrastructure subsector contributing the most and the natural gas transportation   storage subsector the main laggard.On a relative basis, the Strategy underperformed due primarily to stock selection effects. In particular, stock selection in the liquids transportation   storage and natural gas transportation   storage subsectors detracted.In terms of individual holdings, Energy Transfer LP , Targa Resources , Plains All American Pipeline LP , Cheniere Energy Partners LP  and Magellan Midstream Partners LP  were the main contributors. The main individual detractors were Enbridge , TC Energy , Kinder Morgan , Hess Midstream LP  and Equitrans Midstream .During the quarter holding Magellan Midstream Partners LP was acquired by holding ONEOK .

NextEra Energy Partners: Resetting Growth Expectations (Rating Downgrade),"Perhaps it is coming as little surprise, but   has announced they are resetting their  through 2026. They are taking it down from the 12Of course, the big factor listed in this revised growth trajectory would be the current interest rate environment.While perhaps not too surprising, a little disappointing as they had just a couple of months ago once again reiterated their growth expectations for the distribution at 12 to 15  but said that they anticipated it coming in lower to the bottom of this range. So this is a big shift in such a short period of time.That is likely one of the reasonsGoing along with the distribution growth reduction was due to reduced , they noted that adjusted EBITDA and CAFD ranges are also being reduced. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of  1.9 to  2.1 billion. CAFD will be in the range of  730 to  820 million.These outlooks are down from the  2.22 to  2.42 billion it originally anticipated for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD of  770 to  860 million. Here was from the  posted just on July 25, 2023.In this same outlook, that also meant they were anticipating significant earnings growth into the double-digits for the back half of this year.Now that we are nearly done with the latest quarter, they are probably seeing the writing on the wall with the numbers coming in. Though, the warning sign for me should have been that they saw flat or even negative adjusted EBITDA and CAFD in the first two quarters of this year.With that being said, I still took management's guidance. They know the business way more than I would. However, it would make me more cautious about believing management, since they couldn't see even a couple of months down the road on what could be happening to their business. They knew where interest rates were, and even with the news that the Fed expects fewer cuts in interest rates next year, that shouldn't have dramatically shifted their outlook to such a significant degree.Currently, NEP is still a Core Portfolio position in my portfolio, and I have held it for a number of years. This has moved below even my lower cost basis by a significant amount, but I believe that distribution growth going forward is still attractive. I plan to continue to hold this position, but it has definitely been one of the main detractors, bringing down my overall performance.Additionally, the puts that I had sold remain outstanding at a  65 strike that was rolled a number of times this year. I've looked at a number of options to roll, but being so far in-the-money now and having fairly limited options volume anyway is sort of putting the position in a very difficult spot to get out of without significant losses. It's a lose-lose situation.For now, I plan to hang onto those written puts unless something more appealing presents itself, but the chances for early assignment have increased substantially - and they were already highThis is one that I definitely got in way too early as it was coming down, and I got it totally wrong. A sad time for dividend investors with yet another victim in 2023 after another income favorite, W. P. Carey , also reset their dividend payout and took investors by surprise. Though, in this case, NEP isn't cutting its distribution to unitholders. The year-end annualized rate is expected to be  3.52 against the current  3.416. At the same time, the capital loss on these units still makes this a huge punch in the gut.Check out  where we provide ideas about high-quality and reliable dividend growth ideas.

Aker Carbon Capture ASA (AKCCF) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aker Carbon Capture ASA  Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2023 9 00 AM ETEgil Fagerland - CEODavid Phillips - Head, Capital MarketsGood afternoon, and welcome to the presentation for Aker Carbon Capture's results for the third quarter of 2023. My name is David Phillips, Head of Capital Markets. I'm joined today by my colleague, Egil Fagerland, our CEO.Egil will start the main presentation. Then this will be followed by a Q A with the audience. So firstly, Egil will take us through our main achievements and progress from the third quarter of this year, and will run through a number of topics that are important to our strategy. Then he will take us through our key Q3 financials, including some outlook commentary for the rest of the year.And finally, we will take your Q A via the online system. Just as a reminder, you can post your questions into the system at any time. And at the end, we will try and work through as many of them as time allows.So Egil, over to you.Thank you, David. So this is the agenda for our presentation today. Following a highly active third quarter, we will address the highlights of this quarter, our operations and business development, our delivery models and the financial highlights. Finally, the way forward will be highlighted as well. Then we will move on to Q A.But first, before we start the highlights from the Q3, we have a short introduction to the company. Aker Carbon Capture is a pure-play carbon capture company, offering modular and configurable plants with the strength of the Aker Group behind it. Today, we're already delivering 7 carbon capture plants. We are making carbon capture happen.OurSince mid-2020, Aker Carbon Capture has focused on the European and Scandinavian and Benelux markets together with U.K. With an increased policy support for CCUS in North America, we have started our market entry there as well. Also, we're exploring potential positions and markets in the rest of Europe and the Middle East.We continue to prioritize our 4 market segments with high market activity, cement, bio and waste-to-energy, gas-to-power and blue hydrogen. And we're also seeing good engagement with a number of additional segments where our technology is well-suited to capture CO2, such as the refining industry and process industries. Our technology has been tested and verified across all these segments.Now to the highlights of this quarter. We've seen a significant growth in pre-FEEDs and studies this quarter. With order intake year-to-date, 4 pre-FEEDs and studies, around 9 million tonnes of CO2 per year. In July, we signed a MoU with Aramco, one of the world's leading integrated energy and chemical companies.The MoU is to explore partnership opportunities to deploy CCUS and industrial modularization in Saudi Arabia, and we've strengthened our modular product portfolio with the launch of Just Catch 400.Through the third quarter, we've also seen good progress on our major projects. At Twence, the plant has started commissioning. At Brevik, the first heavy lift campaign has been successfully completed. And for Orsted Kalundborg, the container fabrication for the modular Just Catch units has started. In addition, 2 of our U.K. FEEDS and pre-FEED projects are in the final negotiations for government support.Our backlog remains strong at NOk3 billion on the backlog Orsted Kalundborg CCS award in the second quarter. I'm also happy to share that we've continued our revenue growth in Q3, more than doubling our top line compared to the same period last year. All this, while maintaining a cash position at NOk1.3 billion.This quarter, we've also appointed Julie Berg as CFO. Julie brings with her a vast experience in finance, risk assessment and compliance, and she will start on December 1 this year.Now let's take a closer look at the significant growth in our pre-FEED and studies work. In the quarter, we've continued to see a considerable development across regions and industries, further supporting the positive momentum we've been witnessing over time now for CCUS and the market.The EU, France, Germany and U.S. have all introduced supportive CCUS ambitions and favorable regulations the last couple of months. These are important steps for realizing and accelerating the broader industrial decarbonization across both sides of the Atlantic.And with this as a backdrop, I'm happy to share with you that Aker Carbon Capture has been awarded a number of strategic pre-FEEDs and studies across Europe and North America this quarter.In Europe, we strengthened our foothold with pre-FEEDs and studies in Sweden, Germany and France for the waste-to-energy and biomass and power plant sectors, all based on our standardized and modular Just Catch with a capacity ranging between 200,000 tonnes and 250,000 tonnes of CO2 per year per plant. A clear sign that there is a strong interest for the Just Catch product in the market.Then in the U.S., we were awarded a Big Catch study covering emissions from several mineral production facilities with a combined capture capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.And recently, just before our presentation today, we signed a pre-FEED contract for a major European power company, covering a portfolio of power plants in Europe. The planned capture capacity could reach up to 14 million tonnes of CO2 per year for the sites combined. Some of these plants have the potential to become the largest capture plants in Europe.Finally, R D is important to further develop our technology to maximize carbon reduction and removal, while minimizing climate and environmental impacts.In Q3, we've initiated 3 new projects  first, investigating new classes of capture solvents in collaboration with DTU, the Technical University of Denmark  Second, reducing solvent consumption in collaboration with, amongst others, SINTEF  and Third, as a part of the Northern Lights  project, we aim to further develop carbon accounting methodologies that will further enable carbon removal credits.As mentioned, overall, we see that CCUS commercial activities continue to pick up, not only throughout this past quarter, but throughout the whole financial year of 2023. So let's therefore take a closer look at the order intake year-to-date for Aker Carbon Capture.There's been a growing interest from emitters in Europe and the U.S. for our whole product portfolio, ranging from the modular Just Catch 100 and the Just Catch 400, the Just Catch Offshore and our bespoke Big Catch offering.Looking at our order intake year-to-date, Aker Carbon Capture has now contracted studies, Mobile Test Unit campaigns and pre-FEEDs for a combined capture capacity of 8.7 million tonnes of CO2 per year, counting more than 25 capture units altogether.When including the contract for delivery of 5 Just Catch 100 units to Orsted, the total intake for paid works added to our pipeline is close to 10 million tonnes of CO2 per year, and counting more than 30 capture units altogether.However, for clarity, please note that awards our 10 and '25 targets. The target to secure contracts to capture 10 million tonnes of CO2 by the end of 2025. We only count secured development contracts. This covers supply agreements for Just Catch, license and key equipment agreements for Big Catch and Carbon Capture as a service agreements. So the Orsted award earlier this year was an important step in this direction.Also note that, some of the most recent studies we have announced are not included in this overview as they have not commenced and were announced late in October.The growing interest for our modular Just Catch offers a significant opportunity. Our review of the market shows that emitters with between 100,000 and 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year account for around 3,000 industrial plants across Europe and North America.So now to our overall pipeline. When we launched in 2020, we set an ambitious target to secure contracts to capture 10 million tonnes of CO2 by the end of 2025. And as before, we visualized this progress towards the target in 4 categories.Secured development contracts, covering supply agreements, license and key equipment agreements and carbon capture as a service agreements  secured feed and tenders for development contracts  pre-FEED studies and Mobile Test Unit campaigns  and then finally, our prospects.Here, the 1 million tonnes in the chart represent our already secured contracts with Heidelberg Materials, Twence and Orsted, which has been awarded earlier and Orsted now latest during the second quarter this year.This is important progress that shows that we are able to successfully convert this pipeline of opportunities into secured work with timing, of course, strongly influenced by the pace of the market itself.But then to our tenders, FEEDs and PDPs, which are process design packages. This now stands at 7.9 million tonnes, a strengthening since the second quarter. It reflects the Net Zero Teesside Power and still the Keadby 3 in the U.K. and also includes tender activity for development contracts. This category has been strengthened through the quarter due to several studies and pre-FEEDs moving into the tender phase.Also in the quarter, we've seen a continued growth in pre-FEEDs, studies and Mobile Test Unit campaigns. Now this category has grown to 18.5 million tonnes, up from the last quarter. And reflecting on pre-FEEDs moving -- sorry, there are pre-FEEDs moving into the tender phase, and this has been offset by the new study work we've seen in the third quarter, both in the U.S. and in Europe.Then back in July, we signed an MoU with Aramco, one of the world's leading integrated energy and chemical companies. The MoU is to explore partnership opportunities to deploy CCUS and industrial modularization in Saudi Arabia. This MoU is a potential first step for Aker Carbon Capture into the Middle East.The MoU focuses on carbon emissions reduction and removal through modular carbon capture. Together with Aramco, we will assess the potential for developing local supply chains and module fabrication.The country targets to do CCUS for 9 million tonnes of CO2 per year from 2027, and they will expand this to 44 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2035. And through the Middle East Green Initiative, the region aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 670 million tonnes per year, representing around 10  of global nationally determined contributions.Now we move on to look in more detail at our operations. In the Netherlands, at Twence's waste-to-energy plant in Hengelo, all equipment and piping has been installed, as highlighted on the picture.Commissioning activities have started, and we plan for the Just Catch to be delivered around the end of this year, on track to start capturing 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year from 2024. Delivery of the modular Just Catch for Twence's waste-to-energy facility will pave the way for other companies in Europe, planning to decarbonize their operations through CCUS.At Brevik CCS, we're making solid progress by having successfully completed the first heavy lift campaign. The absorber and all the CO2 storage tanks have been installed on site. Also, 2 process pipe rack modules have been lifted in place, and we've started installation in the compressor area. When complete, the plant will be ready to capture 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.Then at Orsted Kalundborg CCS, we will deliver 5 modular and configurable third-generation Just Catch 100 and additional equipment such as liquefaction systems, temporary CO2 storage and on and off loading facilities.We see this project as a milestone for serial production of Just Catch Units, and it will enable us to deliver cost efficient and fast deployment of carbon capture. For this project, all long lead items have been ordered, and we've already started the container fabrication for the units. The total contract value is about  200 million, and the total capacity is 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.And then to the U.K. This remains a very important market for CCS with some important decision points over the next 6 to 12 months. At the end of March, the U.K. government confirmed which projects will go into the final negotiations for Track-1. And this is the Track-1 for government funding.At the end of July, the U.K. highlighted that the Track-2 process, which will include Acorn and Viking clusters, and also the last month, U.K. announced that the Track-1 expansion process will kick off towards the end of this year, with an ambition to move into final negotiations next fall.Aker Carbon Capture is the carbon capture provider for a FEED for BP Net Zero Teesside Power, the FEED for SSE Keadby 3 and the pre-FEED for Viridor's Runcorn CCS. All potential mega scale carbon capture projects in the U.K. Both BP's and Viridor's projects are in the final negotiations with the U.K. government for Track-1 funding.For SSE Keadby 3, the U.K. government will launch a process toward the end of this year to enable the expansion of the Track-1 clusters beyond the initial 8 projects that was announced. This aims to identify and select projects to join the Hynet and East Coast clusters, including the Humber where Keadby 3 is located, and their associated storage facilities as they become viable with a clear aim to be operational by 2030.These projects in the U.K. are important steps forward for the delivery of our Big Catch license and key equipment offering for mega scale carbon capture plans, where for both BP and SSE, we are the capture partner to a consortium of Aker Solutions, Siemens Energy and Altrad Babcock.Now I'll take you through our delivery models and financials. In our second quarter presentation, we introduced the Just Catch 400,000 tonnes per year as a concept. Today, we share some more details about the Just Catch 400 concept. This latest addition to our Just Catch product portfolio follows clear signals from the market, showing interest in the modular Just Catch unit with a higher capture capacity.Although the potential capture capacity of a single unit has significantly increased from our Just Catch 100, the footprint remains optimized and the delivery time efficient due to the prefabricated and completed modules.We're currently doing studies that cover 5 Just Catch 400 units. We see modularization and standardization as a clear market differentiator and accelerator. So in short, we delivered the Just Catch on an EPC basis or to be more accurate due to the high level of standardization under a Just Catch supply agreement, and we delivered under a carbon capture as a service agreement. And this is the offering where our customers simply pay per tonnes CO2 capture.Our Big Catch offering is focused on bespoke mega scale capture capacities sold as license and key equipment packages. As a rough guidance, you could expect license and key equipment contract sizes to be in the range of around 1 3 of the full EPC delivery, but with a higher long-term margin potential.We offer aftermarket services, solvent management and solvent supply for all our clients across all our offerings. And aftermarket revenue streams are expected to pick up over time, in line with the growing installed base of our Just Catch and Big Catch units.Since the third quarter of 2021, we have shared quarterly updates for the estimated levelized cost of the full value chain carbon capture as a service offering based on our modular Just Catch unit. Note that the CapEx and OpEx figures covers the capture facility, liquefaction and temporary storage. So all the pieces needed to do carbon capture and deliver the CO2 over for transportation and permanent storage.For our European delivery model, the full value chain range is unchanged since the last quarter at a range between  75 and  175 per tonnes. This has now been stable for the last few quarters and validated by our ongoing Just Catch deliveries.For North America and the view there, we see the potential to realize lower cost across the value chain, mainly due to lower transportation and storage costs, but also lower operating costs due to lower power prices. This gives an overall levelized cost range of USD 55 to USD 120 per tonne for that market.Now I'll take you through the key financial highlights of the third quarter before we move on to the summary and Q A. Bear in mind that all the numbers that are mentioned are in Norwegian kroner. Let's start with the income statement.Overall revenues for the third quarter was NOk440 million, which is up 116  compared to the same period last year. The growth in revenues is mainly driven by Big Catch and Just Catch projects, including the Orsted Kalundborg CCS project, which has progressed well in the quarter.Our reported third quarter EBITDA was negative NOk47 million, which is NOk9 million better than compared to the same quarter last year.Both Big Catch and Just Catch projects contributed positively in the quarter. However, you should note that the Orsted Kalundborg CCS project profit has not yet been recognized. To give you a better description of how project accounting and profit recognition principles on Aker Carbon Capture work, I would recommend that you review our Slide 31 in the appendix.The overall negative EBITDA continued to be driven by high sales and tender activity, as you can see from our pipeline, the entry into North America and R D activity. Our third quarter net current operating assets ended at negative NOk806 million, which represents a continued positive cash position on our key projects.Overall, operating assets and liabilities or net capital employed, which includes fixed and intangible assets, was negative NOk591 million. This shows that both our short-term and long-term business activities are currently funded by our net working capital position. We continue to have a healthy cash position of NOk1.3 billion, which could cover all of our liabilities 1.4x. And finally, our equity remained strong at NOk0.8 billion.We started the quarter with NOk1.138 billion in cash and cash equivalents. And through the quarter, we saw an overall cash inflow of NOk185 million. The market -- the main drivers were milestone payments on key projects, driving a NOk268 million net current operating assets, cash inflow.We had a loss before tax of NOk40 million and CapEx of NOk43 million, and the CapEx was mainly related to product development and the construction of a second Mobile Test Unit. In total, the cash and cash equivalents ended this quarter at NOk1.323 billion.These were the highlights of our historical financials. And now let's have a look ahead. Our financial outlook remains broadly in line with the outlook presented in the previous quarter. Our backlog ended the third quarter around NOk3 billion after including the Orsted Kalundborg CCS contract from the second quarter.By year of execution, we see this work at roughly NOk0.5 billion for the rest of 2023, around NOk1.3 billion in 2024 and another NOk1.2 billion in 2025 and beyond. As a reminder, all the order intakes are included in the backlog once a firm contract has been announced.We expect a positive impact on gross profit margin when profit is recognized from Orsted Kalundborg CCS. And here, I would remind you to go in the appendix and have a look at how we do project accounting. And we don't recognize profit for the project, that is due to the maturity of the project.Normally, at certain milestones in the project such as placement of key POs, purchase orders, or commencement of the installation work for the project, we typically start recognizing profit on these projects. And this is a  200 million contract, where the majority of the work will be done in 2024 and 2025. So you should expect to see an improvement in the numbers then.The serial delivery of the Just Catch units on the back of Twence CCU and Orsted Kalundborg CCS is expected to further drive improved profit margins through the backlog execution period. And we expect to see an increased conversion of tenders, FEEDS, pre-FEEDs and studies, 2 firm development contracts through the illustrated backlog execution period.Salary and personnel cost is expected to increase gradually with our activity growth, whereas other operating expenses and CapEx are expected to remain around current levels through the next 6 to 12 months.We continue to show a strong liquidity position, ending the quarter with a net cash position of NOk1.3 billion. This position is expected to trend towards NOk1 billion through the year. And please note, as usual, these comments do not include any assumptions for cash spend on M A or additional investment opportunities that might arise going forward. And the numbers might be subject to short-term working capital fluctuations.Now let me share with you a short summary of our way forward. We've set a clear direction to position for the huge market ahead of us. We're here to accelerate planet positive through carbon capture, carbon reduction and removal.We have prioritized European markets in 4 market segments  cement, bio and waste-to-energy, gas-to-power and blue hydrogen. And we see opportunities emerging in industry segments such as refining and process industries.We have a strategic ambition to successfully enter North America, and we're exploring our position with the rest of Europe and Middle East. Our proven technology is market-leading, and we will further improve energy efficiency and increase our focus on new technologies going forward.Through standardization, modularization and digitalization, we are expanding our cost-efficient product portfolio, cost reduction through serial production and working together with strategic suppliers is an important part of this journey. We'll offer the Just Catch on supply agreements and license and key equipment models for the Big Catch, followed by long-term service and solvent agreements.As a part of our aftermarket services, we will offer supply of solvent, performance optimization, digital operations and maintenance. We're also bringing the full CCUS value chain together through carbon capture as a service. And to meet the expected high growth in the market, we will continue to build strong partnerships.And finally, we're building our company through the devoted people who are making carbon capture happen now. And by delivering on our ongoing projects and setting an ambitious carbon capture target, we're in a strong position to make positive impact on our planet and to help our clients move towards a sustainable future.Thank you. And now we move on to the Q A section of the meeting.Okay. Thank you, and welcome back. I hope you enjoy the presentation. And we now move into the question-and-answer session for our presentation today.We will be taking questions on the system. This is a live system, as you know. So as usual, please do enter your questions during our discussion right now, and we'll get through as many as time allows. And thank you also for everyone who's already loaded the system up with some very, very good questions. We really appreciate the interest.So let's get things going. Firstly, from from Societe Generale in Paris. Two questions. Firstly, Egil, asking about the decline in backlog from Q2. What drove thatYes. So in Q2, we had a big order intake of the Orsted Kalundborg CCS project with 5 Just Catch, more than  200 million. So the decline from the second quarter to the third quarter is the revenue recognition that we've done in that period due to the progress on Orsted and also the other existing projects that we have. So that's a natural effect of having a bulky order intake in one period that you will see that being consumed over time.Absolutely. And also from Vincent asking about -- I think it's referring to the major pre-FEED we announced quite recently. How confident are we that this will convert into a real projectSo for all the studies and pre-FEEDs and MTU campaigns, we do, we do quite a tight follow-up whether or not we believe these projects have the potential to become real projects with FID. So we look at whether or not they're in the right area, right clients, right type of emissions and close enough to permanent storage that the project can make sense overall.Whether or not this particular one will move into FID, it's difficult to say at this stage. It's still early. Once we've done the study and the pre-FEED, it's going to be easier for us to comment on whether or not we believe it will have the full potential to move forward. But it's an extremely interesting project and a huge potential. And if Europe and the various countries in Europe are going to meet their targets, this type of project is definitely required.Okay. Moving on. Some questions from from Pareto now. A question on our pipeline, the tenders, FEEDs and PDPs and so on. This is now 7.9 million tonnes per year worth of projects. How much of this is PDPs  And how does the PDP differ from FEEDSo let me start with what -- how our PDP differs from a FEED. So a FEED is typically the work we do before a project goes into FID and becomes a development contract. When we do a PDP, a process design package, that is typically -- instead of a full FEED, because we're going to deliver license and key equipment or it could be just after a FEED, because we're going to deliver the license and key equipment and not do the full EPC.So in that bucket, there's an element of the process design packages, but we can't be specific about the exact number of PDPs we're doing there.Fair enough. I think it's still fair to say in that tenders and FEEDs bucket, it is still very much dominated by the large work in the U.K.Mainly dominated by FEEDs in the U.K. and also tenders for other projects.Yes, absolutely. So the next question from Carrie Elizabeth is about Track-1. It sounds like then for me, actually.Yes, go ahead.It's -- and so when can projects starting in the Track-1 tender hope to see construction commenceI guess, in the U.K., it's worth pointing out there are sort of 3 blocks, if you like, or 3 groups you should bear in mind. Number one, is the Track-1 list that is now in final negotiation stage. Number two, which includes -- by the way, even Net Zero Teesside and Viridor's Runcorn.Number two, is a Track-1 expansion phase, which most likely will include a number of projects that didn't get into that first 8 list. And this could include, theoretically, could include SSE Thermal's Keadby 3.And then you also have Track-2, which is the 2 projects or 2 clusters so far that we know that are Acorn in Scotland and also Viking on the East Coast. And in that list, there's not a lot of new news. The first new -- or I guess, if you look at what's happened in the last, let's say, few months, as Egil mentioned in his presentation, we know that there will be this Track-1 expansion process that will start later this year, November-December.And the ambition in that -- and this is not firm timing yet, but the ambition in that is to have those projects being selected and moving forward for fund negotiations by next autumn. So a little bit like this time, maybe slightly earlier next year. That's the expansion process.And that will also include quite a lot of other categories that weren't in Track-1. So for instance, by bioenergy, capture and storage or BECCS, that's also going to be in that phase if the projects are big enough as well.For Track-1 itself, those 8 projects, this is not a new news on this -- it's always been the case ever since we knew about those 8 projects at the end of -- I think, it was end of Q1 this year. Those 8 projects moving forward, we expect they'll be moving forward and to really taking some steps towards award middle of next year onwards, maybe a little bit in sort of Q3 next year, around that sort of time. That's the best indication.But this is still, as you know, in the U.K., this is not a finalized process. These are final negotiations. We still have to get those vital Ts and Cs sorted out with the government, with our customers before those really move forward.So moving on, Victoria from RBC, a number of questions from Victoria. First of all, net cash was stronger than expected going through Q3. Can we talk about the main moving parts in that free cash flow  What drove that to that point at Q3Yes. So the main driver of the cash increase this period was the project related milestone payments that we received from the clients when we achieve certain milestones. This typically comes ahead of cash outflows on the same projects as our vendors reach milestones as well. So we're expecting this cash to trend toward NOk1 billion at the end of the year.And then, of course, if you look at our working capital position, it's going to fluctuate through 2024 as well and maybe normalize a bit through that year.And that's exactly the other question that Victoria had around cash was, how will this progress to the next year and soYes, as expected.Good. Exactly. Good. So also moving on to the pre-FEED that we announced just recently, a very large one, the up to 14 million tonnes worth in Europe. Can we talk a little bit about what this involves, how long it might last, the pre-FEED phase that is  And what the timeline might be for that to progress to a real contractYes. It's a little bit early to say something about the time line. But you should note that the pre-FEED is more mature than a feasibility study. So typically, that's a client who is more specific on what they want and what they are looking for. We look at converting a pre-FEED into a FEED or a process design package probably within 6 to 12 months, that's the typical range. And then, of course, each client is special and this project, in particular, is extremely large, so timing could be different. But that's the time range we normally see on these pre-FEEDs.And also from Victoria, last one, looking at O M, so the operation and maintenance phase. As our first project moves towards delivery, how should we think about O M  Is it just replacing and studying the amine and the solvent  But what can we say about how that might relate to the overall...So the aftermarket packages that we sell definitely includes an element of replacing solvent and maintaining the solvent and also optimizing both the consumption of the solvent and the capture rate and activities at the plant. If you look at the graph, we're showing for levelized cost of carbon capture as a service in the OpEx bucket, there's a range between  15 and up. And the numbers above  15 is typically related to power or energy consumption -- that number typically don't hit our books. It's typically the client who comes with the power source for the plant. So the remaining  15 per ton is typically the addressable revenue that we can have in the aftermarket for these type of plants.There we go. Excellent. So moving on James Carmichael from Berenberg. A number of questions here. Again, looking at the phasing, when should we expect some of the studies, pre-FEEDs and so on to convert into firm contractsYes. So the first step is converting them into process design packages or FEEDs, especially if we're looking at licensing key equipment models for Big Catch. Like I said on the prior question, 6 to 12 months is probably the right range to assume. Then when you're in the FEED process design package and tender period, anywhere between 3 to 12 months again is typically the range that you should be looking at.So from a pre-FEED or study all the way until a final contract between 1 and 2 years. It really depends on the project itself. So the closer you get to the firm contract, the near where we are, and then we're typically looking at less than a year.Okay. Next one from James. Any updates on the 2 LOIs that were announced in January, and when you talked about FID in Q2.Yes. So those 2 LOIs, I think you're referring to the 2 Just Catch that we announced and that announcement was actually related to the Orsted award that we signed in the second quarter, so that one has already been confirmed. And if I do remember correctly in the press release, we also referred back to that announcement of LOI.Yes. So if you like a very first phase -- the early first half. Saudi Arabia, what's the position in this in terms of when we might expect firm announcement  And do we have any exclusivitySo first of all, it's MoU to explore this partnership. There's no exclusivity. However, we are in dialogues on various topics that are interesting and especially around the modular Just Catch 100 and Just Catch 400 solutions, it could be very interesting going forward. But it's too early to say firmly when there will be real activity in this MoU.And as you saw with the Orsted contract, we are quite persistent. When we sign an MoU, we really intend to move it forward. And with Orsted, we signed an MoU with them and Microsoft back in Q1 2021, and we realized this project in the second quarter of 2023. And if we draw that parallel to Saudi Aramco, it could take some time. It could also go faster.Great. Well, moving on.  Operator Instructions . Moving on, Vetle from SB1. Margins, one of our favorite areas. Should the overall gross profit margin be expected to stay around Q3 levels until recognition starts at minerals at .Yes. I think the simple answer is yes, of course, it depends. But if you take the Q3 numbers and normalize the way the Orsted project, our underlying margins or gross margins are in line with what we've had before. So given that we are not increasing the margins on other projects or some of these pre-FEEDs or FEEDS that we're signing starts up during that period. You should expect the same margin level until we start profit recognition of Orsted, then you should expect a decent increase for sure.So, of course, there could be more work coming in over the next quarter in terms of FEEDS and pre-FEEDs in addition to what you've seen so far that could also impact positively here.Absolutely. Okay. Good stuff. So Daniel from Clarksons is asking also around timelines for conversions or pre-FEEDS and FEEDS. We've done a little bit of that already, I think. But maybe just linking this up. In other words, when can we expect the recent wave of news that we've had in the last few weeks to become firm orders. I mean, I know it's quite a mixture in that, there's something Just Catch, some Big Catch and so on.Yes, so if we take the Just Catch first. Just Catch study or feasibility study or pre-FEED can actually convert into a firm contract within 6 to 12 months. Some of them, depending on the site and the Big Catch project will typically use 6 to 12 months to convert from pre-FEED or study or a Mobile Test Unit campaign into a FEED or process design package. And then when you're in the FEED or process design package or tender period, it's 6 to 12 more months before typically, you see a firm award.Absolutely. And moving to Elliott Jones from Nordea. Orsted profit taking -- or profit recognition rather, should, we assume this will start in Q4 or next yearYes. I think it's a bit difficult to guide specifically on exactly when it will start because here, we are talking about 5 Just Catch units across 2 sites. So normally, when you have a construction contract, you will start it all in one go when you have enough certainty in the contract. I think the timing that you're mentioning is roughly right, but we have to see the triggers come through before we can make that accounting assessment.Also given the fact that we have several sites here, might be slightly different assessments than what we saw for the Twence project, which we've already done profit recognition on earlier.And it's very much next year, not this year. Yes, absolutely.And on to the topic again about pre-FEEDs and studies, but thinking more about conversion rates. We talked about timing, but what sort of conversion rate might we assume in terms of seeing those pre-FEEDs and studies move to ordersI think so far, we've seen a very high level of conversion rate. It's just that it's been a bit slower than everyone has expected, especially related to the U.K. But the projects that we have secured, we have -- and worked on, we have converted. Some of the ones that we have worked on have not converted yet and we're still in competition for those.Over time, I would target to be able to convert, let's say, 1 3 of this into projects as long as the underlying project moves forward. And that is just the reason being that there will be competition on some. And it might be that the client decides not to move forward with some of them in the time period that we are looking at here now. It could be that they come later, like some of the projects in the U.K. where they might move into a later track in the funding process.But we have so far had a high conversion rate on the stuff that has moved forward. So we expect to stay on that for a while longer.Absolutely. Question from Sasi at Morgan Stanley. We sort of mentioned this a little bit, but he is asking again about recording profits on Orsted and I know we've discussed this. I know maybe -- I know in your prepared remarks earlier, you mentioned about some of the issues that you would look at to decide to recognize profit.So typically, we look at have we placed all the major purchase orders that can really impact the cost of the project. And on this project we have. Do those profit purchase orders have the right level of maturity so that we can be certain about that cost  Well, I think we're very close to that. Then secondly, how we place the orders for the installation work, which will happen on site. That's typically a major defining factor for these projects. Once that is done, typically, you're at the right time to start profit recognition. We expect that to be around early next year.Very clear. One question left now. So again, a quick reminder, once we finish this -- answering this last question, we will be heading off. So if you want to get the question in, please do so in the next few minutes.Question from Kate O'Sullivan at Citigroup. Again, it's about the U.K. Track-1. And we mentioned this a little bit, but maybe just go a little bit more detail. You asked about when we expect the final decision on the Track-1 expansion in the U.K. and if Keadby 3 is not in that group, what does it mean and so onI think the latter point, we would have to refer you to our customer. I mean, it's their decision in terms of how they would position that project in these various phases. But just purely as a what-if, as I mentioned before, a project that's going to be joining the Track-1 expansion process, we'll likely be able to do so from November-December this year. That will probably run until Easter, then there'll be decision processes, selection and so on, a shortlist and then with the ambition and as a famous phrase goes, there are lot of known unknowns in this, but the ambition is then to see those final negotiations stage start in the autumn next year.And then probably, if you look at the final negotiation stage from this year, which was announced in, I think it was end of Q1, then it runs for at least a year before you get down to the FID. So you have to think, well, presuming that timeline is correct, and anything the expansion -- in the Track-1 expansion group if they do move into final negotiation stage next autumn, you're looking at autumn in 2025 for the actual award. Something like that is that how we think of those stages.It's also worth bearing in mind that the Track-1 expansion process is now also aligned time-wise roughly with Track-2. And this appears to be -- again, it falls into known unknown camp. It appears to be a chosen routes by the U.K. is to have these 2 running sort of in parallel to really maximize the chance of hitting that 20 million to 30 million tonnes target by 2030 for the whole country. Any to underline at allI think that's a good summary.Okay. Just checking. And we have a couple of more coming in. One more from Vincent in Paris. Capture as a service, will capture as a service cover the fixed cost of the Just Catch  How does the CapEx part of that fit into the capture as a service modelSo the carbon capture as a service model is typically an offering where we would go and work with the client and transportation storage partners to have an offering to the end customer on a pay per tonne model that covers the full value chain range. So whatever that full value chain costs, we would charge that fee. So it will definitely cover the fixed piece, but it will also cover the operations and the transportation and storage.The nice thing about this for Aker Carbon Capture is that the better we operate these plants, the more plants we have in operation, the more of the potential improvements we're able to do on those plants in terms of capture rate and efficiency will fall to us in terms of margins on these.We're quite flexible when we work with transportation and storage partners, whether or not we offer capture as a service only for the facility itself, and they have the same type of model on the transportation and storage or whether we consolidate and do it all.Obviously, my bluff has been called in terms of putting questions in, because we're having some more coming in which is excellent.It's good. Very good.So Anders from SEB. The catching up -- we have this extra slide, you've probably seen, it's Slide 31, I think, where we talk about very theoretically how the profit recognition would work of timing and catch-up and so on. Is the catching up of margin recognition the same methodology as we've used in Twence and BrevikYes, it is the same methodology. I think there is a difference in this project, and it's that we're doing 5 of the same unit. So in this project, there is a possibility, of course, to take all the learnings that we've done from Twence and implemented in the project here. So the potential is larger, of course. And also as we deliver 5 units, there is the purchase power that we get from buying 5 off from all our vendors and also the efficiency gain by doing 5 units at the time. So those elements are new, but the profit recognition principles are the same.And the follow-on for Anders, are we able to say which quarters will you started recognizing margins on the other 2 projectsOn the other projects, if I don't recall incorrectly, we started in the fourth quarter with Twence of 2022. And we started gradually on Brevik in a different way in the second quarter of 2022, if I'm incorrect. I'll have David summarize to the others if we did incorrectly. So -- but we did also -- and please note that we did have other activities in the P L at that time. So it's not necessarily very obvious when those came in.Okay. And at the moment, the last question, but, let's see what happens when we finished answering. At the moment, the last question, again from Victoria, RBC. You talked about the U.K. quite a bit. What about the U.S.  How has this market been in the U.S. in Q3 in terms of looking at the market and progress with potential opportunitiesYes, we've got feet on the ground in the U.S. now, and we see a tremendous level of activity over there. Especially in the states that we've been focusing on mostly now during the startup, which is Texas and Louisiana. We have a huge amount of incoming inquiries. Our brand name seems to be fairly well known. We were a bit worried being European and Norwegian company will people recognize is over there, but in the carbon capture world, our name is fairly well-recognized. So we get a lot of inflow. And now we're selecting the clients that we believe will have the best chance of moving forward into developing carbon capture projects and doing studies and pre-FEEDs with them.Yes, absolutely. I think as you said, one of the key words is selectivity. I mean, something that we've learned a lot even in the last couple of years from Europe. I mean we think we turned away last year something like 7 out of 10 inquiries, politely, of course. But this selectivity -- given how much bigger the U.S. market could be -- this selectivity is so important. Otherwise, we will just spend all our time chasing loose ends.Yes.Okay. That is the last question.Thank you.So thank you very much for your time. You know where we are, so please do get in contact if you want to follow up. And we look forward to engaging with you in the next few weeks and months and at the very least, speaking to you again, I think, in February with our fourth quarter results. Well, of course, we'll have Julie, our new CFO, with us as well.Yes. Very good.Okay.Thank you all.Thank you.",168,2023-09-27T10:33:12.000-04:00
Energy Transfer: The Cash Flow Beast Everyone Should Own,"  is a  41-billion market cap firm that  across 41 US states and plays a vital role in transporting 30  of US natural gas, 35  of US crude oil, and 20  ofThe company is divided into 5 segments and has investments in subsidiaries involved in various energy-related activities. These include compression services, natural gas marketing, and resource management. They also hold interests in other companies engaged in compression services and manage coal and natural resource properties, generating revenue from royalties and land management activities. NGL fractionation, transportation, and midstream gathered volumes hit record highs of 5 , 13 , and 8  growth, respectively. Intrastate natural gas transportation rose by 3 , while interstate gas transportation saw a substantial 17  increase. Crude transportation and terminal volumes surged by 23  and 15 , respectively.The increase in volumes helped slightly offset the sharp fall YoY in the price of transported commodities in all the company's main segments. But of course, this was not enough to achieve similar financial results to the previous year.Despite total revenues falling by 29.3  YoY in Q2, ET's adjusted EBITDA amounted to  3.12 billion compared to  3.23 billion in Q2 2022, which is not that bad. Distributable cash flow  DCF  was  1.55 billion, compared to  1.88 billion in Q2 2022, with excess cash flow after distributions at  579 million.As of June 30, 2023, their credit facility had  2.36 billion available.   387 million in growth CAPEX for Q2 FY2023. ET acquired Lotus Midstream Operations and continues to integrate operations. Lake Charles LNG secured non-binding agreements for long-term LNG offtake totaling 3.6 million tonnes per annum.The company's liquidity is at a very good level, and the constant attempts to expand the volume base speak, in my opinion, to the quality of the management of the excess cash flow. Management is clearly looking to the years ahead and is not limited to the current conditions of the still ongoing bull oil   gas cycle.Long-term debt on the balance sheet decreased by 7.4  compared to the previous year, as part of the debt was transferred to short-term debt, which matures in 2024. The company's cash flow capacity seems sufficient, in my opinion, to service the debt easily  the debt burden itself is not high in relation to equity.ET projected adjusted EBITDA for FY2023 to range between  13.1 billion and  13.4 billion. That's around 15.4  to the consensus revenue figure  from ET for FY2023A quarterly cash distribution of  0.31 per common unit  1.24 annualized  was announced for Q2 2023. This puts the forward yield at  9.5 , which is well above average even among energy stocks. Many readers are probably wondering if this yield is sustainable, as the O G sector is very cyclical and unstable to all sorts of macro issues. Historically, ET's payout grew at a CAGR of   10-year period  over the long term. Today,  that ET's dividend yield will increase to 10.21  by FY2025Like many analysts at Seeking Alpha, I  for the development of the global economy in the foreseeable future - this should certainly put pressure on demand for hydrocarbons of all types. However, in the case of ET, this seems to be partially priced in, as the yield is so high even though from a historical perspective we are now roughly in the zone of normalityBecause the falls of 2015 and 2020 in the chart above had very different reasons than the ones that are likely to happen next in my view.This time, the major oil exporters appear to be aware of the medium-term risks and are positioning their production levels accordingly. This has led to one of the most oil price-supportive setups in crude oil inventories todayAt the same time, demand for certain activities has not yet recovered from COVID, such as the demand for jet fuel in ChinaIf we look at the positioning of hedge funds, the energy sector does not seem to be that crowded so far, despite its superior rise last monthIn my opinion, the energy sector has not yet lost its attractiveness for investors, as buying volumes have just started to return to the market, according to data from Ned Davis  proprietary source . The valuation of the sector as a whole is also still enticing. The energy sector accounts for 12.4  of the S P 500's gains, third only to technology and financials. However, it accounts for only 4.3  of the index's market capitalization, placing it 8th.ET itself should get an additional tailwind from the growing buying power in the sector, as the company looks like a very reliable midstream player with a good balance sheet, healthy growth ambitions, and now a very attractive dividend yield, which sell-side analysts believe is set to rise further.Again, I suggest looking at a company's valuation in a historical context, based on both TTM and FWD metrics. I usually look at EV EBITDA  in the case of oil and gas - EBITDAR . Since YCharts does not provide data on EBITDAR values, I will focus on the classic calculation formula for simplicity of visualization.So let's take a look back at 2020. Crude oil futures fell into negative territory for the first time in their history, forcing some derivatives textbooks authors to urgently add to their new editions. Energy companies faced unprecedented downtime - no one needed oil. The global economy was at a standstill, and the prevailing uncertainty led to a general panic in the stock market. As we can see in the chart below, at the height of this panic, the EV EBITDA of ET dropped to about 7x, possibly even a bit lower. After that, the drop in actual EBITDA values from ET led to a sharp increase in this metric, which is logical.Since 2021, oil and gas companies, including ET, have been on the upswing, leading to a further decline in their EV EBITDA ratios. As I wrote above, this sector is very cyclical, so it is not surprising that EV EBITDA multiples fall sharply at some point  most likely they will rise sharply again when selling volumes prices fall. if ET's volumes are growing at the moment  we saw it in Q2  and the market is waiting for a probable increase in energy prices in the foreseeable future due to the building supply  demand imbalance, why is the FWD metric even lower than the TTM metric, when the logic of things should be the other way around  If you have an answer to my question, please let me know in the comments below.I assume that even if the multiples of ET remain where they are now, income-seeking investors in the form of large funds  and not only them  should come to buy this stock because of its growth approach and shareholder return policy. The distribution yield looks quite stable even against the backdrop of the sharp decline in the share price in recent months.Even in the event of a mild recession, ET should feel relatively comfortable thanks to its margin of safety. How much further should its EV EBITDA ratio fallAnd what is the growth upside of ET's FCF yield in this caseI simply don't have answers to my last 2 questions.My current Buy rating has a number of pitfalls. First, it is not at all necessary that hydrocarbon prices continue to rise, as we have seen in recent weeks. I believe that we still have a mild recession ahead of us due to declining purchasing power and rising real interest rates. Oil prices are very elastic to changes in market demand. So if the US manufacturing activity feels more pain than I expect, the increase in volume from ET may not be enough to keep it undervalued.Be that as it may, it seems to me that ET is now an excellent long-term choice for income-seeking investors today, while not all funds have yet managed to put their capital into this cash flow beast.If the influx of new investors I expect occurs, the current valuation of ET will allow it to rise to 10 times EV EBITDA, based on historical trends. At a current enterprise value of  104 billion, ET will become  15  undervalued in this case. Amid its high dividend yield of over 9 , ET looks even more attractive.Therefore, ET stock is an undervalued  Buy , in my view.Now you can get access to the latest and highest-quality analysis of recent Wall Street buying and selling ideas with just one subscription to  There is a free trial and Join us today   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

ProPetro: The Worst Is Over But Don't Chase The Rally,"ProPetro Holding Corp.  is up more than 40  since my prior , so it's probably a good time to update my thesisWhen I covered this ticker back in May, the hydraulic fracturingHowever, fast forward 4 months and most of these stocks have recouped their YTD losses despite U.S. rig counts and frac fleets not having quite yet bottomed. Only ProFrac , which has higher financial leverage and exposure to private operators, appears to be still in the doghousePUMP's Q2 wasn't as bad and the Q3 guidance also looks a lot more favorable than what one could infer from the crashing stockWith Saudi Arabia now  its voluntary 1 million bpd cuts until the end of the year and Brent close to  90 , the setup for the frackers going into 2024 looks strong, especially as ProPetro has suffered limited utilization losses so far. However, at the same time, the stock's outrageous mispricing from March to May has been somewhat repaired and it wouldn't be a surprise if negative macro news with the Fed meeting this September prompt another correction.As of last Friday, the frac spread count was still trending downRigs, which lead frac fleets, may have yet to bottom too although last week was flatHowever, the market is forward looking, so the onshore services bull run over the last couple of months may suggest the bottom is near. ProPetro's management affirmed this view at their Q2 Other industry peers have shared similar sentiment on their Q2 calls and indicated a decent pipeline of customer inquiries for 2024.We will have to watch how things play out over the next few weeks. Rigs should bottom before frac fleets, so if rigs finally bounce, that will confirm the bottom. However, this may already have been baked into the stock price.ProPetro and some other land services providers like to talk about  bifurcation  as they are on the good side of this trend. Bifurcation here means that operators, especially the large public companies which have the most steady capex programs, have a strong preference for premium equipment  more modern, more efficient  whether we are talking about rigs or frac fleets. So the companies that own the coveted equipment will be better protected from drops in headline activity. In PUMP's wordsThere also seems to be a better sense of margin protection in the industry, even if it means idling equipment - especially among the premium providers who stand more to lose from incurring depreciation for a low day rate. According to PUMP,  price undercutting  is more common for the spot marketPricing discipline is also helped by the industry consolidation. One example of this is the recent merger between Patterson-UTI  and NEXQ2 revenue was actually up 2.8  sequentially and EBITDA down 5  only. ProPetro's utilization isn't falling as much as the headline index. Per managementProPetro sees sustained  80 oil as the next catalystThis tells me the next big move may not be until late fall when the oil narrative has hopefully finally changed. However, no one can time the market which is why I still hold some of my original position despite having taken some gains.ProPetro emphasized in its  some of the bullish factors that I have also been highlighting in my past researchGenerally, I think the bullish thesis is stronger offshore, particularly with regard to equipment shortage, but many of these points are also valid onshore albeit on a smaller scale.PUMP's valuation is still reasonable, even if not the screaming bargain it was a couple of months backRelative to other oilfield services stocks, PUMP still looks quite undervalued although majors such as SLB  or Baker Hughes  naturally attract higher multiplesInterestingly, direct competitor ACDC, which is in worse shape in a number of ways, attracts a premium valuation relative to PUMP. So a further multiple expansion for ProPetro is certainly possible.Wall Street currently sees 26  upside, which given PUMP's volatility, is probably consistent with a  holdProPetro is an onshore oilfield services provider which got beaten pretty badly earlier this spring but has now made up the lost ground and is basically flat YTD. If you caught it close to the bottom, you are almost 50  up by now.Despite having taken some gains, I maintain exposure to ProPetro  and competitors LBRT and CFW CA , but I wouldn't necessarily chase the rally right now and would rather wait for another correction to get in. It is not guaranteed such an opportunity will indeed come, but I think the rigs and frac spreads bottoming has already been priced in, so this fall the risk is probably a bit more to the downside.Editor's Note  This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

NextEra Energy: A Compelling Dividend Growth Stock For The Future,"NextEra Energy  has seen better days as its share price has declined by -19.24  in 2023. NextEra has broken through the bottom of a multiyear range, and shares are trading at the same valuation as in the summer ofMy stance on energy hasn t changed as I have continuously said that eliminating fossil fuels isn t realistic and that an evolution in the global energy mix will be the most likely outcome. Energy isn t a zero-sum game, as fossil fuels play a much greater societal role than simply providing an energy source. My position is that renewables such as solar and wind will continue to increase their position in the global energy mix, and eventually, coal will be phased out. I could be incorrect, as nobody can predict the future, but I still see this as the most likely scenario. I conducted a tremendous amount of research in the commodity markets, and while the data indicates oil and gas will still be relevant in 2050, the story for renewables is full of growth. The future of renewables is setting up well for NextEra.All the data I am going to cite comes from the publications below. If you are interested in the energy market, I suggest reading through these. From all of the actual energy companies, I personally feel that BP p.l.c  puts out the best independent research, and that is why I use their reports in addition to government publications.The 2023 BP Energy Outlook provides 3 scenarios for the adoption of renewable energy. BP sees wind and solar installed capacity increasing by roughly 9x in their new momentum. Most of the capacity comes from providing electricity for final consumption.In the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook, they are projecting that U.S. renewable energy supply will continue to increase. Within the renewable energy mix, solar and wind are expected to see significant growth.In the EIA Annual Energy Outlook to 2050, they predict that in most scenarios, the amount of energy generating capacity will more than double from the 2022 levels. More specifically, they see coal drastically declining, while solar sees the largest utilization increase and wind recognizes the 2 largest increase.I am pro-oil and gas the same way that I am pro-renewables. When I look at the energy landscape, I see it evolving over the next several decades. Based on the data, there is no scenario where renewables don t increase their position in the overall energy mix, nor is there a scenario where renewables replaces oil and gas. The projections are clear, and renewables, specifically wind and solar, have large runways for expansion over the next several decades. This is why I am interested in the renewable space, and I believe NextEra is a good play to capitalize on the growing renewable trend. is one of the largest clean energy companies in the United States and owns Florida Power   Light Company. Florida Power is America s largest electric utility, selling more power than any other utility to approximately 5.8 million accounts and serving over 12 million people across Florida. NextEra has several affiliated entities and subsidiary companies that create the world s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, a world leader in battery storage, and an emerging nuclear power leader with 7 commercial nuclear power units.When I look at , they are a cash cow. In the TTM, NextEra has generated  26.95 billion in revenue with an operating income of  9.27 billion, net income of  8.1 billion, and produced  8.23 billion in cash from operations. NextEra has a 30.53  cash yield from its revenue, and its bottom-line profit margin is 30.05 . Power companies are not typically exciting, but NextEra is generating a windfall of profits with excellent margins. This is allowing  to continue its growth trajectory, as it now has roughly 20 GW of development in its backlog of projects. Over the span of 3 months from Q1 to Q2 2023, NextEra had placed over 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations and added approximately 1,665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to its backlog.NextEra has become a larger profit center, allowing them to expand their backlog of growth projects. NextEra has projected that they will finish 2023 having generated between  2.98 -  3.13 of EPS per share. At the low end of the range, NextEra will see a  0.08 increase  2.76  YoY compared to the  2.90 of EPS generated in 2022. Sticking with the low end of the forward guidance, NextEra is projecting that they will see a  0.25  7.74  increase YoY in EPS for 2024, then EPS will grow  0.22 in 2025 and by another  0.18 in 2026. NextEra is projecting that its EPS will grow by  0.65 or 21.81  on the low end from the end of 2023- 2026. In their Q2 slide deck, NextEra stated that they will be disappointed if they aren t delivering near the top end of their projected range. The top end sees EPS growing to  4 in 2026, which is a 27.79  increase or  0.87 addition in EPS if the top end of 2023 and 2026 are achieved. The future projections from the EIA certainly support the forward growth that NextEra can achieve, and NextEra is certainly in a position to capitalize on an increasing green future.Some people may be surprised that NextEra is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased their dividend annually for 27 consecutive years. NextEra s share price continues to fall, which has increased its dividend yield to 2.76  as it pays a dividend of  1.87 per share. The payout ratio is currently 57.95 , leaving a tremendous amount of room in their remaining EPS to increase the dividend. NextEra has an impressive dividend growth profile, as its dividend has a 5-year growth rate of 11.13 . Despite the sub 3  yield, NextEra s dividend characteristics are some of the strongest I have seen in a long time.Going back to 1995, the  from reinvesting NextEra s dividend have been tremendous. By reinvesting the dividend over the last 28 years, a  10,000 investment in NextEra would have increased by 3,499.68 , as the value today would be  360,009.00. This is just shy of tripling the results of investing in the SPDR S P 500 Trust , which would have resulted in an increase of 1,136.83 . The initial investment in NextEra would have purchased 2,086.44 shares, and at the 1995 dividend rate, the forward projected income would have been  503.15. Over the years, the initial share count would have grown by 3,220.56 shares  153.62  to 5,317, while the dividend grew 683.33  to  1.87. Today, the  5,317 shares would be producing  9,492.81 in annualized dividend income, which is a 1,886.69  increase from when the initial investment occurred. Even with a low yield, NextEra s dividend has worked its magic through the benefits of compounding, and its dividend growth is projected to continue growing as NextEra s EPS increases.Utility companies aren't typically exciting as they are often used as a proxy for bonds given the amount of income generated. Investors looking for capital appreciation usually gravitate toward technology as utility companies often have limited prospects to generate organic growth. While utility companies are not top-tier growth companies, income investors like that they are typically less volatile and operate in a heavily regulated industry that provides protection for the generated income stream.I compared NextEra to several of its peers that are held within the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF  to see how shares were being valued.NextEra is trading at 21.70x 2023 earnings and looking forward it trades at 19.85x 2024 earnings and 18.35x 2025 earnings. NextEra happens to trade at the largest valuation in each forward year in its peer group which would normally be a red flag but this is a sector that normally trades at low P E levels. NextEra is expected to see 18.27  growth in its earnings from 2023 - 2025 which represents the 2nd largest amount of growth in its peer group. I am happy to pay under 20x 2024 and 2025 earnings for NextEra considering their forward EPS guidance.Profitability is where NextEra's valuation gets interesting. Given the sector, I look at things a bit differently. I am looking for the largest amount of profits with the best margins. As green energy becomes more popular and more cost-effective for the end consumer I want to be invested in utilities that are able to reinvest in their operations. NextEra is generating the largest amount of net income and cash from operations with the best margins. The peer group has an average of generating  4.68 billion in cash from operations, and  3.09 billion in net income while having a 20.61  cash yield and 13.95  profit margin. NextEra has generated  8.23 billion of cash from operations and  8.1 billion in net income over the TTM. This places its profit margin at 30.05  and the amount of cash its operations yield at 30.53 .While I would be paying slightly higher for NextEra's earnings, their profitability is the largest from the peer group. This will allow NextEra to continue investing in new projects to grow the amount of green energy they produce. I think the valuation is attractive for NextEra because their oversized profits will allow them to reinvest in their business and continue growing their bottom line. This will also help them come in at the top end of their EPS guidance which could lower their forward P E ratios and make NextEra look even less expensive.While everyone needs energy and utilities are heavily regulated investing in them does come with an appropriate level of risk. The business landscape that NextEra operates in contains a variety of risks that are outside of NextEra's control. NextEra is subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state, and other regulations. As regulation changes it could create situations where NextEra would need to address aspects of their business immediately, or even curtail operations in certain areas. NextEra is also dependent on government and local legislation for approvals on future projects and at any time changes to NEER could cancel or delay planned development activities. NextEra also operates in a market where customers have choice, and as solar systems become less expensive there could come a point where a percentage of their customers decide to purchase a solar system and go off the grid which means less revenue for NextEra. We have already seen the government provide large tax incentives to go solar and if these incentives become larger and are paired with less expensive solar options it could become more of a reality for homeowners. Just because energy is required by the end user doesn't mean that NextEra is immune to risks, and most of the risk that they face is outside of their control.Shares of NextEra are trading at their lowest valuation in several years, having recently broken through a long-term resistance level. NextEra is a premier clean energy company with a large backlog of projects that should support its future EPS projections. I am bullish on NextEra because solar and wind are expected to see the largest amount of consumption growth in the energy generation sector, and NextEra is a leader in the field. NextEra has remained a profit center, and its current margins exceed 30 . I think NextEra can benefit from the expansion into an evolving energy sector while continuing to grow its dividend and eventually go from being a Dividend Aristocrat to a Dividend King.  By the time this article is publish I may have started a position in NEE
